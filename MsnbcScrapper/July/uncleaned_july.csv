Jim Jordan’s latest crusade against ‘woke’ companies proves the GOP isn’t for free enterprise,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 4:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jim-jordan-war-woke-companies-esg-rcna164605,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio is continuing his war on private companies.  Here on the ReidOut Blog, I’ve written a fair amount about Rep. Jordan and his use of the Judiciary Committee to pressure businesses to either invest their money in conservatives or craft policies that benefit conservatives. From trying to pressure social media companies not to curtail hate speech or propaganda, to trying to pressure advertisers to spend more money on conservative media platforms, Jordan has led a right-wing crackdown on industrial independence — which is blatantly hypocritical behavior coming from the purported party of “free enterprise.”  And Jordan isn’t finished.  On Tuesday, he and Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie sent letters demanding information from more than 100 investment companies that form a coalition known as Climate Action 100+. It's a group of investment firms that work to “ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take appropriate action on climate change in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize the long-term value of assets.” Basically, they make sure that companies they’re investing in abide by a set of climate-conscious guidelines. This kind of investment — known as environmental, social and governance (or ESG) investment — is a way for corporate financiers to prioritize issues important to them as they dole out money. And Republicans have tried their damnedest to demonize it and root it out.  For example, the X account for GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee announced Jordan and Massie’s probe of the more than 100 firms by referring to their coalition as a “Woke ESG Cartel.” Jordan and Massie’s letter alleges “the Committee has uncovered evidence that financial institutions are colluding with climate activists through initiatives like Climate Action 100+ to adopt left-wing environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related goals, potentially in violation of U.S. antitrust law.” It also demands each company turn over all documents related to their membership in Climate Action 100+, and answers to questions about how each firm encourages companies to comply with their climate goals.  So Jordan’s committee is essentially putting pressure on private companies for their work to curb climate change, and using a dubious report his committee released in June, which includes the “collusion” accusations, as a pretense to justify his meddling. The letter even references organizations that may have been scared into withdrawing from the climate-conscious coalition of investment firms.  It says: To me, this sounded like thinly veiled threats of a mafioso. Essentially: “These companies knew what was good for ‘em, and and avoided our wrath.”  To be sure, some of the companies that withdrew from Climate Change Action 100+ cited other reasons for pulling out of the coalition. But the committee's actions could very well have caused a chilling effect, more broadly. However you spin it, though, what we’re seeing here is yet another example of the type of government shakedown tactics voters can expect to be completely unleashed if Donald Trump and the Republican Party wield full control of Washington after November’s election."
"Arizona election officer, shunned by GOP for saying the 2020 race wasn't stolen, loses GOP primary",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 4:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arizona-maricopa-county-stephen-richer-gop-primary-2020-election-rcna164552,"A Republican election official in Maricopa County, Arizona, who forcefully defended the integrity of elections in the county and as a result was shunned by some in his own party, lost his primary race on Tuesday. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer lost the GOP primary to Justin Heap, a state representative who has cast doubt on election operations in Maricopa County but has not outright said that the 2020 election was stolen. Heap is backed by the state’s far-right Freedom Caucus, and he was endorsed by Kari Lake, an election denier who on Tuesday won the Republican primary for U.S. Senate. Heap will face Democrat Tim Stringham in November. Election officials in Maricopa County, many of whom bore the brunt of baseless accusations from Donald Trump and his allies that the 2020 election was stolen, have worked to make the election process more efficient and transparent to the public. Although Richer had not been involved in running the 2020 election and assumed office only after the right began its campaign of election conspiracy theories, he faced fierce backlash for rebutting claims that the election was stolen, including death threats and calls for his lynching from Maricopa County Republican Committee Chair Shelby Busch. (Several former Trump aides have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in the plot to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona.) Richer was also accused of election tampering in 2022 after some Republicans, egged on by Trump, amplified false claims of irregularities in the midterm elections. At the time, Lake blamed Richer and another county election official for her loss in the Arizona gubernatorial race. Richer sued Lake for defamation in June 2023. Lake has declined to defend herself against Richer's claims, and she asked a judge to determine the damages she owes him. In a post on X conceding the primary on Wednesday morning, Richer congratulated Heap on his win. ""Elections have winners and, sadly, losers,"" he wrote. ""And in this one, it looks like I’m going to end up on the losing side of the column."" Before he leaves office, Richer will administer the critically important elections in November, including the presidential race, in Maricopa County."

Trump's NABJ appearance was the train wreck many expected,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 2:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/nabj-trump-interview-panel-chicago-rcna164300,"Just as expected, former President Donald Trump’s appearance Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention came with a bevy of bigotry and lies.  His appearance — which took the form of a panel discussion with three NABJ members moderating — had cast a pall over the convention itself before Trump even showed up, to be honest. The organization faced a deluge of denunciations from journalists and activists after it announced it would give a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the free press, spread racist propaganda and repeatedly insulted Black journalists. In fact, NABJ has issued several statements in recent years denouncing Trump’s illiberal behavior and attacks on its members. NABJ announced ahead of the panel that no one in the audience full of journalists would be permitted to ask questions. And the composition of the panel — particularly, its inclusion of Fox News host Harris Faulkner, who has given Trump chummy interviews on a network that has helped spread Trump’s lies and paid a historic legal settlement for doing so — fueled suspicion that NABJ was giving the GOP nominee a relatively friendly platform to lie and peddle propaganda.  Before the event even started, Trump claimed on Truth Social that Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, “refused” to speak at the convention as he did. In reality, as news outlets and NABJ leadership confirmed, a scheduling conflict prevented Harris from attending in person. And it was NABJ leadership who refused to allow her to hold a virtual conversation with journalists at the convention. (NABJ said Wednesday that it is ""in talks"" to hold a Q&A ""virtually or in person in September."") When it came to the event itself, what many people predicted would be a train wreck lived up to those expectations. Though NABJ leadership assured critics that Trump would be fact-checked live on social media, the PolitiFact feed tasked with doing so didn’t catch all of his lies, and the panelists didn’t catch all of them in real time, either.  Trump began his appearance with a petulant attack on a moderator, ABC senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, who asked about his history of racist rhetoric.  “I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,"" Trump responded. ""You don’t even say, 'Hello, how are you?' Are you with ABC, because I think they’re a fake news network — a terrible network. And I think it’s disgraceful."" He went on to claim he has “done so much” for Black people. Predictably, he had glowing things to say about Faulkner, whom he described as a “fantastic person.”  Then came the litany of lies. Trump lied and said Harris “happened to turn Black” a number of years ago after decades of identifying only with her Indian heritage. Harris, of course, is an HBCU-educated Black woman who has known she was Black since she was a child, but Trump’s claims align with right-wing disinformation claiming Harris isn’t truly Black — despite her father’s being a Black Jamaican. He lied — as he did during the presidential debate last month and several times since — about an “invasion” of immigrants from jails and mental institutions taking “Black jobs.” (NABJ honors journalists from outside the U.S., too. One wonders how some of them felt about that claim.) He lied about Democrats’ stance on abortion, falsely claiming the party is in favor of being able to ""execute"" babies. He lied about the criminal cases against him, claiming they exist only because he's a ""political opponent of two people that have weaponized our justice system.” He lied and claimed those convicted for their actions at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, show there are “two systems of justice.” And when he wasn’t outright lying, he was doubling down on disturbing policies. For example, he was asked about his support for immunizing police from prosecution, in response to the recent police killing of Sonya Massey. Trump said the incident ""didn't look good to me"" yet still didn’t back off of his previous calls to protect police from legal accountability for abuse.  He said during the NABJ panel: This car crash of an event was forecast by NABJ members. It sowed distrust and animus among members toward NABJ leadership. It sparked a protest outside the event, an NABJ convention co-chair’s stepping down from her role and multiple speakers’ backing out of their planned discussions.  It also highlighted some of the broader internal debates that have raged within the organization. As the Columbia Journalism Review wrote in 2018, NABJ has faced divisions over shifting paradigms in journalism, pitting some older members and other traditionalists against younger journalists “attuned to the fast pace of new media.” That rift was at play ahead of this event, with some supporters of the panel arguing NABJ's tradition of inviting presidential candidates justified inviting Trump this year and critics of the panel arguing Trump’s tendency to lie with abandon — and the fact most of his illiberal views have been broadcast for nearly a decade now — warranted a departure from the norm.  I’m with the latter group. It’s fair for NABJ leadership to have suggested there are lingering questions about what a second Trump term might look like, but the group never adequately explained why Trump — a serial liar who has targeted its members — was best suited to answer them, let alone given the opportunity to do so without better guardrails in place."
What Olympics star Ilona Maher doesn’t have to explain to you about her body,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 2:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/paris-olympics-womens-ruby-ilona-maher-tiktok-bmi-rcna164574,"Ilona Maher is having herself a time at the Paris Olympics. The 27-year-old rugby player just captured a bronze medal after Team USA’s improbable win in the finals seconds of Tuesday night’s match against Australia — the first medal ever for American women’s rugby sevens. But even before the win, Maher had become a burgeoning social media sensation. Footage of her stiff-arming opponents has drawn comparisons to Baltimore Ravens star Derrick Henry, and her impressive TikTok account has gone viral with videos highlighting an endearingly quirky and honest personality. A consistent theme in Maher’s social media posts is her advocacy for body positivity, which is touted on her official Team USA profile. Last week, she posted a reel on Instagram stating that “all body types can be Olympians.”  “As the Olympics officially start today, I want you all to take a look at all the different body types on display,” she said. “All body types matter, all body types are worthy, from the smallest gymnast to the tallest volleyball player, from a rugby player to a shot-putter to a sprinter. All body types are beautiful and can do amazing things, so truly see yourself in these athletes and know that you can do it, too.” The reaction to Maher’s posts has been overwhelmingly positive, but she’s unsurprisingly had to deal with a few trolls commenting on her weight and Body Mass Index (BMI). One person in particular wrote, “I bet that person has a 30 percent BMI,” prompting Maher to respond directly with a candid message about her body. “I think you were trying to roast me, but this actually is a fact. I do have a BMI of 30 — well, 29.3 to be more exact,” she shared on TikTok. Maher noted that misperceptions about weight and athleticism are nothing new; in middle school, she received a physical that labeled her overweight. Today, Maher is one of the best women’s rugby players in the world. The notion that her body is in anything but optimal shape is absurd. BMI is also a famously flawed and inaccurate measure of health, a fact that rings even truer for athletes. This simple calculation uses weight and height to measure body fat, but doesn’t account for important factors like bone density and muscle mass. As a world-class professional, Maher has access to dietitians and medical experts, whom she says have told her it’s not a particularly useful measurement for athletes. In her TikTok post, Maher reiterates that she’s 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds — 170 of which is lean muscle. That gives her a body fat percentage of 15% — well below the 25-31% range considered healthy for average women who aren’t athletes. Maher certainly doesn’t need me, or anyone else, to defend her body to random people on the internet (who, as she points out, did not just win a bronze medal in the Olympics). But if anything, the Games offer a rare opportunity to witness and celebrate a truly diverse range of body types, particularly among women. Gymnasts are not built the same as rugby players; weightlifters look dramatically different than swimmers. Multiple Olympians across the various sports have talked about body image and how harmful the narrow view of what constitutes healthy bodies can be, especially for young girls.  Much of this conversation in recent years has centered around notions of what “feminine” bodies are supposed to look like; some female athletes have admitted that they avoid building muscle because they believe that looking overly bulky hurts their marketability.  But it should be noted that these conversations are by no means limited to women in sports. For years, ESPN the Magazine’s “The Body Issue” celebrated diversity in body types for men and women athletes alike. When Texas Rangers first baseman Prince Fielder appeared on the cover in 2014, his husky build stood in sharp contrast to other players who would be considered more traditionally fit. But Fielder deserved to be on that cover: A six-time All-Star, he was among the game’s most feared power hitters in his prime. Thankfully, notions of what a healthy body looks like are changing, even as Maher’s comment section proves they certainly still exist. Events like the Olympics are the perfect time to call out and celebrate the athletes and body types that we don’t often get to see on an international stage. For her part, Maher just used her “big, broad, beautiful shoulders” to stiff-arm her way to the Olympic podium."

Haniyeh, 62, was assassinated in Tehran after he attended the inauguration ceremony for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Hamas said.” * On a related note: “Israel warned that no Hamas leader was safe, but the assassination of the militant group’s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Iran’s capital has sent shockwaves across a region hardened by war and conflict.

Trump judge in Texas border case goes too far for far-right court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/texas-border-rio-grande-james-ho-rcna164543,"As surprising as it sounds, the Supreme Court isn’t the most right-wing court in the country. That label better applies to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has gone too far in some cases that have led to Supreme Court smackdowns. So it doubly stands out when a 5th Circuit judge goes further than his colleagues.  That just happened in a dispute between Texas and the United States over the state’s installation of a floating barrier in the Rio Grande. By way of background, the federal government sued Texas over the move, arguing that the state had violated the law by obstructing the “navigable” capacity of the Rio Grande without congressional authorization and building the barrier without approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Ahead of a trial on the matter, the full Circuit Court sided with the state on Tuesday, reversing a trial court injunction that said the state had to move it. So the barrier remains for now. In an opinion by Donald Trump appointee Don Willett, the circuit majority decided that the trial court “clearly erred in finding that the United States will likely prove that the barrier is in a navigable stretch of the Rio Grande.”  Though the circuit sided with Texas, Willett’s ruling didn’t need to address the state’s far-reaching claim that it is permitted to erect the barrier in defense of a border “invasion.” The Constitution says that “No State shall, without the Consent of Congress . . .  engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.” And here’s where we get to the circuit judge who went further than his colleagues: James Ho, also a Trump appointee. The former Clarence Thomas clerk deemed it necessary to address the invasion question and he agreed with Texas, writing that the case “presents a strategic military decision directed toward a foreign enemy within the State’s authority” and that because the state’s claim presents a “political question” that courts can’t review, the case should be dismissed.   Ho’s opinion has been criticized from the right and the left. One of his Trump-appointed colleagues, Judge Andrew Oldham (who clerked for Justice Samuel Alito), wrote separately to explain why the court didn’t need to reach the invasion issue. Oldham noted that it’s “well settled that we should not reach constitutional questions if we can instead decide the case on a non-constitutional ground.” A dissenting opinion from Biden-appointed Judge Dana Douglas further pointed out that Texas’ position “would enable Governor Abbott to engage in acts of war in perpetuity.”  Ho is known for taking outlandish positions, so his opinion isn’t entirely surprising, however extreme its implications. But it’s worth considering because he has been floated as a possible Supreme Court nominee should Trump return to office in November — a scenario that could make the high court more like the 5th Circuit.

Kamala Harris practically dares Trump to debate her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 12:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-debate-september-rcna164521,"Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, once again challenged Donald Trump to debate her, telling a roaring crowd in Atlanta on Tuesday night that he was feeling the pressure of running against her in November. ""So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it — you may have noticed,"" the vice president said at a campaign rally, as she pointed to Trump's refusal to commit to a debate in September. “He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.” “Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” Harris said. “Because as the saying goes, 'if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.'” Harris' remarks seem designed to taunt Trump into debating her. The vice president has been engaged in a back-and-forth with the Trump campaign as it dithers the GOP nominee's participation in a previously agreed-upon Sept. 10 debate, which it arranged with Joe Biden's re-election campaign before he withdrew from the race. On Thursday, Harris accused the Trump campaign of “backpedaling” on the scheduled debate, saying, “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.” Trump's campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, later said it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.” The calculations for the Trump campaign have shifted dramatically since Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. Trump had previously challenged Biden to debate “anytime, anywhere, any place,” and the fallout of Biden’s disastrous showing at the June 27 debate also overshadowed his own blathering performance. Now, as his campaign tries to reorient its strategy for Harris, Trump, whose debate style is rich on insults and poor on substance, now faces the daunting prospect of taking on a former prosecutor known for her debate punches on live television. In an interview with Fox News this week, Trump himself waffled on the subject. He suggested there was no point debating Harris because “everybody knows who I am, and now people know who she is.” He then said he would “probably” debate Harris, but added that he “can also make a case for not doing it.”"
Harris' historic campaign builds on breakthroughs by other Black women,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 12:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-historic-moseley-braun-2024-rcna164343,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""The Beat."" It was a whirlwind first week for Vice President Kamala Harris’ historic presidential campaign. The Guardian described her candidacy as a generational shift in U.S. politics.  Harris, of course, is no stranger to breaking barriers — she’s serving as the first woman vice president in our country’s history — but she's drawn from a range of trailblazers who laid the groundwork for this moment.  Geraldine Ferraro, a Democrat, became the first female vice presidential candidate on a major U.S. party ticket in 1984. There's also former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican Party's first female candidate for vice president. In 2016, Hillary Clinton shattered the glass ceiling when she won the Democratic presidential nomination. Shirley Chisholm was both the first Black woman elected to Congress and the first to run for president. Chisholm pushed her party, which has since come to rely heavily on Black voters, to take Black leadership seriously. Before ascending to the highest echelon of the Democratic Party, Harris was the only Black woman in the Senate. There was only one Black female senator who served before her. That senator was Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, sworn into the Senate in 1993. Moseley Braun, who ran on a platform of women’s and civil rights, immediately challenged the status quo in Washington. In her first year in office, she defiantly took to the Senate floor to protest the renewal of a congressional patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, whose insignia featured the Confederate flag. “I’ve got to tell you, this vote is about race. It is about racial symbolism. … It is about our racial past and the single most painful episode in American history,” Moseley Braun told her colleagues.  Moseley Braun also challenged sexism in the Senate. She was among the first to buck the unofficial ban on women wearing pants on the Senate floor. Moseley Braun wore them repeatedly until the rule was changed. The feminist publication Ms. described that action as a “rebellion” and “a seismographic event.” On Monday’s episode of “The Beat,” I spoke with the former senator about Harris’ historic candidacy. Moseley Braun told me she was “over the moon” and “strongly supporting” the vice president. She also pledged to do everything in her power to help Harris make history yet again: “We have 98 more days to the election itself. We all have to show up and be there for her, take advantage and not let this enthusiasm dwindle. People have short memories sometimes. But if we can keep the drumbeat going, we can have our first woman president.”  Join Ari Melber, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

Time to update the talking points: Border conditions keep improving,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 11:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-conditions-improving-trump-republicans-election-2024-mexico-rcna164538,"During Donald Trump’s Republican National Convention speech — which, believe it or not, was delivered less than two weeks ago — the former president spent a fair amount of time talking about conditions at the U.S./Mexico border. The GOP nominee, however, did not appear to have any idea what he was talking about. “We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and it’s taking place right now,” Trump said, adding, “The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. ... They’re coming at levels that we’ve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them.” The comments were well received by his partisan followers, which wasn’t surprising: Republican voters have heard this message so many times that they assume it’s true, though reality tells a different story. In fact, as a CNN fact-check piece noted soon after, “Trump’s claim that the Biden administration is doing ‘nothing’ is incorrect. Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration.”  CBS News recently ran a related report, noting that the number of migrants unlawfully crossing the U.S. southern border “continued to drop markedly in July.” The same CBS report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that illegal border crossings were already falling earlier this year, but after the Biden/Harris administration implemented changes, crossings “plunged further ... reaching a three-year low in June.” To help drive the point home, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut added via social media that border crossings are now even lower “than in Trump’s last non-pandemic summer.” A New York Times report also noted last week that while the rhetoric from Trump and his party remains the same, “the reality on the ground has recently changed.” To be sure, conditions might yet change again, and there are a variety of factors that have contributed to the improved numbers. The bottom line, however, remains the same: To believe that “the greatest invasion in history” is underway at the U.S./Mexico border is to believe stale and discredited nonsense."
Justice Alito’s extreme approach reportedly cost him court majorities,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/alito-social-media-supreme-court-jackson-barrett-rcna164461,"Ever wonder how certain Supreme Court justices wind up writing the majority opinions in cases? After oral arguments, the justices discuss them and, if the chief justice is in the majority, he can assign the opinion to another justice or write it himself — as Chief Justice John Roberts did in the Donald Trump immunity case, for example. If the chief is in the minority, then it’s up to the senior justice in the majority. Against that backdrop, consider a new report that Justice Samuel Alito was assigned two cases this past term but couldn’t keep majorities together. That’s not unprecedented but, like Roberts’ reportedly aggressive handling of the immunity appeal, it can shed light on the opaque court as we review this past term and look toward the future. That new report from CNN, which hasn’t been confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC, states that Alito was assigned to write the opinion in a big social media case over red-state laws seeking to restrict platforms’ content moderation. CNN reported that Alito (who reportedly declined the outlet’s interview requests) “went too far for two justices — Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson — who abandoned the precarious 5-4 majority and left Alito on the losing side. As a result, the final 6-3 ruling led by Justice Elena Kagan backed the First Amendment rights of social media companies.” Alito also reportedly lost the majority in a case about retaliation for criticizing government officials, which resulted in an unsigned opinion from the court. The justice’s unyielding views are well known, whether in his public statements, rulings or related refusal to recuse from cases. So it’s not difficult to believe he couldn’t keep a majority in a given case. And to be sure, while every case is important, he has led Republican-appointed majorities in big right-wing cases with wider impact, most notably his Dobbs opinion overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022. In some respects, then, the report is as illuminating when it comes to other justices like Barrett and Jackson, who have gone their own ways in various cases. Among other examples this past term, Barrett didn’t fully join Roberts’ immunity ruling in Trump v. United States, while Jackson joined his 6-3 majority opinion narrowing obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants and Barrett wrote the dissent in that case, Fischer v. United States, joined by Jackson’s two fellow Democratic appointees. So their votes — especially Barrett’s, holding more power in the relative middle of the court — are worth watching, even if they don’t move the needle in the biggest cases on the Republican supermajority court, which can afford a defector here and there while still achieving goals that align with the Republican Party (as in Dobbs, where Roberts didn’t agree to overturn Roe but five other GOP appointees, including Barrett, did). Turning back to Alito, the report also reveals that the aggrieved justice “has reflected in private about retirement.” Presumably, he wouldn’t do so voluntarily under a Democratic administration. The 74-year-old is the second oldest sitting justice after 76-year-old Clarence Thomas. This reinforces the reality that November’s election has potentially dramatic stakes for the court’s future.

Why it matters that Mark Kelly is slamming Trump for killing a border deal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mark-kelly-slamming-trump-killing-border-deal-election-2024-republican-rcna164519,"The current Congress has been dreadful for a great many reasons, but arguably the lowest of the low points was the fight over a bipartisan agreement on border policies. Months later, it’s something Democrats are eager to discuss anew. In case anyone needs a refresher, it was last fall when congressional Republicans said they were so desperate to deal with U.S./Mexico border policies that they took a radical step: GOP officials said that unless Democrats agreed to a series of conservative reforms, Republicans were prepared to cut off military aid to Ukraine and let Russia take part of Eastern Europe by force. Democrats, left with little choice, agreed to pay the GOP’s ransom and endorsed a conservative, bipartisan compromise. At that point, Republicans killed the compromise plan they’d demanded — largely because Donald Trump told them to. Making matters worse, the calculus was electoral, not substantive: The former president didn’t want Congress to hand President Joe Biden an election-year victory on one of the party’s top priorities. Republicans followed Trump’s lead and concluded that they’d rather have a campaign issue than a solution. As NBC News reported, some leading Democrats believe it’s time to refresh voters’ memories about what happened and why. “This was not meeting the Republicans on the 50-yard line, this was meeting them on the 10-yard line,” the Arizona Democrat said during an appearance on MSNBC. “On their side of the field, we realized, we’ve got to get operational control over the border. I realized this, Kamala Harris realizes this, and this legislation was going to do that,” he added. “And our goal here was to get this legislation passed and then start working on comprehensive immigration reform. But this was stopped dead in its tracks by Donald Trump because he wanted to have this as an election issue. Like a lot of other Republicans, they don’t actually want to solve this problem.” To be sure, it’s not a secret that Kelly is being considered for his party’s vice presidential nomination, and his comments Wednesday morning served as a timely reminder about his focus on a key issue in the national campaign. But whether Kelly makes Harris’ 2024 ticket or not, the point he emphasized this morning deserves to be at the center of the public conversation: Every time Trump and Republicans refer to conditions at the border, they should be reminded of the fact that they, at the former president’s behest, rejected a conservative border reform package — twice — that they co-authored and requested. What’s more, it’s not just Democrats who’ve accused the GOP of killing the bill at Trump’s insistence. The Harris campaign just released a new video via social media highlighting a variety of instances in which Republicans have conceded that the Democratic claim is true. The video didn’t include Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but the Kentucky Republican said largely the same thing in April. Kelly helped put all of this in the spotlight Wednesday morning, and no one should be surprised when other Democrats do the same thing every time Trump brings up the border between now and Election Day 2024."

Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hello and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday morning, July 30th. Oh, I can’t believe it, July 30th. It’s like, for those of us who teach, it’s only one month left for the summer. So, I’m Andrew Weissman and I’m here with Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. For those of us who teach and have a normal -- Andrew Weissmann: A day job. Mary McCord: -- 365-day-a-week job, it sort of just feels like another day. But you’re right, we actually start teaching also within a month, and it seems like we’ve barely even finished. So, that’s just the way. Of course, you know, my life since age 50 has been on fast forward. I don’t know about you, but. Andrew Weissmann: So, speaking of that, welcome back from Highlands, where we did our live show, it was really nice to see you. Like, it’s so funny, I always feel like I’m seeing you, but it’s really different when we’re actually in the same room. Mary McCord: It’s right. Days and days, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So, what’s on our dance card? Mary McCord: Right. I think, for listeners, we are continuing to see the fallout from the Trump immunity decision of the Supreme Court. We talked last week about the motion before Judge Merchan in Manhattan, brought by Alvin Bragg. We now, of course, have Alvin Bragg’s response to that, which we’ll talk a little bit about today. But really, the other big thing that got filed, it got filed on Friday, was Mark Meadows. Yeah, blast from the past now, indicted in Georgia along with 17 others as part of that RICO conspiracy case, has now petitioned for review in the Supreme Court, for review of the 11th Circuit’s denial of his motion to remove his case to federal court. Remember, this is a Georgia state case that he sought to have in federal court. And what we’ll talk about is how this is really just more and more of the fallout from the immunity decision. I mean, sure, he had that removal motion way before the immunity decision, but he’s now using the immunity decision as part of his petition. So, we’ll talk about that and then just get to a few things on our radar because there’s some things that are going to be coming up, schedules, things that we’re looking to in the next weeks and months. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, there’s some big things coming up, not just sort of 11th Circuit briefing and sort of our legal appellate side, but there’s the case going back to Judge Chutkan. So, that’s going to be a really interesting thing to talk about and sort of what we’re looking for. One quick note is this is a pat ourselves on the back moment. We don’t really do that, I have to say, which is kind of nice. Mary McCord: No, never. Andrew Weissmann: Never. Mary McCord: Sometimes we’re wrong and we just ignore that and we just move on. Andrew Weissmann: Although the immunity decision, I think we were pretty good about. Mary McCord: Yeah. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: What’s the phrase? We blew it? Mary McCord: Yeah, well, yeah. That’s still PTSD, so. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Okay, I’m triggering you already. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So, patting ourselves on the back, this podcast won and our whole team won another award and it’s Adweek’s award for best political podcast of 2024. And it’s so funny because you and I think probably don’t even think of this podcast as political. We really think of it as legal. Mary McCord: In fact, we tried pretty hard to make it legal and not political. Andrew Weissmann: I know. It’s like when we’re both on air, we’re really good about trying to studiously avoid sort of political commentary. But in any event, that’s a long way of saying thank you, listeners. Thank you, Adweek. It’s very flattering. And I know, Mary, I speak for you, which is if you’d said to us when we were left the government that we were going to be doing an award-winning podcast. Mary McCord: We would have laughed. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. It would have been something along the lines of, I’m not sure what you’re on, but I’d like some of that. Mary McCord: Right. I will say the description that Adweek had of the podcast doesn’t sound political at all. Andrew Weissmann: It’s true. Mary McCord: It sounds like what you do is you tune in to hear the deeper dive legal analysis of the case -- Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: -- which is why we’re here. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: It was a really nice, thoughtful description. Have we finished? Is it enough? Patting ourselves on the back. Mary McCord: Yes. My back is so padded that it’s getting sore. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. My shoulder is a little wrenched out from doing the patting. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So let’s turn to our first topic, which last week we talked about that there was briefing. This is a very live issue, which is the briefing in the New York criminal case where there is a jury conviction on the 34 felony counts. But there is briefing about the effect of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision because the Supreme Court, just to remind people, had said even in a case involving personal conduct where the crimes are personal, there’s an issue about what can be heard with respect to official acts by the president and can that evidence be introduced. And if you recall, the Supreme Court by a decision of five to four on this issue said that there are restrictions. It’s not absolute, but there are restrictions. And we sort of surmised what we expected. And that brief has now come in. Alvin Bragg has now submitted his very lengthy brief setting out the various reasons why the sentencing should go forward and why there’s nothing in the Supreme Court’s decision that should result in the convictions being set aside and there needing to be a retrial of the case. That would be the remedy if the trial judge were to agree with Donald Trump. Mary McCord: Well, except for one little caveat there, which is that, you know, again, in this swing for the fences motion that Donald Trump brought, he actually made a final argument that there couldn’t even be such a thing as a retrial because the grand jury would have considered official acts evidence and so essentially the entire indictment was tainted by that and should be thrown out. I mean, that’s a reach. Let’s just say that’s an extended reach. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: And I don’t think, you know, our greatest, tallest basketball player could reach that high. But nevertheless, he is trying -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes, right. Mary McCord: -- to get rid of the whole thing once and for all. Andrew Weissmann: Good point. Mary McCord: As we predicted, though, the district attorney comes in in his response to the motion saying, although the Supreme Court restricted the consideration of certain evidence of official conduct for which the president is immune, that ancillary holding, remember, ancillary to the primary holding, which is that a president cannot be prosecuted for official acts, that ancillary holding about evidence, the D.A. says is inapplicable here. And he says for several reasons. One is that the defendant failed to preserve an objection on immunity grounds to most of that evidence. And in fact, the D.A. goes back in history and gives the entire sort of recitation of the proceedings in this case, including the former president’s attempt to remove the case to federal court in part on immunity grounds, the federal district court judge denying that motion, sending it back to state court. This is a little bit of foreshadowing of what we’re going to talk about with Georgia, sending it back to state court. Trump’s team taking an appeal of that, but then deciding to abandon that appeal. So one issue here is you could have pushed this immunity issue and you decided not to, says the district attorney in his opposition. Andrew Weissmann: Can I just interrupt for a second just to make sure everyone understands? So this is like saying whatever the merits are of the claim. I started in Trump, but we’re about to get to that. Mary McCord: That’s okay. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But this is an issue of essentially, you’ve waived it. It’s like in order to make a claim now post-trial, the courts want to see that you’ve actually made the claim before and given the trial court an opportunity or there has to be a very good reason as to why you didn’t make the claim. And so as to most of these, the claims that Donald Trump made, the D.A. says it’s waived. In other words, you had the opportunity and you did not raise this. In fact, you abandoned it. That’s your point about when they went to federal court -- Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: -- they actually started to assert presidential immunity and then decided not to. And so the first argument is basically you did not make this claim below. You had an opportunity and now you shouldn’t be heard on that issue. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And then they go on to the issue of the merits. And that’s where I interrupted you. Mary McCord: Well, no, actually, there’s another one of those sorts of failure to preserve issues that one is you abandoned it and waived it in your federal court proceedings. But secondly, even in these state court proceedings, you failed to object to all the things that you now say should not have come into evidence. And again, part of this is about generally speaking in any trial, but in criminal trials, if you do not object to things before trial or during trial and give the judge the opportunity to rule on them, then your ability to bring those issues on appeal is restricted. And the way that it’s reviewed on appeal is different than if you had preserved the err. It’s not that you cannot get any review for most errs, but it’s something we call plain error review. If we really want to geek out, we can talk about the two different types of review. And so it’s harder to get a win or a reversal on something you did not object to earlier because the whole idea is, look, you can’t pull a gotcha at defendants. You can’t sit there; hope you’re going to win and get a jury to rule your way. And when you don’t bring up a whole bunch of things on appeal that you never gave the trial court judge the ability to rule on. It’s one of the just bedrock principles of defense in trying a case as you’ve got to bring up issues and let the trial court rule on them. Andrew Weissmann: And in next year’s course, we’ll cover plain error and clear error and the difference between waiver and forfeiture of a claim. Mary McCord: Forfeiture, yes. Andrew Weissmann: So that’ll be in next year’s -- Mary McCord: That’s true. Andrew Weissmann: -- criminal procedure class. Mary McCord: Yeah. That’s the 200-level class. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, okay. Mary McCord: Maybe the 300 level. And so the two things that he did object to, right, as Alvin Bragg says, the only two things that you objected to was Hope Hick’s testimony just with respect to her testimony about statements that Mr. Trump made when he was president and the admission of the Office of Government Ethics Form 278E, which is one of those forms that is about your financial statement form that’s required of all federal officials. Alvin Bragg says those are the only two things you preserved. Everything else you failed to object to. Andrew Weissmann: So on page 13, I thought that the D.A. gave a very good summary of the three ways in which the D.A. says that the remaining claims do not work. And I just thought it was a very easy to understand way of understanding what they’re saying about Donald Trump’s claims. The first is they say the evidence that Donald Trump complains about is unofficial conduct. It’s personal conduct. So you don’t even have to deal with the issue of how to deal with official conduct because they say it’s unofficial. This is personal stuff. The second argument is that even if it is considered official conduct, the presumption of immunity has been rebutted. And they say because reliance on such evidence in a criminal prosecution poses no risk of interference with presidential decision making, unquote. That’s argument two. And the third, which is one that, Mary, I remember you talking about just last week, which we were talking about tweets and the public forum that you just talked about. The third argument is, quote, “The evidence consists of a public record of an official act,” unquote. So those are sort of the three ways in which they say that they should win. Even if you disregarded the waiver -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- arguments or narrowed just to the two things you pointed to. But even if you ignored all that, these are the three arguments and they go through that, applying it to all of the different things that Donald Trump says came into the trial. And I just thought that was such a clean, easy way to separate this out. I thought it was a really good brief. I don’t know what you thought. Mary McCord: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was strong and I thought that, again, you know, what they needed to do is show Judge Merchan on each one of these categories of evidence that Donald Trump says should not have come in, make the argument not official, otherwise rebutted, otherwise a public record. And then they go on and show how each alleged error was harmless, including even harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. And so, you know, we don’t have time to go through because its very detail oriented in terms of going through each allegation of official acts and explaining why that wasn’t an official act at all. So, for example, Michael Cohen’s testimony before Congress about what he did in his capacity as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer to, you know, make this personal payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money to keep her story from coming out before election, how that was all personal and couldn’t be an official act. And you remember, this is something that Mr. Trump’s attorneys have argued in their motion that Cohen’s testimony about this in front of Congress was actually something that implicated Trump’s official acts. Andrew Weissmann: So the thing that you referred to about harmless error is sort of their final argument, which is that -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- even if you found against us on everything we just talked about, all three of those points and waiver, then we’re going to talk about sort of, is it harmless error? And that’s where Donald Trump made the argument that it’s both not harmless and also something called structural error. In other words, that harmless error analysis doesn’t even apply. And I think, Mary, again, you -- Mary McCord: Talked about this last week, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And a good example that you gave last week of what’s called structural error is you don’t have a lawyer in a criminal case. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And your example was Gideon v. Wainwright, which said that the right to counsel applies to the states, not just federally, but it’s sort of broadly applicable. That’s a structural error, meaning you don’t engage in harmless error analysis. You’re entitled to a lawyer. If there’s no lawyer, it doesn’t matter how -- Mary McCord: You can’t fix that. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And it doesn’t matter how otherwise fair it is. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s sort of per se unfair. Structural error is very unusual to apply to something having to do with evidence coming in. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And so even for this Supreme Court, I mean, I think the immunity decision is horrendous and is result oriented, it’s hard to make predictions just because I never would have thought the Supreme Court came out this way. But it’s so hard to see this as structural error. Mary McCord: Oh, agree. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, allowing Hope Hicks, for instance, to testify about one conversation in 2018, the one -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that we’ve talked about as being potentially the most problematic, that just isn’t structural error. Mary McCord: No. Andrew Weissmann: And it’s going to have a harmless error analysis. Mary McCord: Yeah, I’m not worried that any higher court’s really going to compare this to structural error, but you know, they may go through a harmless error analysis as to some of these things. And so what the DA does is he goes elaborately through, you know, the proof of every element of the charged crimes and why even if you keep out the challenged evidence, not just significant, and he says really overwhelming evidence to prove each element of the crimes that were charged and for which the jury returned verdicts. I will say one thing, and you probably noted this too. We’ve talked about this in the past, and I know that Mr. Trump’s team made a big deal about this in their brief, which is that the way that the prosecutors referred to Hope Hicks’ testimony in their summation, in their closing arguments, as, quote, unquote, “devastating.” And of course, Mr. Trump tried to use that to say, this almost say this can’t be harmless, because the prosecutors themselves said it was devastating. And that is dealt with in just a footnote in this brief, basically making what I think is the legally correct argument, that a prosecutor in argument making arguments to the jury about the evidence that really has not that much bearing on whether an error can be harmless or not. Because just because something might be devastating, they explained, doesn’t mean it’s not cumulative of other evidence that already supports the charges. And that’s their whole argument here, right? There’s ample, more than ample evidence to support the charges and there’s no reason to believe that this, the omission of Hope Hicks’ testimony or anything else challenged, made the difference for the jury. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Also, there are two parts to Hope Hicks’ testimony in 2018. And one part seems much less problematic than the other. And so saying that cumulatively, that there’s taking her testimony as a whole, it’s devastating, isn’t saying that the particularly most problematic part is devastating. So I think that the key here, just for to keep everyone so has this on their dance card, September 6, the judge has said he is going to issue his decision. It’s an unusual thing for a judge to announce when he will rule, but here he has. He said that he intends to rule on September 6. And so I suspect that he is going to deny Donald Trump’s motion. It is conceivable he would have a hearing. And then if there is a sentencing required, it is on first September 18. So keep that those dates in mind. Mary, let’s take a quick break and then we’ll come back and we’ll talk about some other things on our dance card. Mary McCord: That’s right. Mark Meadows. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Okay, welcome back. So, Mary, we are going to talk about something that is definitely a blast from the past, which is Mark Meadows filed this week a petition in the Supreme Court to have reviewed the decisions from the federal courts in the 11th Circuit to not allow his removal of the state criminal case to federal court. And we’ll get into the details of that. But let me just ask you the first question, which was definitely the first thing on my mind when I was reading this, which is what on God’s green earth accounts for the fact that we’re in July and the 11th Circuit decision, not even the district court decision, the 11th Circuit decision was in December. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Again, as you know, I don’t do math in public, but December to July is usually a lot longer than you have the normal time you have to seek certiorari, that’s to seek review by the Supreme Court. So what explains this enormous delay? Mary McCord: Extensions of time. That’s what explains it. Extensions of time. Andrew Weissmann: And which justice would it be that did that? Mary McCord: And I don’t know if we’ve talked about this before, but the different circuits each have a justice assigned to them. And so that if you’ve got sort of motions for things like an extension of time and also other emergency motions, motions for stays, motions related to execution of death penalty, things like that, oftentimes when you’re making those kinds of motions, they go to the justice who is assigned to your circuit. For the 11th Circuit, that happens to be Justice Thomas. So Justice Thomas has agreed to extensions of time from the original, what the original due date would have been for a petition all the way to July 27th, which was last Friday. And, you know, one has to wonder possibly was Mark Meadows and his attorneys, were they waiting and hoping that somehow, they could benefit from the Supreme Court’s immunity decision and use that as fuel in their petition for a writ of certiorari? Andrew Weissmann: I actually went and did some homework and I read the applications for the extension. And in fact, one of the grounds was the pending Supreme Court immunity decision. And so that is sort of front and center of the actual petition -- Mary McCord: Yup. Andrew Weissmann: -- in terms of what it is that Mark Meadows is focused on and very much focused on this. Remember the part of the Supreme Court immunity decision that deals with the very, very expansive view of official acts, evidence like, you know, and they just have a lot of flowery language -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- about just how expansive you can view official acts, even if it’s something that doesn’t really seem within the normal purview of the presidents. Mary McCord: And this was about official acts of the president -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Not underlings. Mary McCord: -- just to be clear, that’s what that was about. But before we jump into all the substance, because I know we’re both dying to do that, I want to just make sure people know what the heck we’re talking about. So there is a federal statute that says that in any civil or criminal prosecution that’s brought in state court that is against or directed to an officer, the United States or any agency thereof, not relevant here, or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the United States, right, in an official or individual capacity for, and this is the other key language, for or relating to any act under color of such office. These are things that that federal officer can seek when criminally prosecuted, right, as a federal officer for things that he alleges were acts taken under color of his authority. So to official acts, the word is not official acts in the statute. The word is under color of such office, right? Then the person can remove the case to federal court. This is not an immunity statute. This is a statute saying when you’re being prosecuted in a state court and you are being prosecuted for something that you argue as part of your official acts, you can have your case moved to state court. And the idea behind that is so that if you do have some sort of immunity as a federal officer, you’re not relying on the state court to make judgments about your federal officer immunity. You have a federal court, which is perceived to be a more favorable forum or one that will take these claims of federal immunity more seriously and be a fairer tribunal than a state court. Now, query whether that sort of judgment about the fairness of a state court versus a federal court has any legs or is well-grounded or well-founded. Put that aside. That’s sort of the assumption underlying the law. It doesn’t mean you get federal immunity. Then if you do remove your case to federal court, if the federal court says, yes, you meet the qualifications of the statute, we’ll now take it up in federal court, then you would make your arguments. I shouldn’t be able to be prosecuted for this because I have immunity under federal law. Andrew Weissmann: And as we talked about when this was going on in the Pleistocene years, meaning last year, because it’s that long ago, this would just mean that you keep the same prosecutor, you -- Mary McCord: The D.A., still a D.A., not a U.S. attorney, right. Andrew Weissmann: -- you have the same and, you know, charges. But what you do have is you have a different judge and you have a slightly different jury pool. It’s sort of depending on how the veneer or the pool of jurors comes from. But it really is that you have this federal forum to decide the case, but it’s by no means saying the case is over. Of course, one thing to keep in mind is that people might be going, who cares? Because isn’t the Georgia case sort of on hold right now? And the answer to that is, yes, it is on hold because there’s a whole appeal at the state court level right now related to the alleged conflict of interest ruling by the trial judge with respect to Fani Willis that has now been appealed and the appellate court issued a stay. So that whole case is sort of on hold. But Mark Meadows has a sort of belt and suspenders approach, which is, yes, it’s on hold, but I still want to try and get to federal court. So he has made this motion. And, you know, maybe there’s sort of two key arguments he makes. One is he takes on the decision that has to do with when you describe this statute, this congressional statute, it seems to be worded to current officials, not former officials. And that was something that the 11th Circuit decided that there was an issue that it should only apply to current federal officials, not to former federal officials, and Mark Meadows was a former. So that’s sort of issue one. Mary McCord: That’s right. And just to kind of frame this up, the argument and the petition to have the Supreme Court take this is that this is the first time in 190 years that any court has held that this federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and that this is just wrong and the Supreme Court should fix this. I will note for the textualists out there that the 11th Circuit’s decision is a conservative bench and all three judges agreed to issue concurring opinions and we’ll talk about that briefly. But all three judges agreed if they look at the plain text of the statute, it just doesn’t apply to former officials, whereas Part B of the statute makes clear that it applies to former officials. And this is not Part B. This is Part A of the statute. So for those of you who may think about other textual analyses, particularly that the U.S. Supreme Court has engaged in in this past term, as well as other terms, this is a court that is saying, look, we think this is the wrong result in terms of we think Congress should actually fix this statute. In fact, two of the judges concur and say we think it’s imperative that Congress fix the statute to make clear that it applies to former officers. But the plain text of the statute, we’re just reading the words on the page, is in the present tense of a current officer. So that’s their first big argument. Andrew Weissmann: By the way, one of the things that I find fascinating is that Paul Clement, a very notable Supreme Court advocate who is on the brief for Mark Meadows, basically says, like, I know there are these concurrences that says Congress should fix it, but we figured there’s a shorter way that you can just fix it. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, this is so topsy turvy because this is what conservatives traditionally have accused liberals of doing, which is, you know, this is like the whole attack on Roe v. Wade is, oh, this is reading way too much into the text of the Constitution. And you have the current court basically throwing out its originalism doctrine when it’s needed. Mary McCord: When suitable, right. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly. When convenient for them. So what’s the second issue? The first issue is just this one about, you know, the text doesn’t apply to formers, but then they go on to the second issue. Mary McCord: Right. But to your point on that, before I move to the second issue, is this is another place where they rely on the immunity decision, saying Mr. Trump is a former and there was no question that he was able to obtain immunity. Now, when we are mixing apples and oranges here, Mr. Trump wasn’t removing a case from state court to federal court and having applying a statute. There’s no statute that applies at all. Remember the immunity that the court found they found based on, you know, what they called presidential -- Andrew Weissmann: Policy. Policy and separation of powers. Mary McCord: I would say, yeah, constitutional principles, including separation of powers. So we’re not talking about the interpretation of a statute. Nevertheless, they rely on that. The second part is really more of an affirmance of the district court’s opinion. The district court had not denied the motion based on the statute not being applicable to former officers. It had gone through and said, you essentially have not shown that the gravamen or gravamen, we now know both pronunciations are correct. Andrew Weissmann: Either, either, tomato, tomato. Mary McCord: That’s right. That, you know, the heart of the case is about official acts. Mark Meadows, as chief of staff, yes, you had expansive, you know, authorities, but this was about state election administration and neither the president nor the chief of staff has any sort of authority over that. That’s not related to your official acts. Therefore, because it’s not related to the official acts, you can’t remove it. You will have to stay in state court. I will note, just because we didn’t say this earlier, even staying in state court doesn’t mean, oh, now you can’t argue you’re immune. You just have to argue it in state court. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. This goes directly to the issue flagged by Amy Coney Barrett. And this is where, to a large extent, it is a 5-4 decision on immunity, at least when it deals with the issue of the fake electors. And where Amy Coney Barrett says in a footnote, quite pointedly, you know, sometimes it’s hard to know and make a distinction between official and unofficial. And she goes, and sometimes it’s not. And when it comes to the fake elector scheme, it’s not. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So she would find that that is clearly unofficial conduct. And so, you know, it’s very interesting because this brief, if the court takes it, it both deals with the sort of application of the immunity decision to somebody who’s not the president. I mean, it’s not directly related, but also goes to this real conflict where Amy Coney Barrett is not with the majority on this expansive view of what is official. So it could be pretty fascinating to see whether the majority of five holds with respect to this, because here there has been fact-finding. Mary McCord: I mean, the federal elector scheme is a little different, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But they’re comparable because we’re talking about pressure on state legislatures, pressure here on also the secretary of state in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, right, to reconvene the legislature and basically -- Andrew Weissmann: And this is one where, remember, the posture of the immunity decision was sending it. This is the great preview to we’re about to take a break and talk about Judge Chutkan. But the immunity decision sent it back to the trial court to have this factual hearing. But here, if people recall, there was a factual hearing where Mark Meadows actually testified and there was fact-finding by the federal trial court. And then that was reviewed by the appellate court. So there is a record for the conclusion that this was the acts that are unofficial or that are as a candidate. And this is going to be quite interesting if this case is taken by the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: Yes, it absolutely will. And, you know, like I said, it’s kind of like a dam bursting, right? That one decision has just led to a flood of other litigation. And we have to wait to see how courts are going to rule and what things are going to get to the U.S. Supreme Court. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, the first thing we talked about was the effect of the immunity decision on the Trump case. Now we’re talking about the effect of the immunity decision on Mark Meadows’ removal. I mean, by the way, I think it’s a totally intentional part of the Supreme Court in terms of what they were doing -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- like a giant bowling ball, like knocking down all these pins. Mary, should we take a quick break and then we can turn to actually -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- the third way that the decision from the Supreme Court on immunity could be affecting Judge Chutkan. Mary McCord: Absolutely. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, the floodgates are open now. The dam has broken. So what do we expect now by the end of this week, Andrew? The case, the D.C.-based January 6th case, the one that went to the Supreme Court on the immunity issue, that will finally actually get back into Judge Chutkan’s court by the end of the week. Andrew Weissmann: Just to remind people, there’s a normal delay that occurs when a case is on appeal to get it back to when the trial court can start again. And with the Supreme Court, it’s 32 days, I’ve learned. And so that’s going to happen this week, meaning that the district court has essentially the baton again to go forward. Mary, I know you’re going to say that the parties could actually seek to shorten that and I suspect that that didn’t happen here because the Jack Smith team probably was like, we do not want to ask the Supreme Court for anything. We want to just take our marbles and go home and not give them an opportunity -- Mary McCord: To say anything else. Andrew Weissmann: -- to delay anything. Exactly. Let’s just let the normal processes go forward, especially since there isn’t going to be a trial before the election. And so the main issue that we’ve talked about is Judge Chutkan has, I think, been essentially directed by the Supreme Court to have a factual hearing. Now, on certain issues, it may be -- Mary McCord: Well -- Andrew Weissmann: -- a law issue. Mary McCord: Yeah. I would say she’s directed to have briefing, right, on the legal issues and factual issues, which could include a hearing on those factual issues. I think that’s not for every issue based on the Supreme Court, but certainly for some of them, yes. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. So, I mean, they talk about the context. They just go on and on with respect to not the vice president stuff -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- which is the best argument that Trump has -- Mary McCord: Legal. Andrew Weissmann: -- for legal, but for other issues having to do with state interference, where they just talk so much and what happened on January 6th about the factual context. And they keep on talking about facts specific. And that to me is hearings. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, I think we’re going to see briefing on that issue with Donald Trump trying to do everything and anything to avoid any sort of factual hearing before the general election. And again, kind of remarkable because if you have nothing to hide, what’s the big deal? I mean, put the witnesses on. I mean, remember, the witnesses are going to be to a large extent, if not exclusively, people who are part of his administration in one form or another, or at the state level, very much Republican allies. So, these are not sort of your normal deep state Democrats who I expect would be heard. Mary McCord: Yes. Just to play devil’s advocate, though, you know, we are getting very, very close. We’re, what, 100 days from the election, I think his argument will be. And I don’t think this is a crazy argument that, you know, this would be a very big distraction for the nominee for one of the two major parties. And, of course, in America, it really is a two-party contest. And that to have any kind of hearing, because remember, it’s not like this hearing is going to be Friday, right? There would be number of steps before a hearing. Judge Chutkan may this week, may not till next week, she may put out an order asking the parties to propose next steps. She might put out her own order saying, here is what I want for next steps. Here’s a briefing schedule. Here’s a hearing date. Or she could put out an order saying, come in for a status conference and let’s talk about next steps. So, first, you’ve got to kind of like the setup to what is going to happen. Then, at some point, a briefing schedule, like you said, a hearing schedule. And, you know, the briefs, you know, unless you do, there are two types of briefing. There’s the normal course, where one side puts forth its position, the other side opposes. The side that started does a reply, that’s sequential briefing. And then there’s simultaneous briefing. And that’s where both sides file at the same time. She could do that here. She could do sequential here. And either way, though, these take time. The parties have to, you know, write these briefs, they have to file them. Then she has to make some decisions. I suspect she may make some decisions, maybe now, but she could make some legal decisions before she even decides to have a hearing on the facts. She could be. She does it all at once. So my point is, by the time you get to a hearing, we are probably in October, really, realistically, maybe September. And I very, very strongly suspect Donald Trump’s team will say, this just has to be put off. I mean, he’s a candidate, it’s too close to the election, this would be an interference with the election. Andrew Weissmann: And to continue that motif of delay, there are other arguments. There’s lots of ways for additional mischief. Mary McCord: Sure. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So they can make an argument that even if there is going to be hearing, what should the evidence be? Is it protected by executive privilege? What kinds of things should be allowed? Mary McCord: Is it official acts, right? She needs to decide what’s official or non-official, even to know what could come in at the hearing, right. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So there’s that. There’s also Judge Cannon’s decision is, of course, not in any about Jack Smith not being legally appointed. That, of course, is not binding on Judge Chutkan. In fact, there’s a D.C. Circuit case saying that he is official. Mary McCord: Which is binding. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. But that can get raised to say, wait a second, you should wait and see what happens with that because we shouldn’t have a hearing and be required to go to this hearing, especially, as you said, Mary, at this time, et cetera, when there’s a real issue about whether Jack Smith is even legally appointed. In other words, there are all sorts of ways in which there’s lots of sand thrown in the Judge Chutkan gears. Mary McCord: You’re right. And on that last point, which segues nicely to our last thing we want to talk about today, they will say, I think, that, you know, notwithstanding this D.C. Circuit opinion on the legality and constitutionality of the appointment of Jack Smith, the issue is in the 11th Circuit now and you should wait for the 11th Circuit to rule and that could potentially go to the Supreme Court. So you should wait for that. And we shouldn’t have to go to your point through the hearing when we’ve got this live issue out there. So you’re right. That is more than sand. That is gravel and chunks of like boulders. Andrew Weissmann: So talking about the 11th Circuit, Mary, remember, Judge Cannon said throughout the Mar-a-Lago case that Jack Smith is not legally appointed. She’s the first out of nine judges who have held that. And the 11th Circuit has issued a scheduling order that doesn’t have the case even being fully submitted, doesn’t have an oral argument date, but it doesn’t have the briefing done until sort of late October, assuming that you have a government brief, a defense brief, and then a government reply brief. And so it is quite conceivable, if not likely, that the oral argument would not be until after the general election. And I have to say, in many ways, knowing that the Mar-a-Lago case was not going to happen, that that trial was clearly not going to happen before the general election, I’m not sure it’s such a bad thing for the 11th Circuit because in many ways, look, it’s better to have it decided afterwards and sort of without the heat of politics on it. And so the court can rule on it. It would have no effect because there was no way for Judge Cannon that she was going to have this trial. And the key issue that I am looking for, obviously, there is this substance of what Judge Cannon said. I think she’s wrong. I agree with the other judges. Obviously, I was part of the litigation team in the Mueller case where we argued for why it was statutorily correct. But I think the key issue is whether Jack Smith is going to ask to have Judge Cannon removed from the case for one reason or another. Mary McCord: Yeah. My money is that he won’t, but we’ll see. Maybe I’ll be wrong about that. And just so that folks know, this is not like a delayed or an extended briefing schedule. This is pretty normal. The due date for appellant, which is Jack Smith and the government here, is August 27th. Then there’s 30 days for the appellee, that’s Donald Trump’s team, to file their brief. And then 21 days after that for Jack Smith and the government to file a reply. That is a pretty standard appellate briefing schedule. And neither party, to my knowledge, and I did not just double check this, but neither party sought an expedited -- Andrew Weissmann: That’s right. Mary McCord: -- briefing schedule. And so no one should be thinking, oh, this is some sort of delay. This is pretty normal. And like you said, there’s not a reason to rush here. I mean, Jack Smith, to be clear, has never asked for expedition on anything based on the election. He’s very careful not to do that. He’s asked for expedition of other things like the immunity decision in the interest of the public, good in being able to get that matter to trial, never tying it to the election, but get it to trial sooner rather than later and not have delay. But here, there was no reason to try to expedite, and they didn’t do that. So yes, we will see if he adds and, you know, August 27th. We’ll see what he has to say. As you and I have discussed, there is also an option for this case to be re-indicted by the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida because Judge Cannon’s opinion was about the appointment of a special counsel, Jack Smith, and U.S. attorneys are presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed. There’s no question that they have the authority to bring cases like this, so that issue would go away. And it’s not mutually exclusive, like he can file his appeal, like he has noted the appeal already, file his brief, and it wouldn’t be Jack Smith again, the government could have a U.S. attorney re-indict the case, then of course, at some point, there’d be arguments that now the appeal is moot, so it shouldn’t go forward or things like that. But we haven’t seen any indication thus far that that other track is being pursued by the government. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, so nice to see you again. Mary McCord: It is. Andrew Weissmann: Even if it’s now virtual and not in person. Mary McCord: Yes, it is. And, you know, it’s funny how just a few days ago, as I was thinking, gosh, we don’t have a whole lot new, but kind of, yeah -- Andrew Weissmann: We do. Mary McCord: -- we always do. Andrew Weissmann: You know, it’s the law business keeps us very busy. Mary McCord: It does. Absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: So before we go, I want to be sure to invite everyone who’s listening to join my MSNBC colleagues and me for a live event.

Simone Biles celebrates Team USA's gold with a pointed response to critics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/simone-biles-olympics-gold-2024-gymnastics-vance-rcna164462,"Three years ago, when Simone Biles withdrew from the U.S. women's gymnastics team final at the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health, she faced a barrage of criticism, including from right-wing pundits who called her ""weak"" and ""selfish."" On Tuesday, Biles led Team USA to a triumphant gold medal after they scored a nearly six-point win over their competitors. In an Instagram post later in the day, Biles appeared to respond to critics, writing “lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions” alongside photos of her and her teammates Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera celebrating their win on the floor. Biles' caption appeared to be a pointed reference to her former teammate Mykayla Skinner's comments last month. In a now-deleted YouTube video, Skinner — who replaced Biles in the 2020 team final after she withdrew — criticized the team, saying “a lot of girls don’t work as hard.” “Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t like what it used to be,” Skinner said. “The girls just don’t have the work ethic.” She later posted a statement apologizing for her comments. The team's gold medal Tuesday was a victorious comeback after winning silver in the last Olympics. Several of the Team USA gymnasts had overcome significant mental and physical health issues in recent years: Biles publicly struggled with the ""twisties,"" which led to her stepping down from the last Olympics' team final; Lee, who won the Olympic all-around title in Tokyo, was diagnosed with two kidney diseases last year; and Chiles, who has grappled with the expectations in gymnastics, had considered letting go of the sport. Biles' withdrawal from the Tokyo team final, in particular, drew intense criticism from conservatives, many of whom jumped on the opportunity to turn her into a culture war villain despite showing no understanding of the rigorous demands of professional sports. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called her a ""selfish sociopath,"" North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson said she was ""weak,"" and JD Vance, who was running for the Senate at the time and is now Donald Trump's running mate, questioned why people were praising Biles for putting her mental health first. Biles, 27, became the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history with her team's gold medal Tuesday. So far, no word from her critics on that."
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 7.31.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-73124-rcna164509,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Arizona’s closely watched U.S. Senate race, election denier Kari Lake won a Republican primary Tuesday, two years after narrowly losing the gubernatorial race in the state. * In related news, Reps. David Schweikert, Eli Crane and Juan Ciscomani faced GOP primary rivals Tuesday, and each of the incumbent House Republicans prevailed. * Arguably the most notable result in Arizona’s primary contests was further down the ballot: Stephen Richer lost his re-election bid for Maricopa County recorder, losing to a right-wing primary rival. Local Republicans punished Richer for telling them accurate information about the 2020 election results that they didn’t want to hear. * While Vice President Kamala Harris technically isn’t yet the Democratic presidential nominee, her odds appear quite good: When the Democratic National Committee holds its virtual roll call, Harris will be the only name on the ballot. * In related news, we don’t yet know who Harris’ running mate will be, but the incumbent vice president has already scheduled a rally in Philadelphia for Tuesday, and she’ll share the stage with her choice. * Before President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll found Donald Trump ahead in each of the nation’s most competitive battleground states. A new Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll, however, shows Harris leading Trump, 48% to 47%, across these seven states. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * Ahead of Missouri’s primaries next week, Trump has endorsed both of the GOP’s state attorney general candidates and all three of the party’s gubernatorial candidates. * In Minnesota, the latest KSTP/SurveyUSA poll found incumbent Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar leading both of her Republican rivals by more than 20 points. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * And in case California’s 2026 gubernatorial race weren’t already crowded, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced last week that he’s running, too. This will be the Democrat’s second attempt at the office: Villaraigosa lost to Gov. Gavin Newsom six years ago."
‘Coup’ doesn’t mean what Republicans seem to think it means,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 8:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/coup-doesnt-mean-republicans-think-means-vance-biden-election-2024-rcna164492,"After President Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid, Republicans did little to hide their disappointment — GOP officials were convinced the Democratic incumbent was likely to lose — and some tried to turn the development into some kind of scandal. Sen. Tom Cotton, for example, insisted that Biden “succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors.” Pressed for an explanation, the Arkansas Republican struggled to defend his own over-the-top nonsense, but others in the party have nevertheless echoed the rhetoric. Take Donald Trump’s running mate, for example. The Washington Post reported: “The media ... for years has said the Republicans are a threat to democracy,” Vance told a Nevada audience. “They’re calling it a coronation [of Harris]. I’ve got a different word for it: I call it a coup.” So, a few things. First, as we discussed last week, we already have a good idea as to what a “coup” is. Merriam-Webster’s definition is as good as any: “a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics and especially the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group.” To think this applies to an incumbent president voluntarily withdrawing from a re-election campaign is obviously bad-faith nonsense. I realize that Vance is new to all of this — his career in elected office began last year — but incumbents retire all of the time. It’s perfectly normal. When they retire at the urging of allies, it doesn’t suddenly transform into a rebellion. Second, if Republicans like Vance and Cotton are looking for evidence of developments that actually resemble a coup, perhaps they should turn their attention to Trump’s Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol? As a recent Washington Post analysis concluded, after Trump’s 2020 defeat, the Republican “tried to cheat Biden voters in those five states out of their choice. He tried to short-circuit the effort to count electors. And then he suggested that the furious crowd near the White House direct their anger at the Capitol. It’s useful for Trump’s allies to pretend that Biden’s decision was comparable. It isn’t.” But at the heart of the GOP’s “coup” talk is an implicit message to Democratic voters. The Republican line effectively tells them, “Your own party’s officials helped nudge your own party’s president into retirement! It was a coup against Biden! Aren’t you outraged?” The answer, by all appearances, is no. Before Biden’s announcement, national polling showed most Democratic voters supported a change at the top of the party’s ticket. In the wake of the president’s decision, a new poll from the Associated Press found roughly 8 in 10 Democratic voters will be pleased when Vice President Kamala Harris wins the party’s nomination. If Republicans are looking for a genuine controversy, they’ll have to look elsewhere. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
“When the Clock Broke” with John Ganz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 8:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/-clock-broke-john-ganz-rcna164261,"There’s a lot of unprecedented things going on nowadays. And with everything going on, it can be tempting to distort the moment we’re in and to view things as totally new and completely abrupt. Our guest this week has written about the source of historical continuity, particularly in the 1990s, that has brought us to our current moment. John Ganz is the author of “When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s.” He joins WITHpod to discuss his thesis on modern conservatism, the placid politics of the '90s, inflection points since then and more. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. John Ganz: Shortly after Trump was elected in 2016, a piece actually came out in 2017 by Rick Perlstein in “The New York Times” magazine, and it was basically kind of Rick saying that he had to revise his picture of the conservative movement and cranks and oddballs and fringe figures that he had thought had been marginalized and pushed out of the conservative movement were more important than he had suspected. And also around this time, the alt-right, as it was known then, was really in the news a lot because they were very excited by Trump’s victory, very excited by Trump’s campaign. And I kept on coming across the name Murray Rothbard when reading the profiles and interviews with these guys. Now, a lot of these guys were neo-Nazis, but they all, almost to a man, talked about Murray Rothbard as the person who kind of started them on their road to the kind of political consciousness that they had then. So I was looking around at what Rothbard wrote, and I found a piece from 1992 called “Right-Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement.” And it was eerie what it said and how much it seemed to anticipate Trump and what had happened in the Republican Party. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. We live in an era of the unprecedented. You hear that a lot. I get to say it a lot on the television show “All In,” which I host on MSNBC. And it’s true, there’s lots of stuff happening that hasn’t happened before. At least since the firing of the cannons of Fort Sumter, there had been no violent attempt on the interruption of the transfer of power in the United States, not since Lincoln’s election. So that really was pretty unprecedented, certainly in our lifetimes. There’s never been a president impeached twice. That was unprecedented. There’s never been a nominee for the presidency running who has 34 felony convictions. That’s completely new in American history. It’s been since the 19th century that we had someone running for president who had been president once before. There’s a lot of stuff happening all the time that is genuinely new, has not happened before, out past the frontier of the known world. All of that said, of course, it is often tempting to dehistoricize the moment we’re in, to view thing as totally new and completely abrupt. And often you have opportunities to dip into some historical text. I’ve been doing this in this book I’ve been writing, where you will read something that feels shockingly contemporary, even from a long time ago. An article I was reading that was decrying the fact that everyone back in the 19th century was reading magazines and the whole family never talked to each other anymore because each member of the family had their own magazine they were looking at. So you can find historical continuity and oftentimes that historical continuity is as illuminating as our sense of disjuncture. And my guest today is someone who has found the source of historical continuity that has brought us to our current moment, I think in a fairly unlikely place, in a fascinating place, in the era politics of the kind of end of the Cold War 1990s. I think it’s a time that, as we’ve gotten further from it, has been marked down in history as relatively placid, the emerging of this kind of global consensus about capitalism and democracy and not the site of incredible, contested, violent conflict. You know, we think about the ‘60s as a tumultuous decade. We don’t think about the 90s as a tumultuous decade in the same way. And yet it’s certainly the case that many of the precursors to the ideological tendencies and cultural dispositions that would cohere into what we think of now as Trumpism or MAGA are extremely present in that decade. And John Ganz is a fantastic writer. He writes a Substack that you should definitely check out. I don’t know anything about him. I know literally nothing about him and I love this because it reminds me of the glory days of blogs where you would find someone on the internet who wrote something really good and you’d think, Jesus, this is great. And then you’d keep reading them and you didn’t know. Maybe they were a barista. Maybe they were an econ professor. Maybe they were a software engineer. Maybe they were a Hollywood producer doing this. You never knew. You had no idea what their credentials were or where they were. They were just writing really good stuff and you’re reading it. And John Ganz is one of these people who I started reading and this book is phenomenal. The book is called “When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s.” John, welcome to the program. John Ganz: Thanks so much for having me, Chris. Chris Hayes: I saw a picture of you, I think for the first time fairly recently. I was like, I don’t know, the guy could be 65 years old for all I know, or he could be 15. He could be a high school freshman savant who does spends all his time reading history. John Ganz: Somewhere in between. Chris Hayes: Somewhere in between. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Congratulations with the book. It’s genuinely excellent. John Ganz: Thanks so much. Chris Hayes: Truly, truly great. Well, first tell me a little bit about yourself. Like -- John Ganz: Sure. Chris Hayes: -- why am I reading a John Ganz history? Where does all your erudition come from? John Ganz: Well, I have a history degree with honors from the University of Michigan, which served me very well. I’ve always been extremely interested in history, political theory, social theory, you know, were a big part of my reading habits. And I wrote before the election of 2016, a little bit, mostly about art and culture, not very much about politics, although I was always interested in politics. But then I thought I had to take politics more seriously and started to write more about politics. Chris Hayes: How did you find your way to the 1990s and the topic of this book? John Ganz: Yeah. So basically what happened was all these events kind of fade together in my memory now, but I’ll try to reconstruct it. So shortly after Trump was elected in 2016, a piece actually came out in 2017 by Rick Perlstein and “The New York Times” magazine, and it was basically kind of Rick saying that he had to revise his picture of the conservative movement and cranks and oddballs and fringe figures that he had thought had been marginalized and pushed out of the conservative movement were more important than he had suspected. And also around this time, the alt-right, as it was known then, was really in the news a lot because they were very excited by Trump’s victory, very excited by Trump’s campaign. And I kept on coming across the name Murray Rothbard when reading the profiles and interviews with these guys. Now, a lot of these guys were neo-Nazis, but they all, almost to a man, talked about Murray Rothbard as the person who kind of started them on their road of political to the kind of political consciousness that they had then. So I was looking around at what Rothbard wrote, and I found a piece from 1992 called “Right Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement.” And it was eerie what it said and how much it seemed to anticipate Trump and what had happened in the in the Republican Party. So I had this essay or this article from his newsletter, and then I tried to get in touch with people, writers who I admired. I wasn’t known as a writer very much. I had written a couple of things, but nothing big. And I tried to send this to Jamelle Bouie, who didn’t know me at the time but now we’re friends. And I tried to send this to Rick Perlstein, same story. And you know, they didn’t get back to me. So I had to start writing about this myself, essentially, which turned out to be a good thing. So I wrote a piece about Murray Rothbard for “The Baffler.” And then shortly, a few months after that, I think I wrote a piece about the year 1992 in general and put Rothbard kind of into context of David Duke’s run for governor in Louisiana and Pat Buchanan’s primary campaign against George H.W. Bush, Ross Perot’s candidacy and a bunch of other strange things that were going on at that time. Chris Hayes: The book sort of chronologically starts with Duke, but maybe let’s start with Rothbard because he is a fascinating figure. John Ganz: Sure. Chris Hayes: Son of the Bronx like myself. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Who is Murray Rothbard? John Ganz: Murray Rothbard is one of the big figures in American libertarianism. He is one of the people who helped found the Cato Institute, but he was kind of also a marginalized and fringe figure. He was involved with the right in the 1950s and the emergence of the conservative movement, but was pushed out because of his extreme libertarianism and his continued adherence to the pre-war tradition of isolationism, which was not what the conservative movement with its Cold War hawkishness really wanted to have anything to do with. So he led, you know, a literally very eccentric life in American politics. In the 1960s, he tried to kind of forge a coalition alliance with the new left because he shared or he thought he shared some of their critiques of the welfare warfare state, bureaucracy. That did not work out. That’s when after that episode and getting tired of the new left and the new left getting tired of him, he moved over to, you know, meet the Kochs and try to start Cato. He was pushed out of that organization partially for his personal difficulties, partially for his extremism. He’s involved in trying to, you know, match nations within the libertarian party to push in his direction. And eventually he comes up with a kind of new synthesis that he calls paleolibertarianism with a man named Lew Rockwell, who had been Ron Paul’s chief aide. So this is kind of the Ron Paul side of the libertarian movement. And this includes an extreme free market, laissez-faire capitalist approach with very strong social conservatism. He was very much opposed to what he called left libertarianism with their kind of hippie-ish social liberalism. Chris Hayes: Pod and, you know, do whatever you want in the bedroom -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and abortion and things like that. John Ganz: Yeah, he still calls himself a libertarian, but was really also a pretty vociferous social conservative. But what he does, what he comes up with after he witnesses David Duke’s run is he comes up with this strategy, this theory of politics, which he had been kind of working on for a very long time. There are a few components to it. Insofar as they actually happened, he was a bit of a victim of Buckley’s famed purges from the conservative movement. So he viewed those as a kind of betrayal and weakening of the conservative movement. He viewed himself as the continuer of the pre-war America first isolationist right. So he thought, okay, well, our moment has arrived where, you know, the Buckleyites ascendancy and control over conservatism and the right in America is coming to an end and we’re turning to an older, healthier tradition that I’m a representative of. But he also says, and when he writes right wing populism, he says, look, let’s face it, we live in a big statist world. The government is in close cahoots with big corporations. They have these kind of underclass parasitical clients, and together they squeeze and exploit the middle class in the country. So his strategy is not to dismantle the state so much, although that may have remained. I mean, it definitely remained his ultimate goal, but to put in a kind of big bully in the White House and to menace and smash the liberal elites that he hated. And the inspiration for this, partly, and he had been working on this theory since the 1950s, was Joe McCarthy. I think a lot of conservatives who attempted to make themselves appear respectable to liberal elites would defend aspects of the Red Scare, defend a muscular approach to the Soviet Union, but say, okay, maybe McCarthy was a bit crude and a bit of a demagogue. And Rothbard essentially says, no, you’ve got it exactly wrong. McCarthy’s demagogy and his ability to menace the liberal elites is exactly what was good about him and this is what we should emulate. Chris Hayes: So there’s a few strains here, right? John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: There’s the sort of maybe somewhat paradoxically for a libertarian, he really likes the strong executive. He sees the presidency as a great place to sort of like wield this kind of power. Caesarism, I think, in the words of Samuel Francis, is another thinker that we’ll get to. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: There’s this kind of populism. It’s driven by this resentment that goes both up and down. There’s resentment against big business and the sort of globalist elites, both the country club and the sort of Fortune 500 CEO types. And then the underclass, the clients, predominantly black and brown folks, immigrants, black people in major urban centers, particularly this kind of white middle class and its resentments both up and down. And this kind of embrace of demagoguery and also the sort of on the kind of isolationist front, this kind of rejection of some of the interventionism of the Cold War era conservative -- John Ganz: Movement. Chris Hayes: -- movement, right. Like those are some of the big strains that he’s marrying together there. John Ganz: Yes. Chris Hayes: So that’s Rothbard. Now, I mean, he’s just a weird intellectual who sort of bops around. But you know, his sort of eureka moment is watching David Duke’s success. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And Duke is sort of the person that puts this into practice before Buchanan and, to a certain extent, Perot. We could talk about that, but talk about Duke’s political success and what it did to the Republican Party and conservative movement at the time and what ideas it gave to some of them. John Ganz: Well, I think basically the most interesting thing about David Duke as a parallel to what we’ve seen the past few years, I mean, David Duke was a neo-Nazi and a former Grand Wizard of the Klan. He kind of disavowed this, but not really. It was pretty thin. And he goes on to become a state legislator in Louisiana, and then he goes on to run for Senate and then he goes on to run for governor against the state and national parties. And the state and national parties were unable to stop him. And they were really frantic in ways that kind of reminded me of the Republicans in 2016, really unable to stop Trump. Now, ultimately, Duke, freighted with his past and, you know, a certain lack of political talent perhaps falls. I mean, there’s a very big black vote in Louisiana. They’re not about to elect a former Klansman. So he loses, but he wins 55 percent of the white vote. And I think most notably, again, really gives the Republican establishment a lot of trouble. And yes, Rothbard, Sam Francis, another one of these paleo conservative intellectuals and Pat Buchanan, all see the David Duke candidacy and the struggle that the mainstream Republicans RNC, I mean, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both released radio ads against him. They sent the RNC staffers to fight against him when he was just running for a state legislator seat. They were spooked by him. And this was a hopeful sign to this little circle of paleoconservatives and they took this as a signal for the launching of their own political ambitions at the time. Chris Hayes: You do a great job chronicling Duke and both his sort of vileness, but also his appeal. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And one of the things that the Republicans and even the local media keep encountering are there are two aspects that really resonate. One is that he’s an attentional magnate. He loves being on TV. He makes good TV. So people keep having him on TV. He’s constantly sort of the star of the story. He’s a good story. He’s a good copy. Right. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Former Grand Wizard runs for office. And the second thing is, once people kind of locked into him, once a certain kind of white person in Louisiana locked into him, a lot of whom were conservatives, but other people who were a little more politically unaffiliated. It was very difficult to pry them loose with, like, facts about what a disgusting monster he was. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: It just didn’t work. And they kept finding themselves flummoxed by this. John Ganz: Yeah. It was a very strange phenomenon and there’s a clear parallel. I mean, when I was researching the book, there was a focus group run by the choice of the mainstream party that the incumbent governor, Buddy Roemer, you know, and they asked people, well, what about a guy who have gotten a facelift and what about a guy who hadn’t paid taxes and never really had a real job? And they hated this hypothetical candidate. But when they were told it was David Duke, they made up a lot of excuses. They said, well, you know, only stupid people pay taxes. He must be smart, which sounds very familiar. So, yeah, there was a certain magnetism he had for voters, and it was intensified when he came under attack by the establishment and the media. It was intensified. Now, it’s important to note that this did not make him invincible. It just created a certain base, a certain core that was very loyal to him and very hard to shake. Ultimately, you know, he loses quite badly. You know, it was a landslide election against him. But, you know, more sophisticated political observers like the people who, you know, wanted to emulate him really took very careful note of that white vote. Chris Hayes: That he’s able to win the majority of the white vote. John Ganz: Yes. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Actually there’s a crazy moment where he comes to the Senate gallery after his loss. So he runs. He wins the state rep seat, which is a nail biter. He wins by 226 votes or something like that. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: He runs for state rep. He runs for Senate. He loses. He runs for governor. He loses. But he ends up in the Senate gallery during like a civil rights bill debate -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- sort of attempting to kind of personally intimidate George H.W. Bush into not voting or not signing a piece of civil rights legislation that is passed by both houses. John Ganz: Yeah. So this bill, which had broad bipartisan support, the Civil Rights Act of 1992, which you don’t hear talk about that much, was opposed by, you know, the hard right and some also some business interests. Duke goes to the Senate gallery while they are trying to overturn Bush’s veto of this bill. And it comes close, but doesn’t work. Duke goes outside and crows to the news cameras that he’s the reason why Bush vetoed the bill because he could see that the kind of appeal that he was having was politically potent, he didn’t want to irritate this section of the electorate. And then he goes and gives an interview at “The Washington Times” and there he meets with Sam Francis, who you’ve mentioned earlier, who’s very intrigued by what Duke has to say. Did Duke actually affect that vote or affect Bush’s decision to veto it? He certainly was not the only person on the right who did not like the Civil Rights Act of 1992, but he was a very visible exponent of resistance to it. It’s really interesting to think back about the Civil Rights Act of 1992, which, again, is a little bit obscure now, because at the time it was labeled a quota bill. And there had been a series of Supreme Court cases that had weakened employee protections for race discrimination, sexual harassment. And this was a legislative fix for those problems. Now, if you read some of the more sophisticated attacks on wokeness today, and DEI and so on and so forth, that actually try to connect it to the civil rights infrastructure of the government, they will bring up the Civil Rights Act of 1992, continuing this tradition, I guess you could call it, of opposition to it. But, you know, unless you’re an employment lawyer, you’re not going to hear very much about it. Chris Hayes: One of the lessons about Duke that I would say Rothbard and then Francis will talk about and then Buchanan is really the big one, there’s two lessons. One is race baiting is very powerful. Racism is powerful. It’s a powerful way to attract white voters. And the idea that there are certain things that just can’t be done or said and certain kinds of backgrounds that couldn’t possibly support a politician aren’t really true. Maybe the boundaries are different than you think. John Ganz: Yeah. I think it’s a complicated issue. I think that it’s obviously polarizing, as people might say today. You know, I think that there are both in the type of politics that say someone like David Duke practices, there are strengths and obvious weaknesses, right, so he can get a very enthusiastic core of support. But at the same time, alienates a lot of other people -- Chris Hayes: Yes. John Ganz: -- frightens and mobilizes them. So it’s a little bit of a game of chicken, a little bit. You know, how scary can you possibly be that will excite your type of voters, but it won’t scare people too much that they’ll be encouraged to really come and bash you at the polls, right? So David Duke obviously is a little bit too being a literal Nazi, a little bit too frightening, you know. Chris Hayes: Also humorless, which I think is key. John Ganz: He was somewhat humorless for sure. I mean, he actually, you know, people found him charming. Chris Hayes: Yeah. He had his own appeal. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: The Trump humor schtick to me is a key way that Trump pulls off this trade -- John Ganz: Right Chris Hayes: -- at a higher mathematical level -- John Ganz: Oh, absolutely. Chris Hayes: -- than Duke was able to. John Ganz: Well, he’s an entertainer. Chris Hayes: He’s the kind of like weird. Is he playing a character tongue in cheekness all the time that gives everybody -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- a kind of plausible deniability about just how bad he can be -- John Ganz: Absolutely. Chris Hayes: -- and allows people to go there in a way that was harder with a literal Nazi, you know, in the person of Duke or even Buchanan. John Ganz: Yeah, I think you’re right. And I also think that what I’ve mentioned recently and I don’t think it’s really mentioned enough with Trump is an organic. I mean, look, David Duke wanted to be Adolf Hitler, but he wasn’t, you know. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: He’s not. And, you know, he didn’t have that kind of talent or relationship with crowds. Trump has a relationship with crowds that’s very unusual in American politics. I mean, American politics, politicians are real pros. I think they would go to countries in Europe and clean up, you know. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: But I think Trump is different. He doesn’t shape a message with his advisers or maybe he does that a little bit, but he kind of does this on the fly. He has an organic relationship with the crowds. He sees what they want to hear. They respond to him leading them, but they know that he’s also taking cues from them. And this relationship, this dynamic is quite unique. And it explains a lot of his loyalty and a lot of the excitement he generates in people. Not any of the candidates, maybe a little bit. Ross Perot had a little bit of this. But most of the candidates I discussed in my book are more conventional. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So we talked about Rothbard. We talked about Duke. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Duke goes and meets with Francis, who’s another key figure here. Francis is at the right-wing “Washington Times” at the time, is editorial page writer. And Francis is, again, he calls himself a fascist, pronounced fascist, Italian style. John Ganz: Yeah. Right. Chris Hayes: And along the lines of Rothbard, you know, kind of authoritarian racist populism, essentially. John Ganz: Yeah. Well, Sam Francis becomes involved with the conservative movement around the time of the new right, what’s called the new right and the new right is part of the kind of single-issue movements having to do with busing, gun control, abortion, taxes. And they are all kind of separate, but they sort of come together and coalesce and part of the wave that gets Reagan into the White House. But they are kind of not so intellectually coherent. So Francis is asked to contribute an essay for a book that’s trying to give the new right kind of a theoretical underpinning and he says this represents the revolt of middle Americans, the rise of middle Americans as a kind of ascendant class. And the Reagan administration hopes is a Caesarist populist presidency that will, you know, forge a new political order that’s in the interests of these of these middle American radicals. He got this idea from a from a sociologist named Don Warren. He and like many of his other people in the hard right, and he says, very notably in this, we can’t really call ourselves conservatives anymore. We really have to call ourselves something else. We’re radical. We’re revolutionary. We’re radical, right. We’re not conserving things anymore. The old institutions are dead. He, over the course of the ‘80s, like many other people in the hard right, who some of whom he’s quite close with, are very disappointed with the Reagan administration. Now to us liberals and leftists, we think of the Reagan administration as a huge success for the right and a big disaster for the left. But for people on the hard right, Reagan was a moderate and a squish. Chris Hayes: I mean, there are certain ideological dispositions that can only be disappointed so. John Ganz: Yes. Chris Hayes: And, you know what? Part of that -- John Ganz: That’s also very true. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Yeah. That’s also very true. And I think, you know, Reagan is also temperamentally a lot different from the right in a lot of ways with his sunniness and his optimism, you know. So by the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Francis is very unhappy with what the state of the Republican Party. And like Rothbard, like Buchanan, who he has a personal relationship with, he sees that the arrival of Duke as being a sign that maybe something else is up. You know, it’s also interesting to think about is I know there’s a lot of emphasis in studies on the right put on evangelicals and on the Christian right. And I don’t think that that’s wrong. But I will note that in ‘88, Pat Robertson tried to primary Bush. And that did not activate this button that made all of these members of the of the populist hard right kind of say, oh, maybe it’s time to go in the way that David Duke did. Chris Hayes: So Francis and Buchanan are meeting, you know. John Ganz: Yes. Chris Hayes: They’re having dinner. Buchanan then, I think, kind of take some of the ideas of Francis and the ideas of Duke and he puts it into that ‘92 campaign. And people have drawn these parallels for me. That campaign really, it is a paleo campaign. It has these kinds of recognizable features in that it is kind of trade skeptical, even anti-trade, also very anti-immigrant, also very demagogic, bullying, sort of authoritarian in its kind of tone, if that makes sense, you know. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And it’s surprisingly successful again. And Buchanan’s a smart guy. I knew him a little bit back in the day when doing MSNBC with him. And he’s pretty intentional about what he’s doing. I mean, he both believes it, but also understands what he’s doing, right. John Ganz: He’s a political professional and a media professional. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So what’s his theory of the case for that race? John Ganz: I think he believes that David Duke’s, you know, unexpected strength, the weakness of the of the Republican establishment is a kind of go signal. But he also has his own grievances, one of which is that he believes, along with his fellows, that the neoconservatives have become too powerful within the conservative movement in the Republican Party and they need to be kind of thrown out. So his campaign, as much as an attack on H.W. Bush, who is not really a neoconservative, he had neoconservative allies and advisors, but is really like, I think in their mind, although H.W. Bush kind of moved pretty far to the right, was a Rockefeller establishment Republican kind of guy who they got to get rid of. Chris Hayes: He was mostly just a guy who happened to be there. John Ganz: In my opinion, yes, I think he was a professional public servant whose ambition was to rise to the highest office he possibly could. I think he was driven by a very old type of patriotism, WASP type of patriotism that is different. Chris Hayes: And ego, you know, like everyone. John Ganz: And ego, yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Which was different from the nationalism that was espoused by somebody like Buchanan. Chris Hayes: I mean, he’s the least popular person you can imagine. John Ganz: Yeah. He is a preppy WASP. You know, like in Kennebunkport and so on and so forth. So he views his campaign as also a war against the neocons in an attempt to reverse their power within the party or to arrest their power within the party. So that’s part of his crusade as he puts it, to take back our party and then our country. Now, the thing to note about the neoconservatives and Buchanan is Buchanan, there’s really no way around it. He’s an anti-Semite. Throughout his career, he’s evinced anti-Semitic opinions. He seems to have gotten that from his family when he was growing up. Chris Hayes: I mean, he wrote a book basically saying more or less we picked the wrong side in World War II. John Ganz: Right. And, you know, he views himself also as a member of this America first tradition. Chris Hayes: Yeah. So going back to Taft and Lindbergh and all those folks who were -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- very skeptical of the American war machine and also were -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- if not pro-Nazi, kind of, you know, not that -- John Ganz: Sympathetic. Chris Hayes: -- sympathetic and not that upset about them and often quite anti-globalist, which also always is difficult to disentangle from opposition to the nefarious actions of the international Jew. John Ganz: Exactly, exactly. So he, you know, views the neocons are, look, many of them are Jewish and like with his other guys on the paleocon right, resents their kind of importation of liberal ideas into the right. Now, Buchanan’s version of conservatism, although it does undergo some changes in the 1980s, he says at one point, I think in 1989, I think to Sid Blumenthal, the biggest vacuum in American politics is to the right of Ronald Reagan. So this is the space he sought to occupy. I mean, he knew this, you know, being a man of the right, but he definitely familiarized himself and began to speak the language of the far-right increasingly. The other thing is though, you know, he is a veteran of two White Houses, the Reagan White House where he was communications director and he was an advisor also to Nixon. And this may not be well known among, you know, liberals and lefties today, but Nixon was not particularly well liked within the conservative movement. He was viewed as an establishment Republican, a pragmatist, a liberal. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Buchanan was close to him and had a different view and had a very interesting reading of Watergate. Basically, he thought that Nixon was this tribune of middle American populism that Watergate was essentially an establishment elite liberal coup against Nixon. And the missed opportunity of Watergate was not to launch a kind of counter coup. So that just kind of tells you the tone in which Buchanan is reading politics. He has a personal crusade in a sense to retake the conservative movement and also to, you know, retake the country. Chris Hayes: So to me, the sort of defining features of that ‘92 race, there’s sort of tonal and rhetorical ones, and then there’s substantive ones. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: The tonal rhetorical ones are this just really braying and kind of bile filled populism. I mean, you know, that speech at the convention is just this, you know, sort of execrable. It’s the one someone famously quipped, I like it in the original German, and it ends on this totally kind of fascistic ending about the L.A. riots and the, and the soldiers. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: You know, the sort of, that everything comes from the soldier, that that’s the true source of all sort of freedom and -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and this who’s who list of all the enemies, the feminists and the -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So there’s that. There’s just the bigotry of the demagoguery and this sort of populist, this sort of resentment that just drips through everything. Everything is resentment. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And then there’s these kinds of substantive areas, three of which I think really do become that are really important because they do become, I think, they form the basis of what will be successful in 2016, which is anti-immigrant, anti-trade, anti-foreign intervention. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And those are the places where there’s real heterodoxy, real breaks with some of the establishment ideologically and are actually substantive, not just tonal changes. And all three of those are gonna be woven back together, you know, 24 years later. John Ganz: Yeah. Absolutely. You know, Buchanan is on campaign in New Hampshire and he’s already a part of this kind of protectionist wing of the right. And he plans to run against, he thought what conservatives and Republicans would be upset about was the breaking of the no new taxes pledge, right? So Bush makes the famous no new taxes pledge and breaks it. And among right-wingers today, the story that they tell, or more conventional conservatives, the story they tell themselves is that’s why Bush lost the election. But what Buchanan discovers in New Hampshire campaigning is that people are much more concerned about trade. So that becomes more central part of his message. He doesn’t talk about the no new taxes stuff very much. So the trade stuff becomes big. People are very concerned about, you know, what the last decade of free trade policies and then upcoming, you know, the negotiations are going on for NAFTA and what the effects of that will be. And, you know, at the time, New Hampshire is in an economic downturn because of the recession of 1990, ‘91, so yes. Then the interesting thing is, although the Gulf War was extremely popular, Buchanan, Rothbard and Francis, all opposed it not because for pacifist reasons, but because of the multilateral nature of it and the globalist side of it, that it was, you know, America’s sovereignty was threatened by these multilateral agreements. Chris Hayes: It’s funny you say that because one of the things that would happen that I remember from my early 20s, post 9/11 when, you know, opposition to particularly the war in Afghanistan, but then the war in Iraq was a, you know, relatively marginal view, not totally marginal, but you go to anti-war events or anti-war. You know, these folks were sort of floating at the edges of it because they were the people on the right that were also kind of anti-war. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: But there’d be like some table at the event that like some weird libertarians had. John Ganz: Sure. Yeah. Chris Hayes: And you’d look at the table and you’d be like, huh, that was interesting. It was like the Ron Paul people, basically, and -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you know, and they’d have a Samuel Francis book and then there’d be a Rothbard and, you know, there’s something about the Zionists where you’re like -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And then there’s a book about how like Abraham Lincoln was a dictator -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and like suspended habeas corpus. And you’d be like, okay, all right, I got what’s going on with this table. John Ganz: I get where this is going. Yeah. Chris Hayes: I understand this table. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But that was a real fixture of certain kind of anti-war events back in the early aughts. John Ganz: I remember that. I remember that very clearly, Chris. Yeah. I remember seeing that kind of literature where it’s like mixture of kind of anti-Clinton. I mean, this is after Clinton is president, but there’s still anti-Clinton paranoia. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: And then you see like more kind of abstractly trilateral commission and -- Chris Hayes: Yes, right. Exactly. Yes. John Ganz: Bankers and you know, like -- Chris Hayes: The Rothschild family -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you know, that kind of thing. John Ganz: I’m sure that if you ask the guy for the real stuff, he would reach under the table and -- Chris Hayes: Yes, that’s right. Yeah. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Right. So they all oppose the war, which again is a real thing. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: I mean, it makes them unpopular in their own party. That war, of course, is very popular. But then what’s interesting is that in some ways, you know, it’s so fascinating to me, Buchanan and Perot are different ideological figures. They’re coded at the time very differently. It doesn’t feel like at the time, having lived through it at the age of 13 and as a news junkie, even at that tender age, like a lot of continuity. But you draw out some of the continuity and really like, you know, there’s a lot there that places them in conversation with each other. John Ganz: Well, they were both concerned about trade. Perot had also been a skeptic of the intervention in the Gulf. They both kind of were worshippers of the 1950s. I think that at the time, most commentators thought that they were, you know, part of the same kind of underlying phenomenon. Buchanan, when his campaign is flagging, he says, look, I can’t really compete with Ross Perot. Most of the people who are interested in me are now going after him because he looks like the winner. So, yes, I mean, look, race is less front and center part of Perot’s appeal. And it’s much more on the surface level, kind of universalistic. The fact of the matter is that Perot’s appeal was mostly white. Chris Hayes: Right. John Ganz: He had trouble breaking into minority constituencies, not helped by his extreme awkwardness around race because, you know, he was from Texas and he had very condescending and paternalistic attitudes about black people. Not as hateful, perhaps, as Buchanan, but did not help him. He gave a disastrous speech at the end of the NAACP. There’s a folksiness to Perot that is a lot less threatening than Buchanan and I think he’s angry, but it’s a different tone to the anger and it turns less people off than Buchanan or definitely David Duke. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: You know, one thing about Perot is there was a sense at the time that something had changed, had happened, that this was historically important, maybe even a hinge point. It’s interesting now how much that just seems like a footnote. What was the meaning of Ross Perot? No one really even asked that question. It was just like, well, that was kind of a quirky thing we did there. But you read it as something that did signal something deeper. John Ganz: I think it signaled a true vein of discontent with the political establishment looking for some way to express itself. It was the biggest challenge to the two-party system since, you know, Teddy Roosevelt’s Bull Moose Party, which is almost 100 years earlier. And I think it represented, yeah, a vein of anger and disconnect at the government, you know, with sometimes extremely vague notions of what that meant. But it seemed to peter out the party establishment seemed to be victorious. But then I think, you know, one interpretation of Trump that makes a lot of sense to me was essentially that Trump is a third-party candidate who’s kind of taken over one of the major parties, right. He’s agglomerated himself. And, you know, when he was kind of playing around with the idea of running for president in the past, you know, Ross Perot’s Reform Party was once, you know, one of the vehicles he was looking at. So he definitely viewed that world of third parties, of protest votes as a possible angle. And ultimately, you know, he attaches himself to the Tea Party, which is an internal anti-establishment faction of the Republican Party. So I think basically Trump represents the triumph. I mean, I think of Trump as a synthesis and I think the book tries to articulate the different elements that would go on to be crystallized within Trump. And one of them is Ross Perot’s third party, clean up government, drain the swamp, throw the rascals out, middle class populism. Some of it Buchanan and David Duke’s kind of ethno nationalist race, baity, anti-immigrant stuff. And then some of it is the entertainment industry. Trump is, you know, a creature of cable news. I mean, as is Perot and as is Buchanan to a great degree. But so I think that, you know, obviously he’s not a repetition exactly of Perot, but Perot shows that there is a great deal. There’s a large opening for someone to attack the political establishment as such, from a vantage point that that is sometimes an attack from the left and sometimes an attack from the right. Chris Hayes: I think there’s always this search for kind of materialist, causal explanations -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- particularly on the left and I certainly do this as well. And I have my own theories and I wrote a book back in 2012 that that had something of a materialist or at least a sort of macroeconomic -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- account of some of the levels of distrust and elite failure and sort of the kind of breakdown of meritocracy as a means of explaining some of this alienation that I think has culminated in things like Brexit and Trump. But I also think there’s limitations that I wonder, like, what was it about this time and ‘20s? Is there anything or is it just that history is a kind of stochastic process? But was there something specific about ‘92 and 2016 that market it as propitious moments for the first sort of forays of this style of politics in Duke, Buchanan and then Perot and then for Trump’s success in 2016? John Ganz: Yeah, I think my orientation is similar. I try to base this in kind of a material account. I think it does have limitations. There are other things going on. But essentially what you see in 1992 is that the way that the economy was re-geared during the Reagan ‘80s, some of the consequences of that are becoming apparent for the first time. And you have the American middle class really struggling. A lot of people are falling through the cracks. Wages have stagnated now for about a decade. You know, unions have been crushed, interest rate, and this is different from now and the last 20 years or so or 15 years, but interest rates were very high, which also encouraged, you know, contribute to wage stagnation. And you have also a great deal of discontent with the political establishment because there’s a sense that the political elite, the political class is just working in their own interests and in the interests of, you know, of lobbies and special interests to kind of make these deals that just divide up the spoils of the government and there’s not a sense of a broader public spiritedness going on. So there’s a great deal of anger. I would say, it’s not right to exactly understand this as a class struggle, although that’s the underlying problem. But the issue is what you see in this period is that there is a struggle essentially between the representative and the representatives. There’s a lot of irritation, anger by people against Congress, against representative government in general. And Kevin Phillips, you know, the famous Republican strategist and Nixon advisor, you know, he identifies this as a rejection of representative government as such, searching around for a plebiscitary form of government, a strong man, an authoritarian leader who can cut through the morass of special interests and kind of, you know, rule on behalf of the people. Chris Hayes: So Kevin Phillips identifying this desire for this kind of, you know, sort of populist strong man who can cut out all the special interests who are, you know, preying on the aggrieved white middle class, right, both from below and above, and that’s a similar thing that Samuel Francis identifies. And there’s a deeper ideological thing happening here. I mean, Francis calls himself a fascist. Buchanan doesn’t, but I think has some sympathies that go in that direction. John Ganz: For sure. Chris Hayes: And the ideological moment we find ourselves in is a kind of rejection, a deep rejection of liberal democracy -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and its ethos. And there’s a part of the book where this synthesis and this ideological, alternative ideological vision is made plain in this essay that Francis writes about “The Godfather.” John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: And I thought this was the most ideologically revelatory part of the book. You just wrote about it in your Substack on Popular Front because it kind of perfectly captures the Trumpist model, like what Trump truly believes about to the extent he has normative political commitments about how things should be. They are embodied in this sort of mafia state vision with him as the Don. And this is something that people, you know, the Don father and all these things, these sort of mafia terms, he talks about snitches and all this stuff. So this has always been there. But Francis basically writing an ideological endorsement of this really blew me away. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Tell me about that essay. John Ganz: That essay he writes, yeah, in 1992 is called “The Godfather is a Political Metaphor.” And essentially what he says is “The Godfather” depicts the Corleone family as a representative of an earlier form of social association. He uses the term from the German sociologist Frederick Tonnies, Gemeinschaft, which means community as opposed to Gesellschaft, which means society. Gesellschaft is bureaucracy, the rule of law, corporation, the modern state. Chris Hayes: Yeah. All the elements of liberal democracy and cosmopolitan liberal democracy where -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- strangers and citizens meet each other, mediated through all sorts of institutions, and we negotiate these pluralistic differences. John Ganz: Precisely. Yeah. And Gemeinschaft community is, you know, blood ties, feudalism, family. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah, exactly. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Like, yeah, straight up mafia, feudal kind of -- John Ganz: Right. And he says that, you know, the myth that the Godfather explodes is that we can live in an American society, these operations of mediation work, and we can leave behind force and fraud and all become integrated as free and equal citizens in this democracy of ours. And he says this is BS. Essentially, the Godfather shows the necessity of both force and fraud, even when they have tragic consequences. It shows the reality of politics. And I think basically what unites all of the political currents that I talk about in my book and the ones that we’re seeing now, nationalism and Trump’s kind of gangster populism, if you want to put it like that, is that there’s a rejection of liberal democracy. There’s a rejection of the kind of universalistic promises of liberal democracy. So, you know, citizenship to all or as an ever-expanding franchise, no, this needs to be cut off, retained for a few. The market, the free market, well, which has like non-zero-sum outcomes and no, like what you need is an unfair advantage. We need to favor ours, like enough of this free trade bullshit and enough of, you know. You know, Trump is a capitalist, but he’s not a free marketer. He doesn’t believe in the ideology of the market. Chris Hayes: No. John Ganz: He believes in getting an unfair advantage. Chris Hayes: That’s right. John Ganz: And the belief in, you know, these bounded communities that don’t have necessarily paths to infinitely expand except by, you know, force, taking over other people or bashing other people. So, you know, I think there’s an analogy, a structural analogy between, you know, the appeal to the family as a kind of basic unit of politics and society and that race, for example. It’s like you have to protect your own. It’s time to protect our own. You know, obviously in the context of the United States, which is a pluralistic society, it’s very difficult to make, you know, nationalism, although it has a has an appeal in the United States, is a hard fit because we don’t have a single ethnicity. We’ve always been a pluralistic country. But the rejection of this, that sort of patriotism that says our abstract fealty to ideals of equality and justice for all are what makes us American. No, something more elemental than that. Some bond that’s either racial, ethnic, familial, or just rejects the idea that there can be non-zero-sum outcomes. So you have to form -- Chris Hayes: Right. John Ganz: -- some kind of gang or association and get yours. Chris Hayes: That’s right. Or in the end, right, because there’s James Caan in The Godfather, you know, that you can join the gang. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: See, this this to me is the point and you write this in that Substack piece, that the appeal is that you can be inside our -- John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: -- and that you can get the unfair advantages and you can be on the inside of the -- John Ganz: Sure. Chris Hayes: And the gang is going to take on the people that you don’t like. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And that appeal, I think, is the opposite of a kind of universalist, pluralistic, liberal conception, but it has a lot of appeal. And in some ways, it’s elementally what we’re battling against. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And what’s key about that is that it is a little more universalist than the sheer racism of Duke, even though it has lots of those elements, because there are people who think they could be on the inside. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: That it leaves open the door for them to be on the inside. John Ganz: You can be on, you know, not to take the mafia analogy too seriously, but you know, you can be an associate of the mob and not a main man if you’re not a Sicilian, for example, right. Chris Hayes: Right. John Ganz: So you can have some kind of relationship with the enterprise, but you’re not going to be, you know, the center figure of it. So that’s one way of looking at it I suppose. You can be a friend of mine, but not a friend of ours. But yeah, I think that’s true and I think the struggle is that I think a lot of people, you know, the assumption is that in the failure of the revelation that capitalist society is extremely competitive and people fall through the cracks is not to create institutions of broad solidarity. Chris Hayes: No. John Ganz: It’s to create these -- Chris Hayes: To get yours. John Ganz: -- the institutions of what I call negative solidarity or following (inaudible), which is bounded groups that are created out of opposition to other groups. And you can have pluralism. You know, what’s interesting about this new nationalism across the world, it’s pluralistic to a certain degree internationally because there’s all these little, you know, different nation states, but it’s a hostile and toxic pluralism, right? It’s a war of all against all, not a oh, well, we all have different interests, but then, you know, through the wonderful workings of the market and liberal democracy, they come into concert somehow. This kind of rejects the possibility of civic peace in favor of a constant civic, ongoing kind of cold civil war, which might break out into more hostilities. So, you know, that connects it again to Rothbard’s old conception of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard also wrote about “The Godfather,” and he says mobsters are essentially anarcho-capitalists. That’s what my vision of an anarcho-capitalist society would be these kind of like family concerns that are self-regulating, but, you know, they have to take care of their own and there’s no bigger framework other than the meeting of these businesses in the kind of commission to do things. So it’s strange. It is a pluralistic vision, but it views a world of constant struggle and sometimes that’s understood to be different families fighting each other. Sometimes that’s understood to be different races fighting each other. And sometimes that’s understood to be individuals grasping for what they need. I think that the conservatives in this country, as their counter to socialism, used to provide the market as a potential utopian tool where if it was allowed to do its thing, you would get these wonderful outcomes based on its own internal operation. And essentially what I’m describing is right-wingers who don’t particularly believe in the magic of the marketplace, who recognize the competitive nature of capitalist society, but instead of saying, well, what do we do to obviate that, they want to create an order where you say, well, some people are the winners and some people are the losers. Chris Hayes: That’s right. John Ganz: And, you know, this is really interesting. I was recently reading for the first time, actually, “Wages of Destruction” by Adam Tooze, which is a great book about, you know, the Nazi economy. And it’s so fascinating to see how he talks about, well, we of course know that Hitler and the Nazis had this highly ideological racialized view of the world, but that was also their way of explaining Germany’s unique position in the global capitalist world and its struggles to compete with other countries, right? That was explained in racial terms. So these things kind of turn into each other and, you know, I think that that’s what’s happening, is essentially, you know, to go back to your earlier point about the material underpinnings of this, you know, I don’t know if I’m going to get in trouble for this on MSNBC. But, you know, as Mark said, you know, the rule of the market, the rule of law in a capitalist society is kind of just continuation in many ways of the rule of the jungle. And conservatives or market conservatives, market liberals say, no, that’s not really true. It’s not the rule of the jungle. These institutions work. And liberals and left liberals and social liberals say, well, it is a little bit, but we can mediate. We can soften that. I think this strand that I’m describing, the political phenomenon I’m describing says it is the law of the jungle and you’re going to be the biggest beast.

"Trump pushes his luck with new attack on Harris, China and Russia",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 7:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pushes-luck-new-attack-harris-china-russia-election-2024-rcna164482,"In her first week as an unexpected presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris confronted plenty of racist and sexist lines of attack, but as a Washington Post report makes clear, Donald Trump added to this record in an especially ugly way in his latest Fox News interview. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham started to ask the GOP candidate how international leaders would consider a Harris presidency, but before she could even finish asking, Trump interjected. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy. They look at her and they say, ‘We can’t believe we got so lucky.’” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Post the Republican nominee wasn’t referring to race or gender, and if you believe that, I have a lovely Trump University seminar I’d love to sell you. The obvious problem with the former president’s comments was that they were overtly offensive in ways even he should be able to understand. But there are plenty of less obvious problems, too. For one thing, Harris has spent the last four years in national office, meeting with international officials and leaving no doubt that she’s a force to be reckoned with. For another, if Trump is so convinced that international leaders will walk all over the Democrat, perhaps he could explain why he’s so afraid to share a debate stage with her. But perhaps most important is the degree to which Trump keeps failing tests of self-awareness. Indeed, if he’s looking for an American leader who wasn’t taken seriously abroad, Trump probably ought to find a mirror. In 2018, for example, he addressed the United Nations general assembly, where foreign diplomats literally laughed at him. China’s state-run media routinely characterized Trump — during his presidency — as a bumbling fool who had a habit of slapping himself in the face. Even U.S. allies quietly conceded that they perceived the then-president as an intemperate child with a short attention span. Let's also not forget about a 2019 international gathering in which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the U.K.'s Boris Johnson were overheard mocking Trump, treating him like a punch-line to a joke they found rather exasperating. Russia’s Vladimir Putin was more reluctant to ridicule Trump in public, but that’s only because he enjoyed walking all over the Republican and didn’t feel the need to put that advantage at risk. All of which is to say, Trump’s latest line of attack isn’t just ugly, and it isn’t just wrong. It’s also the latest example of the former president engaging in projection."
Reports of Project 2025’s demise have been greatly exaggerated,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 6:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/reports-project-2025s-demise-greatly-exaggerated-trump-election-2024-rcna164459,"A couple of weeks ago, Chris LaCivita, a leading member of Donald Trump’s political operation, publicly conceded that he considered Project 2025 a “pain in the ass” for the former president’s campaign. His candid assessment was understandable. As regular readers know, Democrats have spent much of the year letting the public know about the right-wing policy agenda crafted by the Heritage Foundation — with the assistance of several prominent Trump associates. Given the governing blueprint’s radical provisions on practically every area of public policy, Republicans have started to see Project 2025 as a political albatross. It was against this backdrop that NBC News reported yesterday: In theory, the developments might lead some to believe the Project 2025 fiasco has effectively run its course. The initiative appears to be ending its policy work, and former Trump administration personnel official Paul Dans who served as the director of Project 2025 is stepping down. In practice, it’s not nearly that simple. As Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign manager, explained in a statement, “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot. This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country. Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real — in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.” The core details of the Project 2025 controversy haven’t changed at all. The right-wing policy agenda was still co-authored by several dozen members of Team Trump. Trump’s running mate, Republican Sen. JD Vance, still wrote a highly provocative foreword to Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts’ forthcoming book. Trump still delivered a 2022 speech at a Heritage Foundation event and said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” It’s also still true that the GOP candidate more recently said he agrees with parts of the radical governing plan. Dans still told a right-wing podcast last year that his group has a “great” relationship with the former president and that “Trump’s very bought-in with this.” What’s more, as The New York Times’ Jonathan Swan explained online, it’s also still true that Team Trump hasn’t prepared for a post-election transition, and if the Republican ticket prevails, the president-elect will still rely heavily on Project 2025. As a practical matter, the latest developments about winding down the initiative matter very little. Indeed, for all intents and purposes, Project 2025 is wrapping up because it’s already done: The blueprint has been written, its Trump-aligned authors remain positioned to implement the plan if given the opportunity, and the threats posed by Project 2025’s objectives remain real."
"The problem(s) with Trump’s ugly rhetoric about Harris, antisemitism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-ugly-rhetoric-harris-antisemitism-jewish-election-2024-rcna164448,"Donald Trump seems determined to convince voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is antisemitic. She’s not, and the former president’s attacks are as ugly as they are false, but the Republican appears preoccupied with pushing this line anyway. During a speech last week, for example, the GOP nominee falsely said his likely Democratic rival is “totally against the Jewish people” — a curious claim about someone who’s married to a Jewish person — and as the Associated Press reported, Trump went even further yesterday. The former president seemed quite worked up on the issue, ranting that Harris dislikes both Israel and Jews — it’s something “everybody knows,” Trump said, reality notwithstanding — while adding that Jewish voters are “fools” to vote Democratic. The radio host, Sid Rosenberg, proceeded to say that Harris’ Jewish husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is “a crappy Jew” and “a horrible Jew.” And while Trump didn’t use those words himself, as an audio clip makes clear, he seemed to agree with the condemnations. A Politico report described the comments as ""bizarre."" A press statement from the Harris campaign, not surprisingly, went much further, describing the on-air exchange as “disgusting” and adding, “America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump.” At this point, we could spend a few paragraphs talking about how wrong the Republican’s attack is. We could also highlight the fact that Trump hasn’t even tried to substantiate his absurdities with evidence. But as important as those points are, I’m struck by a larger point: Trump apparently believes he has credibility when it comes to antisemitism, but he really doesn’t. As regular readers might recall, it was just four months ago, for example, when the GOP nominee invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel. To put it mildly, Jewish Democrats in Congress were not impressed. An Axios report quoted Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, for example, saying, “Trump demonstrates daily his lack of fitness for the presidency by spreading dangerous stereotypes and embracing antisemites.” Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina added that the former president’s rhetoric is “particularly disgraceful and dangerous at a time when Jews are facing dangerous levels of antisemitism nationwide.” Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland issued an especially pointed response, noting, “Luckily I don’t know any Jews who look to Donald Trump for advice on how to be Jewish. After all, this is the guy who saw ‘very fine people on both sides’ of an antisemitic riot and entertained the neo-Nazi Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes over at his house at Mar-a-Lago for dinner.” That larger pattern was of particular interest. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, “You’re not gonna support me because I don’t want your money. You want to control your politicians.” He added, “I’m a negotiator — like you folks.” Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met “in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.” While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their “loyalties.” Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council’s national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign. There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters “don’t love Israel enough,” dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago and arguing that Jews need to “get their act together” and “appreciate” Israel “before it is too late.” In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders “should be ashamed of themselves” over their “lack of loyalty.” Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker. In his earlier campaigns, Trump has struggled badly with Jewish voters. If he thinks lying about Harris will change that, the Republican probably ought to lower his expectations. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
‘Mountain Queen’: The greatest Everest climber you’ve never heard of,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 4:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/mountain-queen-greatest-everest-climber-ve-never-heard-rcna164065,"Lhakpa Sherpa has conquered seemingly impossible mountains all  her life — both literally and figuratively. And now, the 51 year old, who has climbed Mount Everest more than any other woman, is sharing her story in hopes of inspiring women and girls around the world to pursue their dreams and break glass ceilings. “Life can sometimes be very hard. It’s not easy…But you can’t give up. Good things can come from bad,” Sherpa told Know Your Value. Sherpa’s extraordinary life is chronicled in “Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa,” which will be released on Netflix on July 31. The documentary, directed by Lucy Walker, follows Sherpa on her tenth ascent of Mount Everest, when she was just shy of 50, as she attempted to break her own world record of summiting the tallest mountain above sea level. The film also tells the story of her unconventional upbringing. Sherpa, the daughter of yak farmers was born in a cave in Nepal. She was fascinated with climbing as a young girl, even though society did not approve of girls going to school, let alone climbing mountains. Still, she climbed (often disguising herself as a boy) and set world records. In the documentary, she tells the story of how she met her eventual husband, a Romanian climber named George Dijmarescu — and how that relationship imploded due to his drinking and abusive behavior. In interviews, Sherpa details leaving her husband with no money, in hopes of securing better future — particularly for her daughters. The film shows Sherpa living in Connecticut and working at Whole Foods to make ends meet. Even though she hadn't climbed in years, viewers watch a determined Sherpa return to Everest for a tenth time to redeem her life’s purpose and show her two teenage daughters that anything is possible. Know Your Value recently spoke to Sherpa and Walker about the film. Below is the conversation, which has been edited for brevity and clarity. Know Your Value: What was it about Lhakpa Sherpa's story that drew you in? Walker: In a word, everything. I love making character-driven narrative longitudinal documentaries, the kind where you can follow the arc of a life and see the forces that shape it at work, to glimpse the machinery of how a life unfolds. And the characters that I love to follow are the kind of superhuman people who have special reserves of qualities like creativity, grace, courage, and resilience — Lhakpa has all four of those. I love documentaries that are as cinematic, visually and dramatically and emotionally compelling, as any scripted Hollywood movie. And I love telling stories that haven’t been told before. Lhakpa is unique as a protagonist, in what she overcomes in her childhood and in her culture and in her marriage, and in her motivation to climb.  Know Your Value: What do you hope viewers — particularly women facing their own difficult times -- take away from Lhakpa’s story Walker: When Lhakpa was told “no”, she didn’t let that stop her. Her persistence, creativity and strength are magnificent to watch. Her story reads like a legend or a fairytale. Cutting off her hair to pass herself off as a boy in order to avoid arranged marriage and get a job on the mountain. Entering a running race to use the prize money to open a teahouse to support herself when she was an outcast as a young unwed mother, and spending years and years begging her customers to help her in her quest to become the first Nepali woman to summit and survive Everest, until, in what she describes as a moment of magic, one customer told her sure, come with me to the prime minister’s house, and the door to her future finally opened.  Know Your Value: Tell us about filming the current day scenes. Did you climb too? What were the biggest challenges? Walker: Filming on Everest is challenging but I was confident about exactly how to do it because of my experience making my film Blindsight, for which I directed shoots covering two expeditions, one of which went up all the camps of Everest and into the death zone in order to climb the mountain next to Everest on the Tibet side, a 23,000’ mountain coincidentally called Lhakpa. The breathtaking high altitude cinematography was captured by Matt Irving as well as by Lhakpa’s team of Sherpas who climbed with her. We gave everyone cameras and trained them because we wanted to see what shots they might see from their point of view. And I also knew that one camera and one cinematographer was not enough. We needed to be prepared in case the team split, or any one individual might have to descend at any time due to altitude illness etc. I think what is challenging is to keep focused on story and emotion and drama, even though the backdrop is so diverting. The landscape always needed to contribute to the narrative, and not vice versa. But in a way it was equally challenging to capture the intimate scenes of the family. I am especially overjoyed with the scenes with Lhakpa’s teenage daughters at the end of the movie, especially because of how distressed and traumatized Lhakpa’s elder daughter was feeling after all that they had been through. At the beginning of the movie Lhakpa’s daughters are barely speaking to her, even though she had dedicated her life to inspiring and empowering women and girls. But as Lhakpa returns from her quest to Everest to reclaim her legacy, she has inspired her very own daughters. It was very delicate filming them, as I felt very concerned for their well being and not wanting to push them past where they were ready to go. I think I pushed them just the right amount, and it’s remarkable to watch the girls heal and grow thanks to the inspiration of their mom.   Know Your Value: Why do you climb? What do you love about it? Sherpa: I grew up in the mountains and spent my childhood climbing. I wanted to explore.   I wanted to change my life.  I wasn’t educated in a school. The mountains are my school. I’ve been mountain educated and I want to finish my degree. The mountains are my doctor, my healer. They make me mentally and physically strong.   Know Your Value:  In the film we see you overcome many challenges — the physical and mental hardships of climbing to the top of Mount Everest, but also domestic abuse, being a single mom, and financial difficulties. What do you tell yourself when things get hard? How do you get through those times?  Sherpa: Life is a challenge. I was hurt from the divorce and you have to focus on the positive. You have to stay strong mentally and physically. We need the negative and positive to balance out our lives but we must focus on the positives. The mountains can also help heal. People will experience divorce, lose a business, suffer an illness…Nature can help you in a different way. Nature and happiness can love our body back. Nature is power. Nature can help you recover. Everyone is different. Some people will become a doctor, a lawyer, a pilot. Whatever it is that you want to do in life, even if it’s not easy. Keep doing it. You can reach the top of your Mt. Everest.  Know Your Value: Do you have another mountain you are hoping to climb? What’s your next challenge? I have a goal to climb the highest mountain in each of the 50 states. My daughters have come with me on some of the climbs already. We’ve done nine states so far. "
Why Trump targeted Christians with his darkest promise yet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/christian-nationalist-trump-speech-voting-rcna164091,"In a speech at the Turning Point USA Believers’ Summit on Friday, Donald Trump implored audience members to vote in the 2024 election, assuring them that, if he gets a second term, “it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” In four years, he reiterated, “you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham recognized the anti-democratic promise that his supporters “won’t have to vote anymore” had created problems for Trump. In an interview with the former president on Monday, she encouraged him to clarify his statement, yet he continued to repeat it multiple times. Taken together with the rest of Trump’s speech, in which he cast himself as a divinely protected savior of his supporters’ vision for America, and falsely portrayed Kamala Harris as a ruthless persecutor of patriotic believers, his doubling down on his promise to “fix” it sends an unambiguous message. It is the most definitive statement to date of his intention to implement the Christian nationalist autocracy sought by his most ardent believers. Trump made false claims that the Biden-Harris administration “weaponized” the government against Christians, and picked up on an attack circulating in right-wing media that Kamala Harris is anti-Catholic. That smear dates back to Harris’ time as senator and her 2018 questioning of Trump judicial nominee Brian Buescher. Harris had questioned whether Buescher’s membership in the Knights of Columbus, a fraternal Catholic organization that vociferously opposes reproductive and LGBTQ rights, would impede his impartiality as a judge. At the time, the pro-choice group Catholics for Choice defended Harris, arguing that the Knights of Columbus was no apolitical charity as conservatives claimed, but “brazenly used” its status “to pour money, effort and influence into political contests and policy debates.” When Harris ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primary, conservatives resurrected the questioning to charge that she had engaged in anti-Catholic bigotry. Since Harris announced her bid for the presidency last week, right-wing media has resuscitated this attack, even though Harris has served under Joe Biden, a committed Catholic. “She is without question one of the most aggressively anti-Catholic career politicians in American history,” wrote an editor for the conservative nonprofit CatholicVote. A staff writer for the Federalist claimed that “she has a long history of anti-Catholic bigotry that not only hurts pro-lifers but also faithful papists.” In his speech, Trump claimed Harris had “viciously attacked” judicial nominees because they were Catholic, and claimed she is “really militantly hostile toward Americans of faith.” He also claimed that Harris “wants to forcibly compel doctors and nurses against their will to give chemical castration, drugs to young children” and wants to force “every public school in America to let men into women’s and girls’ locker rooms.” In short, “the Harris agenda is an agenda for national destruction,” he said. “The Trump agenda is an agenda for national renewal and greatness.” These comments are particularly incendiary to an audience steeped in rhetoric that the Christian America that God intended is under siege from secular leftists. The Believers’ Summit was billed as “a testament to our commitment to see the body of Christ rise to its calling in this pivotal moment in history. We are dedicated to seeing believers not just defend their faith, but to put it into action, ultimately turning our nation towards the Lord.” Speakers included Christian nationalist author and revisionist historian David Barton, Christian right author and podcast host Eric Metaxas (also a prominent promoter of Trump’s stolen election lie) and Doug Wilson, the extremist pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Wilson explicitly promotes theocracy, or what he has called “a network of nations bound together by a formal acknowledgement of the lordship of Jesus Christ,” rejecting civil government as “demonic” and “satanic.” In the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump earlier this month, TPUSA’s founder, Charlie Kirk, promoted the claim — echoed in rightwing media and at the Republican National Convention — that Trump had been spared because he wore the “armor of God.” Kirk had picked up on a tweet from Jack Posobiec, who has called for the overthrow of democracy and declared anyone on the left “un-human,” claiming that God had protected Trump as an anointed figure in a cosmic battle between good and evil. On Friday, Trump thanked supporters for their prayers: “I stand before you tonight thanks to the power of prayer and the grace of almighty God.” To assure the audience that he would defend them from supposed persecution of Christians by the left, Trump reprised his promise to create “a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias and its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America.” This is another way of telling his followers that they will be able to impose their ideology — against abortion, against LGBTQ freedom, against anything they consider part of the “woke” or “globalist” agenda — on the grounds that freedom for others, whether in the bedroom, examination room or classroom, is “anti-Christian.” The question of just how literally to take Trump’s assurance that Christians “won’t have to vote anymore” is almost besides the point. Long before 2028, Trump is promising his supporters in the religious right that he will bring about the Christian nationalist government that they seek. And democracy is not a priority for those who would be “turning our nation to the Lord.” The triumphant rollout of Harris’s presidential campaign has left Trump and his allies running scared. But he’s also playing a dangerous game with a base that has been hearing a great deal of very hot rhetoric about godly versus demonic forces, and about their political adversaries being “un-human.” Trump is trying to capitalize on all this hate, casting it as a religious war, and hoping to ride it to authoritarian rule."
Simone Biles just proved she’s so much bigger than her sport,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 4:44 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/simone-biles-gymnastics-olympics-2024-score-team-usa-rcna164406,"UPDATE (August 1, 2024 2:50 p.m. E.T.): Simone Biles won her eighth Olympic gold medal in the Olympics all-around final Thursday, making her the most decorated U.S. gymnast of all time. A couple of weeks ago, ESPN put together a list of the top 100 athletes of the 21st century. It’s the sort of clickbait designed to get talking heads arguing during a long summer. And there’s plenty to debate — I’d say Kobe Bryant and Floyd Mayweather are too high and Diana Taurasi and Barry Bonds are too low — but what I found most fascinating about the list was its top 10. With a quarter of the century gone, only three are still active: Lionel Messi (No. 3), LeBron James (No. 4) and Simone Biles (No. 7). Everybody else designated the top of the top is retired. And with all due respect to Messi and LeBron, both are in the valedictory periods of their careers: Neither is the best player in his sport anymore, and their grandest accomplishments are behind them. But Biles? Well, Biles has a way of making you still feel like she’s just getting started.  On Tuesday, in a return to the Olympic women’s team final — the event she famously withdrew from four years ago after suffering from what she called “the twisties” — Biles helped lead Team USA to its fourth women’s team gold medal ever and its third in the last four Olympics. It was a joyous moment for Biles and her teammates and a very strong start to Biles’ so-called redemption tour after she took two years off in the wake of her Tokyo Games collapse. Team USA is back on the top of the world again. Which means, of course, Biles is, as well. It’s Biles’ fifth Olympic gold and the eighth Olympic medal of her career, which makes her the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history. (She already has more golds than any other U.S. gymnast in history.) She’s now only three medals behind track star Allyson Felix for the most non-swimming Olympic medals in U.S. history. She also has three more chances this Olympics, in the vault, the balance beam and the floor exercise, to add to her total. Indeed, her floor routine is perhaps the most anticipated event of these whole Olympics. And that’s just her Olympic titles. When you add in world championships, she has a total of 38 medals, making her the most decorated gymnast in the history of the sport. The numbers keep going up. The numbers get so high, in fact, that they almost become difficult to comprehend. Biles’ withdrawal in Tokyo and subsequent mental health break was rightly praised as an unusually brave and honest response from a star athlete. But they shouldn’t overshadow just how truly incredible, and wholly dominant, an athlete she really is. Biles has ruled her sport in a way that no one in any sport has for more than a decade now. And here she is, still doing it. Biles is the oldest gymnast, at 27, to win a gold medal since 1964. (That’s another record she’s likely to break later this week.)  The closest parallel you can find to Biles may be Michael Jordan, who, after winning his third NBA title, famously took a nearly two-year break from the league to play baseball in the wake of his father’s murder. But ultimately, Biles has a story like no other. Besides talking openly and eloquently about mental health struggles, she has also shared her own heartbreaking experience as a victim of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. This is someone who experienced the unthinkable and not only survived it, but thrived — all while speaking out and empowering others to do the same. And she is, of course, not done. She will remain the story of these Games for the next fortnight, and, despite her advanced age (in gymnastics terms, anyway), she hasn’t yet spoken of retirement in any concrete terms. She’s the No. 9 athlete on ESPN’s top 100 — right now. But everything she does this week, and surely in the weeks and months and years to come, will keep pushing her up. Simone Biles is like nothing we have ever seen. She is literally unprecedented."
Wayne Brady gives an important lesson on the power of vulnerability,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/wayne-brady-reality-show-vulnerable-black-masculinity-rcna164055,"“Wayne Brady: The Family Remix,” a reality show documenting the lives of comedian Wayne Brady and his blended family — the second episode of which drops Wednesday — subverts mainstream representations of masculinity by centering expressions of male vulnerability and sexual fluidity. The Freeform series will explore, among other things, Brady’s journey of coming out as pansexual and how this forces him to confront and challenge his own internalized oppressive ideas of what it means to be a Black man.  I want to say up front, I am not a cisgender man nor am I Black. So my reflections on these themes are only relevant insofar as I have my own lived experience as a pansexual/queer man of color. I know what it’s like to be situated in a space of racial alterity and the many ways that complicates my relationship to my masculinity and sexuality, but pansexual/queer men of color are not a monolith. While I do not know what it’s like to be a Black cis man (which itself includes a near infinite range of lived experiences), I can offer reflections only as someone who’s read exhaustively about and has personally navigated some of the themes this show foregrounds.   The first episode was largely framed around Brady coming out to his friends Joe Nickson and Vincent Bragg, co-founders of the elite advertising agency ConCreates. Nickson and Bragg, who both identify as straight, were formerly incarcerated (primarily employing currently or formerly incarcerated people at their agency) — and Brady describes how coming out to them feels like a litmus test for how people within his circle might respond to the news.  Brady invites the duo over to his house for a meal with his family. Immediately, the viewer is offered a version of masculinity — specifically, Black masculinity — which both normalizes and embraces vulnerability.  “Honesty is me telling you what you ask me … Vulnerability is me volunteering that information,” Bragg says to the group. “I go to therapy twice a week, I’ve been to prison — that’s me volunteering information that you would not be able to see on me in a regular conversation. That’s me being vulnerable ‘cause now you can judge me. Vulnerability and masculinity — those two things go together, actually.” Brady connects this to his experience of fatherhood. “We are not taught ‘my vulnerability can be an asset.’ I know that I wasn’t taught that because my dad wasn’t around to be able to teach me. So I’m now tryna play catch up at 51 years. So, vulnerability is definitely something you have to learn and embrace.”  Nickson shares that his experience with fatherhood, and co-parenting specifically, has demanded he interrogate a lot of the same notions — and that observing Brady’s now convivial relationship with the partner (Jason Michael Fordham) of his ex-wife (Mandie Taketa) prompted him to ask: “What is masculinity and when do I divorce my ego?” Journalist, public health advocate, therapist and political commentator Araya Baker, whose work focuses on anti-oppressive frameworks, has written about Black toxic masculinity as a deeply embedded and necessary survival mechanism that leaves little room for vulnerability. “Beginning with slavery, America’s sociopolitical structures and institutions have upheld a racially stratified, patriarchal class system that, to varying degrees, has oppressed everyone except wealthy white men,” Baker wrote in The Mighty. “This reality, coupled with a desperation to escape racialized poverty, left Black men with no other choice but to attempt assimilating into the dominant culture.” While I subscribe more to bell hooks’ analyses of patriarchal masculinity as a violence enacted against all men — something I’ve written about before — it is unquestionable that men with less privilege and who are subjected to greater levels of oppression experience this kind of cultural violence to greater degrees. I’ve witnessed, first hand, Pakistani men in my family internalize deeply harmful expressions of white supremacist and patriarchal masculinity for the sake of assimilation or, in their case, survival. And this is precisely what makes the show’s representation of masculinity, inextricably bound with vulnerability, so exigent and perhaps even profound.   “I’m still struggling with this s---,” Brady says later, as he comes out to Nickson and Bragg. “Because of talking about the issues of, oh, how people see you and masculinity and all that stuff. Everybody has f------ s--- to say. But I’m not going to be unhappy 'cause I’m not living my truth, and there’s been a lot of shame around it.” Bragg responds to Brady’s news by describing how he started his business after getting out of prison — by leaning into his experience as someone who was incarcerated, rather than obscuring it, and by only concerning himself with the people with whom he had authentic connections and mutual support. “So, there’s 8 billion people on the earth,” he says. “I don’t need 8 billion people to f--- with me. … In order for me to get where I’m goin’, I just need my people.” Bragg’s response both defies Brady’s anxieties and offers a type of instantaneous receptiveness, which is rare.   Reality television, whether we love it or hate it and whether or not we want to admit it, has cultural significance in terms of how it reifies gender roles — most often promoting regressive representations of gender. “[T]aking reality TV seriously also means holding it accountable for its frequent awfulness,” Judy Berman, TIME’s TV critic wrote in 2022. “Shows are still edited to reinforce stereotypes, from the vapid blonde to the angry Black person to the sassy gay man.” This is to say nothing of the “gender essentialism” propagated by ubiquitous (hetero) dating shows, she adds.  Given this, I am prone to taking reality TV and its reductive narrative and character constructions with a grain of salt. And, at the same time, I don’t discount it when this genre of television — with its significant cultural impact (le sigh) — offers us something with a little more nuance and a little more humanity, just as “The Family Remix” seeks to do.

What to watch for in Arizona’s primaries Tuesday night,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 2:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/arizona-2024-primary-races-to-watch-rcna164331,"Arizona is holding its nonpresidential primaries Tuesday, and there are several races to watch. Here are some of the ones I’m keeping an eye on. Last year, I referred to the race in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District — a seat being vacated by Rep. Debbie Lesko, a far-right Republican — as a “Mr. MAGA pageant.” And the GOP candidates — Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh, in particular — have really made that look like a great call as they’ve competed for MAGA voters’ affection in the deep-red district. This race is interesting because, as my MSNBC colleague Steve Benen wrote for the MaddowBlog, Hamadeh initially received former President Donald Trump’s sole endorsement. But just this week, Trump came out and also endorsed Masters, who’s a protégé of Peter Thiel’s — just like Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. The race for Maricopa County recorder — the Phoenix area’s top elections official — has come into focus as Trump allies have spread election falsehoods about Stephen Richer, the GOP incumbent. Richer is running in the GOP primary against state Rep. Justin Heap and Don Hiatt, who have both tried to sow distrust in the integrity of elections in Arizona. A win Tuesday for Richer, who has garnered bipartisan praise for standing up to election deniers, seems like the best way to keep a Republican in the recorder’s office. A victory by Heap or Hiatt could open the door for the Democratic candidate, Timothy Stringham, to win in November. I’ll also be watching the packed Democratic primary in Arizona’s 1st Congressional District. The district is currently represented by Rep. David Schweikert, and Democrats see the beleaguered Republican’s seat as one of the most vulnerable in Congress due to his ethics scandals. This is a district that I felt Democrats foolishly neglected in 2022, so the winner of this primary will have another shot at it. Former Arizona Democratic Party Chair Andrei Cherny appears to be in pole position, but recent polling showed the race as tight. Failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake seems likely to win her race against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in Arizona’s GOP primary for a U.S. Senate seat. But if she does, the margin could tell a deeper story. Lake has turned off Arizona Republicans, at times, particularly due to her attacks on fellow Republicans. If she merely ekes out a win, it could indicate weak Republican support for Lake — which certainly wouldn’t be ideal ahead of a general election matchup against the Democratic candidate, Rep. Ruben Gallego, who’s running unopposed in his primary."
The underhanded fraud that helped create ‘N Sync and the Backstreet Boys,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 2:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-dirty-pop-documentary-lou-pearlman-nsync-backstreet-boys-rcna163507,"Netflix’s limited docuseries “Dirty Pop,” which debuted Wednesday, chronicles how Lou Pearlman, the man who put together the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, also put together one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history. Additionally, the Netflix series documents how the bands were started using dirty money — and how their success subsequently helped Pearlman build a house — really, an empire — of cards, through which he defrauded everyone from elderly couples investing their life savings to the Bank of America. Pearlman, who in 2008 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for a $300 million Ponzi and bank fraud scheme, died in prison in August 2016 at age 62. He had pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, money laundering and presenting or using a false claim in a bankruptcy proceeding. The docuseries is a compelling watch, especially for millennials like me whose glee at the never-before-seen footage of the boy bands will likely be followed by the crushing realization that we’re getting old. But it’s a very clever way into a story of financial crimes, which can run the risk of being dry and hard to follow.  “Dirty Pop” uses the rise of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync — including interviews with some of its members — to tell a captivating and complicated story of how Pearlman created decadeslong careers and irrevocably shaped the zeitgeist, as he ruined lives at the same time. More than anything, it probes the underbelly of unfettered late-stage capitalism, implicitly reminding its viewers that it's built on exploitation and preys on the most vulnerable. The docuseries paints the portrait of a man who seemed to have an uncanny talent for homing in on people who were vulnerable — and therefore ripe for exploitation — and could help him advance his fraudulence. The absurdity of it is itself a critique of the economic system Pearlman gamed. For instance, he started a blimp rental company, but, strangely, nearly every blimp crashed. “It was almost a joke … of people talking about how all the blimps crashed,” Melissa Moylan, Pearlman’s artist representative, says. In the series, Michael Johnson, a member of Natural, yet another boy band Pearlman started, describes the crashing blimps as an “insurance scheme” and said Pearlman used the insurance proceeds to bankroll the creation of Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.  As for his creation of those two boy bands, Pearlman famously told a writer for The New Yorker: “My feeling was, where there’s McDonald’s, there’s Burger King, and where there’s Coke there’s Pepsi, and where there’s Backstreet Boys there’s going to be someone else. Someone’s going to have it; why not us?” So instead of letting someone else create competition for Backstreet Boys, he created 'N Sync, his own Pepsi, himself. “Lou would always have people watch us perform,” Chris Kirkpatrick of 'N Sync says, “It was, ‘Oh, these are Lou’s friends. Gotta schmooze them up.’ I didn’t realize that they were all these investors.” And this was how the boy bands unwittingly became part of Pearlman’s game — he created the longest running Ponzi scheme in American history, which, according to the documentary, spanned more than 30 years. (That’s slightly longer than some reporting has indicated.) The bands’ success helped Pearlman create an image of himself as a music mogul, when, in fact, the opposite was true. He had reportedly struck a bad business deal with record label BMG in a moment of desperation, to get them to sign Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. It was a deal that supposedly left Pearlman with hardly any money — but he made up the difference by defrauding people. Over those 30 years, he stole hundreds of millions of dollars. And the absurdity intensifies over the course of the series. The meat of his Ponzi scheme came through an Employee Investment Savings Account, which was purportedly FDIC-insured and backed by AIG and Lloyd’s of London. He sold this under his company Trans Continental Airlines. Come to find out, he forged all the paperwork, from bank statements to FDIC documents — and that even a photo used in the brochure touting the success of Trans Continental Airlines, which featured one of its fine planes taking off, was actually a picture of a model plane being held up in front of a runway, the documentary depicts. The hand holding the model plane was cropped out.  The FBI raided Pearlman's home and offices in 2007, leading to his guilty plea and 25-year prison sentence — a length of time that was practically unheard of then for financial crimes.  The lives destroyed by Pearlman’s fraud offer their own kind of commentary on the tenuousness of capitalism. It is a system so unregulated and unfettered that it becomes a breeding ground for people like Pearlman and Bernie Madoff, ripe for exploitation. The lack of social safety nets and the desperation this creates reminds us of the extent to which capitalism strips us of our humanity. In the documentary, one retiree, whose life savings were lost after she and her husband invested $300,000 in Pearlman’s so-called Employee Investment Savings Account, tearfully looks at the camera and says that at the time that she’d rather not wake up the next day because she didn’t know where her next dollar will come from. The documentary also suggests that the death of Pearlman’s longtime friend and employee Frankie Vazquez Jr., who died by suicide in 2006, was linked to the devastation Vazquez experienced when he unearthed the truth. His own mother, a former school teacher, the documentary says, had invested in Pearlman.  The end of the docuseries is devoted to creating some kind of duality — Pearlman took so much away, but also gave so much, its interviewees suggest. But, as usual, it was the most vulnerable who lost the most. And that is to say nothing of the sense of personal devastation many of those who were close to him felt after they learned Pearlman was a con artist. “And it’s only now that I can look back at that, and [see] that’s the f---ing monster … That’s the monster that was my best friend,” says a tearful Johnson. An equally apt name for the series — and unfettered capitalism? “Quit Playing Games (With My Heart).”"

The ghost of Antonin Scalia might like a word with Trump on flag-burning,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-flag-burning-antonin-scalia-stupid-rcna163688,"Donald Trump told Fox News that “stupid people” would argue that punishing people for desecrating the American flag is unconstitutional. One notable figure who’d fail Trump’s constitutional test is Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice revered by conservatives whose seat Trump filled with his first high-court appointee, Neil Gorsuch. The subject came up in the context of people burning flags at protests of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congressional address in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. Trump said on “Fox & Friends”: “I think you should get a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American flag. Now, people will say, ‘Oh, it’s unconstitutional.’ Those are stupid people.” (Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s poised to run against Trump in November’s presidential election, issued a statement condemning flag-burning, Hamas and antisemitism but didn’t call for jailing flag burners.) The Supreme Court addressed the issue in the 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. Liberal Justice William Brennan wrote the 5-4 majority opinion, joined by Scalia, that said: “After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest, Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in violation of Texas law. This case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent with the First Amendment. We hold that it is not.” And while Scalia would have disagreed with Trump’s legal judgment, the justice was a proto-Trumpian type who likely would have agreed with the former president’s instinct. Indeed, Scalia later said in public remarks that “If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag. But I am not king.” That was before the Supreme Court’s recent immunity ruling for Trump that did make presidents more like kings. But that doesn’t change the constitutionality of flag-burning — at least until the Supreme Court says so.

Biden's remarks showed he's a man of character. The same can't be said for Trump.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 2:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-speech-oval-office-address-nation-rcna163623,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 25 episode of ""Morning Joe."" ""Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from the modest beginnings of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States. But here I am."" Those were the words of Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday — the president of the United States.  There was no bitterness, no resentment, no self-pity in his voice, or in his presentation. His family sat to the left of the Resolute Desk, his wife and his children, as he gave that address – as he walked into history. History these days doesn’t move like a clock, it moves like a stopwatch, it’s so fast. The speed of history is frightening sometimes, and he is now part of history. Always will be.  He spoke with his family right there but part of it seemed to me that he was speaking to the American family, as well. During the speech, he asked the question: ""Does character in public life still matter?” Well, I would submit that it does. And I would submit that on Wednesday, you saw a portrait of character in the president of the United States.  Going forward, I think his place in history is well-sealed by his presidency, by the accomplishments of his presidency, and by his withdrawal from the presidency. You can only imagine how difficult it is for anyone to give up such power. We can’t really imagine it because we’ve never held power in our hands the way the president of the United States does.  We’ve seen what happens when a president misuses power. We’ve seen what happens when a sitting president refuses to cede power. And now, America has been given an object lesson in character and history by a man proclaiming: Here I am, Joe Biden, behind the Resolute Desk, ceding power."
A political violence scholar explains what's at stake after the Trump shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 1:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-shooter-rcna162412,"Pennsylvania man Thomas Crooks’ attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump on July 13 rattled the nation. The attempt on Trump’s life, and the shocking spectacle it generated, has raised fears about the increasing hostility in our political atmosphere, with violent rhetoric seeping into the mainstream. There are also questions of whether the act could inspire future copycats or aggressive counterprotests. In this particular instance, some of the long-term fallout of the shooting may hinge on the motive of the shooter, which investigators and authorities are still having enormous trouble identifying. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress on Wednesday that the bureau’s investigation has not “yielded significant clues.” Another factor in whether this fades or sticks as a momentous event is how different political movements and parties react to it. While President Joe Biden and Democrats uniformly condemned violence as unacceptable, a number of Republicans attributed Crooks’ act to Democratic rhetoric, despite not knowing what motivated Crooks and the fact that Democrats have not called for political violence. What remains to be seen is how people interpret it in the long term. To get a better understanding of what happened and how to think about it, I called up Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, whom I've interviewed before about America's growing problem with political violence. We discussed the possible motives behind the shooter’s actions, what makes political violence lead toward more large-scale conflict — like civil war — and how we as a society can turn the temperature down to prevent a spiral into chaos. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Zeeshan Aleem: It seems that investigators and reporters have had trouble so far identifying the ideology of the shooter. How should we think about how to interpret the event? Lilliana Mason: We don’t know what this guy was thinking. He could’ve been a school shooter type that’s sad and looking for attention. But it was political violence to the extent that it was violence at a political event targeting the leader of one of our two political parties. And so whether or not he meant it to be political violence, it’s going to be taken by people as political. One thing that I worried about immediately was whether it would be taken up — as JD Vance did — as “they did this to us.” I have a lot of research with my co-author Nathan Kalmoe showing that if you ask partisans — people who identify with one party or usually vote for it — whether political violence is OK, 10% to 20% say that it could be. But then if you ask them, “What if the other party is violent first, then would it be OK to use violence?” And then the numbers really skyrocket. In earlier data that we had from 2020, we saw them go up to around 40% of people saying it would be OK if the other side did it first. I was looking at data from June that we just got in, and actually on that one it was even more disturbing: It went up to basically 60% of people saying, “If they started it, then political violence would be OK.”  Could you expand on what a school shooter type means and how that might be significant? Mason: A “school shooter” can do violence anywhere. It’s horrible that we even have a word for this, right? It’s only in America that we have this word. This guy was very young. He was not even old enough to drink, and in the last election he was 16; this would have been his first election voting for president. It sounds like he was relatively isolated and troubled, and his politics were confusing. He was a registered Republican. [He also donated $15 to a Democratic organization via Act Blue.] We just don’t know. If there was an ideological reason, then it really fits firmly in the category of political violence that he wanted Trump to die because Trump was dangerous or because he didn’t like his platform. But if it’s more on the school shooter end of the spectrum, he may have targeted Trump because, for example, he wanted be famous, and was maybe already suicidal and this was his chosen way to go. The Reagan shooter was not ideological. It wasn’t because he hated Reagan necessarily. It was because he wanted Jodie Foster to pay attention to him. Some right-wingers claim that Trump’s shooting was an outcome of describing Trump as an existential threat to democracy. What’s your response? Mason: It’s possible that framing this as an existential election encourages violence in the sense that violence tends to emerge when we don’t believe that we have remedies within the system, right? That’s when we do protests; we engage in an anti-system way. But if we believe that we have remedies within the system, like voting, then we don’t need to engage in violence.  But what that ignores is that the Republican Party also thinks this is an existential election and that, if Biden wins, we will descend into socialism and communism and whatever else they think. It’s not being framed as an existential election just from the Democratic side. And the other thing is that Trump being the victim of this really overshadows the extent to which Trump himself has encouraged violence since the beginning of his 2016 campaign. He encourages it at his rallies — when people are violent on his behalf, he doesn’t condemn it. He didn’t ask the Jan. 6 people to stop until hours after they had already done all the damage they could do. He made fun of the violent attack on [former House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi’s husband. What does history and social science tell us about the possible repercussions of a presidential assassination attempt? In the 1960s there were a lot of assassinations and also assassination attempts. I think the 60s is a really good analogy to today in the sense of social upheaval, a lot of social progress, previously marginalized groups claiming their power back, and that was very disruptive for the traditional social hierarchy. The difference between the 60s and today is that the political parties didn’t take sides on that divide in the 60s. There were both more progressive and more conservative people in both the Democratic and the Republican parties, and so it didn’t pit the parties against each other on this really volatile topic. Now that we have Republicans as the party of “Let’s go back to the traditional hierarchy” and the Democrats as the party of “We still need to make more progress toward equality,” we’re going into the voting booth thinking about this. That means that the elections themselves and transitions of power feel more existential because they’re related to who belongs in America. It’s related to questions of like “which racial group is best” and “which religion is best” —  these are not things we’re supposed to bring into the voting booth. We’re supposed to find the people that represent our families, and bring us material well-being, and that our pocketbook likes, but instead, our politics are now arranged around who gets to live with the full dignity of being an American. We know that there’s political science that’s shown that in other countries, when politics is divided along racial or ethnic or religious lines, the chance of civil war increases 12 times, because those types of divides are uncompromisable. What’s the best way to turn down the temperature right now in terms of preventing escalatory spirals and worst-case scenarios? Mason: It requires all of the leaders on both sides to reject violence. One thing that my co-author Nathan and I found for our book was that it’s pretty easy to get people to back off of approving of political violence. You just have them read a quote from either Trump or Biden saying that’s not acceptable, that “we don’t do that in a democracy, and if you are going to engage in violence, I don’t want you on my team.” Reading two sentences from a leader in our survey experiment made people back off. It’s really important to note that leaders have a really powerful role to play. And we’ve heard that from Biden and from some Republicans, but we haven’t heard it from Trump or Vance. And so the problem is the people who need to be turning down the temperature are unwilling to turn down the temperature. They have the power to, but they’re not using it. I have seen some people sort of worrying about the possibility of mass violence or civil war. As a researcher on violence, how do you strike the balance between telling people to be concerned about things, but also not catastrophizing, since political violence is a reality across human history and doesn’t necessarily always slide into something like civil war?  Thank you for asking that. I think it’s really important to pay attention to political violence, but it’s also important to remember that it is still exceedingly rare. We have a lot of threats, but not as many actions. And the number of acts of political violence are very, very few. As long as that’s the case, it’s really important for Americans to do their part as citizens and not turn their back on democracy because they’re afraid. This shouldn’t be meant to scare people out of voting or going to their voting places, or even volunteering at their polling places, right? The people that run our elections are mainly volunteers. They are dedicated to democracy. They’re absolutely heroic and brave and they are committed. If people get afraid that everything is violent, then they might withdraw from participating and having their voices heard. And we don’t want that to happen. "
Michigan bans gay and trans 'panic' as a criminal defense,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 1:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/michigan-gay-trans-panic-defense-ban-whitmer-rcna163687,"Michigan became the 20th state on Tuesday to bar defendants from using a so-called gay or trans ""panic"" defense in court. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation, House Bill 4718, that bans the use of a victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity in defense arguments. Supporters of the bill have said that these defenses play into anti-gay and anti-trans biases and reinforce the belief that LGBTQ lives have less value. The bill passed the state House along party lines, but four Republicans in the state Senate voted with Democrats to green-light the bill. State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, who sponsored the bill, said in a statement through Whitmer's office on Tuesday that the legislation is ""a huge step toward securing a safe and inclusive state for all Michiganders."" The law goes into effect in October. According to a 2021 report from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, no state in the U.S. “recognizes the gay and trans panic defenses as free-standing defenses under their respective penal codes.” Rather, they have been used to support arguments of provocation, diminished capacity, insanity or self-defense. W. Carsten Andresen, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Edward’s University in Austin, wrote in 2020 that his early analysis determined that such defenses can reduce a defendant's murder charges about one-third of the time. Andresen told The Washington Post this week that he has found more than 700 instances of the defense being used in murder cases since 1970, including 18 in Michigan. The American Bar Association urged local and federal governments in 2013 to take legislative action to curtail gay and trans panic defenses. California became the first state to ban the practice in 2014 and dozens of states followed suit, but efforts to outlaw such defenses at the federal level have faced challenges, as The Appeal reported in 2021."
Republicans want to sow doubt about Kamala's Blackness. Here's why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-not-black-enough-propaganda-rcna163691,"Republicans can’t keep their bigoted stories straight on Kamala Harris’ Blackness. In recent days, several Republicans have attacked Harris as a “DEI hire,” suggesting her race (and potentially her gender) is the only reason she’s positioned to take over the Democratic nomination. Less prominent — but no less insidious — are the right-wing social media influencers and other anti-immigrant types who are fueling claims that Harris somehow isn’t Black enough.  Influencers like former Republican House candidate Laura Loomer and right-wing pundit Eric Erickson have sought to use Harris’ Indian and Jamaican heritage to suggest Harris — an HBCU-educated Black woman who’s been clear in identifying herself as such — isn’t actually a Black American or can’t relate to the so-called Black experience. Or take for example a particularly rich clip of right-wing commentator Nikki Stanzione telling Black voters “she’s not one of you” (forgive me if I don’t take Stanzione’s guidance on who is and isn’t Black). Similar claims are also being promoted by social media accounts linked to the ADOS movement, which purports to represent ""American Descendants of Slaves"" and which I’ve written about previously for its xenophobic rhetoric toward immigrants. This tired, ahistorical smear against Harris is designed to drive a wedge between Black people, and the social media campaign echoes one that was deployed against her in the lead-up to the 2020 election. The Wall Street Journal conducted a study in 2019 that found these claims about Harris not being Black were largely fueled by bot-like social media accounts and far-right influencers, from Donald Trump Jr. to the extremist activist Ali Alexander.  “Now, as in 2020, users frequently claim Harris isn’t Black enough or Indian enough to claim those identities,” disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz wrote for MSNBC this week. Jankowicz’s op-ed explores the racist, xenophobic and sexist propaganda targeting Harris in the context of the larger trend of attacks on women in politics, and it provides a noteworthy example of a Russia-based propagandist spreading a similar claim.  It’s important to see how these attacks align with the ways in which Donald Trump’s campaign and its allies have tried to win over Black voters: by suggesting they’re at odds or in competition with immigrants. This is the background for the widely denounced — and patently false — claim that Trump made during the first presidential debate that immigrants are taking “Black jobs.” Having extremely online trolls frame Harris as insufficiently Black, not Black at all or incapable of crafting pro-Black policies because of her immigrant background only serves Republican interests.  Keep this in mind as you scroll and post online."
JD Vance’s 'cat lady' video was the last straw for Jennifer Aniston. She's not alone.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT / Updated July 25, 2024, 12:44 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jennifer-aniston-jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless-cat-lady-rcna163674,"Jennifer Aniston, Kamala Harris and women across America are getting really sick of the GOP's bizarre, misogynistic insults. In the aftermath of President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the  2024 presidential race, Democrats have quickly united behind his vice president. In one day, Harris raised a record-breaking $81 million, and more than 28,000 people signed up to volunteer for her campaign. By Monday evening she had secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee.  Across the aisle, the Republican Party is scrambling to pivot a presidential campaign that was focused heavily on Biden and his age. Republican nominee Donald Trump (and his team) have spent a lot of time on social media platform Truth Social trying out numerous “names” for and various attacks against his likely opponent, including “Lying’ Kamala.” Conservatives have argued Harris’ laugh “turns off voters,” claimed “people don’t view her as Black,” thrown around labels like the “DEI” candidate, and  have threatened erroneous legal action to keep Harris off the November ballot.  But one of the more ridiculous attacks to emerge against Harris is the claim that she is not “fit” to lead the country because she’s not a biological mom. In a recently resurfaced clip of then-Senate candidate JD Vance speaking to Tucker Carlson in 2022, Trump’s newly minted 2024 running mate calls Harris a “childless cat lady” who, like other child-free women, ""are miserable at their own lives and the choices they have made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Vance also argued, as have other conservatives, that in order to have a vested interest in America and its future, you have to give birth — a stance that is equal parts insulting and hilariously false.  Vance’s comments have gone understandably viral, with Jennifer Aniston weighing in Wednesday on social media. “All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” she wrote on Instagram. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Aniston has had to deal throughout her entire career with speculation about why she does not have children. In 2022, the “Friends” icon told Allure that she had tried IVF, unsuccessfully. Vance voted against a Senate bill that would have protected IVF. Aniston’s response highlighted the hypocrisy of Vance’s comments. But they are also cruel. To be clear, Harris is herself the proud mom to two stepchildren — Ella and Cole Emhoff — and has been since she married their father, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, in 2014. Like the 4 in 10 Americans who have at least one step-relative in their family, Harris and her blended family know there are a myriad ways to create, and love, a family — a vaginal or C-section birth is not a requirement. Conservative pundit Will Chamberlain disagrees. “Really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn’t be President. No Children,” Chamberlain posted on X. “And no, becoming a step-parent to older teenagers doesn’t count. The concerns of parents and families will always be abstract to her.”  Chamberlain went on to say that he wants “a president with skin in the game, a stake in the future, and the lived experience of raising children.”  Chamberlain and Vance seem to be on the same page. “You have Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance said in his 2022 Carlson interview, ignoring the fact that, like Harris, Buttigieg has two children. “How does that make any sense when we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t have a direct stake in it?” Far-right political activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer — whom Trump has embraced — also made the same argument this week, while simultaneously accusing Harris of terminating past pregnancies (Harris has never said she had an abortion) and pushing the lie that having an abortion causes infertility (it does not, abortion is 14 times safer than childbirth).   Just like with small children throwing tantrums, I understand why some people may think it’s best just to ignore such baseless, asinine attacks. And yet we’ve all seen the damage that can be done when extreme rhetoric goes unchecked.  The truth is, fear and concern for the future is one of the many reasons why people are now deciding to prolong or avoid having children altogether. In 2023, 13 studies conducted between 2012 and 2022 involving over 10,000 participants in numerous countries, found that climate change concerns are associated with “less positive attitudes towards reproduction and a desire or intent for fewer children or none at all.” Meanwhile, child-free politicians are among the many leaders working hard to make the future better for the next generation of Americans. They have helped spearhead efforts to help reduce the maternal mortality crisis, expand the child tax credit and universal free lunch, and policies that protect immigrant families. Here’s another data point for Vance and co. In 2020, half of all eligible youth voted in the presidential election — an 11-point increase from the previous election in 2016. Did all of these young people have children? Certainly not. And yet they showed up to the polls. Because obviously, a lack of biological offspring does not determine your level of investment in America. Perhaps this logic makes sense for a political party that prioritizes vengeance, victimhood and selfishness over equality.   Or maybe this is just another example of Republicans grasping at straws after being out-politicked by an 81-year-old man who (eventually) put party, country and democracy over his ego.  Either way, we can be sure Harris will face an onslaught of racist and sexist attacks between now and November, all designed to undermine her as a person, a politician and a parent. But like so many of her fellow moms, the de facto Democratic nominee for president knows how to ignore these childlike tantrums — all the way to the White House. "
"In his attacks on the ‘childless’ left, JD Vance once hyped a plan to give parents more votes",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jd-vance-parents-more-votes-childless-rcna163670,"A viral clip on social media shows Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, proposing that people with children be given more voting power than people without kids. On the heels of widespread denunciation of Vance’s past condemnation of Democratic leaders as “childless cat ladies,” the footage underscores the Ohio senator’s ire toward people without children. But there’s more to the story. The clip is from a 2021 speech that Vance gave to a conservative organization called the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. At one point, Vance offered up an unusual idea about voting: The reason I said there’s more to the story than Vance’s disdain for childless people is this proposal also epitomizes the Republican Party’s growing embrace of openly antidemocratic policies. As The Federalist noted at the time, Vance’s remarks — in which he also said that people without children have “no physical commitment to the future of this country” — came amid his praise for Hungary’s far-right authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán, who’s seen as a hero among Trumpian Republicans. In fact, as The Guardian noted back in 2011, Orbán’s Fidesz party proposed the controversial idea but the legislation didn’t pass. Per The Guardian: The Guardian notes that the proposal is known as “Demeny voting” because of demographer Paul Demeny, who popularized the idea in the 1980s. Demeny’s work is known for its obsessive focus on fertility rates and immigration and has been criticized by researchers, who have associated it with historical racist rhetoric aimed at curtailing immigration. If you read my Tuesday Tech Drop last week, you know promoting ideas from such figures is nothing new for Vance. So, yes, Vance’s remarks about voting put his cruelty toward childless people on display. But they also demonstrated his aversion to democracy — and his disturbing embrace of theories promoted by Orbán's far-right political party."
"Against election backdrop, economic growth exceeds expectations",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 12:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-backdrop-economic-growth-exceeds-expectations-rcna163704,"During the Republican National Convention last week, each night had its own theme, starting with “Make America Wealthy Again” on the party gathering’s first day. As it turns out, however, voters won’t have to put the White House in the GOP’s hands to achieve such a goal. NBC News reported: The latest data is roughly in line with the kind of quarterly GDP reports we saw across much of Donald Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency — when Republicans said Americans saw the greatest economy in the history of humanity. In fact, all of this comes against a backdrop of the 2024 election cycle, as the former president and his allies try to convince the public that the economy is dreadful, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, circling back to our coverage from a couple of weeks ago, there’s a lot for Americans to like about the current state of their economy. The job market remains strong, unemployment remains low and wages are up. And when it comes to inflation, the latest Consumer Price Index report showed price increases slowing sharply — including the first month-to-month decline in more than four years. What’s more, there’s an international context to consider. The World Bank last month not only noted that the Biden-era economy is the world’s strongest, it also concluded that the global economy is in better shape in large part because of the United States’ recovery. “Globally, overall things are better today than they were just four or five months ago,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. “A big part of this has to do with the resilience of the U.S. economy.” Gill’s report further credited “U.S. dynamism” with helping to stabilize economies abroad. A Washington Post report added, “The United States is the only advanced economy growing significantly faster than the bank anticipated at the start of the year.” Around the same time, The Atlantic’s Rogé Karma described the U.S. economy as “the envy of the world.” Four years ago, Trump told supporters that Democratic policies would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” Everything he said and predicted was wrong — and the former president hasn’t even tried to explain why his predictions were so hilariously misplaced."
The one Democratic criticism that seems to bother Trump the most,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 11:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/one-democratic-criticism-seems-bother-trump-rcna163685,"In the aftermath of the assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, many leading Republicans not only blamed Democrats, but GOP officials also pointed specifically to one Democratic talking point: Describing the former president as a threat to democracy, Republicans said, was simply beyond the pale. The GOP nominee is apparently thinking along the same lines. Politico reported: It might seem like a simple, albeit cheap, line at a campaign rally, but the closer one looks at the rhetoric, the more important it becomes. Right off the bat, Trump’s interest in “unity” has obviously been thrown out the window. Earlier this week, the former president said he was shot because “the Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me,” and as of Wednesday night, he tried to draw a direct connect between a Democratic talking point and the attempt on his life. It’s wildly irresponsible to talk this way — investigators still say they don’t know what motivated the shooter — but Trump clearly doesn’t care. What’s more, it’s tough to take the former president’s complaints about the rhetoric seriously, given his own record. In fact, the week before the shooting in Pennsylvania, Trump described the Biden administration as a “fascist government,” as his campaign operation issued a fundraising appeal asserting as fact that President Joe Biden is “a threat to democracy.” Two weeks earlier, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND EXISTENCE OF OUR COUNTRY ITSELF!!!” The hysterical missive dovetailed with months of rhetoric in which Trump has told voters that the United States would likely cease to exist if he loses. If he thinks it’s dangerous for Democrats to push such criticism, perhaps Trump can explain why he has pushed the same criticism. Complicating matters, the Republican candidate might not like the Democratic line, but it’s rooted in fact. As we’ve discussed, this is a White House hopeful who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. If Trump doesn’t want to be accused of threatening democracy, then he might want to try curtailing his threats to democracy. Finally, it’s hard not to wonder what Republicans’ internal polling has to say on this. The scope of the pushback against this specific talking point suggests it might be potent."
Melania Trump will tell her story in an upcoming memoir this fall,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-memoir-rcna163651,"Melania Trump, the inscrutable former first lady who has largely avoided the public eye after her husband's time in office, will tell her own story in a memoir set to be released in the fall. Titled “Melania,” the book will chart “a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence,” her office said in a statement Thursday. The book is currently available for preorder on her website for $40. Signed copies go for $75. A full-color collector’s edition with ""bonus photographs"" is priced at $150 and will come with an optional digital collectible. Trump’s office did not announce a release date. “Melania” is published by Skyhorse Publishing, which has released books from other MAGA world figures, including former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec. Melania Trump promoted her memoir on social media on Thursday, writing, ""May your experience reading my book be as enjoyable as the writing process was for me."" It will be the first memoir from the former first lady, who is intensely private. Her time as first lady was marked by a contentious relationship with the press and a discomfort with the confines of the role. She quickly receded from public life after leaving the White House in January 2021, and she has rarely been seen in public since. Her absence on the campaign trail as her husband vies for another term in office has sparked some speculation, and she forwent a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention earlier this month, bucking longstanding tradition. Coincidentally, Donald Trump also announced on Thursday that he is releasing a photo book — his third since leaving office — titled ""Save America,"" on Sept. 3. The book will feature ""iconic moments"" from his first term and lay out his vision for a second term, according to its publisher, Winning Team Publishing. The book is available for pre-order at $99, though signed copies are priced at an eye-popping $499."
Why it matters that Biden said he wants Supreme Court reform,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 11:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-supreme-court-reform-rcna163472,"The Supreme Court was on President Joe Biden’s mind Wednesday night as he delivered historic remarks from the Oval Office about his decision not to run for re-election. He mentioned the court among both his past accomplishments and in his vision for the future, citing his appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and telling the nation that he’s going to call for reforms.  Both the past and future aspects highlight the crucial role that the composition of the court plays in November’s presidential election — as it has in every election, whether people have realized it or not. Indeed, one of Donald Trump’s most lasting presidential legacies may be his appointment of three justices in a single term: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Unless a surprise vacancy arises before he leaves office, Biden will have appointed one justice: Jackson.  To be sure, the number of justices a president appoints can be more a matter of chance than skill, especially when it comes to variables like a justice’s health. That unpredictability alone underscores the importance of each election, as Republican appointees Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito are in their mid-70s and Democratic appointee Sonia Sotomayor is 70. It’s hard to imagine a Republican-appointed justice stepping down voluntarily during a Democratic administration, and vice versa. Of course, that political reality hasn’t played out equally across party lines, leading to today’s 6-3 Republican supermajority that has delivered significant wins for the Republican Party.  The gamesmanship inherent in the current process highlights the benefit of one of the Supreme Court reforms that Biden could adopt: term limits. Knowing how long a justice would serve ahead of time could remove some of the unnecessary chaos that governs the nation’s top court and, in turn, the nation. Alternatively, adding seats to the court could more immediately balance it out, but that doesn’t appear among the changes that Biden is reportedly considering (not that any reforms are likely to pass this Congress). There’s also the question of whether this Supreme Court would strike down reforms reportedly backed by Biden like term limits and an enforceable ethics code. Perhaps paradoxically, expanding the court is the most legally straightforward measure (it’s been done before throughout the court’s history), even if it’s politically the least likely.  At any rate, the dim prospects of any imminent reforms shouldn’t stop Biden from centering the court in the national conversation. Ultimately, whether one wants court reform or the appointment of favored justices in the meantime, the court — and the Congress involved in any reform legislation and the judicial appointments process — is on the ballot in November.

Why the DOJ’s handling of Roger Stone’s case got another look,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 9:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dojs-handling-roger-stones-case-got-another-look-rcna163662,"Donald Trump and his team tend to hold Justice Department officials in low regard, though it’s likely the Republican was pleased with the latest findings from the DOJ’s inspector general’s office. The Associated Press reported: It’s been several years since we last talked about this, so let’s revisit our earlier coverage and review.For most of the process, Stone’s prosecution seemed rather routine. The longtime Republican operative and close Trump associate was charged with multiple felonies, given a fair trial, convicted by a jury, and was prepared for sentencing. Federal prosecutors recommended a sentence that was in line with existing guidelines and made their case to a judge, in writing, defending their rationale. All of this unfolded exactly as it was supposed to. But after the then-president condemned the prosecutors’ filing via social media — a bizarre development in its own right — the Justice Department intervened and declared that it was withdrawing the recommended sentence. Soon after, four prosecutors announced their resignations. David Laufman, a former counterintelligence chief at the Justice Department, called the developments “shocking,” adding, “We are now truly at a break-glass-in-case-of-fire moment” for the DOJ. Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general, wrote in a message to career employees at the department, “This is not what you signed up for. The four prosecutors who bailed on the Stone case have shown the way.” Aaron Zelinsky, one of the four federal prosecutors who resigned, later told Congress, “I have never seen political influence play a role in prosecutorial decision making, with one exception: United States v. Roger Stone.” Zelinsky went on to allege that Trump’s Justice Department exerted political pressure on prosecutors to “water down and in some cases outright distort” the nature of Stone’s conduct. Given the seriousness of the allegations and the appearance of brazen political interference, the Justice Department’s inspector general’s office took a closer look. Four years later, it concluded that then-Attorney General Bill Barr and his team were involved in the case in “highly unusual” ways, but the findings nevertheless blamed the local U.S. Attorney’s Office and said it found no direct evidence of Trump asking Barr to intervene.There was, however, a highly relevant detail that might’ve been easy to miss, which Talking Points Memo highlighted: In other words, the Justice Department’s inspector general couldn’t prove political interference in the Stone case, but it also wasn’t able to ask questions of many of the key players. As for what happened after Stone was sentenced, Trump, four years ago this month, commuted his friend’s sentence late on a Friday afternoon, rewarding Stone for having lied on Trump’s behalf. The Washington Post’s editorial board called it at the time “one of the most nauseating instances of corrupt government favoritism the United States has ever seen.” The editorial board added, “If the country needed any more evidence, Friday confirmed that the greatest threat to the Republic is the president himself.” After Trump’s 2020 election defeat, he went further and pardoned Stone — two days before Christmas, when the developments were more likely to go overlooked. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Eager for attention, Trump returns to a favorite topic: his legal cases",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 9:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-legal-cases-harris-rcna163607,"Up until Sunday afternoon, Donald Trump was about as buoyant as we’ve seen him over the last several years. After the Supreme Court and Florida federal judge Aileen Cannon handed him significant legal wins in rapid succession, he also survived an assassination attempt so brazen (and preventable) that scores of allies declared Trump had been touched by the divine — and then went on to bask in the adulation of the MAGA-faithful at the Republican National Convention last week.  But the more relaxed, subdued Trump disappeared almost as quickly as he came, as NBC News’s Vaughn Hillyard observed after watching Trump’s first, post-convention rally. And judging by his social media posts, one topic that has him especially exercised? His legal proceedings, three of which he mischaracterized in a series of Truth Social posts on Wednesday. First, Trump touted his “big win” in a “high Florida court” against ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos, which Trump claimed is a “powerful case” that will force the news media “to start telling the truth.” But Trump’s description of that development is misleading at best.  The ruling Trump was referencing came down Wednesday from a federal trial court — or, in other words, the lowest level of the federal court system — and merely determined that Trump’s defamation case against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, which stemmed from the latter’s March interview with GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, cannot be dismissed now, at the outset of the litigation. In his lawsuit, Trump claims that Stephanopoulos’ repeated statement that a judge and two juries held Trump liable for raping author E. Jean Carroll was both false and malicious. But in its effort to have the case thrown out, ABC argued that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over Carroll’s two trials, had already determined, in a written opinion, that the first jury “implicitly” found that Trump had “‘raped’ [Carroll], albeit digitally rather than with his penis,” and therefore, that Trump could not dispute that conclusion. In a July 2023 ruling, Kaplan determined that “[t]he finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’ Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.” ABC also argued that even if Kaplan had never made that ruling, his underlying reasoning was sound and should apply because Stephanopoulos’ descriptions of the jury’s verdict were “substantially true”— and therefore could not constitute defamation. (In delivering their verdict, the jury in the first Carroll case did not find Trump liable for rape, as that term is defined under New York law, and instead held him liable for sexual abuse.) Trump is right that Judge Cecilia Altonaga rejected both of those arguments, allowing the case to continue. But she also made plain that Trump’s purported “big win” was hardly the final word, explaining that she was “not reaching the merits of [Trump’s] claims. [ABC and Stephanopoulos] may very well convince a reasonable factfinder” — meaning a jury — “to follow Judge Kaplan’s reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos’s statements were not defamatory.” That, however, “is not the issue before the Court now,” Altonaga clarified. Within hours, Trump was crowing about yet another legal victory, albeit just as inaccurately. “I got out of my Documents case,” he posted, invoking the recently dismissed Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, “by WINNING against the FULL FORCE AND POWER of the U.S. Department of Justice.” Yet Cannon’s dismissal of that case rested solely on her determination that special counsel Jack Smith, who has not been subject to day-to-day supervision by the Justice Department, was appointed and funded in violation of certain provisions of the Constitution. Put another way, as MSNBC Legal Analyst Andrew Weissmann has noted, she dismissed the case because Smith — who was not confirmed by the Senate, as is required for “principal officers” of the executive branch — was functioning too independently of the attorney general and the DOJ. She didn't dismiss the case because Smith was backed by “the FULL FORCE AND POWER” of the DOJ, as Trump claimed, much less acting in concert with the department's leadership. But Trump’s third distortion of a judicial decision was Wednesday’s charm. For the first time, Trump — who complained constantly about the gag order in his New York criminal case during that trial — asserted that the order is now “interfering” with his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris and was engineered by Manhattan criminal court judge Juan Merchan “to benefit my Democrat Opponent.” (Harris, of course, wasn't yet running for president during the trial in April and May.) Trump failed to mention, however, that the gag order has never encompassed any statements about President Joe Biden, Harris or anyone in their administration. Instead, by its plain terms, it was entered to protect discrete and small groups of people key to the trial: known and foreseeable trial witnesses, jurors, lawyers and court personnel directly involved in the case, their family members, and finally, after a raft of threats, the families of both the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (but not the judge or Bragg themselves). Moreover, since late June, Trump has been relieved from the gag order’s provisions about trial jurors, whose names and addresses still may not be revealed, and witnesses, who can be discussed in any and all respects. It’s hard to see, therefore, how what remains of the gag order — namely, prohibitions on statements about the lawyers, courthouse staff, their families, and the families of the judge and DA — could impede Trump’s presidential campaign, much less constrain any core political speech. These distinctions, important as they are, will be lost on those who hang on Trump’s every word on Truth Social. But where it comes to legal proceedings, Trump has never played nice — and even a brush with death is unlikely to change that."
Beyoncé's 'Freedom' becomes the soundtrack to Kamala Harris' historic campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 9:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599,"In the days since Vice President Kamala Harris launched her bid for president, Beyoncé’s song “Freedom” has become the soundtrack to her campaign. Harris walked out to the song at her first visit to her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. It played the next day at her first campaign rally in Wisconsin. On Thursday, the campaign released its first ad, which again featured the song. The video contrasts Donald Trump's vision for the country with hers, with Harris saying in a voiceover: “There are some people who think that we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate. But us? We choose something different: We choose freedom.” Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which features rapper Kendrick Lamar, was released in 2016 as part of her visual album “Lemonade.” Rolling Stone called the song at the time “one of the most striking political statements” of Beyoncé’s career. Although the Grammy Award-winning artist has not officially endorsed any candidate in this year's race, she did grant Harris’ campaign permission to use the song through the next few months of the election, CNN reported on Monday. (That Harris is using the music with the artist's permission also stands in stark contrast to Trump, who's been asked not to play songs by the Rolling Stones, R.E.M., Prince, Neil Young, Rihanna, Guns N' Roses, Queen and Adele — among others.) Harris is a known Beyoncé fan. She and her husband, Doug Emhoff, went to the singer’s Renaissance World Tour concert in Maryland last August. The tickets, valued at $1,655.92, were a gift from Beyoncé, according to Harris’ financial disclosure report earlier this year. Beyoncé has a history of supporting Democratic candidates. She sang the National Anthem at President Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration and performed at a concert for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign alongside her husband, Jay-Z — much to Donald Trump's consternation, even years later. Beyoncé also endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020."

Why Trump wants his handpicked FBI director to ‘resign immediately’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 8:16 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-wants-fbi-director-resign-immediately-chris-wray-rcna163641,"Seven years ago next week, Christopher Wray, Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was sworn into office. After the 2020 elections, President Joe Biden had an opportunity to replace Wray with his own FBI director, but the Democrat said he was comfortable leaving Wray in place. But while FBI directors generally serve 10-year terms, Wray probably realizes by now that his future will be decided by the 2024 presidential race. The FBI chief testified yesterday before the House Judiciary Committee and offered new insights into the investigation of the recent assassination attempt targeting Trump. But as part of the hearing, Republicans pressed Wray on whether he’d seen a decline in Biden’s health. He said he had not. As NBC News reported, the comments were not well received by the former president who appointed him. In an online statement published to his social media platform, the Republican candidate specifically called on Wray to “resign immediately,” adding, “Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!” There is literally no evidence of Wray lying to Congress. But I’m also curious about whether the testimony related to Biden was the only thing that troubled the former president. During the same hearing, for example, Wray said there’s some uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Trump’s injury from the shooting in Pennsylvania. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” Wray told lawmakers, adding, “There’s a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.” This, coupled with the fact that the former president and his team have been reluctant to share even basic details about his medical care after the shooting, is generating new questions on Capitol Hill. For example, Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York — a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor — wrote online this morning, “We must see Donald Trump’s official medical records.” We probably haven’t heard the last of this."
It just got harder for Trump to distance himself from Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/just-got-harder-trump-distance-project-2025-election-2024-vance-rcna163631,"For months, Democrats have tried to let the public know about Project 2025, a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by the Heritage Foundation with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. Earlier this month, however, Democrats received some unexpected help — from the former president himself. A few weeks ago, the Republican nominee published an odd item to his social media platform claiming to “know nothing” about Project 2025. He went on to claim he has “no idea who is behind it,” he disagrees with some of its provisions, and he has “nothing to do with” the initiative. Democrats were delighted: Trump’s denial helped bring attention to the Project 2025 plan, which is exactly what the party was hoping for. The former president nevertheless issued a similar statement a week later, which again helped to push the radical blueprint into the national spotlight. At a rally in Michigan this past weekend, the GOP candidate not only tried to distance himself from Project 2025, he also described its authors as part of the “severe right,” adding that some of the agenda’s provisions are “seriously extreme.” Trump reiterated his position online again yesterday. All of this has the effect of alerting the public to the right-wing agenda’s existence — which again is what Democrats are hoping for — while simultaneously reminding voters that the Project 2025 is so extreme that even Trump doesn’t want to be associated with it. But there’s a related problem: The more Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025, the more we’re confronted with evidence pointing in the opposite direction. A Media Matters report explained: Well, that certainly won’t help. Complicating matters, a recent CNN report explained that “at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025 ... including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to ‘Mandate for Leadership,’ the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch.” What’s more, NBC News tracked down a 2022 speech in which Trump spoke at a Heritage Foundation event and said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” In case that weren’t quite enough, Media Matters also discovered that Paul Dans, a former Trump administration official and the director of Project 2025, told a right-wing podcast last year that his group has a “great” relationship with the former president and that “Trump’s very bought in with this.” I can appreciate why Trump doesn’t want to be associated with Project 2025 — most voters would find the agenda to be almost cartoonishly extreme — but his denials keep running up against reality.

"In ‘veepstakes’ process, Democrats appear to widen the aperture",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 6:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/veepstakes-process-democrats-appear-widen-aperture-rcna163616,"Ordinarily, a major party presidential campaign spends months scrutinizing potential running mates. Given the historically unusual circumstances surrounding President Joe Biden’s withdrawal, the compressed calendar and the Democratic Party’s looming virtual nominating process, Vice President Kamala Harris doesn’t have months. She has about a week. For the party’s likely nominee and her team, that’s the bad news. The good news is that Harris and her new political operation have an impressive short list that’s come together quickly. The New York Times reported: This list is nearly identical to the list NBC News reported earlier in the week, though NBC News’ version included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — who has said publicly that she’s not interested in national office, at least not this year — and the Times’ list includes Beshear. But let’s not brush past that “remains in flux” part. In fact, while it’s easy to believe Harris’ ultimate choice will be one of the aforementioned names, there’s evidence of a widening aperture. Take, for example, retired Adm. William McRaven, the former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, who is perhaps best known to Americans as the Navy SEAL who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. There were rumors a few days ago that McRaven — a fierce and eloquent Trump critic who endorsed Biden four years ago — would get running mate consideration, and that chatter was apparently true. “I am honored to have been considered as a possible running mate for Vice President Harris,” McRaven said in a statement last night. “However, there are far better candidates and I have removed my name from consideration.” Around the same time, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Harris’ campaign has reached out to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker “to gauge his interest” in possibly joining the 2024 ticket. CBS News ran a report of its own late yesterday, noting that there are “approximately a dozen” people being vetted as possible running mates. In addition to the names referenced above, the CBS News report also pointed to some Biden administration Cabinet officials — including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — who will receive a closer look. I won’t pretend to know who Harris is going to pick, but everyone I’ve spoken to in Democratic politics seemed to say roughly the same thing: They’re enjoying the “veepstakes” process enormously. “Everybody’s enjoying the moment and kind of thinking through scenarios and how exciting some of these combinations could be,” former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle told the Times. “It’s kind of fun.” Reiterating a point from earlier in the week, former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm are overseeing an intense vetting process, and I continue to feel sympathy for them. As a Politico report indicated, Harris appears likely to select her running mate “by the middle of next week.” Watch this space."
"Trump says Harris shouldn’t be ‘allowed to run,’ recycling weird claim",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-says-harris-shouldnt-allowed-run-recycling-weird-claim-rcna163593,"In his first rally since President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race, Donald Trump did exactly what everyone expected him to do: The Republican spent much of the event going after Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president’s case against his new rival, however, has tended to rely heavily on vague name-calling: Trump called the likely Democratic nominee a “lunatic,” for example. But during his pitch in North Carolina, one the GOP nominee’s lines of attack stood out: The Republican’s followers, naturally, cheered the rhetoric. There is a degree of irony to the comments: A jury recently found Trump guilty of nearly three dozen felonies. If Harris “shouldn’t even be allowed to run for president” because “she’s committing crimes,” then I supposed we should look forward to the former president delivering a withdrawal speech of his own. What’s more, insisting that the Democratic vice president is “committing crimes” would be less ridiculous if Trump had any evidence of Harris, you know, actually committing crimes. But of particular interest was the GOP candidate’s suggestion that his likely Democratic rival “shouldn’t even be allowed to run” for the White House. If the comment rang a bell, there’s a good reason for that: Part of the problem here is that the Republican nominee is getting lazy, recycling stale insults, nicknames and attacks. But just as notable is the fact that Trump has long taken a keen interest in who should and shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him, and in a remarkable coincidence, he consistently argues that those who stand in his way are — or should be — ineligible for American ballots. Trump already earned a reputation as someone who was hostile toward democracy. This won’t help. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why Democrats may need Mark Kelly to stay in Arizona,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-mark-kelly-vp-arizona-rcna163454,"Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., is a lot of great things. He is an astronaut and a Navy combat pilot. His parents were police officers, and his wife, Gabby Giffords, was a congresswoman severely injured by a mass shooter. Kelly is a gun owner and Second Amendment supporter who has long campaigned for reasonable gun control. He is a Democrat who somehow won not one but two statewide races for U.S. Senate in 2020 and 2022 in Arizona, where — until Kyrsten Sinema in 2018 — no Democrat had held a Senate seat for 30 years.  His résumé is impeccable, and he is likable. That’s why Kelly is now among the front-runners to be selected by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate. But picking Kelly as her vice presidential running mate would be a mistake. Kelly does not bring fire to the campaign trail. He would not fill the “attack dog” position the VP candidate traditionally holds. Kelly barely speaks to the media or the people. He is successful by being middle of the road and quiet — which is perfect for a Democrat in Arizona but not for the Democratic VP candidate campaigning around the U.S. Kelly’s political success is based on a now-proven playbook for Democrats in Arizona. Run to the center, appeal to independents (approximately one-third of Arizona voters) and moderates, debate as infrequently as possible, limit public speaking, keep a low profile with the media, raise money and run ads. Kelly follows this playbook perfectly, and it has worked well for him. But it would not work for him as the VP candidate. For all of his credibility, experience and substance, Kelly lacks the political charisma and fire necessary to run for national office. Even his biggest supporters acknowledge privately that Kelly is not a great orator or debater. No one attends a Mark Kelly speech or event and walks away talking about his passion or persuasiveness.  He is extremely accomplished, a proven leader able to handle the intense stress of combat and commanding two space flights. He probably would be a solid vice president, but he would not help Kamala Harris win the presidency. Harris needs a partner in this race who can bring people to their feet. Who can excite Democrats around the country. Who can publicly push back with power and clarity when Donald Trump or JD Vance make outlandish claims — or outright lie. Kelly is not that guy.  There are barely more than 100 days to the election and a lot to overcome. This fight requires two strong retail politicians. Kelly’s political skills are moderation and discipline, but those skills are not what is needed in a fast-paced national campaign against Trump’s lies, attacks and threats. Can Kelly transform himself into an aggressive politician? Perhaps he has suppressed that part of him in his two Senate races. Maybe he could, indeed, be the political attack dog needed at this moment. He is a combat pilot, after all.  But at what cost? Kelly brings substance and the ability to work across the aisle, but he would endanger the credibility and reputation he has built in Arizona as a moderate centrist Democrat that paves his way to Senate wins. And he would put his next Senate election at risk if a Harris-Kelly ticket loses.  If they do win the White House, Arizona loses a proven Democratic winner important to Senate balance with no guarantee of holding the seat. Winning would allow Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs to appoint his replacement in 2025, but a new election would be held in 2026 (rather than 2028) — with no guarantee that Kelly’s successor would enjoy the same support among independents and even moderate Republicans necessary to win in Arizona. There are other great options for a running mate, including several governors who are great orators comfortable with political sparring, without the threat of giving up a Democratic-held seat in a swing state.  Mark Kelly is a great man and a great senator, but he is not the person for this moment. A fast, grueling campaign against Trump and Vance requires a different set of skills. Harris would be well served by looking elsewhere. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here and the case for Josh Shapiro here."
Trump voters fear 'excitement' of Harris campaign,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/wisconsin-voters-swing-state-trump-harris-2024-rcna163528,"On Tuesday, Elise Jordan, an MSNBC political analyst and former George W. Bush administration staffer, sat down with voters in the battleground state of Wisconsin. The Badger State has played a pivotal role in deciding the last two presidential elections. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, defeating Hillary Clinton by almost 23,000 votes. In 2020, Joe Biden turned the state back to blue, beating Trump by a similar margin. Ahead of the 2024 election, Jordan spoke with two voting blocs that could help move the margin in either candidate's direction: female Trump supporters and right-leaning swing voters. Jordan, who was just in Wisconsin last month conducting similar focus groups, said she was shocked at the burst of energy Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy had injected into the race — among both Trump supporters and swing voters. The group of Trump supporters told Jordan they feared the Democratic ticket shake-up could lower Trump’s chances of retaking the White House, since they believe Harris could motivate young, minority and female voters to head to the polls. “Everyone is excited about her, and that scares me,"" one voter shared. Asked how they view Harris’ competence and experience compared to Biden, voters said they saw the vice president as worse. One woman called out Harris for her role in the administration's immigration policy: ""She doesn't even know what's going on at the border, and that's what she was supposed to be in charge of? I mean, as a schoolteacher, if I didn't do what I was supposed to be doing, you better believe my job would be in jeopardy."" Another voter took aim at Harris' intelligence, calling her an ""idiot"" and ""not real smart."" The voters also expressed doubt over the possible election outcome. Asked whether a Harris victory in November would be an ""honest result,"" the entire group shook their heads at Jordan. As for right-leaning swing voters, the group said they had concerns about both Harris and Trump. One voter told Jordan she was open to voting for Harris but felt ""uneasy"" over how much the vice president may have known about Biden's mental and physical fitness. She said if Harris was ""willing to hide that type of information"" about Biden, ""what she’s willing to hide for herself?” As for their views of the former president, a voter told Jordan she couldn't ignore Trump's criminal convictions. She also had issues with his integrity and moral character, suggesting Trump could use the office to ""retaliate"" against his enemies. Another voter voiced shared concern over Trump’s “making too aggressive of choices” and acting out of impulse. However, she also worried Harris could be too cautious in responding to threats and make the U.S. appear ""weak."" One swing voter had a message for both candidates: “It would just be nice if they concentrate more on the issues instead of the mudslinging and personal attacks. ... Let’s try to find that common ground where we can agree on things. Let’s start with that.”"
Someone needs to teach Tom Cotton and the GOP what the word ‘coup’ really means,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/maga-republicans-joe-biden-coup-divide-democrats-rcna163434,"Almost four years after supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 election, Republicans have finally become comfortable using the word “coup.” However, consistent with their upside-down view of the world, Republicans are not using “coup” to characterize what Trump and his supporters attempted between his losing the election and Jan. 6, 2021. They’re using it to mischaracterize Democrats convincing President Joe Biden to step aside to give Democrats a stronger chance of defeating Trump. Shortly after the news broke Sunday that Biden was dropping out of his presidential campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democrats’ nominee, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X, “Joe Biden succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors, ignoring millions of Democratic primary votes.” “The coup is complete,” wrote MAGA Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., also echoed the claim that we witnessed a “coup” when Biden dropped out. “Is it a coup against Joe Biden?” Fox News host Jesse Watters asked Trump and his running mate JD Vance in an interview that aired Monday morning. Vance responded point blank, “Yeah, I think it is.” Trump though was uncharacteristically sheepish, only telling Watters, “Sort of.” Biden dropped out for the same reason politicians have ended their campaigns since time immemorial: He realized he couldn’t win. As NBC News reported Sunday, Biden decided to end his campaign after discussing his election prospects with his wife, family and key advisers. It’s true Biden wasn’t happy with the growing calls for him to drop out after his deeply troubling debate performance against Trump in June. However, as NBC News noted, Biden reached his decision after reviewing extensive polling data, including data showing how Vice President Kamala Harris would fare in a potential matchup against Trump. At the end of it all, as the NBC News report puts it, “Biden came grudgingly to accept that he could not sustain his campaign with poll numbers slipping, donors fleeing and party luminaries pushing him to exit.” “While it has been my intention to seek reelection,” Biden said in a letter to the nation Sunday afternoon, “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” That’s not a coup. That's what American politics has long looked like. True, a president dropping out only a little more than 100 days from the election was jarring and historic. But at the end, Biden made what he believed was the best choice for himself, his family, his party and his country. In contrast, Trump didn’t bow out even after he lost the 2020 election. Unlike Biden, who accepted that he couldn’t win, Trump wouldn’t even accept that he didn’t win. As the federal indictment against Trump charging him with four felonies puts it, “Despite having lost, the Defendant was determined to remain in power.” To that end, according to the indictment, Trump “pursued unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results.” That’s what Republicans ought to be calling a “coup.” Trump’s “criminal scheme,” as the indictment describes it, included replacing legally elected electors to the Electoral College with fake ones chosen by his campaign to deliver Trump the victory he didn’t actually win. And it included an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. That’s what an attempted coup attempt looks like, not anxious Democrats pressing Biden to drop out. In fact, when challenged, Republicans can’t even defend their use of the word “coup” to describe what Democrats did. “So why call this a coup and not Jan. 6?” CNN anchor John Berman asked Cotton. The senator gave a meandering answer that included, “George Clooney, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street bankers all working behind closed doors to bring unbearable pressure to bear on Joe Biden.” Berman wouldn’t let the issue go. “You use the language ‘coup,’ and again, you’ve never said that for Jan. 6.” He said, “As far as I know, no cops were beaten up. No one defecated in the Capitol. There was no criminal trespass in terms of changing the Democratic candidates, were there?” Cotton evaded the question and instead began spouting comments about Harris’ record when she was a district attorney nearly two decades ago. This coup claim is just as baseless and hypocritical as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., claiming that, by Biden dropping out, he is  “invalidating votes” of millions of Democrats who cast a ballot for him in the primary elections. Johnson professing to care about Democratic voters is laughable. He played a visible role in trying to help Trump convince the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out the votes of millions of people who voted for Biden in the 2020 general election. By characterizing the Democrats' changing of the guard as a coup, the GOP’s goal was apparently to divide Democrats with a narrative that Biden was unjustly forced out. As the off-the-charts excitement and enthusiasm for Harris confirms, that’s not working. But using the word could definitely work for Democrats. They shouldn’t let voters forget that Republicans have nominated for president a man who fought against leaving when voters told him to. That attempted coup should alarm all Americans who treasure our democratic republic."
Biden should have given this speech a year ago,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 7:23 PM PDT / Updated July 24, 2024, 7:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-prime-time-speech-wednesday-rcna163345,"This is the speech President Joe Biden should have given a year ago. In a barely 10-minute address to the nation from behind the Resolute Desk on Wednesday night, Biden put a bow on his decision to abandon his cratering re-election campaign. Biden, still recovering from Covid, spoke haltingly and at times seemed to slur his words — sometimes repeating sentences with the words rearranged a bit. Even when he was boasting of his administration’s accomplishments, there was a mournful tenor in his voice. He looked exposed.  But his appeals for unity amid ongoing attacks on our democracy didn’t ring hollow. He came off like a patriotic American who saw his predecessor unforgivably botch the early days of a pandemic and then try to overturn the results of a free and fair election. Biden, for all his baggage, understands the dangers on the horizon.  Yes, he’s a career politician who ran for president three times. He’s always wanted this job and never wanted to give it up. But sitting in the Oval Office, surrounded by family and staff members, Biden didn’t look like a man defeated by an uprising within his own party. He looked like a man who finally accepted reality and who needs some rest.  This is the correct outcome. And yet, when he recalled his promise to the American people to “always level with you … to tell the truth,” I couldn’t help but feel a bit gaslighted. After what would prove to be a career-ending debate performance in June, it seemed that only Biden’s inner circle failed to understand there was no going back. There was no way to convincingly argue that Biden hadn’t lost a step — or many steps — and that he’d be just fine if he served another four years.  Biden was never supposed to be an eight-year president. He was always supposed to be a “bridge” to the next generation. Though he never pledged to do it, during the 2020 election there were breadcrumbs of reporting in The New York Times and Politico that indicated Biden and top advisers were at least open to the idea of his serving just one term, then riding off into the sunset as the hero who dislodged Trump from the White House and leaving it to someone else to take the helm in four years. If Biden had given this speech a year ago — telling members of his own party to vote for someone else and thanking Americans for their faith in him — he’d have done far less damage to his administration’s credibility, and he would have enabled a competitive primary process.   He didn’t, so instead we’ve got a just-over-100-day presidential election the likes of which we’ve never seen before.  It’d be a stretch to use President Gerald Ford’s famous post-Watergate line, “Our long national nightmare is over,” but the specter of an ailing, unpopular 81-year-old president trying to persuade the country — again — to vote for him instead of Trump was kind of a nightmare for a lot of Americans. And now it is in fact over.  We’re at that bridge to the future now. Look at the other ticket, featuring a 78-year-old former president and a 39-year-old senator with less than two years of experience in office. Trump’s decision to pick Sen. JD Vance is MAGA’s passing of the torch. And if they win on Election Day, this country could be forever changed in a terrible way.  We can’t know yet what will happen in November. But a few weeks ago, Biden seemed almost certainly on a path to a crushing defeat. Instead, his early exit means there is now a much better chance that his work can and will be continued — and his legacy not destroyed."
The Secret Service failed Trump.

With just over 100 days until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris spent her first day as the presumptive nominee for president of the Democratic Party on the campaign trail in the crucial electoral college state of Wisconsin. Harris’ Secret Service detail, which was already very strong, should now be strengthened  — not just because she has moved up from vice presidential nominee to presidential nominee, but because we have seen recent proof of Secret Service protection not being strong enough. The director of the Secret Service resigned Tuesday after being sharply questioned by both Democrats and Republicans in a congressional hearing about how a lone gunman was allowed to get on a roof within range of a presidential candidate and fire shots that could have killed the candidate and did kill one of the spectators and wounded two others. That is the first time in history that a Secret Service director has resigned after shots were fired, even though every single time shots have been fired at a president since the creation of the Secret Service, after Abraham Lincoln’s presidency, it has always been the Secret Service’s fault. Every time.  In every single shooting, the Secret Service made the mistake of giving the shooters a clear shot. In 1901, the Secret Service allowed an assassin to walk right up to President William McKinley to shake his hand and instead revealed a handgun shooting the president to death. Congress had no hard questions for Secret Service Director John Wilkie after that, and the Secret Service director served another 10 years in that job after failing to protect the life of President McKinley. In 1933, two weeks before his inauguration, an assassin approached President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s car in Florida and fired shots that missed him but killed a mayor who was standing on the running board of the president-elect’s car. Once again, the Secret Service let an assassin with a gun get too close to the president-elect. Roosevelt was riding in an open car. It was an easy shot because it was an open car. The world was lucky that the assassin missed. Congress did not grill Secret Service Director William Moran who allowed that assassin to get so close to the president. Congress did not ask why Moran allowed the president-elect to ride in an open car. Moran served three more years as Secret Service director and continued to allow Roosevelt to ride fully exposed in an open car, which Roosevelt did throughout his presidency. Thirty years after those shots were fired at Roosevelt, shots fired at President John Fitzgerald Kennedy riding in the back of an open car took the life of the youngest president in history. As pieces of the president’s skull and brain tissue fell onto the surface of the open car behind President Kennedy’s head, his wife tried to reach back to grab those pieces while the fully incompetent Secret Service began climbing onto the back of the limousine and urging the first lady to stay in the car.       It was only after Kennedy was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, that afternoon that Secret Service Director James Rowley decided the president should never again ride in an open car. And no president ever has, since that day. If Rowley had made that decision one day before, American history would be so much less tragic. Rowley served 10 more years as Secret Service director after losing Kennedy on his watch because of his incompetence. Kennedy’s younger brother Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 while running for president.  The Secret Service provided protection to presidential candidates starting the day after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Bobby Kennedy’s assassin was able to walk up to him and shoot him point blank.  In 1975, the Secret Service allowed President Gerald Ford to be shot at twice within two weeks. Stuart Knight was the director of the Secret Service then. He allowed people with no firearms training to simply get too close to the president.  He’s the only Secret Service director in history who allowed the same president to be shot at twice. But he wasn’t finished. He became the only Secret Service director in history to allow two different presidents to be shot at.  He was in charge when the Secret Service allowed another completely untrained pedestrian with a handgun to walk up and get close enough to President Ronald Reagan to fire shots as the president was entering the Washington Hilton. In that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed the president’s press secretary to be shot. And in that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed a Secret Service agent to be shot. All because the Secret Service and Secret Service directors had not yet figured out how to prevent pedestrians from randomly walking up to presidents and firing handguns at them.  There was no condemnation of Knight after the Gerald Ford shootings — two in one month — or the Ronald Reagan shooting. He left the Secret Service after eight years as director.  The Secret Service got marginally better after some of these shootings. No more open cars. No more people allowed to get close to a president moving on foot in or out of a building.  And now the Secret Service thinks it has figured out how to protect Donald Trump at his rallies. The Washington Post reports that the Secret Service urged the Trump campaign to “stop scheduling large outdoor rallies and other outdoor events with big crowds.”  But at the outdoor rally in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to do the elementary thing of securing every possible elevated firing position. The roof it decided not to secure was the roof the murderer used to fire at the candidate and his supporters. It was, as usual, the Secret Service’s fault. The Secret Service director was right to resign, but she should not have been the first to resign. The new acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, is a 24-year veteran of the Secret Service. We can only hope that he will provide the protection that allows this campaign to make it to Election Day with all of the big surprises being only political surprises.

Buttigieg hits back at JD Vance’s dig about ‘childless’ Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 2:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-pete-buttigieg-childless-cat-ladies-harris-rcna163504,"Sen. JD Vance, now in the spotlight as Donald Trump’s running mate, is being widely criticized for his past comments about “childless” Democrats, which have come under renewed scrutiny. “You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” he told Tucker Carlson on Fox News during his run for the Senate in 2021. “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has been floated as a potential vice presidential pick by Kamala Harris, addressed the Ohio Republican’s remarks in an interview with CNN. “The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,"" Buttigieg said. “He couldn’t have known that, but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children.” Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, announced in September 2021 that they had adopted newborn twins. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has talked about the struggles they dealt with in the adoption process, saying they had “some false starts and some heartbreaks.” And even though Harris is a stepmother to her two children, she has been subject to an oddly regressive line of attack from some Republicans, who insist that she’s not a real parent because she doesn’t have biological children. Vance, a natalist, has a host of bizarre, ultraconservative views on gender, as Politico pointed out. In his 2021 interview with Carlson, he also specifically denigrated women without children, saying:"

The vote against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) is the latest step in a Israeli push against the agency, which Israeli leaders have accused of collaborating with the Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza.” * The latest on the investigation into the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania: “The gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump may have had a firearm with a collapsible stock, making it easier for him to carry and conceal the weapon, the director of the FBI testified Wednesday. The gunman also had researched President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, FBI Director Christopher Wray said.” * On a related note: “Former President Donald Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one where he was shot during an assassination attempt this month in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to two sources familiar with his campaign’s operations.” * An intensifying climate emergency: “Sunday’s record as the hottest day ever recorded on Earth lasted only one day. According to preliminary data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average temperature reached 17.15 degrees Celsius (62.87 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, toppling the prior day’s record of 17.09 C. In other words, the planet had its two warmest days back-to-back this week.” * Occasionally in Congress, bills pass: “A federal bill that would allow victims of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes to sue people who create, share and receive them has unanimously passed the Senate and now moves to the House for a vote. The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (Defiance) Act of 2024, introduced by Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., would create a federal civil remedy for identifiable victims of deepfake sexual abuse.” * Following up on our earlier coverage: “The Justice Department’s inspector general on Wednesday blamed ‘ineffectual leadership’ and not political interference for the softening of Roger Stone’s sentencing recommendation in February 2020 after his conviction for lying to Congress. The report upheld an account by then-Attorney General William P. Barr but also found that line prosecutors’ suspicions of political meddling by President Donald Trump’s administration were not unreasonable.” * And while this might sound like a weird joke, it’s quite real: “Scientists have found traces of cocaine in wild sharks off the coast of Brazil, in a discovery that highlights the risks to marine life of the illegal cocaine trade.” See you tomorrow."
Trump's defamation case against ABC after Carroll verdict can proceed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 2:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-defamation-abc-e-jean-carroll-verdict-rcna163499,"After Donald Trump was found liable last year for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, the federal judge overseeing that New York case explained that the jury had essentially found that Trump had raped her, as that term is commonly understood. Nonetheless, a federal judge in Florida has allowed Trump’s defamation claim against ABC and George Stephanopoulos to proceed, based on the anchor’s use of the term “rape” to describe the jury’s verdict. Here’s why. As a refresher, the Carroll jury found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed her, but it didn’t find that Trump had raped her. The New York federal judge who presided over that case, Lewis Kaplan, downplayed the distinction when he rejected Trump’s challenge to the jury’s multimillion dollar award as excessive, reasoning that just because the jury declined to find that Carroll had been raped under New York law, that didn’t mean she failed to prove Trump raped her “as many people commonly understand the word.” Kaplan likewise rejected Trump’s defamation claim against Carroll for her saying that he had raped her. This new decision stems from Stephanopoulos’ March interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in which he questioned her support for Trump despite him being “found liable for rape.” Stephanopoulos repeated that phrase several times during the interview. ABC and Stephanopoulos argued that the former president’s defamation claim is foreclosed by the New York court’s findings. But on Wednesday, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the Southern District of Florida rejected the defense motion to dismiss Trump’s case. (If Altonaga’s name sounds familiar, that may be because the George W. Bush appointee reportedly urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to step aside from Trump’s classified documents case.) In Trump’s defamation suit, Altonaga distinguished Carroll’s claim that Trump had raped her from Stephanopoulos’ characterization of the jury verdict as having found that Trump had raped her. The judge determined that a reasonable jury could interpret the anchor’s statements as defamatory. Yet, she made clear that she wasn’t necessarily agreeing that Trump had been defamed; rather, the judge’s legal determination was that the defense didn’t present a strong enough argument to dismiss Trump’s case at this stage of litigation. “Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan’s reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos’s statements were not defamatory,” Altonaga wrote, adding that a jury that views the segment may find sufficient context to conclude Trump wasn’t defamed.  In some respects, the ruling is like another recent Trump defamation win in Florida. In that state court case, he beat a motion to dismiss his claim against Pulitzer Prize Board members and staff, related to a statement about his 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia. As with the Carroll-related claim, the rejection of that motion to dismiss doesn’t mean that Trump will ultimately prevail — only that his case can proceed.

Trump camp denies nephew's allegation that Donald Trump used racial slur,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 1:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-racial-slur-fred-trump-iii-nephew-book-rcna163500,"A new book by Donald Trump’s nephew Fred Trump III, a real estate executive, recounts an incident in which the presidential candidate allegedly used a racial slur after his car was damaged. The allegation appears in Fred Trump’s book, ""All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way,"" and is cited to offer insight into the ways in which Donald Trump has allegedly engaged in overt racism.  As The Guardian reported, based on an advance copy of the book the outlet obtained ahead of its release next week:  In response to the report, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told NBC News, “This is completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order.” Trump has faced previous allegations by his family that he’s used racial slurs. Mary Trump, Fred Trump III’s sister, published a book in 2020 that alleged Trump was known to use racist and antisemitic slurs. She told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow at the time that the N-word was among the slurs her uncle used. A spokesperson for Trump’s White House called Mary Trump's book at the time ""a book of falsehoods, plain and simple” and said Trump “doesn’t use those words.” Trump’s team has also had to bat away similar claims made by nonfamily members. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former Trump business associate and White House aide, claimed in 2018 that she’d personally heard a tape of Trump using the N-word during filming of NBC’s “The Apprentice”; Manigault Newman repeated the claim in her book published that year. As with the allegations made by Trump’s niece and nephew, this allegation of racism was disputed — at the time by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who dismissed the former aide as “a disgruntled former White House employee"" who was “trying to profit off these false attacks.” And a former ""Apprentice"" producer, Bill Pruitt, published an essay in Slate this year in which he said he was present to hear the former president use the N-word during the show's first season (Cheung disputed Pruitt's account in a statement to Slate, saying, “This is a completely fabricated and bull---- story that was already peddled in 2016”). Much of Trump's racist behavior and racist rhetoric has been public and well documented over the years. This latest allegation from his nephew — taken together with previous allegations — suggests his private persona might be a bit more bigoted than his public one."
"Mike Johnson insists Kamala Harris’ race and gender are irrelevant, as Republicans keep calling her a ‘DEI hire’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republicans-kamala-harris-dei-hire-race-gender-rcna163484,"As the ugly attacks on Kamala Harris from the right take shape, House GOP leaders are warning their fellow Republicans not to focus on her race or gender in their criticism of the de facto Democratic presidential nominee. The racist and misogynistic attacks on the vice president from conservative commentators and GOP lawmakers began almost immediately after she announced that she will seek her party’s nomination. Some lawmakers have called her a “DEI hire,” suggesting that Harris — who has served as a U.S. senator, a California attorney general and a San Francisco district attorney — is where she is due to identity politics and not because of her accomplishments. It appears that the top brass in the House GOP are trying to steer members of their party away from such bigoted attacks. At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, urged his party members to instead focus on Harris’ record with the Biden administration, Politico reported. Afterward, House Speaker Mike Johnson told Politico that this election “has nothing to do with race” and that it’s a comparison between the two candidates’ strengths and their ideas for how to solve the country’s problems. “This election will be about policies and not personalities,” the Louisiana Republican told reporters after the meeting, according to The Associated Press. “This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris, and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.” Whether such calls will sink in among House Republicans remains to be seen — they certainly do not seem to have gotten through to their presidential nominee. According to NBC News, while on a call hosted by the Republican National Committee on Tuesday, Donald Trump accused Harris of having “played the race card on a level you rarely see” in debates with Joe Biden during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2020."
JD Vance hopes voters won't dwell on his far-right abortion views,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 12:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-hopes-voters-wont-dwell-far-right-abortion-views-rcna163510,"Before settling on his new running mate, Donald Trump was reportedly worried about something specific: whether his choice would be seen as too far to the right on abortion rights. The Republican realized that the issue has been a real problem for his party, and he apparently feared the impact on his 2024 candidacy. NBC News quoted a source close to Trump in March saying, “He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position.” With this in mind, the former president appears to have made the wrong choice. Sen. JD Vance isn’t just a far-right opponent of abortion rights; the Ohio Republican also has publicly endorsed a national ban, supports enforcement of the Comstock Act, had a campaign website that described him as “100 percent pro-life” (under a headline that read, “END ABORTION”) and endorsed his home state’s six-week ban. What’s more, Talking Points Memo ran a related report, noting that the Biden administration finalized new regulations under HIPAA that limited law enforcement access to medical records tied to reproductive health. Eight Republican senators pushed back against the administration’s efforts — and Vance was one of the eight. The word “staunch” keeps coming to mind. But as Politico reported this week, Vance is hoping voters don’t dwell too much on his views and positions when it comes to reproductive rights, and will instead focus on Trump’s leave-it-to-the-states approach. In other words, the GOP’s vice presidential nominee isn’t denying his far-right views on abortion rights so much as he’s arguing that his far-right views on abortion rights aren’t especially relevant because he won’t be at the top of his party’s ticket. At first blush, that might sound vaguely reasonable. Throughout American history, when there have been differences between running mates on the same party’s ticket, it’s the candidate at the top who makes the final call about the prevailing position. But a lingering question hangs overhead: If voters return Trump to the White House and he were unable to complete his term for whatever reason, Vance would be elevated to the Oval Office. Would he stick to Trump’s far-right position, or his own even-further-to-the-right position? Or put another way, the senator would have people believe he’d only be the vice president. And while that’s true, (a) vice presidents often have influence over the administration’s agenda, especially when their presidents are indifferent toward governing and public policy; and (b) vice presidents sometimes become presidents. For its part, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign team said in a statement: “JD Vance is telling voters not to believe their own eyes and ears when he calls to ban abortion nationwide, rejects exceptions for rape or incest, and compares abortion to slavery. Voters aren’t buying his pathetic excuses — they know that the Trump-Vance ticket is all in on Project 2025, and that the only way to stop them is by voting for Kamala Harris this November.”"
Mike Johnson warns Congress and its guests that disrupting Netanyahu could mean arrest,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/netanyahu-congress-speech-2024-mike-johnson-arrest-rcna163471,"Ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial joint address to Congress on Wednesday, several lawmakers announced they won’t be attending.  Some — like Rep. Sara Jacobs, who wrote an article for MSNBC, and even Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie — made clear in their announcements that their absence is an act of protest. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying his damnedest to prevent any expressions of dissent from disrupting Netanyahu's speech. In an effort to pre-empt protests in the room, Johnson sent out a Dear Colleague letter on Tuesday in which he threatened the arrest of anyone in the galleries who interrupts the speech. Should members of Congress create ""a disturbance,"" Johnson said the sergeant at arms will intervene. Protests by guests at congressional hearings can routinely result in arrests. Last year, 10 protesters were arrested last year at a hearing on the Israel-Gaza war, and the father of a Parkland shooting victim was arrested at a hearing on gun regulations. Johnson made a similar threat in Milwaukee last week at an RNC-adjacent event hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition.  “There’s a number of Democrats in the House who have said they’re going to boycott the event,” he said, “and then some others are gonna protest. Listen, we’re gonna have extra sergeants at arms on the floor, and if anybody gets out of hand, the Speaker of the House will bang the gavel — we’re gonna arrest people if we have to do it. We’re gonna get the message out."" The message got out. Although it seems to contradict Republicans' claim that they're the “America First,” pro-free speech party, here’s one of their leaders threatening Americans with arrest if they protest a foreign leader speaking before the U.S. Congress."
"Live from Highlands, NC: Back to Manhattan",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-live-highlands-nc-rcna163485,"On Monday, July 22nd, MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord spoke at a live event at the Center for Life Enrichment in Highlands, North Carolina. They touched on President Biden’s historic decision to exit the race, and the legal ramifications it could hold for Trump’s continuing criminal cases. Mary and Andrew also address the question of whether a president can pardon himself, and to what extent. And they detail the reasoning laid out in Trump’s motion to vacate his New York conviction based on the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity, and if any of the arguments hold water.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to Prosecuting Donald Trump. I’m Andrew Weissman, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. So we’ve got something special today. On Monday, July 22nd, Andrew and I participated in a live event at the Highland Cashiers Center for Life Enrichment in North Carolina. Andrew Weissmann: That’s a mouthful. Mary McCord: It is a mouthful. It’s one of those rare occasions when we get to do this in person, which is always very special and in front of a live audience. Andrew Weissmann: I know. It was really, really fun. I was there last year, and this year, you and I got to do it live together, which is always actually really nice. So, it was a fantastic event. We wanted to share it with you in this episode. It’s great to actually have a live event with an audience. So without further ado, here are some highlights from the conversation that Mary and I had. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) (APPLAUSE) Andrew Weissmann: It’s so nice to see you all. I was here last year, and I’m so glad to be invited back with my much better half. For those of you who listen to our podcast, you’ll know that we don’t script anything, and now you will actually really be able to witness that that is certainly true. You might be thinking it’s better if we do script it. So this reminds me, we were doing a live show in Austin, Texas -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Texas last year. Andrew Weissmann: -- and with Chris Hayes, and I looked over, and Mary and Chris, their microphones are perfectly placed, and mine was just, let’s just say it fell down into a location and just stayed there and so, I’m known on our podcast for telling anecdotes. I think that’s the main source of why I’m here. But anyway, so the first part of our discussion, we were planning on talking about a motion that Donald Trump has made in the New York criminal case where he was convicted that is based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. And we’re still going to do that and talk a bit about the immunity decision, give you a quick overview of it, just in case anyone is living under a rock, doesn’t know exactly what it is, but just to give a little context and then talk about that motion. And we’re still going to do that. However, there was some news and it doesn’t involve the change in chamber music program yesterday. It’s a little bit more national in scope. Mary McCord: International, I would say. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: That’s right. Yes. So we will start by talking about President Biden’s decision yesterday, and specifically not so much what that has to do with who will be the next candidate, but what impact that may have on these prosecutions. Andrew Weissmann: And I have to say, when you’re on MSNBC or doing these sort of short news clips, I think of it as like speaking in haiku. You know, the hard part of it is how do you shrink something down into a short amount of time. And we both get tons and tons of e-mails and people saying, but you didn’t explain, and we’re like, well, that’s true because as you know, it’s like -- Mary McCord: Because we had five minutes and they were already, the producer was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. Andrew Weissmann: Right. If you want to know what’s going on in our year, it’s usually it’s like, and you’re done. So probably me a lot more than Mary. So I remember when Rebecca Kutler, who came up with this idea, I was like, there’s no audience for that. I mean, what are you going to call the podcast, two nerds? And sure enough, she was right. There were people who did want that deeper dive. And the description of two nerds is probably one that at the end of this presentation, you’ll be able to judge for yourself that that would probably would have been a better title than “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” But anyway, that was the genesis of it. And it’s sort of been great. And I have to say, just working with Mary for the last year plus, it is also very calming because a lot of times things happen and people say like, how do you stay so calm on air? And a lot of it is when you’re thinking about having to do a podcast for like, you know, 30 minutes or 45 minutes on something, you get it all out of your system beforehand so that you can really sort of calm down and figure out what’s the best way to sort of explain this. So if you think all of us are naturally, or both of us are naturally calm, it’s all of that’s, the non-calm part is happening off screen. Mary McCord: Right. Right. Except for occasionally Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: And this is just to tell you how great it is to interact with those who listen is we had a whole episode, I think, after one of Judge Cannon’s decisions. I don’t remember which one anymore because -- Andrew Weissmann: Because there’s so many to choose from. Mary McCord: -- yes, exactly, yeah. That triggered Andrew, and then so I sure enough, like and we talked about this for, you know, many times. I’m triggered, I’m triggered. So a couple of days later, I get this e-mail from somebody who is listening to the podcast. And then he said, I was on vacation in Oregon, and I passed by this street and I had to take a picture. And it was Trigger Avenue, literally a street sign. So that became our next week’s name of our podcast, Trigger Avenue. And we both took a nice little stroll down Trigger Avenue. So anyway. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, let’s start. Mary McCord: Shall we -- Andrew Weissmann: So, we obviously don’t do political commentary. That’s not our background. We don’t have anything really interesting to say that would be useful more than just as we can react like citizens, but our background is not sort of political pundits or pollsters or anything like that. So we looked at the and thought about the announcement yesterday in terms of what does it mean in terms of the legal ramifications, whether it’s the four criminal cases or even some of the civil cases involving Donald Trump. So, Mary. Mary McCord: Well, obviously, if Donald Trump wins in November, that will be the end of the of the two federal cases. And so President Biden deciding that he’s not running doesn’t necessarily change what that outcome will be, but it just feeds into this election will determine many, many things far beyond these criminal cases. But if he is reelected as president, as probably most of you in the room know, he will be able to direct his Department of Justice to dismiss those federal cases. And that was actually true even before the immunity ruling. But it remains, I’d say, even more true now because the Supreme Court has explicitly held that it is one of the president’s core constitutional powers to, through his Department of Justice, make decisions about the investigation and prosecution of cases. And that is something that I think many of us wouldn’t have thought were part of his core presidential powers. We thought, yes, he’s the head of the executive branch. Certainly, he can direct his attorney general to do things as a matter of policy, prioritize certain types of cases. Let’s say sometimes presidents want to prioritize white collar fraud cases. Others want to prioritize violent drug trafficking cases, right? That’s kind of normal. But what has, through the years, developed within the Department of Justice and the White House is a set of norms that says we want the public to feel confident that prosecutions and investigations are not being made for political purposes. And so we will, by our own internal guidance, we will direct that there is separation between the Department of Justice and the White House. So at the Department of Justice, in my tenure and Andrew’s tenure, every attorney general that I worked under, and I worked there for well over 20 years, Republican and Democratic, would always put out a new memo that, you know, prosecutors are not to be communicating to the White House about decisions about investigations or prosecutions, with some exceptions in national security areas, mostly because the president shouldn’t be surprised if we have extradited a terrorist to come to the U.S. to be tried, right. He should know about that in advance because that would be pretty monumental. White House also has always had a set of memos. Every White House counsel, Republican and Democratic, have always put out similar guidance. The White House should not be directing the attorney general or the Department of Justice about individual investigations and prosecutions. But that’s not constitutionally required. And so one of the real consequences of this election when it comes to the ongoing cases is there would definitely be that power to direct that those cases be dismissed. Now, the president can’t direct that state prosecutions be dismissed. The president can’t direct that civil cases brought by people like E. Jean Carroll or even the state attorney general in New York, a civil case, he can’t direct that those things be dismissed. He can only direct his own Department of Justice. So as we come into this election, it’s obviously on the Democratic side, you know, a whole process right now of having another nominee to take President Biden’s place. And we have just a matter of months, but the outcome will have a real impact on these cases. Andrew Weissmann: So I add embroidery to the substance. And the one thing to note is a lot of times people talk about whether a president can pardon himself. And that is an issue that has not been decided by the Supreme Court. And given the Supreme Court, I hope they don’t get to decide it, but it’s also not something that is necessary because as Mary pointed out, the new president can just say, drop this investigation. He doesn’t have to worry about pardoning himself. He can just be like, you’re not going to prosecute, you know, to depersonalize it. The president could be like, you’re not going to prosecute Democrats and you’re only going to prosecute Republicans, or you’re only going to go after Muslims and you’re not going to go after, you know, white Protestants, or pick whatever hypotheticals you want. And so the president has this enormous power, particularly under the immunity decision to have these kinds of communications with the Department of Justice just to denigrate the immunity decision, which for one second, one of the things is when Mary noted that the decision said that within the president’s core powers, the Supreme Court said includes the communications between the president and the attorney general, they specifically noted the context of that was communications about bringing a sham investigation. And the Supreme Court said that is absolutely immune. I mean, so remember that those were the charged allegations in the January 6th case. They are now out of the case conclusively in a 6-3 decision. And so there’s enormous power and I do think that one of the things when I was thinking about what happened yesterday is something that Joe Biden said when the immunity decision came out was he that night went on air. And I thought in a pretty remarkable way, and again, I’m trying to sort of keep this depoliticized. He said, just in terms of the presidency, you had the sitting president of the United States saying the decision today to give the presidency, the position I hold, more power is wrong. And that just is remarkable, that sort of self-restraint and understanding the role that the presidency has and the limits of that role in what’s supposed to be a system of checks and balances, I thought was remarkable that you had that happening on the day of the decision. The second thought I had, which is a bit of a factoid, is that the fact that Kamala Harris, if she ends up being the nominee, which it looks like she will be, is that you have a former prosecutor and the contrast in terms of the rule of law where you have just looking at the absolute, you know, black and white facts, is you have a former prosecutor on one side and you have somebody who is a convicted felon. Regardless of what you think of the case, a jury listened to the evidence and found beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of 34 felonies and is facing charges in two other cases. And we’ll talk about it. I didn’t say three others because the case in Mar-a-Lago is now not just technically, it is -- Mary McCord: But actually dismissed. Andrew Weissmann: -- it is actually dismissed by the district court. That is likely to be appealed. So I just think that contrast of the rule of law being on the ballot as well as the Supreme Court is, I think, going to be really heightened and brought to the fore by the background of the two candidates. Mary McCord: And that reminds me, when I was saying the president, if Donald Trump wins, could dismiss the cases against him, that only assumes that somehow there is by then a Mar-a-Lago case because there is not one right now. We want to dig in now, we have already talked on a couple of episodes about we’ve gone through fairly extensively the immunity decision and its consequences, not only for the January 6th case and what Judge Chutkan in the D.C. District Court will be tasked with doing as that case comes back to her. We’ve also talked a little bit about the consequences more broadly for the government. But there is a specific aspect of the opinion that really is pertinent to the Manhattan case where there’s already been these guilty verdicts. And I’m sure all of you are aware that immediately following that opinion, Mr. Trump’s attorneys filed a motion before Judge Merchan in Manhattan seeking to have those verdicts set aside on the grounds that official acts evidence was introduced into evidence at that trial and should not have been in accordance, if this is Mr. Trump’s argument, should not have been in accordance with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. And so since that notice, they have filed a full brief, 50-something pages, and we are now awaiting Alvin Bragg, the D.A., to file his opposition, which is due in two days on the 24th, if I have my days correct. And then Judge Merchan has actually already announced that he will make a decision on that September 6th. And on September 18th, they will either move forward with sentencing or not move forward with sentencing, depending, of course, on what his decision is on the 6th. So we are in the midst of, you know, very significant briefing on a very significant issue that is directly about how do we apply the Supreme Court’s ruling. (END AUDIO TAPE) Mary McCord: Okay, let’s pause here. After the break, more from my discussion with Andrew from the Highlands Cashiers Center for Life Enrichment in North Carolina. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: So the reason it’s useful to do that sort of TikTok, it’s a phrase, by the way, which apparently I can’t use anymore, as my NYU students, like, keep me up to date with what anyone in the last 20 years has been doing. Mary McCord: But it’s too bad, because it’s a great phrase. Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: Like, what’s the TikTok? Andrew Weissmann: A lot of people correctly are thinking, what in God’s green earth does an immunity decision about what you can do as president have to do with the New York criminal case? Because the New York criminal case was about conduct that, to a large extent, involved what candidate Trump was doing. And the decision was not about immunity for a candidate. It was immunity for a president. And so you’re thinking, well, this is clearly just personal conduct that was taking place either before he was president, or to the extent that it sort of spilled over to a time period that he was president. It might be a time period that he was president, but its conduct, the alleged criminal conduct, was personal, as if you got into a car accident or robbed a bank or did something, you know, you just did on your own time, but not as president. So how can the immunity decision have any consequence? And that is something we talked about, I think, last episode, but we didn’t really dig into. And the answer is that amongst the many things that that decision did, and this is one of the more outrageous, because it basically just takes the president, I think, almost completely off the hook for any criminal liability, is they said that a prosecutor cannot use official conduct, even to prove up that evidence of official conduct, to prove up a case, even if that underlying case is for unofficial conduct. Mary McCord: And is it worth pausing there to just give the three areas of immunity? I know you’ve all read the decision, right? And all the concurrences and dissents. No, seriously, I’m sure you’ve heard a lot about it. But just since we’re going to dig into this one aspect, just a real quick overview. Basically, the Supreme Court, you know, divides cases that involve a president to three pieces and says, you start with core presidential functions for which the president is absolutely immune. And the controversy there about that ruling, because I think just saying that is not controversial. In fact, even the government’s attorney, Michael Dreeben, who both of us know very well from our years in government, argued, yes, we agree, before the Supreme Court, there would be some core presidential functions for which a president couldn’t be prosecuted. These are things like the things that actually appear in the Constitution, like the pardon power, the veto power, things like that. The Supreme Court defined it much, much more broadly, as we were indicating, like essentially anything you do as head of the executive branch and many other things. So that’s a problem. But core presidential functions, absolute immune. There’s no balancing test or anything like that. Just can’t prosecute for it. Andrew Weissmann: And one thing that’s interesting is a concurrence by Amy Coney Barrett, I thought, laid out sort of the rationale in a way that’s, I think, very easy to understand as to how she thought about absolute immunity in that core area. She just said, look, if it’s a core area, what you’re really asking the court to look at is could Congress act in any way to criminalize that conduct or to regulate that conduct? And if it’s something that’s been exclusively given to the president by the Constitution, then Congress doesn’t have that power. It can’t go into that area. It has been given solely to the president. And as she said, in that limited number of areas that are in the Constitution, she just said the way to think about it is that’s just not something that Congress has the power to criminalize or even, frankly, civilly regulate. And so that was sort of the big issue, as Mary said, is that that sort of small area was interpreted quite broadly. Mary McCord: Because the majority does, you know, say something similar, but comes at it from a different perspective. They say in this broad view of core presidential functions, Congress is disabled from legislating and courts are disabled from examining it. So absolute immunity means in that most capacious description would be really calls into question, can Congress do oversight of the Department of Justice? What happens with the appropriations of funds? I mean, we could go on and on and on. So that’s that first bucket. The next piece is then a court who’s looking at an indictment has to decide are the charges in that indictment then outside core presidential, are they official acts or unofficial acts? Unofficial acts, purely private conduct, reimbursing a lawyer for paying hush money to a porn star, purely private conduct, unofficial act, can be prosecuted for that. But they’ve said when you’re deciding between official and unofficial, you can’t take the president’s motives into consideration. You have to just parse it separately. And within what they call the outer perimeter of official acts, again, looking sort of broadly at what might be an official act, then there is at least presumptive immunity. Maybe absolute, we’ll decide that later if we ever have to, but at least a presumption of immunity that can only be rebutted if the prosecutor can establish that there would be no danger of intrusion on the president’s executive authority and functions by that prosecution. This is a lot of gobbledygook, I understand. So there’s a lot of work that the court sent back to Judge Chutkan. They said the direction to the attorney general to tell states that they were investigating fraud in the election, that’s off limits. That’s absolutely immune. He can’t be prosecuted for. Communications with his vice president, Mike Pence, that’s at least presumptively part of his official acts. And so, Judge Chutkan, you have to determine whether the prosecution can rebut that it would not intrude on the functions of the executive to prosecute for his pressure on Mike Pence, right, to count the fraudulent votes on January 6th. And then these other areas, the pressure on state legislators and state legislatures and the fraudulent elector scheme and the tweets, you know, be there, be wild, and we’re going to march down the street and tell Congress what we think. And if Mike Pence had had courage, you know, we wouldn’t be in this position. All that sent back to the judge to determine official, unofficial. And they put some guidance there, and we talked about it at our last podcast. And then the thing we want to talk about today, this is a very long wind-up, is the other thing they said, which is that special counsel says, argues, and special counsel did, that official acts, even though special counsel will understand things that are immune from prosecution, you cannot base your indictment on that, but you could introduce as evidence official acts in order to prove, say, let’s say, knowledge and intent and things like that, absence of mistake when it comes to the personal conduct. And this is something that the chief had suggested at argument that he very much thought, yes, you should be able to do that. Andrew Weissmann: Chief Justice Roberts. Mary McCord: Chief Justice. And he’s the one who wrote the majority opinion, but he really reversed course on that in his opinion and said essentially that would eviscerate the immunity that they are providing to the president because it would allow the prosecutor to get into evidence, the very things that get into the president’s deliberations and his thinking as president, and it would prevent him from taking the kind of bold and fearless actions that presidents need to take if they’re worried not only that they might be prosecuted for them, but even that evidence might be examined by a jury. And this was remarkable for many reasons. This is where Justice Barrett disagreed and actually dissented from that, and then it -- Andrew Weissmann: So this is part of the decision. This is 5-4. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: This is not 6-3. This issue of can official conduct be evidence in an unofficial case. Just to be clear, what this is all about is the Manhattan case. To my mind, there is no question that that is exactly what the Supreme Court was focused on. They had an unofficial conduct in the Manhattan case, and you had a 5-4 decision saying that if there was official evidence that was put on in that case, the court’s going to have to look at that to see whether that was allowed and whether it was permissible. That is the issue that is going on now because then we’re going to the substance of what Donald Trump is claiming was the official evidence that was used in a case that clearly is about unofficial conduct and that 5-4 decision that is leading to this problem in the Manhattan case. And the rationale, there’s two paragraphs of this long immunity decision, and the court gives two, I think, very, very flimsy rationales for why this should even be a problem to introduce official conduct. One is that if you allow juries to hear this and a president knows that his, or maybe her, official conduct will be introduced at a trial in the future, it will distort, that’s the phrase, it will distort his decision-making process. Just think about that. Like if you thought that a jury in a criminal case for your unofficial conduct, your personal conduct, might hear about something you did as president within your official acts, that will sort of unduly distort what you’re doing. Mary McCord: And you’ll be jailed going forward as president. Andrew Weissmann: And Ketanji-Brown Jackson said basically to that, good, that’s what you want. That deterrence is a good thing, not a bad thing. Just sort of directly took it on in really terrific language, in my view. The second argument, which is, I think, even weaker for why this is a problem, is that the five justices on this part of the opinion said that a jury cannot be trusted to separate the policies of a president they may disagree with from anything else in the case and we cannot rely on normal criminal rules about keeping prejudicial evidence out, about balancing, that categorically a jury cannot be trusted, meaning this is not something that we’re going to allow a judge to sort of balance and decide case by case, which is the normal rule, because of the concern that a jury couldn’t hear this evidence and be fair. I think it’s really useful to think about that rationale when we go through the specifics of the Manhattan case that are being charged, because when you look at the specifics, it so belies that notion. Remember, this is a jury that by definition is hearing, that can be trusted to decide a case involving a former president for unofficial conduct. That you can go forward on because the Supreme Court hasn’t said, oh, they just can’t hear the case at all because they couldn’t be fair. So the tipping point for them is, but if you introduce anything within the broad official acts as defined by the Supreme Court that the president takes, such as a tweet or a conversation with the communications director -- Mary McCord: Well, hang on. We’re going to come back to that. We’re going to come back to that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, but I’m just saying that’s the issue that gets created. So anyway, so let’s turn to the specifics. Mary McCord: Okay, but the one little area of hope, I guess, that the Chief Justice said in response to Justice Barrett’s dissent here, because Justice Barrett said, in this example, suppose you have bribery, a president offering an ambassadorship in return for a bribe payment, a monetary payment. It’s an official act to appoint an ambassador. So are you saying that the government could not put on evidence of the ambassadorial appointment? Because how could you ever prove bribery? Bribery is definitely an unofficial personal act. Supreme Court even agrees with that. But how would you prove it? And what the Chief Justice says in a footnote in response to Justice Barrett is, but of course, the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact the president performed the official act, made the ambassadorial appointment, right? And the prosecutor may admit evidence of what the president allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or agreed to receive in return for being influenced in the performance of that act, because receiving money would be personal, not official. But what the prosecutor may not do is admit testimony or private records of the president or his advisors probing the official act itself. And the reason I’m reading this to you is because I think this is something that essentially Donald Trump’s attorneys, when they swing for the fences in their motion in New York, they really ignore that footnote. Andrew Weissmann: And one of the issues for the courts going forward is that footnote is really hard to understand the difference between the second sentence and the third sentence of, you know, not being able to explore the testimony or the advisors as to why, in the case of an appointment of an ambassador in exchange for a bribe, you know, the government would normally be needing to show, well, it’s this for that. Mary McCord: It’s this corrupt quid pro quo. Andrew Weissmann: But let’s assume that the advisor had taped evidence of the president saying, oh, I’m going to do it for this reason. He’s actually or she is not qualified to be ambassador, but this is why I’m going to do it. It’s not totally clear from that footnote what evidence is allowed, which is, by the way, it’s insane that this is something that we’re all considering. And Chief Justice Roberts’ footnote gives sort of something for both sides to argue about what is that line as to what gets allowed. So, Donald Trump, so first, just to be clear, as a defendant in a criminal case, a Supreme Court case comes down, it gives him arguments to make, and neither of us has anything against that. That is what defendants are entitled to do is make arguments based on the law and the facts. And as long as it’s made in good faith, that’s part of our process. Mary McCord: And that includes when it comes down after the trial and before sentencing, right? Because you can bring arguments on appeal based on new case law, where things start looking questionable in terms of retroactivity is if you have a case that has been a criminal case that has been tried, convicted, appeals affirmed, it’s, you know, 10 years in the rearview mirror, new case comes down. Does that impact retroactively? But when it comes down before the appeal, generally speaking, you can raise issues on appeal. There are other issues here about whether this was waived by Mr. Trump or whether he failed to bring a timely motion before trial, and that will all get litigated. I think we’ll see that in Alvin Bragg’s opposition. But we’ll also see him arguing the merits that these things, and we’re going to go through the list, are not official acts. (END AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: Okay, let’s take a quick break. When we’re back, more from our discussion from the Highlands Cashier Center for Life Enrichment in North Carolina. (ADVERTISEMENT) (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: So I’m going to jump to sort of the key problem, and then we’ll talk about some of the other issues because as Mary said, Donald Trump gave a laundry list of anything that could arguably be official, and there are various responses that we expect the state to make in two days. But there is one key area that I think is worth discussing, and then we can sort of backtrack to things that we think are probably less of an issue, and that is Hope Hicks. So Hope Hicks, as you may recall, took the stand, and she gave a lot of evidence that had to do with the time period before Donald Trump was president. There’s no issue there. Mary McCord: And that’s because she was working with the campaign when he was a candidate, right? And they were doing damage control. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: That’s all personal. Andrew Weissmann: So that’s going to be fine, and there can’t be a claim about that. So the issue arises because, in addition to talking about what happened in 2016 and for instance, she was describing what it was like when the “Access Hollywood” tape came out and the reaction, and that was sort of part of the state’s case in terms of motive for the crimes, but she then talked about two things in 2018. So that is when Donald Trump is president, and she has an official role at the White House leading communications with the public. So you have the president and a sort of senior official having a conversation, and the two types of things that are said, one has to do with -- Mary McCord: I have them on my screen, if you want. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah, perfect. Mary McCord: Okay. So one is when “The Wall Street Journal,” I guess, had reported that Michael Cohen had claimed, and they had him quoted as saying, he made the decision to pay Stormy Daniels in order to, you know, keep the story of their alleged sexual encounter in order to keep that out of the press right before the election. He said he paid that hush money without Mr. Trump knowing it, out of the goodness of his heart. And so Hope Hicks was asked about this, and she reported that she had a conversation with Mr. Trump about it, and it was “New York Times,” not “Wall Street Journal,” I apologize. I believe it was the day after, this is Hope Hicks testifying. The morning after Michael, that’s Michael Cohen, had given a statement to “The New York Times” saying that he had, in fact, made this payment without Mr. Trump’s knowledge. Mr. Trump was saying that he had spoken to Michael and that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that, you know, Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that’s what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart. He never told anybody about it, you know, and he was continuing to try to protect him until the point where he felt like he had to state what was true. And this is what Hope Hicks testified that Donald Trump told her when he was president, and she was his communications director. She was then basically asked, you know -- Andrew Weissmann: Did you believe it? Mary McCord: Did you believe it? And she says, I would say that would be out of character for Michael and there’s an objection that’s overruled, and then she’s asked, why would it be out of character? And she says, I didn’t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or a selfless person. He’s the kind of person who seeks credit. Right? So here we’ve got this testimony where she’s basically saying, Trump was telling me that this is what Michael said, but I didn’t believe that Michael would have been telling the truth then. Just a couple questions later, and this is the other significant part that they’re arguing should not have come in because this was official communications between a president and his communications director. She’s asked, did he say anything about the timing of this new reporting, right, because this is in 2018 when he’s the president. Oh, yes, she says. He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story, a different kind of story, before the campaign had Michael not made that payment. And I think Mr. Trump’s opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. Andrew Weissmann: And then this was the end of her direct testimony. I was actually there for a lot of the trial, and then, as many of you may know, she then broke down in tears. And, you know, these two things were very strong evidence, and the DA in summation argued that this was very strong corroborative evidence. Mary McCord: He used the word devastating. Andrew Weissmann: Right, which was fair in terms of its import. Mary McCord: Now, did she alone prove up the actual false business records, you know, charges? No, not at all. The point of her testimony was to corroborate Michael Cohen, to corroborate David Pecker, to corroborate the witnesses that actually did have direct factual evidence. So she was not a direct fact witness, but she was an important corroborative witness. Andrew Weissmann: So Judge Merchan is going to have to make a number of decisions. Leave aside that if he rules that all of this shouldn’t have come in, he’s going to have to decide was it material to the case, it didn’t make any difference because there’s always harmless error. Something comes in, but it’s, you know, it’s a grain of sand on the beach. His first decision really has to be about looking at these two things that Hope Hicks testified to. Is this even official act evidence? Now, does it fall into the broad category which the Supreme Court has outlined in its immunity decision of official act evidence? Now, I think if you were to ask Justice Alito, the answer is going to be yes because I’m not sure he will ever see any non-official act evidence. But that’s not the issue. The issue will ultimately be will there be five justices who would agree to this. Judge Merchan has to initially make that call and then it will go up within the New York criminal system, and then it could go to the Supreme Court. And, you know, you can argue it both ways, some stronger than others. With respect to, I’ll take the second one first, which is Donald Trump’s statement, according to Hope Hicks, that it’s better this came out now than before. Fine, that’s the president. Yes, he’s talking to the communications director, but that has nothing to do with his official conduct. The argument is like, that’s just sort of like opinion evidence and it doesn’t help her do her job. Mary McCord: Yeah, and for example, because when you think about what would be official there, like there’s oftentimes bad news that comes out about a president, or maybe not quite like this, but you know, there are definitely scandals. We’ve had them before, right? And so there would be a strategy. What’s their communications strategy, right, to ensure the American public that this didn’t happen, or whatever it is, whatever the argument. So that the argument, because you might be thinking, why is this even arguably official acts? But, you know, strategizing as the communications director with the president about communications to the public, you can see that being official. But as you were just saying, Andrew, if you’re really just talking about, ooh, good thing that came out now and not like back when I was a candidate, that really has nothing to do about, Hope, here’s what you need to say when you go out and talk to the public about this, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. But that then raises the issue with the first statement. And of course, the statement itself from Donald Trump to Hope Hicks, which is essentially Donald Trump saying, I didn’t know anything about this. Michael did it on his own. That’s exculpatory if you believed it. I mean, it’s hard to say I was prejudiced by putting in evidence that’s exculpatory. The problem is that she also testified, essentially, I didn’t believe a word of it. So you have coming out of Donald Trump’s mouth as sort of a story that she is saying, you know, that’s just not true. I mean, Michael Cohen wasn’t going to, and this is a critical issue. Michael Cohen wasn’t going to have done this on his own. This was something, as I used to say when the trial was going on, there were hundreds and thousands of reasons that he would make sure that Donald Trump knew because he wanted to get repaid because the theory was that he was fronting the money. Mary McCord: He took out a home equity loan to do it and didn’t tell his wife. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So the argument that Donald Trump makes is even if it’s a lie, the president can have a strategy in terms of what he wants to tell the public about something that would be detrimental to his presidency and he’s going to need to respond to. Even though it’s a personal matter, it’s coming up now that he’s in the role as president, the Supreme Court goes out of its way to say that a president can make official act comments, even about things that are sort of general interest that the presidency doesn’t really have a role in. Mary McCord: You talked about using the bully pulpit. They specifically talked about that. I think we both agree that will be the biggest issue, serious issue that Judge Merchan is having to consider. There are a bunch of other things though that I think are not serious and this is what I’m going to do because normally our producer when we’re going long does this, like wrap it up, and we ignore her for like a while because we have more things to say, but now we’re going to start talking really fast. Andrew Weissmann: We have a wonderful, wonderful producer. Mary McCord: Yes, we do, we do. Andrew Weissmann: And for the record. Mary McCord: But he swings for the fences and the reason I have this up is I have the list from the table of contents of his brief. I’ve read his brief, but then you can see everything. Not only does he challenge the testimony of Hope Hicks as official acts, he challenges the testimony of Madeleine Westerhout, who really kind of was like the person who was outside of his office. It was important testimony just because it kind of positioned. It was contextual testimony. It sort of positioned him in the White House, how he would talk to people, what his practices were, how he would make phone calls, things like that. But it really was not anywhere near like Hope Hicks is, I think, in terms of its importance to the case. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. But do you want to know what I think the D.A. should argue with respect to Westerhout, who is sort of this person sitting outside of the Oval talking about sort of just practices. Essentially, in the law, it’s called opening the door. If you are a defendant and you raise a topic, you can open the door to the government responding. You can’t raise something and then say, but wait, government, you can’t even respond to it. So in the opening, the statement by Donald Trump’s lawyer, he basically, I’m going to paraphrase it, says the president was too busy as president to be focusing on the invoices. And what was very important was that he signs these checks, a whole bunch of them while he’s president, and attached to the checks are invoices that are false. And his seeing them would be important evidence because you could see that it did not comport with the underlying facts of what happened. And so in the opening, the defense says he’s running the free world. He’s not going to be focusing on a few scraps of paper and invoices. He’s too busy. And so to me, that’s an argument for opening the door to say, wait a second, we get to put on evidence about the process that he did this. And the fact that one of the arguments the DA made that I thought was really powerful was like, hey, he didn’t even have to sign any of these checks. If these are all personal, he could have had his wife do it. He could have had his sons do it. The fact that he retained this is something he wanted to control, even when the White House tells you just how focused he was on this. We will see whether I’m right or not in two days. I’ve certainly been wrong before. Mary McCord: I mean, save one of these for last, because I think it’s in a different category. Then he also challenges Trump’s tweets, his Twitter posts. He challenges Trump’s public Federal Election Commission filing, an Ethics in Government Act filing, where he talks about payments made. So what, based on what I read in that footnote, do you think about tweets over social media and a public filing? What did the chief justice say could be introduced? Public records, right? So here you have Mr. Trump’s attorneys coming in and saying, all of these tweets that Mr. Bragg introduced into evidence, those are his use of the bully pulpit. Those are part of his official acts as the president to communicate with the public. Yes, and they’re public. They are public. So I would certainly argue, if I’m Alvin Bragg, those can come in because those are out there in the public as public records. What Mr. Trump’s attorneys here seem to me to be doing is conflating this notion of immunity for actual prosecution for the official acts with the bar on entering them into evidence. The bar on entering into evidence isn’t an absolute immunity to being prosecuted. And so they’re turning to basically say, those tweets are official acts, can’t introduce them, but that is not what the Supreme Court said. And I would say the same thing about this ethics form. This is a public form that is part of the public record, and it can’t be much more part of the public record than notice of an ambassadorial appointment. Andrew Weissmann: And just to go back now to the rationale when we talked about what the chief justice was saying as to why official act evidence shouldn’t be allowed, even in an unofficial case, because there’s the risk of undue prejudice that a jury couldn’t hear it. This is like a perfect group for this, because the citizens are made up of everyday people. The idea that you could not differentiate and somehow be categorically prejudiced against the former president because of Hope Hicks’ statements in 2018 versus in 2016, or whether they were tweets that said, I reimbursed, or a public form that said, I reimbursed. I mean, it proves to me just the absolute sort of lunacy of saying that a jury categorically could not hear this evidence. And I think when you start looking at the actual evidence that gets introduced, and so here we sort of have this great case study, it really belies the rationale that was used by the five justices in the majority as to why it shouldn’t come in. Mary McCord: The last one I think that’s worth talking about, last argument, is there was evidence that after Michael Cohen got into trouble criminally while Donald Trump was president, when this and other things like his lying to Congress came to light, he was contacted, and you may recall this from the trial, by an attorney, Robert Costello, who was urging Cohen to fight these charges, not to cooperate, and was sending signals because he had close ties to Rudy Giuliani, who of course had the former president’s ear, and he was saying things like, if there are things that you need, that you want, you should let me know so that I can convey that to the friend who may be able to do something about that. This essentially was dangling, you know, pardons out there. And this is where I really think this motion, you know, really is bold. They’re basically saying, pardon power, remember pardon power? That’s a presidential power. So this attorney, who is not Donald Trump, telling Cohen, you should, you know, communicate to me what your needs are, and I’ll communicate them up. They’re saying, that’s an official act. Now, that’s many steps removed. Now, of course, what Alvin Bragg wanted the jury to, you know, infer from that is that this attorney wouldn’t be saying that if Giuliani hadn’t told him to say that, and Giuliani wouldn’t have said it unless Donald Trump told Giuliani to say it. But still, to put that within official acts, this communication seems to me such an incredible stretch. But that’s what they did in this motion. Rather than kind of like spend almost all of the ink arguing hard about Hope Hicks, this is like the spaghetti at the wall, like everything basically is official acts. And to me, it takes away from the credibility of the real issue there. And the last comment I’ll make about this is, Andrew mentioned sort of harmless error. This motion starts from the prospect that you can’t even apply a harmless error test, that this is structural error that is automatic reversal. And so if you’re wondering, well, what is structural error? The best example is, first of all, it’s exceedingly rare that the Supreme Court holds that anything is a structural error that requires a reversal without even considering whether it’s harmless. And the classic example is someone who is made to go to trial without an attorney. Gideon v. Wainwright, the case where the Supreme Court held that criminal defendants have a right to an attorney and to counsel throughout their criminal trial. And so there’s no way you can fix that on harmlessness because it was from the very beginning of the case to the very end of the case, the person had no attorney. That’s structural error. These evidentiary issues, these are not structural error. And it may be they’d be reviewed for harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt because the immunity, at least according to the Supreme Court, derives from constitutional principles. But still, there will be that opportunity to argue harmlessness, which for many of these things, I think would be an easy argument. Hope Hicks, a more challenging argument, but not impossible. Andrew Weissmann: So expect a decision on this on September 6th from Judge Merchan and he could hold a factual hearing, which looks like if it did happen, it would be a few weeks later than that. He also could just deny it outright using many of the arguments that we just talked about, in which case the sentencing of the Republican nominee, can’t believe I’m saying that, will happen in mid-September. Then as a defendant, he has every right to appeal it within the New York system. And then we expect he would try to go as quickly as possible to the Supreme Court of the United States, which has proved to be a friendly venue. Unknown: Thank you both very, very much. We really appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) (END AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: Thanks so much for listening. We’ll be back next week.

CREW’s call for Alito to step down highlights his recusal failures in Trump cases,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/crew-resign-justice-samuel-alito-supreme-court-trump-rcna163415,"Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has called on Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to resign, citing his failure to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, including the Donald Trump immunity ruling. The watchdog group’s letter won’t sway the justice, but it highlights the problem of Alito’s having participated in these crucial disputes. The letter, dated Tuesday, notes that Alito declined to recuse after it emerged that flags carried at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, also flew outside of his homes: CREW cited three cases: • Trump v. United States, the immunity ruling. • Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. • Trump v. Anderson, the ruling that kept Trump on the ballot despite the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban. Alito was in the majority for all three — as was Justice Clarence Thomas, who, unlike Alito, never attempted to explain his nonrecusals, despite his wife’s connection to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. We can safely assume that Alito won’t be resigning — at least not because of this letter. The GOP-appointed justice is in his mid-70s and would probably want to retire under a Republican administration so Republicans could confirm his successor. So when Alito (and Thomas, also in his mid-70s) voluntarily leaves the court may depend partly on whether the litigant he’s been helping returns to the White House in November.

Republicans’ case against Kamala Harris is off to an ugly start,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-election-republicans-case-kamala-harris-ugly-start-rcna163468,"Three days into the transformed 2024 presidential race, how is the Republican Party’s case against Vice President Kamala Harris coming along? While pondering the question, consider the headline on one of The Associated Press’ overnight reports: “Republican leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris.” From the article: On the one hand, Republican officials believe this will be the year in which they break through with voters in communities of color. On the other hand, GOP leaders feel the need to remind their members that targeting Harris with racism isn’t a good idea. That said, the reminders have merit. A political sprint is obviously underway — Election Day is just over 100 days away — and it stands to reason that Republicans are going to take on the likely Democratic nominee in every possible way. But it’s also hard not to notice that the GOP’s case against the incumbent vice president is off to a rough start. Over the course of the last 72 hours, the American public has seen Republicans target Harris with: • racism; • sexism; • false claims about her serving as a “border czar”; • complaints about her laugh; • complaints that she has served the public for too many years; • complaints about her hometown of San Francisco; • complaints that she likes Venn diagrams too much; and • complaints about plastic straws. For good measure, let’s not overlook the fact that Republican Sen. JD Vance — a year before getting elected to Congress, and two years before receiving his party’s vice presidential nomination — took rhetorical aim at Harris during a Fox News appearance, emphasizing the fact that she does not have biological children of her own. As part of his Senate campaign in Ohio, Vance specifically referred to Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” The Republican added that this included Harris. The GOP will need a winning message against the likely Democratic nominee. This isn’t it."
Elon Musk now denies he's donating $45 million a month to help Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-trump-donation-45-million-pac-rcna163404,"Elon Musk has denied that he is contributing $45 million a month to a pro-Donald Trump political action committee, saying he is instead donating ""at a much lower level” than was initially reported. “What’s been reported in the media is simply not true. I’m not donating $45 million a month to Trump,” Musk said in an interview with Jordan Peterson, a conservative Canadian pop psychologist and YouTube personality, posted Monday on X, the social media site that Musk owns. Musk said he created the America PAC not as a “hyper-partisan” group but to “promote the principles that make America great in the first place.” Those principles, he said, include meritocracy and freedom, which he defined as “the least amount of government intervention possible,” a condition without which “everything becomes illegal.” The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Musk was planning to donate around $45 million a month to America PAC. In response to the reporting, Musk appeared at the time to give mixed signals. He responded to the WSJ article on X with a picture of gnus with human legs and the caption, “FAKE GNUS.” But he also replied to a post claiming he is “pledging $180 million” to re-elect Trump — the equivalent of $45 million a month from July until November — writing, “Yeah.” Later on Tuesday, Musk posted on X that he is “making some donations to America PAC, but at a much lower level.” The acerbic Silicon Valley billionaire had publicly thrown his support behind Trump after the attempt on the former president’s life at a campaign rally July 13. The Journal's report about Musk's monthly contributions to the super PAC underscored the financial heft behind the efforts by Silicon Valley's increasingly right-leaning factions to shore up their candidate of choice. At a rally in Michigan this week, Trump himself vowed “to make life good” for people like Musk. (Read more from my colleague Ja’han Jones about Trump’s overtures to Musk.) He also boasted about the tech billionaire’s donations to him. “Elon endorsed me the other day, and I read — I didn’t even know this, he didn’t even tell me about it,” Trump said, “but he gives me $45 million a month.”"

The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has now sent the PAC a cease and desist letter, demanding that they stop using Haley’s name. * President Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver a speech Wednesday night in which he will discuss his decision not to seek a second term. Donald Trump and his political operation have demanded equal time, though as best as I can tell, no network has agreed to the request. * Speaking of the Republican nominee, the Trump campaign also filed a complaint this week with the Federal Election Commission, complaining about Vice President Kamala Harris taking over Biden’s campaign accounts. This complaint isn’t likely to amount to much, but it’s worth keeping an eye on. * As Sen. Bob Menendez prepares to resign, who’ll replace the New Jersey Democrat? The Garden State’s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, has vowed to appoint a temporary successor quickly, and a short list is coming together. * Harris continues to pick up 2024 support from some of the nation’s largest and politically powerful labor unions, including AFSCME and the AFL-CIO. * In related news, Teamsters Vice President at large John Palmer announced late last week that he’s moving forward with a challenge to incumbent President Sean O’Brien, following O’Brien’s controversial decision to speak at the Republican National Convention. * And an interesting observation about recent political history: “This will be the first Presidential election since 1976 to not have a Biden, Bush, or Clinton on the ticket.”"
Dems in array: Handoff from Biden to Harris appears seamless,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 8:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-2024-democrats-array-handoff-biden-harris-appears-seamless-rcna163430,"Ahead of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race, many of the Democratic incumbent’s supporters said he had to keep going with his re-election bid — because the alternative would be intraparty chaos, division and disarray. There was one important flaw, however, in the argument: Democrats were already dealing with intraparty chaos, division and disarray. Nearly every day, more party officials called on the president to pass the torch, and there were multiple polls showing most rank-and-file Democratic voters as wanting an alternative to Biden. It appeared unsustainable. It also appears that the party has turned a corner. A Wall Street Journal report summarized: With extraordinary speed, a party that appeared fractured is suddenly united. A party that saw its fundraising efforts screeching to a halt is suddenly reporting record-breaking hauls. A party that cringed in response to every new poll is celebrating the latest national survey data. This seamless handoff from Biden to Harris wasn’t inevitable, but it has been executed with striking skill. It prompted Matt Compton, a veteran of the Obama White House, to note via social media: “Shout out to the staffers in Delaware who just lived through the most stressful five weeks in campaign history, then flipped every piece of branding and content on a dime, raised $100m, recruited 58,000 volunteers, and generally just lit the internet on fire for Kamala Harris.” Pod Save America’s Dan Pfeiffer added, ""What [the Harris campaign team] has pulled of since Sunday is truly incredible. No campaign in history has ever undergone such a shift with no notice. The way they been able to capture the wave of enthusiasm is so impressive. True professionals."" That’s certainly fair, though it’s also worth pausing to emphasize Biden’s role. The incumbent president didn’t just do the bold thing by standing aside, he also played a direct role in helping rally Democrats behind their likely new nominee. The results have been unmistakably impressive."
GOP’s Tom Cotton pressed on weird talk about an anti-Biden ‘coup’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-tom-cotton-pressed-weird-talk-anti-biden-coup-rcna163416,"After President Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid, Republicans scrambled — in the most cynical way possible — to turn this into some kind of scandal for Democrats. In fact, one word came up more than any other: “coup.” The argument, to the extent such a word is applicable, is that Biden prevailed against token opposition in presidential primaries and caucuses and earned his party’s nomination in the process. For the party to urge him to stand down, and for the president to voluntarily agree to do so ahead of the Democratic National Convention, constituted a “coup.” It was, and is, a ridiculous claim, though it’s been embraced by a wide variety of Republicans, including vice presidential nominee JD Vance. One of his Senate colleagues, Arkansas’ Tom Cotton, went in an even weirder direction, writing via social media, “Joe Biden succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors, ignoring millions of Democratic primary votes. Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy.” He didn’t appear to be kidding. In reality, of course, we know what a “coup” is. Merriam-Webster’s definition is as good as any: “a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics and especially the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group.” To think this applies to an incumbent president voluntarily withdrawing from a re-election campaign is obviously bad-faith nonsense, but there’s a related angle to this that shouldn’t go overlooked: If Republicans like Vance and Cotton are looking for evidence of developments that actually resemble a coup, perhaps they should turn their attention to Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol? CNN’s John Berman pressed Cotton about this on the air yesterday, asking, “As much as any politician I’ve seen, you choose your language very carefully. So, why call this a coup and not January 6th?” The far-right senator tried to change the subject, and the host tried again: Cotton dodged the question again. That wasn't too surprising; there is no good answer to these questions. As a Washington Post analysis concluded this week, after Trump’s 2020 defeat, the Republican “tried to cheat Biden voters in those five states out of their choice. He tried to short-circuit the effort to count electors. And then he suggested that the furious crowd near the White House direct their anger at the Capitol. It’s useful for Trump’s allies to pretend that Biden’s decision was comparable. It isn’t.” If Cotton and his cohorts are looking for a party that took steps to subvert democracy, we can show them one, but they might not like the look in the mirror."
"Kamala Harris sounds different, but she could still be a status quo president on Israel",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 6:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-israel-netanyahu-gaza-rcna163202,"President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his bid for re-election has sparked curiosity and hope among progressives and Arab Americans who were turned off by his support for and complicity in Israel’s brutal siege of the Gaza Strip. Many are wondering whether Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner to win the Democratic presidential nomination, may be more inclined than her boss to push back more forcefully against Israel and offer support to Palestinians. It’s a tricky assessment to make, in no small part because Harris doesn’t have a deep background in foreign policy. Most of Harris’ career focused on law enforcement, and during her brief stint in the Senate she wasn’t a major foreign policy player. Her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign focused mostly on buzzy domestic policy ideas. As vice president she did delve into foreign affairs and diplomacy, but her job wasn’t to craft major policy — it was to execute it. There are some small hints that Harris could be to the left of Biden on the issue. But there are also plenty of reasons to think she would approach the issue similarly to him, and that her divergence from Biden could come down to speech style rather than policy.  The case for Harris as being potentially more sympathetic to Palestinian interests is primarily based on subtle rhetorical signals. In March, Harris delivered a speech that included some of the most overtly critical statements about Israel’s operation issued by the Biden administration, acknowledging the situation in Gaza as a “catastrophe.” Moreover, that speech might have been even more pointed had it not been softened by her colleagues. NBC News, citing current and former officials, reported that “the original draft of her remarks was harsher on Israel in describing the dire humanitarian situation for Palestinians in Gaza and the need for more aid.” White House National Security Council officials reportedly “toned down” parts of her speech. (A Harris spokesperson at the time called the portrayal ""inaccurate."") Later that month Harris said in an interview that she didn’t rule out “consequences” for Israel if it launched an invasion of Rafah, which was at the time a stronger warning to Israel than any Biden official had made to date. As Politico reported at the time, Harris “has consistently gone further than President Joe Biden by at least half a step” in her rhetoric criticizing Israel. And in an interview with The Nation, Harris at least came across as more specifically attentive to the suffering of Gazans — and U.S. protesters on their behalf — than Biden. However, Harris’ criticisms of Israel, while notable, have been modest in scope, and might appear stronger than they are because Biden has set such a low bar. As independent journalist Spencer Ackerman has pointed out, in her March speech, Harris might have sounded more upset by the humanitarian horror show than Biden, but she refused to condemn or fully critique Israel’s policy that helped give rise to it: the collective punishment of Gaza by vastly restricting food, electricity and supplies in violation of international law. Harris' Nation interview might have sounded humane, but she made no substantive policy statements and declined to clarify which, if any, protesters she felt were right. And Harris’ saying Israel might face “consequences” over Rafah was not a red line comment, and hardly guarantees that she has the resolve to confront Israel in a meaningful manner.  From the beginning of Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 war crimes, the Biden administration has hinted that it could do something but has basically done nothing significant about it beyond private pressure — with the exception of a temporary pause on a shipment of some of the heaviest ordinance it sends to Israel. The more one digs into Harris’ background, the case that she could be an agent of the status quo on Israel appears meatier than the case against. Her rhetoric on Israel has generally ticked all the conventional U.S. foreign policy establishment boxes, including emphasizing the “ironclad” nature of the U.S.-Israeli alliance and Israel’s right to defend itself. As a senator, she spoke twice at conferences held by the hawkish American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), pledged support for Israel’s security and described the bond between the U.S. and Israel as “unbreakable.” During her first AIPAC speech in 2017, she noted that her first act as a senator was to introduce a resolution condemning a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel. Jeremy Scahill of Drop Site News recently wrote up a comprehensive evaluation of Harris’ policy record on Israel and described her as having “hardline” support for Israel, noting, among many other things, her co-sponsoring legislation in 2017 “condemning former President Barack Obama’s decision to abstain from vetoing a UN Security Council Resolution critical of Israel.” In addition to Harris’ conventional pro-Israel positioning, her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, is reportedly likely to remain central to her foreign policy agenda. He is a longtime U.S. foreign policy establishment adviser, who seemingly aligns with a number of Biden’s views of Middle East policy. When you put all this together, the picture emerges of a politician who, at least after Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks, has a rhetorical tendency slightly to the left of Biden. But most of her public positions don’t suggest that she is ready to change the course of the U.S.-Israeli relationship in a substantial way, if at all. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a seasoned former Middle East hand, summed up his assessment this way in a recent interview with NBC News: Her views on Israel are to the “left of what Biden is prepared to do but way to the right of those who argue we need to impose costs and consequences on Israel to make it clear we’re the superpower and they’re not.” Miller's synopsis is a reminder that Harris' rhetoric could cut both ways: it could signal openness to new directions, but it could also provide cover for business as usual. The one major X factor of Harris’ worldview is she is still a relative newbie in the world of foreign policy. Her worldview is still forming, and the world is changing. It is possible that Harris’ perception of Israeli policy — like many Americans’ — was changed by Hamas’ attacks or Israel’s response to them. While newness can make some politicians more conservative, still others might feel emboldened to shake up the status quo. Harris’ newness might, theoretically, make her more more receptive to left-wing pressure on the issue. That activism is already taking place — such as a recent statement by major unions calling on the U.S. to halt military aid to Israel. Some of it is likely to be on the way — such as widely anticipated pro-Palestinian protests at the Democratic National Convention. A sustained resurgence of effective pro-Palestinian protests could extract policy wins from Harris, whether on the campaign trail or during a potential presidency. Harris will most likely try to use use ambiguity and a light touch to work to her advantage. Without doing much, she can allow many progressives to project hope onto her as an alternative to the status quo. And without doing much, she can bank on most pro-Israel supporters of the Democratic Party, who’ll most likely assume she’s still on board with the Biden-Harris foreign policy they’ve come to expect. For now, Harris appears to be treading carefully. She won’t be presiding over or attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial address to Congress on Wednesday, which a number of Democrats are boycotting. She will instead be on the campaign trail and is expected to meet with Netanyahu privately during his visit. It’s a perfect way for her to avoid any polarizing optics — or make clear to anyone exactly where she stands."
"Eyeing new polls, Team Trump pushes flawed ‘Harris Honeymoon’ memo",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 6:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-polls-2024-trump-election-kamala-harris-honeymoon-memo-rcna163401,"It’ll probably be a few days before many of the leading polling outlets release new data on the 2024 presidential race, but in the wake of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal announcement — which was just three days ago — there are some preliminary survey numbers to kick around from polls conducted after Sunday’s news. The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll, for example, found Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by 4 points, 42% to 38%, with third-party candidates in the mix, and by 2 points, 44% to 42%, in a head-to-head match-up with the former Republican president. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) The latest national NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, meanwhile, showed the Democratic VP tied with Trump in a multicandidate field, and in a head-to-head match-up, the GOP nominee was ahead by the narrowest of margins, 46% to 45%.(Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) It was against this backdrop that one of the former president’s pollsters thought it’d be a good idea to issue a memo on where things currently stand. HuffPost reported: “The coverage will be largely positive and will certainly energize Democrats and some other parts of their coalition at least in the short term,” Fabrizio wrote in his memo. “That means we will start to see public polling — particularly national public polls — where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump.” The document added that Harris is seeing a “bump” in the polls now, and this is likely to “last a while until the race settles back down.” At face value, there’s nothing especially wrong with Fabrizio’s analysis. There’s also no great mystery about the pollster’s motivation: With Biden out of the race and Trump’s advantage in national surveys slipping away, it stands to reason that the Republican’s top polling expert would issue a document that, for all intents and purposes, tells his party — and his client — “Don’t panic. This is temporary.” There is, however, a relevant detail that the memo downplayed: where Team Trump expected to be at this point. Ahead of the recent presidential debate, the GOP nominee was already well positioned in the 2024 race. After the debate, his advantage grew. Then Trump was shot, the former president named his running mate and the Republican National Convention soon followed. Right about now, in other words, most political observers — in both parties — would expect to see Trump’s lead reaching new heights. But it’s not, thanks in part to Biden’s willingness to put the country’s needs first, and in part to Democrats rallying behind Harris with great enthusiasm. The fact that the vice president is getting a “bump” isn’t a huge problem for the Republican ticket and its allies; the fact that Team Trump expected to be riding high as July came to an end, however, is far more significant."
"New Republican impeachment measure targets Harris (yes, again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-republican-impeachment-measure-targets-harris-yes-rcna163389,"As this week got underway, House Republicans were all set to add to their rather extraordinary impeachment list. In the wake of the recent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, Rep. Greg Steube of Florida announced plans to file articles of impeachment against Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina soon after took steps to force a vote on the measure. The efforts quickly proved moot: A day later, Cheatle announced her resignation. But impeachment fans didn’t have to wait too long for the GOP to move forward with a related gambit. The conservative Washington Times reported: At the outset, it’s worth emphasizing that the California Democrat has never served as the administration’s “border czar,” no matter how many times Republicans and their allies claim otherwise. But that’s not the only area of concern here. For one thing, as GOP lawmakers really ought to know, impeaching a sitting vice president over policy disagreements is ridiculous. For another, if seeing the words “Ogles,” “Harris” and “impeachment” in the same sentence rings a bell, there’s a good reason for that: This same highly controversial congressman first introduced an impeachment resolution against the vice president last summer. The far-right Tennessean’s measure didn’t go anywhere, so he apparently decided to unveil a new one because —well, just because. But stepping back, there’s a larger context to all of this: Much of the House Republican Conference seems to look at impeachment campaigns as toys to be pulled off the shelf when they’re bored. In fact, it’s time to update the big list: President Joe Biden: There is absolutely no evidence uncovered by Republicans that the incumbent Democrat has actually committed any high crimes, but as of this morning, there are literally seven different impeachment resolutions pending in the House targeting the sitting president. Vice President Kamala Harris: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Harris in the last Congress (I still don’t understand why) and it picked up two co-sponsors. Ogles, meanwhile, has unveiled two resolutions over the last 13 months. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: For the first time in American history, the House voted earlier this year to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary, targeting Mayorkas despite lacking evidence of high crimes. Attorney General Merrick Garland: Several GOP lawmakers, including former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have raised the prospect of impeaching the nation’s chief law enforcement official. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a pending impeachment resolution against Garland a while back, as did Rep. Scott Perry, who also unveiled a similar resolution. Secretary of State Antony Blinken: For reasons that remain fuzzy, Republican Rep. Ralph Norman introduced an impeachment resolution last summer targeting the nation’s chief diplomat. Rep. Dave Schweikert also raised the specter of impeaching Blinken. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin: Nearly a year ago, Rep. Cory Mills of Florida introduced a resolution to impeach the Pentagon chief, and it managed to pick up three GOP co-sponsors. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg: A handful of congressional Republicans have endorsed impeaching Buttigieg, though formal resolutions have not yet been introduced. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona: Though this effort hasn’t yet moved beyond the discussion phase, Cardona is apparently in the mix. The New York Times reported last fall that “some” GOP lawmakers would like to impeach the education secretary. FBI Director Chris Wray: Schweikert also made behind-the-scenes comments suggesting the FBI director handpicked by Trump might face some kind of impeachment threat. Soon after, Greene introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Wray, which has picked up a half-dozen GOP co-sponsors. Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia: Greene, apparently upset about criminal cases against accused Jan. 6 defendants, has also introduced an impeachment resolution going after the federal prosecutor. (It has four Republican co-sponsors.) Taken together, the House Republicans' broader impeachment list now includes the sitting president, sitting vice president, six Cabinet secretaries, the director of the FBI and a largely unknown federal prosecutor. White House spokesperson Ian Sams told NBC News earlier this year, “House Republicans are treating impeachments like an Oprah audience giveaway. They are disregarding the Constitution for the sake of cheap, baseless political stunts, instead of focusing on the issues Americans care about, and it lays bare how extreme they have become.”"
Andy Beshear’s perfect response to JD Vance makes his case to be Harris’ running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 3:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/andy-beshear-kamala-harris-vp-rcna163228,"In early 2023, Kentucky Republicans launched an all-out attack on transgender children, trans families and the state’s broader LGBTQ community. The GOP’s supermajorities in the state House and Senate spent much of that year’s general session constructing and passing Senate Bill 150, one of the most heinous, restrictive, anti-trans bills in the country. One day during this hateful effort, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear traveled to my small, rural town in the middle of his re-election campaign to present a check for tourism and sidewalk improvements near an elementary school.  A standing-room-only crowd gathered in the conference room of our police department. I watched the governor go around and, as he always did, shake every hand. A number of local Republicans chatted as happily with him as everyone else.  When he shook my hand, he smiled and joked, “Long time no see!” as I had just seen him from a distance a few days earlier at the state Capitol, where he’d spoken at a rally for the pro-LGBTQ Fairness Campaign. “You doin’ OK?” he asked. I immediately thought back to some of the truly ignorant legislative committee meetings I’d covered concurrent with that rally, and how many lawmakers appeared, at best, indifferent to the suffering they were about to cause with SB 150. “To be honest, governor,” I replied, “I cried all the way home from the Capitol last Friday.” We talked privately for a few minutes about the bill. Then he looked me in the eye. “Hang in there,” he said with boy-next-door sincerity. “Remember, we are all children of God.” This may sound like an odd conversation for a regular citizen to have with a governor. But I can tell you it felt completely normal to talk to him — to Andy, as Kentuckians began calling him during the pandemic — in this honest, very basic, human way. With Vice President Kamala Harris now the de facto presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, many consider Beshear one of the most likely choices as her running mate. If he can’t deliver Republican-dominated Kentucky — and, let’s be honest, no one could — what does Beshear bring to a national ticket? The basics. His principled rejection of public mudslinging; his active listening skills, positivity and kindness; and his down-to-earth, Mr. Rogers-like ability to communicate with people no matter their party registration, which is how he won re-election. After years of Trumpian lies, fearmongering and divisiveness, I think we are starving for this. And Beshear, unlike former President Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance, has a sense of Kentuckians — and Americans — that goes beyond stereotypes concocted for a book. “I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like because let me just tell you JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said on MSNBC earlier this week. “The nerve that he has to call the people of Eastern Kentucky lazy? Listen, these are the hardworking coal miners that powered the industrial revolution. … We should be thanking them, not calling them lazy.” What Vance — who was raised in Ohio, not Kentucky — has in common with his new boss is that they are both slick, millionaire opportunists who exploit regular working folks.  Despite the bad impression our Republican state legislators create, Kentuckians are some of the most generous, welcoming people you will meet. I was born and raised in Missouri; my husband hails from Indiana. But after our son went to the University of Kentucky, he loved the state so much that he stayed. After a decade in Silicon Valley — where my husband worked in the tech industry and, yes, where JD Vance made his money as a venture capitalist — we wanted to be closer to our family and decided to join our son here. In our first days after moving, our new neighbors threw a picnic bonfire for us in freezing cold January. Beshear reflects that welcoming nature. Long before the GOP’s anti-trans fearmongering in 2023, right-wing activists were circulating a photo of Beshear with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an activist drag troupe, in an effort to hurt him with the Kentucky electorate.  “This is what our Democrat governor is about today,” a Republican state senator claimed. “These are the values that the Democratic Party of today is out there trying to convince our children’s the right way to live.” Conservatives predicted Beshear would run from the photo. Instead, he embraced it. “Everyone in Kentucky counts,” he told a local news station. “I would absolutely take that picture again.” That approach has paid off: In last November’s gubernatorial election, Beshear won with more than 52% of the vote (up from 49% four years earlier). A month before, I received a Facebook message from a prominent, lifelong Republican in my tiny, rural town. “Yes, I am a Republican,” he wrote, “BUT I AM VOTING FOR ANDY. He is what is best for Ky and has done an excellent job as governor.” He would do an excellent job as vice president, too.  Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign.

Here are 4 things to watch for during Biden’s historic speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-prime-time-address-wednesday-rcna163352,"President Joe Biden’s prime-time address Wednesday is designed to tell the nation — and, frankly, the rest of the world — “what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people.” We all have questions.  Biden’s speech caps a truly wild few weeks in what has become a truly unprecedented election campaign. It all started at the end, following Biden’s disastrous debate performance. (As a reminder, that was less than four weeks ago.) Two weeks after the debate, as Biden’s critics continued to call for an internal reckoning, a would-be assassin climbed onto a Pennsylvania roof and almost killed former President Donald Trump in the middle of an otherwise unremarkable weekend rally. This act of violence was followed by the political earthquake of Biden’s withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket.   In between these political earthquakes, Biden hosted a NATO summit, sat for two prime-time interviews and addressed the nation about the attempt on Trump’s life. All to end up in isolation at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware to recover from Covid.  Now, we will hear from the president directly again. This is the right move. But because it is a formal address, do not expect a speech that dives too heavily in politics. Here are four things to watch for Wednesday night.  First, this is not a farewell address; it is a “there is still work to be done speech.” While Biden will no doubt highlight some of the many accomplishments of his administration, it is equally important that he present what he still hopes to accomplish. His decision to drop out of the campaign makes him, surprisingly, a lame-duck president. But that should not mean he sits back and wastes the remaining five months of 2024. I would love, for example, to hear him expand on his promise to lower prescription drug costs for all people, not just those on Medicare Part B. Second, Biden must forcefully push back on the un-American rhetoric being spewed by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson, R-La., has gone on record demanding that Biden resign immediately, claiming that if he “is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president.” Frankly, it is disgraceful that Johnson would use his platform to even suggest that Biden is not fit for office at such a critical time. To undermine the American commander in chief when it has become clear that he is not running for re-election is dangerous, irresponsible and mean.  Up until this point, Biden has emphasized his work on foreign policy. This should continue, as there remains an incredible amount of good work to be done by one of the world’s most respected elder statesmen. Hopefully Biden will be able to secure more funding for Ukraine and Taiwan, two countries that Trump may turn his back on if he wins in November.  Last, it is important that Biden works to reassure the country that despite what can feel like overwhelming partisanship and rhetoric, the democracy that he has spent the last 3½ years defending is strong enough to survive and prosper. And that he will continue working to defend and bolster its foundations for as long as he possibly can.     Biden has been called our country’s consoler in chief, and after the last month, we could really use some reassurance.  "
The right pushed an absurd conspiracy theory about Biden after he dropped out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-conspiracy-theory-dead-covid-rcna163301,"As Republicans scramble to shift gears against a new Democratic presidential nominee, a conspiracy theory about President Joe Biden emerged over the past few days, one that purported a kind of “Weekend at Bernie’s” situation involving the president. Yes, that sounds ridiculous. But after the president‘s announcement that he would no longer run for re-election, the ludicrous claim gained some traction in right-wing circles: that Biden, who tested positive for Covid-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas on Friday, was either dead or severely incapacitated. (Biden's decision to bow out of the race was not attributed to any specific medical issue.) Several Fox News anchors cast doubt on Biden’s whereabouts on Sunday. Bret Baier said it was “disconcerting” that Biden had not been seen. His co-host Dana Perino said, “I hope he’s fine. But you can forgive people for wondering if we are really living ‘Weekend at Bernie’s’ right now. Proof of life, please.” An account associated with Donald Trump's presidential campaign posted a clip of the exchange on X and implied that Harris was somehow behind the mystery. On Monday morning, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., similarly demanded “proof of life from Joe Biden” in a post on X, adding that he should “discuss if he’s aware that he dropped out.” Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk then claimed on social media platform X that he had a “lead” that Biden was “dying or possibly already dead.” His account later shared a link to an unverified story, attributed entirely to anonymous sources, that Biden had suffered a “full-blown medical emergency.” Right-wing billionaire Bill Ackman also suggested that Biden’s Sunday letter was suspicious because it had a digital signature. Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, announced a press gaggle on Tuesday afternoon for the purpose of questioning why Biden hadn’t “been seen since Kamala’s Coup” (despite the demonstrable fact that Biden had been). The idea that Biden was dead or near death, and that Democrats were somehow hiding it from the public — and from a White House press corps that is voracious for scoops — is deeply unserious. There is no evidence whatsoever that the president was not simply recovering from Covid. But such unfounded conspiracy theories have often found a credulous audience among the right, where claims have long festered that Biden is a puppet of Democratic Party “elites” (a group that somehow excludes the president himself). Meanwhile, Biden was seen boarding Air Force One in Delaware on Tuesday. White House physician Kevin O’Connor said in a memo released the same day that the president's Covid “symptoms have resolved.” Biden is set to speak from the Oval Office on Wednesday about his decision to drop out of the presidential race."
Trump’s latest praise for Elon Musk should have us all concerned,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 4:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-elon-musk-project-2025-zuckerberg-rcna163339,"Happy Tuesday! Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week’s top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. In a rambling tangent over the weekend, Donald Trump boasted about how uber-rich right-winger Elon Musk reportedly is planning to spend $45 million a month on a pro-Trump super PAC and suggested that making the X owner’s life more comfortable should be a priority. “We have to make life good for our smart people, you know? We have some smart people,” Trump told rallygoers in Grand Rapids, Michigan, adding: “We have to make life good for our smart people, and he’s as smart as you get.” It was yet another authoritarian-sounding indicator that Trump would prioritize making life easier on uber-wealthy tech executives in his corner — like Musk, who seems to be living a pretty rich life already — if he regains the White House. Trump, who reportedly has offered oil executives favorable policy in exchange for donations, is behaving as though he’s indebted to Musk and other big donors. Musk reportedly pushed Trump to select Sen. JD Vance, someone else who has made a fortune from the tech industry, as his running mate. And Vance is the guy who reportedly courted Silicon Valley executives to throw their weight behind Trump. If the GOP ticket wins, we’re likely going to be living under a far-right technocracy. In a recent sit-down interview with right-wing commentator Jordan Peterson, Musk went on a disturbing diatribe claiming that “the woke mind virus” had killed his adult trans child, who is still living. The remarks provide some insight into Musk’s perverse bigoted ideology and what may have helped inspired it. Read more at USA Today.

The racist right-wing attacks on Kamala Harris have begun,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-republicans-racist-attacks-trump-rcna163264,"As Democrats largely coalesce around Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, some politicians and pundits on the right have resorted to racist dog whistles in their attacks on the vice president, a Black and South Asian American woman. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called Harris a “DEI hire.” Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., claimed that many Democrats feel they must support Harris’ candidacy “because of her ethnic background.” Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Donald Trump’s running mate, said Harris does not feel “grateful” for the country. “I never hear that gratitude come through when I listen to Kamala Harris,” Vance said at a rally in Ohio. Former Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested that Harris is inarticulate and lazy, two pervasive negative stereotypes that are used to disparage Black Americans. “She does not speak well, she does not work hard, she doesn’t inspire anyone,” Conway said. The ugly attacks on Harris started even before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race Sunday and endorsed her to run in his place. As Democrats began openly defecting after Biden’s debate performance and the discussion about who would replace him at the top of the ticket ramped up, so did the claim that Harris was only in her position because of identity politics, and not because she earned the spot on her merits. The New York Post recently published a column by Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino, who warned about Harris becoming the country’s “first DEI president.” Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump White House aide and a prominent figure on the right, echoed a similar insult shortly after: “She’s a DEI hire, right? She’s a woman! She’s colored! Therefore, she’s got to be good.” In a way, these Republicans are following the example that their standard-bearer has set. Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, has called people of color “animals” and elevated racist conspiracy theories against nonwhite opponents — including fellow Republicans. He has attacked the appearance of some women while sexualizing others. Trump has also attacked Harris personally. In 2020, after Biden picked her as his running mate, Trump helped fuel a false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory about her and also called her a “monster,” “nasty” and “the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate.” More recently, he has mocked her laughter and tried to put down her intelligence."
I’m the youngest Jewish member of Congress. Here’s why I’m not attending Netanyahu’s address.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netanyahu-address-congress-jacobs-israel-rcna163137,"It’s never easy being Jewish in today’s world, but the past 10 months have been especially excruciating. Like millions of Jews around the world, I’m still grappling with the aftermath of Hamas’ horrific attack on Oct. 7 and the sharp rise in antisemitism that we’ve seen since. And I’ve also been deeply alarmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s brutal, unrelenting military operation that has reportedly left more than 39,000 Palestinians dead. This response hasn’t been proportional, strategic or effective — and I can’t in good conscience condone it by attending Netanyahu’s joint address to Congress. I’m deeply connected to my Jewish roots and to Israel. As a child, my summers were split between visiting my family in Tel Aviv and helping to host my Israeli cousins in San Diego and going to camp together at the Jewish Community Center. I have traveled from the northernmost to the southernmost parts of Israel, prayed at the Western Wall, spent time with Bedouin families in Segev Shalom, stayed in Sha’ar HaNegev — San Diego’s sister city, which suffered a brutal onslaught on Oct. 7 — and visited Gaza and the West Bank. As a member of Congress, I’ve traveled to Israel twice on official visits — during the first, I met with then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and during the second, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu after he regained power. In the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, Israel had the right to defend itself after Hamas’ brutal attack left more than 1,200 civilians dead, thousands more injured, assaulted and traumatized, and more than 200 hostages taken. But there is absolutely no justification for leveling Gaza, displacing nearly its entire civilian population and destroying generations of Palestinian families. Civilian infrastructure from schools to refugee camps to ambulances to hospitals to water facilities has been demolished. Humanitarian aid can’t be delivered and distributed effectively, leaving 1 million Palestinians to experience the highest levels of starvation soon. Young Palestinians who have survived this war are spending their childhoods lining up outside food banks and scavenging for makeshift food alternatives. For 10 months, the Israeli military, under the prime minister’s direction, has conducted intense bombardments on Gaza. Yet Hamas hasn’t been eliminated, and Israel isn’t any safer. From my work at the State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, I know that civilian casualties fuel recruitment, radicalization and support of terrorism. Every civilian casualty that results from the Israeli government’s strategy provides an opportunity for Hamas and other extremist groups to prey on. There’s no justification for terrorism and nothing acceptable about Hamas’ actions — and that only makes it more important that Israel acts in a way that doesn’t drive more recruits into Hamas’ ranks. Unfortunately, Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn’t have a sound plan to avoid that outcome — or a plan to bring the hostages home or secure lasting peace and security. He has lost significant support within Israel, with thousands of Israelis taking to the streets recently to call for his resignation. Many believe that Netanyahu has deprioritized the hostages and continued this war to avoid a looming political reckoning. The reality is: There is no military solution to this conflict. Even a far more precise and better-executed military campaign than the one being waged won’t work without acknowledging the root political issues. Israel can effectively counter the threat posed by Hamas only by first addressing the core grievances that have fueled recruitment and support for decades: the lack of a Palestinian state and Palestinians’ right to self-determination. And yet, Prime Minister Netanyahu appears unmotivated to reach a cease-fire deal and continues to repel the idea of a two-state solution, and he has even used this conflict to advance Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Growing up, I was taught about Jews’ sacred task of tikkun olam — to repair the world. It’s our responsibility as Jews to speak out against injustice and work to make the world a better place. It is because of my Jewish upbringing and values that I can’t attend Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address. My faith isn’t a shield or an excuse for destruction. And my presence at Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address would be weaponized as false proof that I support him and his government’s conduct during this war, which I vehemently oppose. Partisan grandstanding before Congress doesn’t advance the cause of peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the region. It won’t bring the hostages home. And it won’t end this war, deliver humanitarian aid to those in need or give Palestinian children back their childhoods. When the stakes are so high, my faith compels me to reject performative gestures and focus instead on tangible actions to end this war."

Trump creates new uncertainty about possible debate with Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:49 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-uncertainty-debate-kamala-harris-election-2024-abc-rcna163310,"Donald Trump spent the better part of a year begging for a debate against President Joe Biden. The former Republican president worked from the assumption that he’d fare well against the Democratic incumbent — and as it turned out, Biden’s stumbles during his showdown with Trump were so significant that they helped push him from the 2024 race. In theory, there’s no need to dramatically alter the schedule, since the GOP nominee can simply debate Vice President Kamala Harris instead of Biden. In practice, it’s proving to be a bit more complicated than that. A few hours after the incumbent president ended his re-election bid, Trump published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC News in September. He apparently has a problem with that: The Republican called the network “fake”; he deliberately misspelled George Stephanopoulos’ name in a juvenile way; and he concluded, “I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.” Soon after, Politico reported, “One GOP source tells me he doubts Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris — he’ll likely call her an illegitimate candidate.” Trump doubled down on his original message shortly after midnight this morning, again attacking the network. “ABC Fake News is such a joke, among the absolute WORST in the business,” the former president wrote adding that ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” It’s a far cry from the “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE” message Trump pushed while pleading for a debate with Biden. This afternoon, however, the Republican nominee participated in a press call and said he’s “absolutely” prepared to debate Harris — more than once — though he’s “not thrilled” about ABC hosting the event. As part of the same comments, Trump told reporters, “Well, I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden. But I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different.” So, which is it? Will Trump face off against Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, or not? One possibility is the former president is scared of the Californian and looking for excuses to bow out. Another possibility is that Trump is engaging in a mind-numbing “work the refs” exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff. Either way, the Republican appears a lot less eager to share a stage with the incumbent vice president than he did with Biden."
Black men backing Kamala Harris fuel another fundraising spree,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-win-with-black-men-fundraising-rcna163280,"Thousands of Black men joined a virtual conference Monday night to fundraise for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, according to the event's organizers. The massive turnout helped dispel toxic myths about Black men’s willingness to back a woman candidate.  The event was hosted by “Win With Black Men,” a collective of organizers modeled after “Win With Black Women,” the activist group that held its own, massive Zoom call to fundraise for Harris on Sunday.  Journalist Roland Martin; activists Michael Blake, Khalil Thompson and Quentin James; and political commentator Bakari Sellers hosted the men's conference. Sellers gave a passionate endorsement of Harris while explaining how she was one of the first people to call him when his baby daughter was very ill. In various corners of social media, there’s been speculation — fueled by social media chatter and, in part, by conservatives who are hardly authorities on Black voters — that Black men will largely be averse to voting for Harris because she's a Black woman. Similarly offensive suggestions were made about Black men in Georgia’s 2022 gubernatorial election when Stacey Abrams was on the ballot in a rematch against Republican incumbent Brian Kemp, but those speculations never came to fruition. And Monday was a powerful show of Black men’s broad support for the Harris campaign. A “Win With Black Men” organizer reported more than 53,000 Black men joined the virtual event on Monday and raised $1.3 million in four hours. The organizers say half of that will go to the Harris campaign, and half will go to organizations that specialize in mobilizing Black men to vote. MSNBC hasn’t independently verified the fundraising numbers. The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. The energy surrounding the event was palpable enough to inspire organizers to commit to similar, pro-Harris conferences geared toward other demos — like white women.  There was an array of speakers at this virtual conference, including actors Don Cheadle and Bill Bellamy; comedian Bill Bellamy; Democratic lawmakers Raphael Warnock, the senator from Georgia, and Maxwell Frost, the congressman from Florida; faith leaders Bishop William Barber, Pastor Jamal Bryant, and the Rev. Mark Thompson; Mayors Brandon Scott of Baltimore and Brandon Johnson of Chicago; as well as labor leaders and community organizers.  But the message was essentially the same from all of the speakers: They may be men, but they aren’t MAGA men who want to be conscripted into Donald Trump's hypermasculine crusades. Speakers took turns bigging up Harris’ leadership qualities, dispelling myths about Harris’ prosecutorial record in California, encouraging Black men voters to reject racist and sexist attacks on Harris, and calling on viewers of the conference to reach out to other Black men who may feel disaffected by the political system and may be considering not voting.  For all the breathless talk in the media and online about Black men allegedly swinging in Trump’s favor this election cycle, Monday’s meetup underscored the political reality: There are many Black men — like there are many Black women — firmly in Harris’ corner. And they're putting their money where their mouth is, adding what's already been a massive fundraising haul for Harris in the first few days of her campaign.

Biden ends 2024 ticket saga with 'Game of Thrones' finale,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-biden-game-of-thrones-2024-rcna163206,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 22 episode of ""The ReidOut."" If you live long enough and observe politics long enough, you’re liable to see some amazing things. Over the weekend, political observers, journalists and historians got to witness one of them.   It was an event in the style of a ""Game of Thrones"" finale: a clash between two of the most powerful figures in modern political history, Nancy Pelosi — arguably the most effective House speaker of the modern era and the current speaker emerita — and Joe Biden, the president of the United States. Pelosi, who ceded the leadership of the House Democratic caucus to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries more than a year ago, led what could be described as a political coup d’etat against Biden, whose performance in a debate three weeks ago literally sent his party into an existential panic. A panic that became the fixation of the media, and a cause among rich Democratic donors, op-ed writers, thought leaders and elected Democrats on Capitol Hill. Collectively they came to see Biden as a liability, not just for the general election against Donald Trump, but their own re-election chances as well. The increasingly vocal and urgent calls for Biden to step aside and make way for a younger candidate who could more effectively take the fight to Trump divided the party along racial lines, with Black and Latino members seeing a deeper play at work — to oust not just Biden but Harris, too. As the fury inside the party heated up, Democratic donors began to make the money dry up, threatening not to put another penny into the race until Biden was no longer the nominee. Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Hakeem Leader Jeffries appeared to let it become public that the party believed Biden should go — Olenna Tyrell-style: “I want him to know it was me.” Over the weekend, as Biden recovered from Covid, holed up in his Delaware home with his family and close friends around, came the coup de grace. Biden’s closest aides shared catastrophic internal polling with him and first lady Jill Biden that showed a certain defeat in November, not just for Biden but for Democrats down ticket, too. And so, Biden relented, putting his country before his ambition and announcing he would no longer seek a second term. The Pelosi coup had succeeded. But Biden — a man who has been in politics since he was 29 years old as a senator and committee chairman, a two-term vice president, and the president of the United States, a man who has endured excruciating and repeated personal loss and tragedy and allowed it to fuel his determination to save the soul of this country — had one more card to play. Less than a half hour after he announced his withdrawal, Biden exercised what in many ways is the greatest power any leader has: the power to choose your own successor. Biden bypassed the rumored wishes of the Pelosi and donor crew and fully endorsed his historic vice president to be the Democratic nominee. He threw his support behind Harris, the would-be first woman, first Black woman, and first Asian American president, on the very day state party delegations were meeting to work out the votes in the upcoming Democratic convention. The Biden endorsement sent a lightning bolt through American politics, unlike anything I’ve seen since then-Sen. Barack Obama made his debut at the 2004 Democratic Convention, prompting Oprah Winfrey to declare him “the one.” The Biden nod prompted state parties and over 200 Democratic lawmakers, one by one, to follow their president’s lead and endorse Harris. As did the various governors whose names have been tossed around as possible rivals for the nomination. As each one endorsed her, they effectively took their names off the list of competitors, allowing Harris to bask in the glow of a captivated media and unbelievable, record-breaking fundraising. Almost exactly 24 hours after Biden’s announcement, Pelosi also fell in line, giving her full-throated endorsement to Harris. In other words, Joe Biden, at what looked like his moment of greatest political weakness, reasserted himself as the leader of his party, from his sick bed. He checkmated the former speaker's gambit by writing the epilogue to his own legacy in the history books: Her name is Kamala Harris, first of her name.

We studied attacks on women candidates. Nobody got it worse than Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-racist-sexist-attacks-disinformation-rcna163265,"On Sunday, when President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, I already knew what vitriol would be unleashed against her online.  Four years ago, I led a study investigating gendered abuse and disinformation against female political candidates. Over two months, we found 336,000 pieces of abuse or disinformation targeting just 13 candidates across six social media platforms. Whether Democrat or Republican, young or old, urban or rural, these women were subjected to sex-based falsehoods and hate that their male counterparts weren’t. Of all the abuse and disinformation that we identified, 78 percent targeted Harris, then a U.S. senator from California seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Why? In part, because she was a high-profile woman running for the highest office in the land. But Harris is not only a woman; she is a Black, South Asian woman. Across our dataset and other research in the space, it is clear that women of color and other intersectional identities receive more abuse, and more vitriolic abuse, than their white counterparts. In 2020, we observed three groups of abusive or false content targeting Harris. In the minutes after President Joe Biden’s endorsement, and the days since, such content has again flourished across social media. The most prevalent were sexualized narratives falsely claiming that Harris had “slept her way to the top” because she had a relationship with California politician Willie Brown in the 1990s. The relationship, which was not a secret and occurred long after Brown had separated from his wife, ended eight years before Harris sought elected office. This narrative includes the use of graphic, misogynistic keywords and nicknames. It also includes image-based abuse, “cheap faking” Harris into lingerie and suggestive positions. The most prominent deep fake pornography website also hosts more than 10 pages of videos that insert the vice president into pornography. The intent of this content is clear: to humiliate Harris and undermine her credibility and fitness for office. In our 2020 study, we found that users engaging with this disinformation and abuse were more likely to engage with other abuse and disinformation about Harris.  And there is plenty. Harris’ detractors promote transphobic disinformation, which is frequently employed against women in positions of power. In 2020, users claimed Harris couldn’t possibly have risen to prominence without having secretly been a man. They edited photos of her to make her appear more masculine, and QAnon conspiracy theorists even created an elaborate backstory about her past life. Those narratives have surfaced again this week, along with racist allegations, claiming Harris is not eligible for the presidency because her parents were immigrants. Now, as in 2020, users frequently claim Harris isn’t Black enough or Indian enough to claim those identities. Our foreign adversaries are watching and happily exploiting American misogyny and racism to their own advantage. The same false, gendered and sexualized narratives that Americans engaged with in 2020 were reflected in Russian propaganda outlets as well. One Russian state media outlet, Zvezda, wrote in 2020: “Kamala claims to be the descendant of oppressed African Americans, but how many slaves did her great-grandfather have? How did having an affair at work help her advance her career?”  Other Russian outlets also made a mockery of the Biden administration’s attempt to create a diverse administration, describing these attempts as “the smirk of political correctness” and “quotas for women and colored people.” As diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts have become a lightning rod for the American right wing, Republicans are echoing that narrative and claiming that Harris is a “DEI” candidate, ignoring her track record as a district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president. It’s important to label these lies for what they are: an attempt to undermine a powerful woman’s decades of public service because of her gender, her ethnic background and her skin color. Sadly, Harris’ experience is not unique: By virtue of simply being women in public life, female politicians across the political spectrum are subjected to vile gender-based hate, lies and even violent threats. This isn’t “just part of the job” because the job looks entirely different if you happen to be a man. Let’s be frank: The Republican Party, which appears to be scandalized by a consensual relationship that Harris had over 30 years ago, seems not to care one iota about its nominee’s multiple affairs, credible allegations of sexual misconduct assault, or a jury finding him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.  Harris’ candidacy and the abuse that targets her offer women of all political stripes a warning. Gendered disinformation and abuse — which happen on both sides of the political spectrum — undermine women’s participation in public life. They dissuade generations of young women, who may not want to face such hate, from seeking public office.  But her candidacy also offers us hope. If Democratic and Republican women both condemn the gendered and sexualized attacks against Harris, then we would send a powerful message that there is no place for misogyny in American politics and chart a course toward equal representation. A Harris administration won’t end the online abuse of women overnight, but it will deflate its perceived power. Online misogynists are loud and ugly, but they are outnumbered, and they can’t stop progress. "
"Following jury’s verdict, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez to resign",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 11:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jurys-verdict-democratic-sen-bob-menendez-resign-rcna163295,"A week after a jury found Sen. Bob Menendez guilty on 16 corruption counts, it was clear that the New Jersey Democrat’s future was bleak. Indeed, the question wasn’t whether the senator would resign, but when. The answer has now come into focus. NBC News reported: The longtime senator didn’t have much of a choice. Senate Republicans have been silent, but Senate Democrats have been firm in arguing that Menendez needs to step down. Some, including Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, raised the prospect of expelling their criminal colleague if he failed to resign. Now, evidently, that won’t be necessary. The developments mark an extraordinary fall from grace for the once-powerful chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Revisiting our earlier coverage, federal prosecutors first indicted Menendez in late September, alleging that the New Jersey Democrat received “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in bribes and used his influence to benefit the Egyptian government, among others. Though the senator has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty in court, it was difficult to deny the seriousness of the allegations. According to the Justice Department, Menendez received cash, gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low- or no-show job and a luxury vehicle. Complicating matters, the longtime lawmaker struggled to present much of a public defense. Roughly three weeks later, the senator was indicted again, and those charges accused him of providing sensitive information to the Egyptian government in exchange for bribes. What’s more, prosecutors alleged that Menendez acted as a foreign agent while serving as the chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That was in October. In January, the incumbent lawmaker faced another round of criminal allegations, with prosecutors claiming he took improper actions in support of Qatar as recently as 2021 and 2022. In March, Menendez confronted still more charges, alleging that he and his wife conspired to obstruct justice. It was against this backdrop that the Justice Department — the one that Republicans claim is targeting the White House’s opponents — successfully prosecuted the Democratic lawmaker ahead of his re-election bid. As for Menendez’s seat, Democratic Rep. Andy Kim already appears well positioned to win this year’s Senate race in the Garden State. In the interim, The New York Times reports that New Jersey’s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, is expected to appoint a replacement who would serve until January. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Kamala Harris has a lot of VP options. She should choose Josh Shapiro.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 10:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-josh-shapiro-vp-pennsylvania-rcna163093,"Now that President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, it seems increasingly likely that Harris will be the party’s choice to run against former President Donald Trump in November.  After all, a wave of endorsements immediately flooded in. The Clintons, John Kerry, 32 senators and 181 House Democrats quickly voiced their support. Given these endorsements and Harris’ ability to swiftly incorporate Biden’s campaign infrastructure, she’s the clear front-runner for the nomination at the August convention. As Harris solidifies her position, attention turns to her potential running mate. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro stands out as a compelling choice, bringing political acumen, intelligence and relevant skills to the ticket.  Despite his relatively short tenure as governor, Shapiro has already made significant strides. He demonstrated interstate cooperation by partnering with New Jersey to form a task force strengthening labor law enforcement and worker protections. This showcases his ability to collaborate across state lines to achieve progressive goals.  As attorney general of Pennsylvania, Shapiro rooted out sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Combine his background in fighting for survivors of sexual abuse with Harris’ background as a prosecutor protecting victims of sex crimes, and the choice between the Democratic ticket and one headlined by Trump, a sexual predator, is a stark one for voters. Shapiro’s initiatives in Pennsylvania have not only bolstered his popularity but also solidified his standing as a leader capable of bridging partisan divides. His approach to governance emphasizes practical solutions and effective communication, qualities that are increasingly valued in today’s polarized political landscape. Shapiro’s success in navigating complex policy issues — such as labor law enforcement and infrastructure projects — underscores his ability to deliver tangible results while maintaining broad public support.  Shapiro also has a skill the White House desperately needs right now: showcasing government achievements.  As we saw when Shapiro handled the I-95 bridge reconstruction this year, Shapiro knows how to show off the great work the government does. From the moment of destruction to completion, Shapiro documented the rebuild, effectively demonstrating how the government works for its people. This skill is crucial, considering recent polls indicate many voters are unaware of major legislative achievements of the Biden-Harris administration, like the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act.  Harris needs a political ally who is not only skilled in governance but also adept at communicating these achievements to the public. Politically, Shapiro brings advantages that could prove vital in securing the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.  While Biden’s 2020 win was great, his margins in key states like Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were narrow. Shapiro’s popularity in Pennsylvania could help secure this crucial swing state. A Quinnipiac University poll in January found Shapiro with a 59% approval rating, well ahead of the 40% approval rating Biden had in the same poll.  When he ran for governor in 2022, Shapiro won in Erie County by 15 percentage points, a key battleground for Democrats who won it twice in 2008 and 2012 with Obama. Erie County is a crucial battleground for the state, where turnout can be a make-or-break factor; just ask Hillary Clinton. If Democrats do not win these key Pennsylvania communities, they will struggle to win the state and consequently the White House. Shapiro’s successes in Pennsylvania can also be extrapolated to other swing states, like Michigan and Wisconsin.  Moreover, Shapiro has experience running against the radical MAGA movement; when he ran for governor, the Republican nominee, Doug Mastriano, was a right-wing fringe candidate who espoused wild conspiracy theories about chemtrails and vaccines. Shapiro was quick to defeat this MAGA-aligned candidate by focusing on kitchen table issues and uniting Pennsylvanians, leveraging his success in the attorney general’s office. A Harris-Shapiro ticket presents the best way for Democrats to win. It combines Harris’ federal experience and prosecutorial background with Shapiro’s proven track record in state governance and his ability to communicate government achievements effectively. This pairing has the potential to secure crucial swing states like Pennsylvania while also appealing to a broad spectrum of voters in Rust Belt states with similar political landscapes. The Harris campaign, by bringing in Shapiro, can effectively demonstrate how the government positively affects the lives of people in rural communities like Pennsylvania, thereby broadening the pro-working family message of the Biden-Harris administration.  As the Democratic Party looks to retain control of the White House, a Harris-Shapiro ticket would offer a blend of experience, youth and political savvy ready to pull off a historic victory that protects our democracy and ends the era of MAGA madness once and for all.  Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here. "
The Kamala Harris veepstakes has no bad options,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 12:06 PM PDT / Updated July 23, 2024, 10:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-best-running-mate-candidates-rcna163054,"UPDATE (July 23, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET): Kamala Harris' presidential campaign has requested vetting materials from five potential vice presidential contenders, NBC News reported on Tuesday. After President Joe Biden announced that he’s ending his re-election campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, there’s speculation about whom Harris might pick as her running mate in the likely scenario that she wins the Democratic nomination. NBC News has a list of potential picks, all of whom bring something unique to the table. As I see it, none of the picks mentioned would be bad by any stretch of the imagination. But there are some who I think stand apart from the rest. Narratively speaking, Kelly might offer the most upside. He’s a former naval captain turned astronaut who made a foray into politics after his wife, then-Rep. Gabby Giffords, was severely wounded in a mass shooting in Arizona. He’s a popular senator from a crucial swing state that has been trending toward Democrats in recent years. He also has been a longtime Harris supporter, having endorsed her Senate candidacy in California in 2016. His military background and outspokenness on behalf of veterans give him credence among people who have served; he would counterbalance the presence of Sen. JD Vance, a Marine veteran, on Trump’s ticket; and he also would help undermine right-wing nonsense about diversity measures being a top issue plaguing the military. Furthermore, Kelly has been vocal on the matter of immigration — a salient political issue in his home state — and earlier this year denounced Trump’s successful effort to tank bipartisan immigration legislation. Shapiro is another popular governor of a potential swing state. His 2022 defeat of MAGA extremist Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial race showed that he’s unafraid of highlighting Trumpian attacks on democracy in plain speak, and he has shown charm and deftness in interviews that could further distinguish Harris’ ticket as the youthful and exuberant one relative to Trump’s old-fashioned authoritarianism. He would also be just the second Jewish vice presidential nominee, after Joe Lieberman, which could send a powerful message in response to the documented antisemitism within the MAGA movement. Cooper, who previously served as North Carolina’s attorney general, is about to be termed out but has maintained popularity in his state despite its trend toward Republicans in recent years. Despite the GOP’s efforts to curtail his powers as governor once he was elected, Cooper has shown an ability to achieve long-sought reform — like Medicaid expansion — in a state where Republicans control the legislature. Having Cooper on the ticket with Harris could give Democrats more confidence in competing for North Carolina, particularly if — as some have predicted — extremist-friendly candidates like Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, drive Democratic turnout. At 46 years old, Beshear is the youngest potential veep pick on my list of possibles. Like Harris and Shapiro, he served as his state’s attorney general before becoming governor. Beshear’s father was a governor, so he has a political lineage in Kentucky despite the state’s conservative leanings and has won elections over MAGA candidates while being a vocal supporter of abortion rights. It seems unlikely that having Beshear on the ticket would put Kentucky in play, but he has exhibited an ability to speak to white rural voters that could certainly help Harris in key battleground states."
What the Kamala Harris 'coconut tree' meme is all about,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-meme-rcna163177,"Just two days into Vice President Kamala Harris' run for the presidency and ""coconut tree"" memes have consumed the internet. “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” Harris says, laughing before she turns dead serious. “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.” The line is from Harris' speech at a White House event for Hispanic leaders in May 2023. In fact, the Republican National Committee's GOP War Room YouTube account may have been the first to isolate that moment from her speech, posting a clip of it that very same day in an apparent attempt to paint her in a negative light. The clip gained renewed attention over the past few months, and it had become a viral meme long before President Joe Biden’s debate performance or any sincere talk about his withdrawing from the race had begun. But the meme gained real momentum in the wake of the debate as the Democratic Party started to reckon with Biden's age and fitness for office. For younger people especially, the cynicism they reported around Biden's candidacy was suddenly replaced with a hope that someone else might take over the top of the ticket. Harris' emergence as a leading contender supercharged the meme, and thus you had people online earnestly admitting to being ""coconut-pilled."" I’ve previously questioned the Biden campaign’s attempt to engineer memes to appeal to voters. Harris is different from many politicians in that she seems innately meme-able — a nebulous quality that her presidential campaign is already capitalizing on. Part of why the coconut tree meme works is because it developed organically on the internet and coincided with Harris’ abrupt and historic rise to the current top of the Democratic presidential ticket. But its stratospheric ascent in recent weeks also comes with a risk of oversaturation, especially as other politicians try to get in on the joke. After Harris announced Sunday that she intended ""to earn"" and ""to win"" the nomination, some Democrats who rushed to endorse her referenced coconut trees in some way. Harris herself has not acknowledged the meme or tried to make a funny reference to it — a move that would almost certainly curdle its charm quickly."
"Old habits die hard: Even now, Trump can’t stop going after Biden",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/old-habits-die-hard-2016-election-trump-cant-stop-going-biden-rcna163266,"During the 2016 presidential election, it made sense for Donald Trump to go after Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state was, after all, his rival at the time, and over the course of the campaign, the two traded plenty of rhetorical shots. But after Election Day 2016 had come and gone, common sense suggested that the Republican would shift his attention. He’d won the race. Clinton had exited the stage, transitioned to retirement, and expressed no interest in pursuing office again. Trump had every reason to focus on governing, and no reason to target his former rival. He did it anyway — repeatedly. In fact, when Trump launched his 2020 re-election campaign, he devoted much of his speech to Clinton, despite the fact that she wasn’t running. With just weeks remaining before Election Day 2020, Trump not only pushed then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to uncover and release Clinton emails, he also lobbied then-Attorney General Bill Barr to prosecute Clinton for reasons unknown. (This was before the GOP pretended to care about the “weaponization” of federal law enforcement.) None of this made any sense — she was neither on the ballot nor on the campaign trail — but Trump couldn’t help himself. He’d invested so much time and effort into hating Clinton, he apparently found it impossible to end his offensive. And now it’s happening again. After President Joe Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the 2024 race, it stood to reason that Trump would curtail his attacks for a painfully obvious reason: The Democrat would no longer be his opponent. There was little to be gained from additional rhetorical barrages. But just as the Republican couldn’t shake his hatred for Clinton, as The New York Times reported, he’s still ranting about Biden, too. The GOP nominee responded to Biden’s news on Sunday with ugly tirades and conspiracy theories. It was in Trump’s interest to take the high road, but he apparently didn’t care. A day later, the former president kept going. “It’s a new day and Joe Biden doesn’t remember quitting the race yesterday!” he wrote to his social media platform on Monday morning. This morning, Trump offered more of the same. I won’t pretend to know what’s on the Republican’s mind, but if Democrats are lucky, he’ll keep up the anti-Biden hysterics indefinitely."
"As Biden stands down, spotlight turns to Trump’s age and fitness",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 8:25 AM PDT / Updated July 23, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-spotlight-trumps-age-fitness-health-2024-election-rcna163226,"In the wake of last month’s presidential debate, much of the 2024 race shifted to questions about President Joe Biden’s age, health and fitness. Republicans wanted to speak of little else; Democrats fearing Biden’s electoral defeat felt compelled to go public with their concerns; and media professionals covered the conversation in granular detail. For some of Donald Trump’s detractors, this seemed wildly unfair. If the incumbent’s age and occasional difficulties are under the microscope, they asked, how is it that Biden’s rival is avoiding similar scrutiny? Isn’t the nearly-as-old Republican, who routinely seems unable to tell the difference between fiction and reality, equally deserving of the same questions? It was, and is, a fair point — and as a new Washington Post report makes clear, the spotlight is turning in ways the GOP nominee might not like. The Post’s report went on to note that Trump is “a 78-year-old with a history of heart disease and obesity,” who “has not shared any updated bloodwork results or other specific information during this campaign to help experts assess his ongoing medical risks.” To be sure, the Republican has long had a problem with transparency. He promised to release his tax returns, for example, and then went back on his word. His White House also abandoned public access to visitors’ logs. Team Trump was also less than forthcoming when it came to readouts of the then-president’s conversations with foreign leaders, and at times, those close to the Republican even tried to hide information about his golfing habits. But it’s Trump’s secrecy surrounding his health that’s relevant anew — not just because he’s now the oldest presidential nominee in American history, and not just because he’d turn 82 while in office if elected to a second term, but also because he was recently shot during an assassination attempt, and Trump and his team have been reluctant to share even basic details about the care he received after the incident. It's against this backdrop that the former president, just this morning, published an item to his social media platform that read, ""I don’t know who said it, or where it came from, perhaps the Radical Left, but I never discussed, or thought of, Jamie Dimon ... for Secretary of the Treasury."" It was just last month when Trump sat down for an interview with Bloomberg and said he'd consider JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary. I think we know how the political world would respond if this happened with Biden, which is all the more reason to take seriously questions about Trump's fitness. What's more, there’s no reason to assume these questions will go away as the new presidential race unfolds."

She has no rivals for the party’s 2024 nomination. * On a related note, the Democratic National Committee confirmed that the party will choose its presidential nominee in a virtual, online voting process by Aug. 7, which is two weeks from tomorrow. With this in mind, there’s a very good chance that Harris will choose a running mate next week. * In an extraordinary development, Harris’ new presidential campaign raised a whopping $81 million in the 24 hours following President Joe Biden’s decision to end his re-election bid. Not surprisingly, this smashed all previous records. * Speaking of fundraising, it turns out that none other than Donald Trump was a Harris donor — once in 2011, and then again in 2013. * I’d recommend taking preliminary polling with a grain of salt, but a new national survey from Quinnipiac University found Trump with a narrow, two-point lead over Harris, 49% to 47%.(Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * Harris has quickly embraced Biden’s campaign operation as her own, and the vice president asked Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chair, to stay on and run her campaign. O’Malley Dillon accepted the role. * Biden is canceling scheduled campaign events, but he’s also promised to hit the trail in support of his party’s ticket. * What happens to the millions of dollars Biden raised for his campaign now that he’s passing the torch? Reuters had a good summary. * And during an appearance on CNN, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis was asked if he’s open to serving as Harris’ running mate. “Look, if they do the polling and it turns out they need a 49-year-old balding gay Jew from Boulder, Colorado, they’ve got my number,” the Democratic governor replied."
Biden’s Historic Exit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-bidens-historic-exit-rcna163251,"A rocky few weeks for the Democrats culminated in Sunday’s extraordinary statement from President Joe Biden, announcing an end to his candidacy. , As he did so, he made space for the next generation of Democratic leaders, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to head the ticket. As the dust settles, former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri react to the president’s decision, and take stock of what’s next after Harris announced her intent to run and bring the party together to win.  Note: this is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Monday, July 22, about 9:00 a.m. on the East Coast. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m back here on a Monday with my co-pilot, Claire McCaskill. Oh my God, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, it’s really been something. We’re going to take a little time to talk about Joe Biden and how wonderful he is. But I just want to say, even though this has been an emotional roller coaster, I feel really blessed that I’ve had a front row seat. As somebody who loves politics and who is a major in political science, these are incredible times to live in. And -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- you know, I don’t know how all this is going to turn out, but, you know, I’m buckled in now and I’m ready for a wild ride because, you know, the first two loops on the roller coaster -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- are so big, but then it builds to the great big one at the end. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Claire McCaskill: I’m ready for the great big one. And I think it’s going to feel great getting to the top and fun sliding down the other way after we beat Donald Trump. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, I mean, yeah, that part of the roller coaster, I’m all down for. It is not even Labor Day, you know, because I know Labor Day is where you really buckle in to say like, okay, we’re inching up on the roller coaster and this is where it’s going to get crazy. But when we last spoke on this podcast on Friday, all eyes were on President Joe Biden and whether he’d decide to leave the race or stay in amid the deafening calls to rethink his candidacy. Claire McCaskill: And Sunday, yesterday, we all bore witness to this important next chapter of history. The president released a letter mid-afternoon announcing that, quote, “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.” Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I mean, it was stunning, right? Plus, I had talked to a lot of people at the White House on Saturday just to check in with you because I know how it is when you’re totally under siege and like all of a sudden all of your friends and all the people who wanted things for you for the last three and a half years just ghost you, right? So I wanted to check in and see how everybody was doing. And I don’t think people were misrepresenting the situation to me. I really think they thought there was no decision. He can’t speak. You know, he’s in Rehoboth. He’s recovering. People should not expect anything soon. I hope things get resolved one way or another. But there was no sense of certainty that this was going to come down on Sunday. And it didn’t even occur to me that the president could put out a piece of paper announcing this as opposed to doing a real statement. But let’s talk about why he felt the need to just go ahead and do it. I know Steve Ricchetti is really close aide, good friend of mine, I think a friend of yours too, Mike Donilon, been with him for decades and had them come to Rehoboth and talk this all through with them. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, on Saturday night. And I think the other thing that happened was there was internal polling that was done in the campaign. And I think that Ricchetti and Donilon had that data for the president on Saturday night and showed him in stark terms what was happening in the battleground states. Because there really are two races that are run, as you know very, very well, Jen. One is, yes, you want to get every vote in every state, but you have to get to 270 electoral votes. So the battleground states become dominant, especially in the closing months of the campaign. And I think when the president saw that not only had he had significant slippage with a large delta between the Senate candidates and his presidency on the ballot in the battleground states, that he was losing significant ground in states that we had considered safe -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- like New Jersey, like New Mexico, like Minnesota -- Jennifer Palmieri: Virginia, yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- like Virginia, like Colorado. These had gone from purplish-tinged to blue, really, since Barack Obama. And the fact that they were in play, I think that the culmination of all that data is what really showed him in very stark terms that what he had said, if he was shown that he could not win, he would stand aside. And I think that data told him that he could not win and so he did just that. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And the three of them sat up and wrote this letter. And just imagine how emotional that must have been for the three of them. You know, I always think in literary terms and I’m like, oh, that would be an incredible play, just that discussion, you know. And it’s something more symbolic than just a president stepping aside in this race. It is that generation, you know, the very beginning to the baby boomer generation, an older white man, being what he said he was going to be, the transition to a new generation. And not just giving way to a new candidate, giving way to a new generation, you know, a woman, a woman of color. As it feels the same way as you do, Claire, it’s a very big moment in American history and I feel lucky that we get to. I mean, some days I’m like, why do we have to live through all of this? But it is a remarkable thing to see. And I am proud of our party that unlike the Republican Party, not that there’s any comparison in any universe between Joe Biden’s, situation that he’s dealing with and Donald Trump, but still, we had a leader that was not up to the job and our party rose to the occasion and did something about it and had a leader who was, you know, was a true patriot and put his own concerns about his own future. And then even his legacy, although his legacy, I think, you know, has really been buoyed by this to do the right thing. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think his legacy will be legend in the history books at this point. Jennifer Palmieri: Legend. Claire McCaskill: It will be legend. Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, the vice president to the first black president, the president that picked a black woman as his vice president and then accomplished so much and then step aside. I mean, he’s going to be this incredible figure. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And I was proud of the fact that everyone, especially the leadership, took a day to not focus on the vice president, that most people that I watched on television and most of the statements I read and most of the traffic on social media was all about Joe Biden yesterday -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- which is appropriate. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It is appropriate. You know, I know, Jen, that a lot of us who reported accurately on what we saw at the debate have taken in a lot of negativity from a lot of Democrats who felt that we were being unfair to the president. I completely understand. I don’t discount those feelings and I get it. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It was not easy. It was really hard. But I do think it’s really important for people to realize that age was always an issue for Joe Biden. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: The debate didn’t make it an issue. It always registered in the polls. And the way that Joe Biden had to overcome that was with performance. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It was his only path to the presidency for another four years, was to overcome the concerns that voters, not necessarily the voters that are all in living on X or Insta or any of the other TikTok, but for a whole lot of Americans, it was a wait and see. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And the debate crystallized those concerns in a way that really impacted how people were responding on polls and ultimately, I believe that was the tipping point. For those people who say accurately talking about an obvious problem in our presidential candidate is what caused this, then I got to tell you, maybe they need to think about that because what our party did was 180 degrees from what the Republican Party has done. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: The Republican Party has looked at unbelievable disqualifying flaws in a very messed up man and said, yeah, that’s our guy. Yeah, no -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- he’s a felon. No, he’s a serial adulterer. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: They’re all in. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I’m proud that our party had the courage to step up and talk about the obvious. And I’m even more proud, so proud that we elected Joe Biden in the first place -- Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Claire McCaskill: -- because there aren’t very many leaders that would have done what he did for his country. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. So, another thing I want to say is Jill Biden has come under a lot of criticism that I think has been unfair in the last few weeks. You know, this is something that happens. People don’t like what’s happening and they blame the wife. And her communications director put out a statement on her behalf last night that I think gave us a sense of what was really going on. Down to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose. She’s his biggest believer, champion, and always on his side. And that trusted way only a spouse of almost 50 years can be. She’s just been like a huge and she’ll continue to be a huge benefit, I think, campaigning, but just like an incredible support of an incredible first lady. So what do you think about Biden going forward, Claire, and what he can do in the campaign? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, really essential. You know, I think this is the way it’s going to game out. I think you’re going to see more and more people endorsing Kamala Harris and you’re going to see more and more delegations. A lot of them are meeting today. Some are meeting tomorrow. I think she will quickly amass the number of delegates she needs for the nomination. Then they’ve got to figure out how do you intersect needing to introduce her to the country with a biography and actually nominating her. But make no mistake about it. Joe Biden is going to be very important at the Democratic National Convention, celebrating him, honoring him, giving him the love and affection that we all feel for him, and also him signaling to the country the reasons why he selected Kamala Harris in the first place. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: He had a lot of choices for vice president. There were many that he could have chosen. And she is the one that got the nod. And I think he is very important in the campaign, really to build enthusiasm in the Democratic base. I don’t think he helps with that last two percent that we need in those battleground states. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: But frankly, right now, Jen, I do believe this race is turnout, turnout, turnout. I think it is getting our folks out. And that’s why this change at this moment has really injected jet fuel into what I believe will be one of the most robust turnout operations that our party has ever seen. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. One thing I would note that I think was probably was really effective and understanding humans file in the back of their mind, the Clintons and how they handled this, okay. You know, I think everyone played their role here. Obama put his one statement out saying I have his back. And then he stepped back, right. He didn’t say more. The Clintons continued to make phone calls to donors throughout this process saying you need to continue to give to Joe. They were supportive behind the scenes and calls that they gave to Joe. Sometimes, you know, you need all of these things. You need people pushing him to do the right thing. But you also need people that just have your back, right. And I feel like that probably helped, too. But let’s explain like kind of what’s going on behind the scenes. I think some people are like, how can Barack Obama not endorse or why is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries still saying there should be an open process? And I think that, first of all, there’s no mechanism by which there’s not an open process. The vice president will have to in some form go before the delegates and be nominated as the next nominee. And that is an open process and other people can decide to run if they want to. So far, no one has. But I think what these leaders are trying to do is make sure that that people understand that there’s integrity to this process. There’s this thing like, oh, she can’t just be anointed that she’s earned it, not that she hasn’t earned it by virtue of 14 million votes that she has gotten in the Democratic primary as part of the running mate, as being the running mate, as being the vice president, as being the best prepared for the job. But these leaders are making space. And I think it’s smart. You know, this is a high class problem she has now, having so many endorsements. But these leaders are stepping back for now to let there be a process that has legitimacy to show that unlike, you know, rigged elections on other sides, that there is a process here by which she will earn the nomination and that’s why those leaders are holding back. And I think that assuming that this continues to go on the path that we are on, they will come and endorse her at the at the right time. You do want to stage these things. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I mean, they didn’t want the appearance of this being shoved down anybody’s throats and they wanted it to happen organically and now it has. And it will continue to happen that way and they will endorse not as the first, but as well, some of the last, and that’s great. And I do think it’s important to remember, this is not a coronation. It’s the Constitution. A vice president is selected for the reason that there would be someone to step in if for any reason the president steps aside. That is exactly what is happening here. So we’re going to take a quick break here. When we get back, we’re going to look at what’s next after President Biden endorsed Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. Soon after Biden released his statement withdrawing himself from the race, he released another endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee. Let’s take a moment to review what happened subsequently. First, she said, I’m honored -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- to have his endorsement. And it is her intention to earn and win this nomination. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: That is the first thing that happened. She led with earn. Smart. Jennifer Palmieri: Yep. Claire McCaskill: And then she basically spent all day on the phone. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: I think she called 100 people, literally, yesterday. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And that’s a lot as somebody who’s had to do call time. A hundred is a lot, especially since you have to keep your energy level up. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You have to face every phone call like the first phone call you made. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You have to listen. You can’t cut people off. And you have to say the same things over and over again. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: I don’t think people understand how exhausting that can be. So, she’s already showing a work ethic that she will need to draw upon in the next hundred and what is it, 102 days now, 101? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I think so. Claire McCaskill: It’s close. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s like, yeah. Yeah, next Sunday, I know is 100 days because you and I have to do some sort of special, as I recall, so. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Next Sunday is 100 days. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. I even talked to people who had voicemails from her. It’s like, yeah, so she was busy doing all that. It is interesting. The president put his statement out. He thanked the vice president in his original statement for her patience, her support. And I was like, oh, wow, he’s not endorsing her. And then, you know, it’s like maybe 20 minutes later, half hour later, you know, which I think is smart, like stage these things. And then said, you know, separate and apart from that decision, I have made the decision to endorse her. And then, you know, those next 12 hours were super important and she just like, wow, did she lock down a ton of support. By the way, every single state party chair has endorsed her in the party, all 50. That’s different than every delegation. But every state party chair has endorsed her. Clyburn, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Clintons, Senator Warren, the SEIU, the Farm Workers Union -- Claire McCaskill: AFT. Jennifer Palmieri: --AFT. So, a ton of support behind her. No rumblings of anybody getting in. Oh, my God. Joe Manchin raised his head for a brief moment to say that maybe, I mean, I was like, oh, my gosh, do it. That’s like such a favor to her. Go ahead. Change your party registration back to Democrats and try to challenge her. That would be helpful to her. But then I think this morning he was on CBS and he said that he wasn’t going to do it, but somebody should. But I don’t know that anybody is. And so now if I were in the room, if I were in the Vice President Harris for president campaign, I would try to slow this down, you know. Honestly, this is what Bill Clinton would describe as a high class problem. So many endorsements coming in so quickly. You want to I think now you want to stagger them. There are some Midwest governors that have not endorsed yet. Walls, Evers, Whitmer, like, you know, hold them back, do something with them, go to their states so that you can show some deliberation in the way that you are earning support of, you know, in different states and maybe of different demographics. You know, the labor unions go out with them, you know, do things so people are seeing that the endorsements are happening for a reason. It’s not just panic that everybody needs to get on board with whoever the Democratic nominee that they are selecting, that they are choosing to endorse Kamala Harris because of her record as vice president. You know, I know a lot about the labor unions in particular, and they have so much that this administration has done for labor that, you know, they want to endorse her because of that. We want to endorse her because of this and her record. And this is what she’s going to do as president. And also in the lead up between now and the convention, you want that kind of roadmap, I think, that’s building that, you know, now that they’ve gone through the chaos of the first day, I think you want to be more methodical about lining this up. But like, wow, it’s a high class problem. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And the most important thing to note here is that no one of substance has surfaced to challenge her, even though they could. You only have to have 300 signatures to become a candidate and no one has. All the people mentioned -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- have either endorsed her or maybe will endorse her over the coming two or three days, every single one. And let me just say this about Joe Manchin. This is a phrase. It’s well-worn, but bless his heart. You know, I mean, lordy. It is just so typical of him that he pokes his head out, like anybody, hey, anybody. Hey, look at me, look at me. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s just that basic with that guy, isn’t it? Claire McCaskill: I know. Jennifer Palmieri: Sometimes I make things more complicated than they need to be. It’s like no peace, he’s just an attention hog. That’s just like what’s going on. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And so we know the DNC rules allow for anybody to gather signatures and be placed in nomination. And when they do the roll call, whether it’s virtual, here or, you know, the first weeks of August or whether it’s at the convention, those names can be placed in nomination and the delegates could vote. So, this notion that there is no way anybody has a chance is based more on the practical realities than on the process, because the process certainly allows for anyone to step up if they want to. But, you know, what’s really happening here, Jen, and I think it’s important that we really put an exclamation point behind this. There was such stress. Literally, most Democrats I know had been holding their breath for days. It was like, oh, please, you know, we cannot. This is just untenable. We can’t go on like this. We can’t continue to not know for sure. We can’t continue to wait for a slip up or, you know, a moment where we are revisiting -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- his ability to make the case. And now it’s just like this unbelievable rush of relief. Jennifer Palmieri: $49.6 million dollars rush of relief. Yeah, I know. So much money they’ve raised. Claire McCaskill: And people need to know that is not big money, people. That is $25 contributions. That is $50 contributions, maybe $100. Jennifer Palmieri: Those are my sisters. I heard from so many members of my family, who do I donate to? Claire McCaskill: Me too. I heard from friends that I’m pretty sure never gave to me that said, how do I give to Kamala Harris? And it was like, okay. Well, I’ll help. So, I think the amount of money that came in from low donors, first of all, I like it because it really puts the big donors in their place. They should be at the back of the parade, not at the front of the parade. And the front of the parade are folks that are showing an outpouring of support for Kamala Harris. And I think that’s very, very, very exciting. And I think now, Jen, if I were in the room, she’s got to spend some money right now, especially in the swing states on a really powerful biography spot. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Plouffe was saying this morning, I couldn’t agree with him more, you’ve got to do biography. You’ve got to do it serious and you’ve got to do it, sustain it with a lot of weight behind it, both online and in traditional media forums, and then move into the contrast. The media is going to be focused on the contrast and not her bio. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: She’s going to have to let people understand what she has overcome. Every race she’s made in her life, she was underestimated. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And this is no different. And I love it that she would come at this as an underdog, an underestimated underdog, but a courtroom prosecutor who knows-- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- how to take it to the witness in a way that I’m not sure we’ve had a presidential candidate be able to do in a long time. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. I mean, here’s what people need to know. And if you want to shorthand it and help her, prosecutor, attorney general, senator, vice president, president. Like, how’s that for a good resume, people? You know, I think people, because she, you know, has been sort of new in the national scene for the last five years, like that is her resume. By the way, prosecutor, attorney general, the biggest state of the nation, senator, biggest state of the nation. But yeah, agree with that. So like now you have the time. Bio ad, use your endorsements to kind of, you know, slow the endorsement downs, use them to reaffirm things in your bio, what you’ve accomplished to help introduce you. And then, you know, we know prosecutor versus the felon. She’s phenomenal. Like she’s phenomenal on the debate stage. She’s phenomenal in prosecuting an argument on abortion, on democracy, on rights. But you get a few weeks now to introduce yourself and that’s what, yeah, that’s what they should do. Claire McCaskill: I think everybody needs this lesson. This is what you need to remember. You know, in a sentence, when you put that little half circle there, it’s a comma. It’s Kamala. Jennifer Palmieri: La. Claire McCaskill: Kamala. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Because I worked with her sister, Maya, on Hillary’s campaign, that’s what she would say. Kamala. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Kamala. So, yeah, VP, what do you think? Jennifer Palmieri: Oh my God. I mean, oh boy. Okay. I mean, the auditions on “Morning Joe” were hilarious. Here’s the list that’s like been reported as being vetted. It’s Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. I think those are the four most serious that I believe we know are actually being vetted. And what that means, people, is like a team of lawyers descend on you and produce a really scary binder of, you know, anything that they can find out about you. And it’s a very serious, very intense, very uncomfortable process. Other ones that could be, are rumored to be, considering Maryland Governor Wes Moore, California Governor Gavin Newsom. You can’t have two Californians. I mean, he’s great and obviously you can’t have two Californians. J.B. Pritzker, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. He is one of the governors that has not endorsed yet. Like I said, sort of like a swath of Midwest. I forgot about him. Whitmer, Evers, Pritzker, Walls of Minnesota. I think Josh Shapiro is the most serious candidate at this point. You know, if he can lock up Pennsylvania, that’s great. I know labor really likes him. He’s a phenomenal candidate. I’ve interviewed that guy a lot. He’s just like a really good campaigner. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Gretchen Whitmer. What do you think of the list? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think that’s the list. I think the top four are the ones you mentioned. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Mark Kelly has a lot to recommend him. His background, he also would help in a state that is important, not as important as Pennsylvania, but nonetheless important. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I just think there’s a sense in many ways that getting somebody from outside of Washington helps. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah,. Claire McCaskill: And since Mark is a sitting United States senator, although he doesn’t feel like it. You know what I mean? Jennifer Palmieri: He doesn’t feel like a senator at all. Claire McCaskill: Right, right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, he feels like a senator, but he feels like what he’s done in his life is bigger -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Claire McCaskill: -- than even maybe being a senator. Jennifer Palmieri: Did you say he’s an astronaut? Should we remind people of that? Let’s remind people who he is. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. He was an astronaut, but really flew a lot of combat missions. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know, J.D. Vance did PR for the Marines in Iraq. Mark Kelly was in the plane that was being shot at and that was delivering weaponry in the war effort. So a big difference in terms of their backgrounds. Jennifer Palmieri: And his wife. Claire McCaskill: And his wife, Gabby Giffords, one of the first real true victims of political violence in our country. Not the only obvious, but in modern times, since the Kennedy assassinations and Martin Luther King, really the first person to be seriously wounded in an assassination attempt. I love Josh Shapiro. I think he’s great. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I think it’s for a lot of reasons. I think he makes the most sense. Jennifer Palmieri: Kelly makes a lot of sense, too. Claire McCaskill: Kelly does, too. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I don’t mind either Andy Beshear or Roy Cooper. Jennifer Palmieri: True. Claire McCaskill: You know what I love? I love the fact that all of the people being talked about have had to run in states that they could lose to a Republican. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, for sure. Claire McCaskill: I mean, that’s really important, you guys, because -- Jennifer Palmieri: It is. Claire McCaskill: -- I mean, don’t get me wrong. Kamala Harris has fought maybe the toughest battles you ever fight, which is primary wars in California. But because those primaries in California are brutal -- Jennifer Palmieri: Terrible. Claire McCaskill: Terrible. But I like the idea that all four of these nominees have had to get votes from people that don’t have a D behind their name. They know what it means to speak to the electorate, not on partisan terms, on terms of what matters to people, what you can do to address the real life problems they have. And I just think all four of these are great choices. I think she’ll be served well by any of them. I give a little bit of a front runner status to Josh Shapiro just because he comes from Pennsylvania. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And he’s really good. I mean, he is a very effective campaigner. Okay, so money. We talked a little bit about money, but I want to explain something else. The Harris campaign announced this morning that they have raised $49.6 million dollars since Biden dropped out. It’s the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle. The other thing people should know about that’s helpful if the nomination goes to Harris is that because she is on the ticket with Biden, she can assume the infrastructure of the campaign and the resources of the campaign. And that would not have been true for somebody that had not been on the ticket. Let’s take a quick break here and when we come back, I want to nerd out on the DNC rules for nominating Kamala Harris. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, let’s explain the craziness about the timing of the nomination and what those rules are. I’m kind of up to speed on this. Are you up to speed on this? It’s so complicated. Okay. Claire McCaskill: It’s too boring for me. Jennifer Palmieri: But it matters a lot. All right. So -- Claire McCaskill: I know. I know. Jennifer Palmieri: It matters. It matters. It matters. Okay, the convention starts on August 19. The party, the DNC, the Democratic Convention has continued to say that there should be a virtual nomination to have the nomination done sometime between August 1st and August 7th because in order to make sure that the candidate can be on the Ohio ballot, their rule is that they need to know who the nominee is by August 7. Ohio passed a law that said that they would wait. The law doesn’t take effect until September 1. Most lawyers I talk to say that doesn’t matter. You don’t actually need to have the virtual nomination by August 7 in order to worry about Ohio. It’s fine. Some people say it’s risky to not do that. Let’s just assume that it’s fine to not worry about Ohio. The other problem is that Washington State starts printing. They need to know who the nominee is on August 20. They start printing ballots. Then California starts printing ballots on August 22. The convention starts on August 19. And so what has to get decided in the next week is how the nomination is going to happen. Will they pursue, move forward quickly, like in the next, you know, two weeks from now, I guess, and then that window of August 1 to August 7, and do a virtual nomination of the vice president? Or will they wait, you know, create a rule that allows them to wait and do this actually in Chicago and nominate her there, you know, as you would in a traditional convention? I think they need to figure this out and like let her have a real nomination and not have a Zoom call, you know. Like figure it out, people. You’re in charge of the rules. Jay Inslee is the governor of Washington. If you need to ask him to like print his ballots a week later, I bet you can figure that out. Let’s have a real convention and, you know, particularly when we’re reintroducing a new nominee to the country. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and Mark Elias put out a statement yesterday as the definitive Democratic lawyer saying, do not worry, the Democratic nominee will be on the ballot in all 50 states. There is nothing that can be done to change that. Since Mark has spoken, I am comfortable with that. Jennifer Palmieri: Me, too. Claire McCaskill: Let’s do this in a way that gives those double haters, those disengaged voters, those voters that have not been paying attention because it was just two old white guys, let’s speak to them in a way that is meaningful and I think you’re right. I think it’d be better to do it at the convention if they can figure it out. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Do it for real. It’s ridiculous. Claire McCaskill: By the way, if we’ve figured all this out, surely we can figure that out because it seems a lot less difficult than what we’ve just been through. Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, also the party controls the party, right? So like I just don’t understand why they can’t, like it’s ridiculous. So anyway. Wow. Okay. I mean, a way different Monday than I expected that we would. You know, we just recorded on Friday. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And guess what? We’ll be back on Thursday. Jennifer Palmieri: We will be back on Thursday. Yes, with Dave Wasserman. I’m super excited about that. He is the analyzer from Cook Political Report, and there’s no one who goes deeper into the data of what’s actually happening in all of these states and districts. So that’ll be great. So historic day, friends. Thanks so much for listening. As we said, we’ll be back on Thursday for our regular weekly episode. If you have a question for us, this will be good.

Secret Service director resigns after backlash over Trump rally security failures,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 8:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/secret-service-director-resigns-kimberly-cheatle-rcna163146,"Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after facing bipartisan pressure to step down during a House hearing, NBC News reported. Republicans at the hearing used the assassination attempt against Donald Trump on July 13 as a Trojan horse to push their anti-diversity agenda.  Republicans and Democrats at the hearing were largely in agreement that Cheatle should resign over the Secret Service's failure to prevent the attack. Later Monday, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and the committee’s top Democrat, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, signed a joint letter calling on Cheatle to step down. But ever since the shooting, conservative activists, benefactors like Elon Musk and some lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Johnson have baselessly sought to blame the shooting in part on liberal rhetoric or diversity, inclusion and equity measures. The DEI thing became a talking point among far-right influencers online, after they noticed that some members of Trump’s Secret Service detail on the day of the shooting were women.  For his part, Trump has thanked the Secret Service agents who protected him. His sons have defended the women in their father's detail. And Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita has condemned right-wing criticism of the women, which shows that these attacks are viewed as beyond the pale even for some at the center of the MAGA universe. So it's remarkable that several House Republicans kept pushing that angle during the hearing.  One can detect more than a hint of condescension in Wisconsin GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman’s questioning, for example.  “You’ve spent some time trying to change the makeup of the Secret Service,"" Grothman said. ""OK, you feel there — whatever — too high a percentage are men. Um, does this affect at all who you are hiring for the Secret Service?” The congressman went on to ask whether Cheatle was ever “not hiring men because of your desire to hit certain targets,” a seeming reference to hiring goals set by some organizations that right-wingers kvetch over in their attacks on diversity efforts. Cheatle said the agency only hires the most qualified candidates. But after briefly deviating from this misogynistic line of questioning, Grothman asked, “Can you elaborate why you want one-third of the Secret Service to be women?” Cheatle denied ever saying this. Grothman, who told a reporter earlier this week that he feels Democrats are backing Harris ""because of her ethnic background,"" sure seems eager to ascribe someone else's success to their gender or ethnicity, which is quite rich coming from a white man in Congress. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., also appeared to question the diversity and qualifications of Secret Service agents, asking why someone shorter than Trump or incapable of physically carrying him should be allowed to serve on his security detail.  Perry didn’t mention women specifically, but his remarks sounded like an allusion to the female Secret Service agents bashed by bigoted, right-wing social media trolls. Cheatle yet again affirmed that she’s only hired people who are qualified and capable of doing the job, and Perry responded by claiming this was the sign of a “culture” in which “the primary objective here seems to be something other than securing the site, securing the principal, and securing the people at the site.” Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett was the most overt in his bigotry, calling Cheatle a “DEI horror story” during the hearing. And he told CNN on Monday that he believes Harris was a ""DEI hire"" by the Biden campaign in 2020. When asked by Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, whether the security failures had to do with DEI, Cheatle said they had “nothing to do” with such initiatives. You can watch Crockett and fellow Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, respond to the baseless, bigoted attack on DEI here. As I wrote last week, House Republicans are risking dooming their probe into the Trump assassination attempt by politicizing it in the way they already have. Using this investigation to push cheap political crusades undermines its seriousness."
Harris campaign contacts five Dems in search for running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 7:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-campaign-contacts-five-dems-search-running-mate-rcna163207,"On the first full day of the new 2024 presidential race, it quickly became apparent that Vice President Kamala Harris was likely to be the Democratic nominee. It was equally evident that she’d need a running mate — and she wouldn’t have much time to find one. With this in mind, multiple news organizations confirmed that former attorney general Eric Holder and his law firm would oversee an intense vetting process And who, pray tell, will they be vetting? The answer is just now starting to come into focus. NBC News reported that the Harris campaign has requested vetting materials from five potential vice presidential contenders, according to two sources familiar with the list (in alphabetical order): It’s worth emphasizing that this shouldn’t necessarily be seen as an exhaustive list. We know from previous election cycles that some who make short lists like these fall out of favor, while others are sometimes added to the list as the process unfolds. The eventual Democratic vice presidential nominee might very well come from this quintet, but there are no guarantees. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, for example, has been rumored to be in contention for the job, though he’s not on this list. That doesn’t mean, however, that he’s out of the running. As for the list itself, these are, by any fair measure, five strong contenders. Shapiro claims he hasn't been contacted as part of the running-mate search, but the Pennsylvania Democrat is nevertheless a popular governor in a key battleground state, who also happens to have a background as a prosecutor who took on the Trump administration. Cooper and Whitmer are also popular governors from battleground states, and while the latter suggested that she’s not interested in serving as her party’s vice presidential nominee, perspectives change when opportunities are no longer abstractions. Kelly, the only senator on the list (so far), has an impressive background in the military, and is a former astronaut. What’s more, while Democrats would hate to see Kelly leave the Senate, Arizona has a Democratic governor who’d appoint his successor and keep the seat “blue.” Walz’s inclusion on the list might seem surprising to some, but I’d recommend keeping a close eye on the Minnesotan. He’s an excellent speaker, a successful governor in a Midwestern state, a former well liked congressman, and perhaps most importantly, Walz is a decorated military veteran. As the process advances, spare a thought for the researchers who have a daunting and expedited task ahead of them. Politico reported that delegates to the Democratic convention could begin voting on the party’s presidential and vice presidential nominees as early as next week. The report added, “Such a timeline, if it were implemented, could result in Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden’s endorsed successor, selecting her running mate by the middle of next week.” Watch this space."
Ohio Republican forced to scramble after ‘civil war’ comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 6:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ohio-republican-forced-scramble-civil-war-comments-rcna163189,"It was just 10 days ago when a gunman shot Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, and while the shooter’s motives are still being investigated, Republicans responded to the assassination attempt by blaming Democratic rhetoric. As far as the former president’s GOP allies were concerned, Democrats weren’t just responsible for the gunman, they had a responsibility to “lower the volume” in the public discourse. All of this came to mind watching a Republican campaign rally in Ohio yesterday. Politico reported: In context, Vance had not yet taken the stage at the official campaign event, though a local state senator was warming up the crowd before introducing the Republican vice presidential nominee. “I’m afraid if we lose this one, it’s going to take a civil war to save the country, and it will be saved,” Lang said. “It’s the greatest experiment in the history of mankind, and if we come down to a civil war, I’m glad we got people like ... Bikers for Trump on our side.” It’s important to emphasize that while the GOP legislator made these comments — out loud, on camera, in front of a large audience — and he appeared to mean what he said, Lang did issue a written statement soon that walked it all back. “Remarks I made earlier today at a rally at a rally in Middletown do not accurately reflect my views,” Lang said via social media. “I regret the divisive remarks I made in the excitement of the moment on stage.” Nevertheless, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said in a statement, “Donald Trump and JD Vance should denounce George Lang’s calls for violence and apologize for platforming this kind of violence.” There has been no such apology. “Donald Trump and JD Vance are running a campaign openly sowing hatred and promising revenge against their political opponents,” the Harris campaign added. “That’s why a Republican official was empowered to predict a civil war while introducing these candidates.”"
An emboldened Trump is threatening to sue those who indicted him,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 6:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-sue-mar-a-lago-raid-cannon-rcna163118,"As many major news outlets continue to digest President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race and the Democratic Party’s swift rallying around Vice President Kamala Harris as its standard bearer, you would be forgiven if you had turned your attention away from the person who commanded last week’s news cycle: Donald Trump. But almost 24 hours to the minute after Biden announced he was leaving the race, Trump took to Truth Social on Monday with what could be a significant post of his own, suggesting it’s his “time to sue” an unspecified “them for illegally breaking into, and raiding, Mar-a-Lago” in the wake of federal District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case. Yet, that case — which concerns Trump’s alleged possession of classified and other national security related documents at Mar-a-Lago and both his and his two co-defendants’ alleged obstruction of the federal investigation of the same — was not thrown out because of any finding that the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago was legally defective. Instead, Cannon dismissed the case for a wholly unrelated reason: She ruled that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith and the funding of his office violate two distinct clauses of Article II of the U.S. Constitution. Nonetheless, the former president-turned-GOP-presidential-nominee is now not only insisting that the Mar-a-Lago search and seizure of evidence broke the law, but also that he intends to sue prosecutors and/or the FBI for violating his rights. And his post therefore begets two questions: One, is Trump serious about a civil lawsuit against federal prosecutors? And two, assuming he is, would that suit have any chance of succeeding? Let's start with whether Trump truly intends to sue. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but if past is prologue, the answer is likely yes. Recall that the nation was first introduced to Cannon not as a result of the indictment against Trump, which was randomly assigned to her, but through the civil case Trump himself filed two weeks after the Mar-a-Lago search and used to secure the appointment of a special master to review the evidence collected ""to preserve the sanctity of executive communications and other privileges."" The second and more significant question then is what such a lawsuit would look like. Let's assume Trump is going to sue and that what he's after is a damages award that would hurt and embarrass the government. Whom would Trump sue and what claims might he advance? Ordinarily, under Supreme Court precedent, the federal government and its agencies are immune from damages unless they waive sovereign immunity. Yet a federal statute — the Federal Tort Claims Act — does exactly that. It specifically allows lawsuits for torts such as false arrest, abuse of process or malicious prosecution where those claims are rooted in the acts of federal investigative or law enforcement officers, a category broadly defined to include ""any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law."" That doesn't, of course, mean Trump is filing any such suit in the immediate future, especially as the special counsel's office has indicated its intent to appeal Cannon's dismissal of the case. Nor does it mean any lawsuit Trump files will necessarily be one for malicious prosecution. In part, that's because it's at best unclear whether Trump could establish the elements of malicious prosecution under Florida law, which would govern in this case. Under a 1994 Florida Supreme Court ruling, claims of malicious prosecution in the state require proof not only that the plaintiff — here, hypothetically Trump — obtained a dismissal in his favor, but also that the case was dismissed because of his innocence. Plus, that plaintiff must also show, among other factors, proof that prosecutors lacked probable cause and acted with malice. Here, by contrast, the case was dismissed on procedural, not substantive grounds, and there are no conclusive judicial findings from the litigation before Cannon that the Mar-a-Lago search was inappropriate or legally defective. On the contrary, late last month, Cannon found Trump failed to make even a preliminary showing that the affidavit submitted by the Justice Department to obtain the Mar-a-Lago search warrant contained any material false statements or omissions, a showing required to obtain any further hearing about the warrant's propriety. So should we take Trump at his word that he intends to sue? Sure. But can we expect Trump to launch this newest legal effort soon, much less successfully? That's both more dubious and murkier."
Trump allies reconsider: Is JD Vance the right running mate?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-allies-reconsider-jd-vance-right-running-mate-rcna163172,"As Donald Trump and his team evaluated potential running mates, there were plenty of “safe” choices for the former Republican president. Sen. JD Vance wasn’t necessarily one of them. The 39-year-old Ohio senator — the least experienced major-party running mate in nearly nine decades — has no accomplishments to speak of. He has a record of extremism on key issues. He comes from a state the GOP ticket is almost certain to win anyway. He actually hated Trump in the recent past. As the public was reminded at Vance’s first solo rally since joining Trump’s team, the guy doesn’t exactly radiate charm and charisma, either. Even in his home state, Vance is hardly a powerhouse. In 2022, as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine cruised to a landslide, 26-point re-election victory, Vance appeared on the same ballot — and won by six points. As a recent Washington Post analysis summarized, the young senator “underperformed every other statewide Republican on the ballot by a large margin. Ohio went strongly for Republicans; it did not go strongly for Vance.” So why in the world did Trump pick him as his new running mate? Why choose a Republican with little appeal beyond the former president’s far-right MAGA base? At least in part because Trump assumed he was poised to win anyway. As the former president saw it, with an inevitable 2024 victory in hand, there was no harm in running up the ideological score, satisfying the base and establishing greater control over the Republican Party’s vision for the foreseeable future. That, of course, was when the GOP nominee expected to defeat President Joe Biden. As the incumbent stands down, the party’s recent moves are being reassessed and recontextualized. Tim Alberta wrote for The Atlantic: That luxury is now gone. Alberta added via social media, “[The] most striking thing I heard from Trump allies yesterday was the second-guessing of JD Vance—a selection, they acknowledged, that was borne of cockiness, meant to run up margins with the base in a blowout.” Oops. I’ve long argued that the running mate selection is the most important choice a presidential candidate will make during his or her campaign. Trump did not choose wisely — and it’s apparently not just Democrats who’ve noticed."
It's not enough for Kamala Harris to not be Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-presidential-campaign-policy-trump-rcna163002,"President Joe Biden’s historic exit from the White House race and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him marks a thrilling turn of events for many Democrats. Biden’s re-election prospects had been looking terrible. Harris has injected an air of new possibility into the race, and she instantly benefits from not being dogged by questions about her mental acuity. Harris is taking control of Biden’s campaign operation, garnering endorsements from across the party and positioning herself as the favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. But it is imperative that she not allow her candidacy to be defined purely in negative terms as a generic alternative to someone undesirable: It is not enough to not be Joe Biden. It is not enough to not be Donald Trump. If Harris wants to make a splash, re-introduce herself to the public and have a decent shot at beating the former president, then she must embrace a compelling policy vision and sell it with gusto. This is an arena in which Biden largely failed. Harris needs to avoid making the same mistake. The Biden-Harris campaign had focused mostly on selling re-election as a way to protect democracy and abortion rights. Those are deeply important ideas that can fire up the Democratic base. But most American voters are not the Democratic base, and Democrats need to get their attention and secure trust their trust by unveiling policies that pique their interest. This is a realm in which Harris can improve upon Biden’s platform and shore up her potential weaknesses against Trump. The Democratic Party must not just stand against things. It must stand for things.  Less politically engaged voters and swing voters have an outsize interest in economic issues, and polling data indicates that Trump tends to poll better than Biden on the economy. A set of recent surveys from The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer found that a large majority of voters in five battleground states want sweeping change in our economic and political systems. And even though inflation has subsided, Americans persistently believe that the cost of living is too high. Big, bold proposals that acknowledge that there are big structural problems in the way our economy distributes wages, wealth and freedom can engage and excite people. It would be negligence of the highest order for Harris to not adopt the language and policy vision of economic populism as a focal point of her campaign. Big policy swings can help Harris renew and build coalitions on the left, as well. Buzzy policy commitments and rhetorical emphasis on issues such as increasing the minimum wage, expanding the child tax credit, creating a public option for health insurance, universal child care, free higher education options, tackling skyrocketing housing prices and cracking down on tax cheats, among countless others, would allow Harris to engage activists and specific constituencies and motivate them to work to elect her. Biden unveiled some eye-catching policies on banning medical debt, controlling rental costs and reforming the Supreme Court in the final weeks of his campaign. But his pivot was too little, too late. Those policy announcements mostly came about as concessions to the left wing of the party as Biden scrambled to secure support from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the progressive House members known as “the squad” as his support fell after his debate against Trump. It remains to be seen how Harris will approach those policies, but one hopes she considers them alongside other potential headline-generating policies. A bold economic populism can also serve as a shield for Harris. Unfortunately Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and their GOP allies are likely to use the kinds of racist and sexist tropes to try to tear her down just as they have done in the past. Even more unfortunately, those lines of attack could persuade voters even outside the MAGA camp who are amenable to bigoted messaging. But if Harris hammers home social and economic policies that would benefit all people regardless of background, then she can help keep the conversation grounded in universal terms and help ensure that she sounds grounded in the struggles that working people face across all demographic backgrounds. Additionally, Harris can use economic populism to help rebuff the MAGA world’s increasingly sophisticated courtship of unions and call out the ruse of right-wing populism, which claims to champion working-class people even as it prioritizes the desires of corporations and the rich. Harris is an experienced, energetic and competent candidate suited to take the torch from Biden in an emergency. But with Trump looking unusually strong in polls this year, Democrats must remember that fear of Trump is not a strong enough strategy for winning the election. Harris can shut down shallow theorizing about whether she is “electable” by getting to work and doing what Biden failed to do: making a bold case for how to make America better for everyone."
Joe Biden can be proud of his record,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-presidential-term-record-rcna163132,"This wasn’t how Joe Biden planned to end his career. He wanted to be president for his entire adult life, clearly loved having the job and hoped desperately to hold on to it for another four years. But Biden can take comfort in this: He may be America’s best one-term president ever.  For progressives like me, Biden’s tenure has been a pleasant surprise. For nearly 50 years before reaching the Oval Office, Biden positioned himself as a moderate within the Democratic Party. Many liberals rightly looked askance at the less admirable parts of his long record in the Senate, such as his tight relationship with the credit card industry and his mishandling of Anita Hill’s testimony during Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court confirmation hearings. We feared that his commitment to conciliation and procedural norms was ill-suited to facing down an increasingly radical Republican Party. But again and again, Biden exceeded expectations. It’s important to remember how unlikely some of the president’s victories were, especially when it came to passing new laws. During the 2020 election, Biden argued that his decades as vice president and senator made him uniquely capable of getting meaningful legislation passed by his former colleagues. But there was reason to be skeptical of what he could accomplish in Congress. He has faced a Republican opposition increasingly judged not by what it achieves but by how venomously it fights Democratic presidents. While Barack Obama began his administration with huge congressional majorities — including, briefly, a filibuster-proof 60-vote bloc in the Senate — Biden had essentially no margin for error in either chamber from the start. Add in some troublemaking Democrats like Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and it was reasonable to expect Biden would struggle to accomplish anything.  Yet he did accomplish plenty. The enormous American Rescue Plan helped carry the country through the terrible economic effects of the Covid pandemic. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was the first meaningful gun safety legislation in decades. The bipartisan infrastructure law — something Donald Trump never got passed in four years despite years of promises — and the CHIPS and Science Act represent extraordinary investments in American industrial capacity. And his industrial policy was a key break with the neoliberal approach of the past. Instead, the Biden administration aggressively intervened in the economy to promote new manufacturing, especially in areas that have experienced tough times in recent years. The results speak for themselves. Whether you want to give any president credit for job creation that happens under his watch, Biden’s record in that area is unmatched in any presidential term in history. There are nearly 16 million more jobs today than when Biden took office. Under Donald Trump, less than 7 million jobs were created before the pandemic tore through the country, during what Trump absurdly claims was the greatest economy in human history.  The Biden legislation that may have the most significant long-term impact, though, is the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed the Senate via Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote after an excruciatingly long and complex process. The IRA had many components, but most importantly, it’s the most significant climate change legislation ever enacted. The IRA promotes clean energy production across a variety of economic sectors and geographic areas, offers subsidies for electric vehicles and reduces carbon emissions in multiple ways.  Unfortunately, most voters know next to nothing about the IRA or Biden’s aggressive executive actions on climate. As Robinson Meyer of the climate news site Heatmap (where I am also a columnist) wrote of Biden, “Again and again, he would pull off some difficult domestic policy — and then fail to communicate it to voters.” That’s meaningful — part of the president’s job is to bring the public along with what he’s doing — but it doesn’t change the impact of Biden’s practical accomplishments.  There are many other parts of Biden’s legacy to praise. He brought long-needed diversity to the federal judiciary, appointing unprecedented numbers of female and nonwhite judges. After four years of Trump’s praising dictators and demeaning U.S. allies, Biden restored a foreign policy consistent with both security and American values. He was the first president to join a union picket line, and his administration was consistently, strongly pro-labor. And despite unceasing Republican efforts to obscure Trump’s almost infinite corruption, his administration has been remarkably free of scandal.  That isn’t to say that Biden hasn’t made mistakes; every president does. There are decisions he made that I disagreed with. He hasn’t done nearly enough to restrain the Netanyahu government in its disastrous war on Gaza. He could have moved more aggressively to expand access to health care and retain the Covid-era expansion of the child tax credit. And I wish he had embraced Supreme Court reform years ago, not just before he dropped out of the 2024 campaign. But in the big picture of Biden’s term, two takeaways stand out. First, he displayed a remarkable and admirable adaptability for someone who has been in politics for half a century, adjusting to changes not just in his party but in the world. How many young people would have said a politician in his 80s would do more on climate than any president before him? Second, Biden took governing seriously. He showed that knowledge of how Washington works does, in fact, matter a great deal. When Biden claimed that his long experience would make him better suited to handle the complexities of the legislative process and the sprawling executive branch, some scoffed. Yet he was right.  In the end, age came for the president, as it comes for us all. In Biden’s case, it left him unable to fight off Trump a second time. But he was a better president than almost anyone expected."
Kamala Harris wants to 'earn' the nomination. That's only half the battle.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 4:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/harris-nomination-battle-2024-trump-biden-rcna163129,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 22 episode of “Morning Joe.” I’ve had the privilege of working for President Joe Biden. I worked on his 2020 campaign, and once he took the White House, I had the honor of serving as a deputy assistant to the president. From my time with the president, I can tell you he is a remarkable man, he is a selfless man, and, frankly, what he did on Sunday is something very few elected officials in this country would ever be willing to do. I’ve also had the honor of serving Vice President Kamala Harris as both her chief spokesperson and senior adviser. I can tell you that throughout this entire process, there have been very few people more loyal to the president than the vice president. After Biden threw his support behind Harris on Sunday, the vice president made it clear that she plans to earn the Democratic Party’s nomination. It is my understanding the vice president was on the phone all day long, asking people for their support, not just expecting to get it. By my count, she has already secured the support of over 100 House Democrats, a dozen Senate Democrats, most of the country’s Democratic governors and several complete state delegations. That’s what I would call working to earn the nomination. As we look to the weeks ahead, there’s no doubt in my mind that Harris is well-poised to lock up the nomination. But that’s only half the battle. After that comes the hard part: campaigning and winning. This will not be an easy race. Much has been made about concerns over the president’s age, with many arguing that’s why the race was so close. However, I would argue this race was always going to be close. It was close in 2020, and no matter who is at the top of the Democratic ticket, it’s going to be close this time around. Now it’s time for Democrats to do the hard work and defeat Donald Trump, not just for the sake of their party, but for the sake of our democracy. Join Symone Sanders-Townsend, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its kind live event.

Why the mayhem caused by CrowdStrike failure could happen again,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 3:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/crowdstrike-outage-safety-update-rcna163127,"Airlines grounded planes across the world on Friday, not because of a problem with the airplanes themselves but with the computers that help them navigate the complexity of scheduling, display flight schedules to passengers, and monitor flight paths. Some hospitals canceled scheduled surgeries and medical appointments because their staff couldn’t use their computers to access patients’ medical records. Even grocery stores were impacted. I couldn’t buy groceries just outside London on Friday because the payment processing system used at my market was down. We can trace all those disruptions to cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike. A minor error in its software caused computers running the code to fail. Even after the code was patched, each and every computer affected had to be manually restarted by a human being, which meant fixing the problem took a lot of time. How did a small mistake in a company most of us had never heard of create such a mess? Centralization pressures have consolidated many industries, and, in software, the result has been that Microsoft Windows is the default operating system controlling everything from 911 systems to banks to elevators. Corporations around the world trust Microsoft to help them smoothly run their businesses. Microsoft’s security team deploys updates automatically on a schedule. Many users have probably forgotten or weren’t even born during the widespread malware attacks (as early as 1988 and especially in the 1990s and 2000s) which repeatedly brought down much of the internet. What we saw on Friday exposes the tension between safety and security. Safety means ensuring that software runs as expected and does so dependably every time. Safety gives us the confidence to use computers to handle hospital medical records and airline scheduling and know that they will be reliable. Security, on the other hand, is ensuring that software is free from attacks from those who want unauthorized access. Security allows us to connect computers to the internet and know that cybercriminals will not be able to use our computer to make money or access private information stored. For software like Microsoft Windows, which is ubiquitous in our national critical infrastructure, we need safety and security. But focusing on one can come at the expense of the other. To ensure safety, we need enough time to audit the code and test it properly. That allows experts to examine the code and run it in a variety of scenarios to give them the confidence the code will run as expected. To ensure security, though, we need to be able to update the code quickly to minimize harm against potential attacks. Cybercriminals are regularly targeting computers using new ways to get in. Quick updates allow us to block threats as soon as they arise. An error in a CrowdStrike update didn’t run as expected, which caused worldwide frustrations Friday. Due to the complexity of modern computer systems, even systems that were not running CrowdStrike were affected. If they used a third-party service dependent on CrowdStrike, then they would still be equally affected. For instance, I don’t know if my grocery story runs its own payment processor or if it contracts with a payment processor that uses CrowdStrike. It’s irrelevant. If a single component of an interconnected system is directly affected, then the rest is rendered unusable until the affected systems are back online. Security software like CrowdStrike’s needs to be able to run updates on a fast pace to ensure the security of the systems it runs on. However, by allowing CrowdStrike to autoupdate without outside inspection, too much trust is put in this company and its software. Such a process doesn’t sufficiently safeguard safety, and we need a complete review to see if CrowdStrike followed all relevant safety norms. If they did, then those those safety norms need to be updated. What happens next? We need security software to be able to update quickly, but better mechanisms need to exist to ensure the safety of the underlying systems. In the weeks and months to come, expect changes within companies as they adjust their systems to include security critical code in their normal safety processes. But this is not enough. Governments regulate software systems, particularly in certain critical industries. This extra layer protects their citizens from undue harm. Software systems are certified by external companies providing compliance checks on a regular basis. This ensures that they comply with the regulations. In many sectors, systems are required to run proper security software and CrowdStrike was a default option here. By giving a single vendor privileged access to many Microsoft corporate systems around the world, a ripe environment was created for a single failure to bring down a large part of the computer-powered infrastructure we rely on across the world. There are a large number of centralization pressures in the software industry. Outsourcing information technology is a cost-effective way to outsource legal risk if issues arise. Choosing known good vendors makes the compliance-checking processes quicker and easier. These pressures can’t be overcome if there isn’t substantive changes in how we regulate systems. We have now seen one of the repercussions of the lack of diversity of software. If nothing changes, such a catastrophic event will inevitably happen again."

How Trump beat a motion to dismiss his Pulitzer defamation claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 1:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-russia-pulitzer-lawsuit-defamation-rcna163060,"Donald Trump has won a court battle in his defamation lawsuit against members and staff of the Pulitzer Prize Board, a lawsuit stemming from an award given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for stories about Russia and his 2016 campaign. The former president has alleged that board members and staff conspired to publish a defamatory statement in 2022 affirming the veracity of the newspapers’ prize-winning journalism. The Florida state judge’s decision denied the defense motion to dismiss Trump’s complaint, which lets the case move forward. Here’s the 2022 Pulitzer statement at issue: The Florida judge, Robert Pegg, found that the statement wasn’t “pure opinion” — as the defense argued — which wouldn’t be actionable by Trump. Rather, the judge said that the statement “withheld information from their audience that would have provided an adequate factual foundation for a common reader to decide whether to agree or disagree with Defendants’ decision to let 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting stand, and whether the awarded reporting had in fact been discredited by facts that emerged from the Mueller Report or the other government investigations that had been made public since the conferral of those prizes.” Basically, the judge ruled that the defendants couldn’t escape the case at this stage of litigation. The bottom line for now is that Trump’s complaint survived a motion to dismiss, but whether he ultimately prevails remains to be seen.

"Team Trump wanted Biden to stay in the race. Then in an instant, everything changed.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 1:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrats-harris-biden-ticket-trump-rcna163078,"This is an adapted excerpt from a July 21 special episode of “The Rachel Maddow Show.”  Three and a half years into his presidency, Joe Biden made American history with an act of profound political and personal sacrifice: stepping down from his re-election bid in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris. In the instant Biden announced that news, at 1:46 p.m. on a Sunday, everything changed. The Democratic Party instantly ended its internal war — an emotional, intense, harrowing fight that has torn the party apart for the past three and a half weeks. That is over. The expectation among Democrats, an expectation voiced more and more openly in recent days, was that the party was in for a historic wipeout in November — with not just the White House in danger, but the House and the Senate in danger as well. That expectation has also evaporated in an instant.  Shortly after issuing his statement, Biden voiced his strong and unequivocal endorsement of Harris. Harris confirmed immediately that she would indeed run and pledged to fight — to win.  When it came to commenting on the very difficult knockdown, drag-out fight within the Democratic Party, Republicans and Donald Trump had been uncharacteristically disciplined. They were being very reticent and very disciplined about not talking about the concerns over Biden showing his age.  That’s because they were crossing their fingers and hoping Biden would stay in the race, expecting he would stay in. They were looking at the polls and bragging about their surely, absolutely guaranteed victory. Last week, Trump’s pollster said there were between 20 and 25 different paths to victory in the electoral map. Biden, perhaps cannily, waited until the supremely self-confident Republican side locked in their ticket. He waited to announce his plans until Trump picked a running mate whom most Americans do not know, and who — they are discovering — is deeply committed to a nationwide ban on abortion. Trump’s remarkable recent run of political good luck has finally come to an end. He is now the old man in the presidential race. A 78-year-old who is only occasionally coherent, with a record as president that is viewed by historians as the worst in the history of the country and a tenure that ended in violence. A man who refuses to promise there won’t be more violence from his supporters in the future.  Trump drags along with him not just the legacy of what happened the last time he was in office, but also the threat of a national abortion ban and a possible prison sentence — that all heads with him to the polls. We now know Trump’s opponent will not be a man older than him. His opponent will likely be a 59-year-old former prosecutor, attorney general, U.S. senator, and vice president to Joe Biden — who cemented his legacy with a decision that will go down in history as one of the most selfless patriotic sacrifices of any sitting president ever.  At 1:46 p.m. on a Sunday, Biden changed everything about this race. In an instant, the old era is over and the new era is here. It’s go time.

Biden will be a one-term president. That's not necessarily a bad thing.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 1:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-joins-one-term-presidents-club-legacy-historical-comparison-rcna162973,"America tends to pity the one-term president. Whether denied a second term by the voters or by fate, the commanders in chief who served only a single stint in office have a certain pathos about them. Consider just some recent one-termers. Gerald Ford? Accidental president remembered for falling down the steps of Air Force One. Jimmy Carter? Used as an epithet for a failed presidency by Republicans for decades. George H.W. Bush? Outshone by his own son’s two terms. It is this sad fate that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden sought to avoid as they ran for a second term this November. But now that Biden has dropped out, he has definitively joined the club. Before he ran in 2020, Biden reportedly considered pledging to serve only a single term before deciding instead on a strategy of ""quietly indicating"" that he wouldn't run again. (He chose a funny way of going about that.) Republican nominee John McCain also mulled a similar move in 2008. Both dropped the idea in the end because they feared it would reduce their power in the White House, but maybe also because the lure of joining the pantheon of two-term presidents is too strong. The two-termers, after all, get the glory. Mount Rushmore? Two-termers. Coins and paper bills? Two-termers. Prestige Hollywood biopics? Two-termers. One-term presidents are not remembered as fondly. When the American Political Science Association released its regular survey ranking the presidents earlier this year, the top 10 had only a single one-termer in it (JFK, who continues to be remembered more for his potential than his achievements); the bottom 10 were all one-termers (including Trump, for now). Looking at the bottom of the list starts to feel like the old ""Simpsons"" bit where the kids dress up as the ""adequate, forgettable, occasionally regrettable caretaker presidents,"" singing: One-termers, all of them. Some of that is raw skill. After all, as Trump reminded us in 2016, anyone can win a presidential race once if they get lucky. But winning twice shows that it wasn't a fluke. A second term is also a good proxy for whether you lived up to your promises since voters have a chance to weigh in on how you did with your first four years on the job. But if becoming a certified member of the One-Term Presidents club is a sad moment for Biden, there is still hope for him. Some one-termers have been rehabilitated by history, especially when they have shown skill in international diplomacy, racked up legislative achievements in a short time or done what was right for the country on a major issue. The exemplar here is James K. Polk, who, admittedly, is not well known today. But as fans of the band They Might Be Giants know, he fulfilled every one of his campaign goals in just four years, including a pledge to only serve one term. Another model is the elder Bush, whose judicious handling of the end of the Cold War and decision to end the first Gulf War without invading Iraq lost him political points at the time but came to look better in retrospect. The truth is that it's still too early to tell, as historians will largely judge Biden based on what happens next. He may be remembered for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, massive spending to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and fight climate change, and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Or his presidency may be seen as a brief interregnum between Trump's two terms. Whatever happens, Biden's decision to voluntarily step down and not seek the nomination that was within his grasp will loom large in the analysis. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins the nomination and goes on to win the general election, Biden may be seen as a statesman who understood the stakes and let go of power for the good of the country, a marked contrast with Trump, who still can't admit he lost in 2020. He will have passed the test of doing the right thing on a big issue. But if she falters and either loses the nomination or the general election, Biden will be remembered more for having held on as long as he did, fatally damaging his party's chances. Biden's legacy, then, may come down not to what he did on the job but how and when he decided to quit. He may forever be a one-term president, but, unlike most of the others, it will have been his choice, and he can take some solace in that."
Harris praises Biden's 'deep love' of country in first remarks since he endorsed her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/vp-harris-first-remarks-short-rcna163081,     
A potential Trump v. Harris race puts two competing ideas of Christianity on display,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 10:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-christian-faith-religious-freedom-rcna163011,"Following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will no longer seek re-election in November, the 2024 presidential race juxtaposes two very different versions of Christianity: Donald Trump brandishes a performative rendition of the Christian faith as a political prop to advance authoritarian theocracy, while Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to take his place as the Democratic nominee, practices the Christian faith she was raised in, while embracing her interfaith family.  In doing so, Harris embodies our nation’s founding ideal of religious freedom and models a Christian commitment to religious pluralism.  Although he has reportedly mocked his conservative Christian leaders behind their backs, was not active in church before running for president and says he’s never asked God for forgiveness, Trump has manufactured mass far-right devotion among his base through moves like overturning Roe v. Wade. Surviving an assassination attempt will only heighten MAGA zealotry, as we saw with the surge of Christian nationalist narrative claiming Trump survived only by the will of God.  Harris grew up attending 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland. “I was raised to live my faith,” she said at the National Baptist Convention, USA, Annual Meeting in 2022. “Marching for civil rights, my parents pushed me in a stroller. That was faith in action.” I’ve witnessed her put her faith in action on the national stage. Four days after Biden picked her to be his running mate in 2020, I was invited by the Biden-Harris campaign to attend a meeting between her and national faith leaders. We heard directly from the Rev. Dr. Amos Brown, her pastor at Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. It was clear from the very beginning of her national political career that she would not shy away from talking about her Baptist convictions. Harris once served as Rev. Brown’s campaign manager when he ran for re-election to the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. “She is an encourager; she encourages all people regardless of their social station in life,” Rev. Brown shared with Baptist news outlet Word&Way. “She is a role model for womanhood, and just human decency and dignity at its best.”  Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church. “Just think, after slavery was outlawed in our country, the founders of this very convention came together to protect the freedom of worship,” she said at the National Baptist Convention. “As Black people in our nation battled racist laws and ideologies, men and women of the cloth were the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in America. And they, then, following the teachings of Christ, built coalitions of people of all faiths and races and walks of life, because they understood and knew the importance of the collective.” “I can trace my belief in the importance of public service back to learning the parable of the good Samaritan and other biblical teachings about looking out for our neighbors,” she said in a Religion News Service interview in 2020.  “Ever since I was a girl, church has not only been a place where I draw strength, it’s been a place for reflection, a place to study the teachings of the Lord and to feel grounded in a complex world,” she told RNS. “Church still plays that role for me. And I also draw something else from it as well: a sense of community and belonging where we can build lasting relationships and be there for one another in times of need.” Harris grew up in an interfaith family and chose to form an interfaith family as an adult. Her mother, an immigrant from India, took her to visit Hindu temples growing up. Harris has said this teaches her “to see that all faiths teach us to pursue justice.” If elected, Harris’ husband Douglas Emhoff wouldn’t just be the first person to hold the title of first gentleman. He’d also the first Jewish spouse of a president.  “From all of these traditions and teachings, I’ve learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,” Harris said about the Hindu and Jewish influences in her life.  Emhoff has also been a leader in the Biden-Harris administration at fostering interfaith dialogue and collaboration. I heard him speak at an interfaith iftar at the U.S. Institute of Peace in 2022 during Ramadan. Harris and Emhoff hosted an Eid al-Adha celebration in 2023, the first Eid celebration at the vice president’s residence.  One of the most exciting aspects of Harris’ potential candidacy is that she doesn’t shy away from making the religious case for abortion rights, meeting head on Trump’s alliance of Christian nationalist groups pushing to outlaw abortion on so-called religious claims.  Harris spoke on this matter at the National Baptist Convention: “As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And she will choose, in consultation with her pastor or her priest, or a doctor and her loved ones. But the government should not be making that decision.” Harris’ boldness is representative, as most Christians in the United States support abortion rights.  In 2021, Rev. Lauren Jones Mayfield was invited to the White House to participate in a roundtable discussion on reproductive health care with Harris. “Harris honored my religious voice as I intended for her to hear it, a deep valuing of American religious liberty and reproductive freedoms,” Jones Mayfield told me. “The vice president made clear her own support for reproductive health for all Americans alongside her ongoing commitments to religious liberty. For those of us who engage in reproductive rights activism of our faith, not in spite of it, Harris honored our collective, clerical voice that celebrates the American right for a patient to choose their best course of medical treatment with their doctor, family and faith leader if it’s so desired.” Rooted in the Black Church tradition, deeply informed and inspired by her interfaith family, and a trailblazer for reproductive freedom, Kamala Harris’ Christian faith is the antithesis of Donald Trump’s Christian nationalism, in which the Christian faith is wielded as a tool to oppress, exclude and limit basic rights of people who believe or pray differently.  If elected president, she would make history on multiple fronts: the first female president, the second Black president, and the first president of South Asian descent. She’ll also be a role model for confidently living out your faith in public while respecting others’ religious values."
Of course Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 10:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-kamala-harris-beat-trump-democrats-rcna162955,"By the end of last week, Joe Biden’s departure from the 2024 presidential campaign seemed a question of when, not if. But when the president finally announced his exit on Sunday afternoon, the preceding sense of inevitability didn’t lessen the shock of a political leader putting party and country above his own ambitions. In an era of intense political cynicism, Biden’s withdrawal is an extraordinarily selfless act. As Barack Obama wrote in a tribute to the man he selected as his running mate in 2008, ""we’ve also been reminded — again — that he's a patriot of the highest order.” Biden’s second announcement on Sunday, less than a half hour after the first, was equally momentous. By endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him as president, Biden has unified Democrats and put the party on solid footing to hold the White House in November. A Biden endorsement of his vice president always seemed like a foregone conclusion, but by putting his full political weight behind Harris, Biden ensured that no Democrat would seriously challenge her bid for the party’s nomination.  Not surprisingly, by Sunday evening, the wind at Harris’ back had reached hurricane strength. All the Democratic officials whose names have been bandied around as potential challengers to Harris — including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newson and Josh Shapiro — endorsed her bid for president. So, too, have former President Bill Clinton and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. As of Monday morning 178 members of the House and Senate Democratic caucuses had jumped on the Harris bandwagon. Key unions, abortion rights organizations and other outside groups quickly threw their support behind Harris. And Democrats appear poised to have one of the single best fundraising days in American history — raising $60 million in less than 24 hours At this point, Harris is likely to win the party’s nomination in Chicago by acclamation. But here’s the question that most concerns Democrats — can she beat Donald Trump? Critics will point out that Harris’s 2020 bid for the White House was a disaster — and they’re right. Her campaign was not just poorly managed, but it was difficult to discern a basic rationale for her candidacy. She came across as overly cautious, lacking a core set of beliefs. She struggled with staffing issues — a problem that persisted into her early days as vice president. That Harris is a polished and effective campaigner has never been in doubt. But it’s her management skills that have long been in question. But other presidents, including Biden himself, have succeeded after earlier failed campaigns. And the past three weeks have arguably lessened the concerns about Harris. Since Biden’s disastrous debate performance, pretty much every Democrat on the planet expressed either a public or private opinion about who should lead the party against Trump in November — with one notable exception, Kamala Harris. There have been zero leaks from Harris’ team or her political allies. She allowed no political daylight between her and Biden as she criss-crossed the country on behalf of the presidential ticket. And when the president dropped out, the vice president and her whip operation sprung into action, quickly lining up endorsements and support. In a matter of hours, Harris and Democrats had completely flipped the script on the 2024 campaign. Of course, the strategic problems that torpedoed Harris’ campaign four years ago could return between now and November. But one advantage for Harris is that the campaign’s trajectory and messaging have long been established. The Biden campaign sought to make 2024 a referendum on Trump. The Harris campaign will do the same. Her most important responsibility will be to make the case why another Trump term in office will be a disaster for America — and the best option for voters is to stay the course with Democrats. That she can do, and likely more effectively than the man she is replacing.  At the end of one of the most extraordinary 24-hour periods in American political history, it’s amazing what a difference one day can make. On Sunday morning, Democrats were in disarray, hopelessly divided and convinced that the 2024 election was already a lost cause. A day later, they are united and seemingly more determined than ever to end Trumpism once and for all. If they are successful, Joe Biden’s legacy will be set — as the man who stepped up to eject Donald Trump from the White House, and four years later as the man who stepped down to ensure Trump remained out of office.

Kamala Harris’ ‘top cop’ background complicates matters for GOP,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 9:57 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-top-cop-2024-election-republicans-democrats-rcna163062,"Most American presidents were lawyers before seeking elected office, but the number of presidents with prosecutorial experience is vastly smaller. Vice President Kamala Harris would join this tiny club. The New York Times reported on the Democratic candidate’s professional background: A Time magazine report added that Harris, who campaigned in the Golden State as California’s “top cop,” also “developed a tough-on-crime reputation as district attorney.” This wasn’t a principal part of Harris’ pitch during her 2020 campaign, but that’s apparently about to change. In fact, it was just a couple of hours ago when the vice president’s political operation issued a press statement with a headline that read in part, “Donald Trump Won’t Be the First Felon Kamala Harris Holds Accountable.” For Republicans, this creates a challenge. At last week’s Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird boasted about her party’s approach to law enforcement: “We put criminals where they belong: in jail.” Montana Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy added, “Cops are good, criminals are bad.” My personal favorite was a speech from House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who said with a straight face, “Donald Trump stands with the people and the police — our men and women in blue — not with the criminals and rioters.” It was around this time when convention attendees waved pre-printed “Back the Blue” signs. As we discussed soon after, there was a glaring problem with the rhetoric: A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies — which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault — and the Republican happens to be running on a platform rooted in his support for rioters. But after President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race, the dynamic took on a greater significance. This isn’t just a situation in which Republicans have nominated a criminal for the nation’s highest office, it’s also a situation in which the GOP candidate will likely face someone with a record of putting criminals behind bars. The New York Times reported a few months ago on the “complicated relationship” between Trump and law enforcement, which touched on an underappreciated story. Emmer’s rhetoric about the former president “standing with the police” notwithstanding, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. Just as notably, Trump has promised pardons for insurrectionists, many of whom violently clashed with police officers. And that was before he prepared to take on a former prosecutor. Complicating matters, some of the top contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination — Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — are also former prosecutors, raising the prospect of two former prosecutors taking on the first presidential candidate in American history to be convicted of a crime. The Republican’s crimes and condemnations of law enforcement haven’t stopped multiple police unions from endorsing his 2024 candidacy — the first time in modern American history in which police unions have backed a criminal for national elected office — though it’s an open question as to whether they might reconsider. As for Trump, the former president said at a rally on Saturday: “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal.” Don’t be surprised if Team Harris puts that quote to use in the coming weeks and months."

Joe Manchin possibly rejoining the Democratic Party and running for president, the independent West Virginian told CBS News that he would not be a candidate. * For reasons that I do not understand, Donald Trump continued to rail against Biden Sunday night and Monday morning, including fresh allegations from the former president that the Democrat “never had Covid.” (If you’re confused about why the Republican keeps pushing this, you’re not alone.) * In a bit of a surprise, businessman Sandy Pensler ended his Republican U.S. Senate campaign in Michigan and agreed to back his primary rival, former Rep.

Flashback to 2018: Harris says she is keenly aware of what a barrier-breaking campaign would entail,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 8:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/flashback-2018-harris-says-keenly-aware-barrier-breaking-campaign-enta-rcna163048,"All eyes are on Vice President Kamala Harris following Joe Biden’s decision over the weekend to withdraw his candidacy for the U.S. presidency and to endorse her instead. If Harris, 59, become the Democratic nominee and defeats Republican candidate Donald Trump in November, she would be the first woman to serve as U.S. president. Harris previously served as the first woman and first Black attorney general and U.S. senator in California’s history. In December 2018, then-senator Harris headlined a Know Your Value event in San Francisco as she was considering making a bid for the presidency in 2020. Harris said she was keenly aware of the challenges a barrier-breaking campaign would entail. “Let’s be honest. It’s going to be ugly,” Harris told Know Your Value founder and “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski on stage in front of hundreds of women. “When you break things, it is painful. And you get cut. And you bleed.” Harris did end up making a bid for the nation’s top position, but withdrew her bid in December 2019, citing a lack of funding. In 2021, the vice president was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s inaugural “50 Over 50” list . During an interview with Brzezinski about the honor, Harris encouraged women not to view their age as a limitation and to follow their passions at every phase of their lives. “There is so much that we still need to do to encourage girls and women of every age to know and internalize their capacity, and to internalize their strength and their gift, whatever that may be—and to not be burdened by other peoples’ limited views of their capacity based on who has historically done what,” she said. Harris, then 56, added she has never used her age as a guide for her life plans— not even when others told her “no.” “I’ve never been one to do a five-year plan. Never. I’ve never evaluated myself based on my age,” Harris told Brzezinski. “...I’ve been told many times during my career, things from, ‘oh, you’re too young, ‘It’s not your turn,’ ‘They’re not ready for you.’ But I didn’t listen.” The vice president added: “I eat ‘no’ for breakfast.” And just last month, Brzezinski sat down with Harris to mark the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling striking down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which guaranteed the right to abortion in the United States. Accompanying Harris was Hadley Duvall, a young woman from Kentucky who  survived her stepfather’s sexual abuse as a child. Duvall teamed up with Harris to sound the alarm on what a second Trump presidency would mean for women in America. Harris declared that freedom is at stake in this year’s election. “Every person of whatever gender should understand that if such a fundamental freedom, such as the right to make decisions about your own body can be taken. Be aware of what other freedoms may be at stake,” said Harris. Brzezinski asked Harris why the presidential race is so close, to which Harris responded: “These races are always close …At the end of the day, we’re going to win ..Just look at what happened in the midterms, for example…Many talked about the red wave. I would call it a red drip. You look at where the American people were in so called red states, and so called blue states, every time this issue of abortion was on the ballot, the people voted for freedom …We have our differences, but the American people believe in the integrity of our country and our values, which include that we protect and fight for individual freedoms and liberties. And so I do believe that the contrast is clear. And in November, it will be stark.”  "
"Election denier Mike Johnson claims legal concern for Biden voters, democracy",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 8:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/mike-johnson-biden-harris-trump-rcna163013,"When you hear “Mike Johnson” in the same breath as “invalidating votes,” you might think of his role supporting unsuccessful efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential victory. But on Sunday, the Republican House speaker voiced purported concern about invalidating the votes of millions of Democratic primary voters, raising the specter of unspecified legal challenges to Democrats putting forward a different nominee than Biden against Donald Trump in November. For starters, there doesn’t appear to be any legal impediment to nominating someone besides Biden (seemingly Vice President Kamala Harris, at this point). Though Biden was the presumptive nominee after winning all but one Democratic contest earlier this year, he hadn’t officially been nominated. That process was expected to take place next month. And despite what some Republicans have claimed, the relevant state ballot deadlines for appearing on the ballot haven’t passed. And in this historic moment, it’s worth recalling Johnson’s support for invalidating votes in the 2020 election. When he became speaker last year, The New York Times called him “a silent but pivotal partner” in the failed effort, citing, among other things, that he “collected signatures for a legal brief in support of a Texas lawsuit, rooted in baseless claims of widespread election irregularities, that tried to throw out the results in four battleground states won by” Biden. Johnson is a lawyer, by the way.  Relatedly, there’s Johnson’s support for his party’s nominee, who is under criminal indictment for allegedly subverting the 2020 election. Trump’s federal election interference indictment, for example, alleges that, “on the pretext of baseless fraud claims, the Defendant pushed officials in certain states to ignore the popular vote; disenfranchise millions of voters; dismiss legitimate electors; and ultimately, cause the ascertainment of and voting by illegitimate electors in favor of the Defendant.” (Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases and was found guilty in the New York case, the only one to have gone to trial.) So while we should expect Johnson to continue supporting baseless legal claims to aid Republicans, right now it’s hard to see any merit to such claims. And even if legitimate issues arise, it will always be difficult to take Johnson seriously as a caretaker for democracy and the rule of law.

Team Trump (sort of) provides new info on post-shooting medical care,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-sort-provides-new-info-post-shooting-medical-care-rcna163038,"For the first several days after a gunman attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, the former president and his political operation had surprisingly little to say about the medical care he’d received. What’s more, it wasn’t at all clear why they’d be tight-lipped about this. An Associated Press report noted last week that the public was “still in the dark over the extent of his injuries, what treatment the Republican presidential nominee received in the hospital, and whether there may be any long-term effects on his health. Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family.” CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta also had a good piece along these lines last week, noting that a full public assessment of Trump’s injuries “is necessary,” adding: “The concern is that gunshot blasts near the head can cause injuries that aren’t immediately noticeable, such as bleeding in or on the brain, damage to the inner ear or even psychological trauma. As a trauma neurosurgeon, I have seen how a thorough evaluation after any kind of gunshot wound can provide a complete picture and lead to a speedier recovery.” Since I wrote about this a few days ago, it seemed only fair to note that Team Trump did, in fact, eventually provide some additional information — at least, sort of. The Washington Post reported: To be sure, some transparency is better than no transparency, and it’s good to know that the former president is recovering well in the wake of the shooting nine days ago. But this doesn’t put the matter entirely to rest. Under normal circumstances, we’d expect to receive information from the physicians who actually treated Trump after the incident. There might even be a news conference or two. Instead, Team Trump waited a week before issuing a letter from a member of Congress — issued on Jackson’s congressional letterhead — who acknowledged two years ago that he had allowed his medical license in Florida to expire. (Jackson’s medical license remains in “military active” status until early next year.) This is the same Jackson who was slammed by the Pentagon’s inspector general’s office, which concluded in 2021 that Jackson engaged in “inappropriate conduct” while serving as Trump’s White House doctor, adding that the congressman “drank alcohol, made sexual comments to subordinates, and took the sedative Ambien while working as White House physician.” The watchdog also found that Jackson mistreated subordinates and “disparaged, belittled, bullied and humiliated them.” In 2022, the Navy demoted Jackson from admiral to captain as a consequence of his misconduct. The Washington Post’s report added: “Jackson worked in the White House medical unit under three presidents but drew scrutiny in a Pentagon inspector general’s report, which states that he provided prescription drugs without proper paperwork — a habit that allegedly earned him the nickname ‘Candyman.‘ Jackson has denied the report’s claims, describing them as politically motivated.” He was nevertheless elected to Congress, where Jackson ran into ethics troubles. Between Jackson’s record and Trump’s long-standing record of problematic medical disclosures, Saturday’s statement didn’t exactly resolve the larger concern.

Democrats celebrate President Biden’s ‘selfless and patriotic act’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 7:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrats-celebrate-president-bidens-selfless-patriotic-act-rcna163029,"After President Joe Biden announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term, the Democratic incumbent wasted little time in endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris. The Californian, not surprisingly, issued a statement of her own that touted, among other things, Biden’s “remarkable legacy of accomplishment,” his leadership, his “honesty and integrity,” and his “big heart.” But there was one sentence in Harris’ statement that stood out for me: To acknowledge the obvious, Biden faced an incredibly difficult decision. The Delaware Democrat scored an impressive victory four years ago — by most measures, the best performance for a challenger since FDR — and took office facing daunting challenges, here and abroad. In the months and years that followed, Biden’s steady hand helped guide the nation through dangerous waters, putting his skills and experience to use. The result is a stronger and safer nation, well positioned for the future. In theory, his re-election should’ve been a foregone conclusion. In practice, it wasn’t nearly that simple, and his odds of electoral success were poor, despite his accomplishments. It must’ve been tempting for the president, confronting unwelcome evidence and pressure, to put his desire to serve above other considerations, but when push came to shove, Americans were reminded of who Joe Biden is. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni had a good column on “the bigness of what Biden just did.” It’s no secret that Biden has long dreamed of the presidency, first seeking the office 36 years ago. Having finally attained the office, and delivering on his promises, it’s not surprising that he was slow to listen to those who urged him to acknowledge unpleasant electoral realities. But in the American tradition, leaders became heroes, not just through the leadership, but also by choosing to voluntarily relinquish power for the benefit of the nation. Biden didn't just do the right thing with his decision to pass the torch, he did the patriotic thing — making a historic sacrifice for the good of the country — creating a case study for future generations to follow. Take a bow, Mr. President. You’ve earned it."
"Trump raises stakes in 2024 race, praises ‘iron fist’ leaders",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 6:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-raises-stakes-2024-race-praises-iron-fist-leaders-rcna163009,"In his bizarre speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Donald Trump strayed from his prepared text to share some thoughts about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. “Hungary, strong country,” the Republican said. “Run by a very powerful, tough leader. He’s a tough guy. The press doesn’t like him because he’s tough.” In reality, of course, it’s not just “the press” who has concerns with Orbán — and “tough” seemed like a ridiculous adjective given the circumstances. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem has explained, the Hungarian strongman has taken a series of steps in recent years to undermine democratic institutions, “through measures like consolidation of hundreds of media outlets under the control of political allies, gaming elections and using emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic to dramatically expand executive power.” Vox published a related report in 2018 on “how democracy died in Hungary.” It noted a vote from the European Parliament, which labelled Orbán’s government a “systemic threat to the rule of law.” Closer to home, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said just a couple of weeks ago that Orbán is also “completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians.” And yet, Trump can’t seem to shake his affection for the Hungarian leader, which leads to a related question: Does the former president admire Orbán despite the apparent fact that he’s “completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians” or because of it? The question returned to the fore over the weekend, when Trump spoke in Michigan and reiterated his praise for foreign autocrats. As a Newsweek report noted: Trump clearly wasn’t kidding. “Orbán was right,” Trump continued. “We have to have somebody that can protect us.” When the political world looks at the Republican as a candidate who’s hostile toward democracy, part of the focus is on his failed White House term, when he was routinely indifferent to legal limits and constitutional boundaries, culminating in an effort to claim illegitimate power after an election defeat. There’s a related focus, of course, on his 2024 platform: Trump, a candidate who’s talked about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship.” He’s also vowing to reject election results he doesn’t like, created militarized camps, issue pardons for politically aligned criminals, and fire federal officials who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. But just as important is Trump looking to authoritarians as models worthy of emulation. Ahead of the 2016 elections, the then-GOP candidate was on record praising Saddam Hussein, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and even China’s handling of the Tiananmen Square massacre. (Seeing images of brave Chinese democrats standing in defiance in front of tanks, Trump sided who deployed the tanks.) Ahead of the 2024 elections, he’s doing it again. Trump offers gushing admiration for Beijing’s “ruthless” control over China’s population. He struggles to contain how impressed he is with his benefactor in Moscow. He celebrates Orbán “because he says, ‘This is the way it’s going to be,’ and that’s the end of it. ... He’s the boss.” He heralds Kim Jong Un as an “absolute leader.” He asks his followers to believe, “It’s nice to have a strongman running the country.” This keeps happening for a reason: Trump expresses public admiration for dictators, not despite their authoritarian control, but because of it. In the process, the former president keeps raising the stakes in the 2024 race. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"In the new 2024 race, Trump hedges on debating Kamala Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-2024-race-trump-hedges-debating-kamala-harris-rcna163003,"It’s difficult to overstate just how eager Donald Trump was to debate President Joe Biden. Last summer, for example, the Republican said the debates “definitely” have to happen. Soon after, the former president suggested he’d like to see 10 debates, rather than the usual three. As regular readers might recall, Trump used his social media platform in the spring to declare that he was prepared to debate the Democratic incumbent “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE,” regardless of who organizes the events. A month later, the former president headlined a rally in Wisconsin and appeared alongside an empty podium on the stage. “This is for Joe Biden,” Trump said. “I am trying to get him to debate.” It was not subtle. The GOP nominee worked from the assumption that a one-on-one debate against the incumbent would go his way, and as it turns out, it did. But now that Biden has decided to forgo his re-election plans, is the former president equally eager to share a stage with Vice President Kamala Harris? Here was the message Trump published to his social media platform a few hours after Biden’s announcement: At this point, we could note that there’s literally zero evidence of Biden being corrupt; presidential scholars consider Trump the worst president in American history; ABC News is neither “fake” nor “very biased; and Trump’s deliberate misspelling of George Stephanopoulos’ name makes the Republican look like an ill-tempered tween.But as relevant as those details are, let’s not miss the forest for the trees: When it came to a possible debate against Biden, Trump said, “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” When it comes to a possible debate against Harris, Trump’s message is ... noticeably different. What’s more, Politico reported overnight, “One GOP source tells me he doubts Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris — he’ll likely call her an illegitimate candidate.” In fairness, it’s worth emphasizing that Jason Miller, a senior member of the former president’s campaign team, told NBC News that there will “definitely” be another debate. Whether his boss ends up agreeing remains to be seen."
Why Republicans have reason to worry about the 2024 race shake-up,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-reason-worry-2024-race-shake-rcna162998,"As the Republican National Convention wrapped up four days ago, party officials could hardly believe their good fortune. Republican expectations had reached extraordinary heights, which was understandable under the circumstances: The party was united; their candidate was leading; their opponents were splintered; and the Democratic incumbent appeared on track to lose. For his part, Donald Trump wasn’t just telling people privately he’d win, he’d also started talking about the post-election transition period, as if his 2024 victory were a given. Everything was on track — until the race changed. The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta had a good report on this overnight, noting that Republicans, with striking speed, went from “cocky ... to fearful,” in large part because they assumed President Joe Biden would never abandon his re-election candidacy. A Politico headline said the Republican Party was “pretty pissed” by the Democratic incumbent’s surprise announcement, adding, “It’s striking how much GOP anger there is over today’s news. Donald Trump’s campaign is built to beat Joe Biden.” Democrats, meanwhile, have made a similar transition — from despair about a looming defeat to cautious hopes about a race reborn. To be sure, there’s still some uncertainty about the process and the relevant details, and it’d be an overstatement to start describing Vice President Kamala Harris as the presumptive nominee. But let’s not play games. Delegates are on board with Harris. So are Democratic governors and members of Congress. And the Clintons. And Cabinet members. And labor unions. And donors — both large and small. Perhaps most importantly, a Harris-vs-Trump contest offers contrasts that Democrats like. At this time 24 hours ago, the presidential race was a contest between two old and unpopular men. Now, barring any surprises, the contest is dramatically different. In a year in which focus group members say they’re looking for a younger candidate, Republicans are running the oldest presidential nominee in American history against a likely Democratic candidate who’s nearly two decades younger. In a year in which many voters are concerned about crime, Republicans are running a man who’s committed dozens of felonies against a former prosecutor who’s brought criminals to justice. In a year in which some voters might care about experience, Republicans are running the least experienced presidential ticket in generations against a Democrat who’s spent the last 20 years serving the public well. I spoke to someone overnight who works in Democratic politics who said a Harris-Trump contest would be “the future vs the past.” No wonder Republicans are feeling anxious."
Kamala Harris is the right choice to continue Joe Biden’s legacy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-next-president-joe-biden-legacy-rcna162596,"The seesaw battle for the soul of the Democratic Party is finally over. A long three weeks after Joe Biden’s debate debacle against Donald Trump, with scores of party leaders and big-time donors expressing zero confidence in his physical ability to endure the rigors of the campaign trail, our 46th president has called it quits.   It wasn’t easy for Biden to reach this decision. By nature, he is a relentless crusader on behalf of America’s working class. His Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the among the most historic pieces of legislation since Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society victories in the 1960s. But at 81 years old, Biden — who refused to take a cognitive test — has reached the end of the line. The Democratic Party’s burden of derailing Trump’s backward-looking isolationism, nativism and racial divisiveness takes a Democratic nominee with the stamina to deliver five energetic speeches a day. This rule does not apply to Trump: He is a MAGA cult leader with his own Truth Social network at his disposal in a nanosecond. It couldn’t have been easy for Biden to reach this decision, because, as he’s said many times, he really has proven how to get “Big Deal” beneficial things done for America’s middle class. But now, after much hand-wringing and fretting over abysmal approval ratings, Biden has returned to his previous 2020 political position. “Look,” he said then, “I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else. There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.” That future is now. But Biden himself prepared us for this moment four years ago, when he selected Kamala Harris as his running mate. As Trump and his campaign deployed racist dog whistles, Biden chose a brilliant 59-year-old California woman with a Jamaican-born economics professor for a father and an India-born research scientist for a mother. Countering Trump’s innate sexism and lawlessness, Biden recognized and valued the incisive intelligence Harris had honed as a courtroom prosecutor, district attorney, attorney general and senator. Now Vice President Harris must use those skills to send Trumpism writ large into history’s dustbin. Everyone who truly knows Harris, not the media, knows she is brilliant and an empathetic voice for social justice. The vice president’s family — as recounted in her excellent memoir, “The Truths We Hold” — is part of the great American immigrant success story. When Trump said at a 2023 New Hampshire rally that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” Harris’ response came swift and hard. “It is language meant to divide us,” she said later the same day, likening Trump’s vitriol to “the language of Hitler.”  Born in Oakland, California, in 1964, Harris was raised in college towns in the Midwest before graduating from high school in Quebec. She then returned to America and attended Washington, D.C.’s prestigious Howard University before she resettled in her birth state for law school. After graduation, Harris became a prosecutor and was eventually elected San Francisco’s district attorney in 2003. Over the next dozen years, she worked her way up to elected posts as the state’s attorney general and then its junior senator. Columnist Joe Mathews put his own spin on it: “Is there any better preparation for running a country … than a political career in a state as crazy as California?”   Harris arrived on the national scene in tumultuous political times, entering the Senate just as Donald Trump entered the White House. As Trump’s presidency opened floodgates of right-wing activism across the land, she earned a reputation as one of the Senate’s most forceful interrogators, skewering the likes of Attorney General William Barr and Supreme Court nominee (now Justice) Brett Kavanaugh. When Joe Biden selected her as his running mate four years ago, he was already thinking about the next chapter of her history, and of America’s. Donald Trump and the Electoral College had denied America its first female president in 2016. But Biden’s endorsement of Harris once again opens the White House door to finally have America’s first female president. The passing of the Democratic Party leadership to Harris has come earlier than our 46th president had hoped. But Biden — the inveterate institutionalist, strategist and political fighter — had set up his heir apparent in advance: Kamala Harris.  Extending his presidential legacy was the motivation for Andrew Jackson in the early 1830s. On track for easy re-election, Jackson proposed that after he won he would immediately resign, leaving the top job to his vice presidential running mate, the personable Martin Van Buren. Devoid of any imperial attitude toward the presidency, Jackson considered it as just another job, in which withdrawal or resignation due to changing circumstances could and should be commonplace. Only when Martin Van Buren balked on minor grounds did Jackson abandon his plan.      By the time President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose a new running mate in 1944, he’d been in office 12 years. As with Biden, his focus was innately on the future, and self-awareness of his own ill health must certainly have had him thinking of a potential successor. His ultimate choice, Sen. Harry S. Truman of Missouri, may have been fairly obscure, but no one knew better than Roosevelt what the job of the presidency required. And when Truman ascended to the office upon Roosevelt’s death in 1945, his instinct was borne out. Today, Truman is regarded as one of the very best presidents in U.S. history. Another member of that august group, President Dwight Eisenhower, was keenly aware that a president’s job included setting up a strong bench of future leaders. Though popular with his party and the electorate during his first term, the 66-year-old Eisenhower wasn’t convinced that he remained the man for the job. In a letter to his personal physician, he used a football analogy to explain why: A good quarterback, he wrote, “may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play. … If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the presidency.” Ike elaborated on this theme in his diary, noting that there is a “greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50” and that to win, his party needed top-tier candidates “in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize … youth, vigor.” A decade later, facing the prospect of a re-election campaign in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson worried not so much about his age as about his own unpopularity’s dragging his party to defeat. Announcing his decision not to seek a second term, he framed the campaign horse race as a distraction from the real work of governing. “With America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day,” he said, “I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes, or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office.” For four years now, Vice President Harris has been in the trenches fighting against right-wing populist forces challenging America’s future here at home and abroad. During her term, Harris has traveled extensively, visiting 21 countries on missions ranging from humanitarian to military. She was a point person for the administration on immigration, on climate and on women’s right to health care and reproductive freedom. Sometimes studious, sometimes vivacious, she has emerged as the very antithesis of Trump. Harris and Trump now offer voters the starkest political contrast in U.S. campaign history since 1860.  Where Harris is rational, Trump is bombastic. By virtue of Harris’ legal training, she instinctively deals in facts. Former President Trump is a showman extraordinaire who doesn’t let truth get in the way of scoring a shazam moment. Where she’s compassionate, he is often the bully of the bully pulpit.  Make no mistake, though, Harris can be the toughest presence in any room. But being combative in one-on-one political showdowns — like she was with Kavanaugh and Barr — isn’t her default modus operandi. In an old-fashioned but multicultural 21st century way, Harris is an avatar of Duty, Honor and Country. A vote for Kamala Harris this November, in essence, is a vote for the legacy of Joe Biden."

Lester Hunt launches a final effort to take McCarthy on and rein in his abuses.

(NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rick Ewig: This is an interview with Mr. Lester C. Hunt, Jr. Mr. Hunt is a historian teaching in a Chicago-area college. This interview is being conducted on December 29, 1979, in Mr. Hunt’s home on Cornell Avenue in Chicago. Rachel Maddow: That is the voice of a grad student at the University of Wyoming. His name is Rick Ewig. It’s 1979, and Mr. Ewig is doing this interview for a research paper. The paper is about a U.S. senator from Wyoming, Lester Hunt. He’s in Chicago to interview the son of the senator. Ewig: His father was a United States senator from the state of Wyoming who served in the Senate from 1949 to 1954. Maddow: It was 25 years since Lester Hunt had served in the Senate; 25 years since he died. But this grad student managed to track down the senator’s son and namesake, Lester Hunt, Jr., who had always been known by the name Buddy. Radio Anchor: Taking seats right next to Mrs. Hunt, Buddy Hunt, son of His Excellency Governor Lester C. Hunt of Wyoming.  Maddow: Buddy Hunt had been a young man when his father died. He’d been 26 years old. Ewig: Okay, what I’d like to start out with first is, like, a general background on your father, since I really don’t know much about him. Lester C. “Buddy” Hunt, Jr.: Well, let me see. What do you want from me? Like, you know, beginning to end sort of thing? Ewig: Okay, well, for my own benefit that I would -- I would like to have is a physical description of him. Was he your size or? Buddy Hunt: How interesting. He’s taller than I am, had light brown hair, as you probably know, and white later. He was corpulent. And often as fat as I am, although not always. And round-chested, you know, heavy built. Women thought he was very charming. He had a good smile and a sort of pleasant face. His sort of face did not put people off. Maddow: There was a lot that Buddy remembered about his dad. How he never touched a drop of alcohol in his life. How good a baseball player he was. How he had decided to become a dentist, not exactly for the love of medicine, but just as a way to build a bigger, fuller life for himself and his family. He remembered that the career his dad built after being a dentist, that one was the real passion for him.  Buddy Hunt: He would often talk about how he enjoyed his dental practice and this and that, but it was clear, I think, from our point of view, that what he liked was politics and dentistry was a way to make a living. Anyhow, that’s the way we saw it, and that’s sort of the way my mother and sister and I sort of talk about it, at least. And he loved politics. He just loved it. Maddow: He loved politics. One of the things that stuck out the most for Buddy about his dad, even all those years later, was how hard he had worked at that job that he really loved. Buddy Hunt: He worked a lot of nights, a lot of weekends. But, on the whole, he didn’t bring his work home. So that at home, we didn’t -- we talked about personal things, you know, family things and so forth. And he didn’t talk much politics at home. He was glad to get it off his mind when he came home.  Maddow: “He was glad to get it off his mind when he came home.” And maybe it was for that reason, Senator Hunt not bringing his work home, that there was quite a lot that the senator’s own family didn’t know about him in terms of what he was contending with at work day to day. That was certainly true when it came to the darkest chapter of his time in politics, his time in Washington. And that was the reason this grad student was interviewing Buddy Hunt in the first place. During the interview in Chicago, he pulled out some old newspaper articles for Buddy to take a look at. They were from right after his dad died. Articles written by Washington journalists Drew Pearson and Marquis Childs. They had to do with the specific circumstances surrounding the death of Senator Lester Hunt.  Ewig: Have you read the things that were written by Drew Pearson or Marquis Childs?  Buddy Hunt: No. No. Ewig: You haven’t read any of that?  Buddy Hunt: No, I haven’t. Ewig: Oh. Because they say basically that -- you know, that your father was being blackmailed.  Buddy Hunt: Oh, they did?  Maddow: Blackmailed. It was maybe not the sort of question Buddy Hunt expected to get from this grad student who was just there interviewing him for a research paper. Ewig: They say basically that -- you know, that your father was being blackmailed.  Buddy Hunt: Oh, they did?  Ewig: Yeah.  Buddy Hunt: By whom? I don’t -- Ewig: It was by Senators Welker and Bridges at the time. Maddow: It was by Senators Welker and Bridges, two Republican U.S. senators.  Ewig: You know, I have the things here if you’d like to look at them.  Buddy Hunt: Yeah, I might. I don’t -- I don’t think I’ve seen them. I might have seen those and, you know, ignored them because I -- Ewig: Yeah, well, this here, this one is by Drew Pearson, that one came out shortly after your father died, like a few days. Buddy Hunt: Uh huh. Interesting. I didn’t see this. Maddow: Buddy Hunt here is reading these newspaper articles detailing a blackmail campaign by these other senators against his father.  Ewig: And Marquis Childs says basically the same thing as -- Buddy Hunt: Uh huh, uh huh. No, I didn’t see that. It may be that nobody told me this, in order not to tell me this, you know, and then — Ewig: Yeah. Maddow: You can hear it in Buddy’s voice. He’s almost speechless. But it’s there in black and white in front of him. It’s detailed reporting.  Buddy Hunt: I don’t know anything about that. But maybe I -- maybe I wasn’t supposed to. Maybe that was the whole issue.  Ewig: That could be.  Maddow: Because buried in these old newspaper articles Buddy Hunt had never seen before was not just the reporting that Buddy’s dad had been blackmailed. It was also the reporting that the blackmail had to do with Buddy.  Buddy Hunt: The only blackmail thing I see here is in regard to me. Am I missing something?  Ewig: No, that’s basically it. Buddy Hunt: No. Yeah, yeah. Maddow: “The only blackmail thing I see here is in regard to me.” That’s what Buddy Hunt says there. And he is right about that. The blackmail that preceded his father’s death was in regard to Buddy. What it was really about, though, was the fact that his father, Democratic Senator Lester Hunt, had made a very powerful, very dangerous enemy in Washington, a man with almost superhuman talent for dominating every news cycle. A man with a chain of serious ethics problems, personal problems, corruption scandals. A man who had been caught in innumerable lies, flagrant lies, on issues big and small, trivial and serious. All of which seemed to only increase his followers’ belief that he was the only one they could trust, the only politician they truly believed in. He had been aligning himself with some of the most dangerous forces in the country, who saw in him not just someone they agreed with, but someone whose approach to power might succeed in what they wanted. It might succeed in taking the country apart. His critics described him as a would-be American dictator, and warned that his power might be growing even beyond his own party’s ability to stop him. That he might make it to the apex of American power, to the White House, no matter what any entity in politics might do to try to stop him. His political opponents had sought to have him censured, impeached, expelled from the Senate. Not only had he survived all of it, but each successive failed confrontation appeared to make him stronger, his base of support all the more energized. And those battles had been costly. His opponents would not only find themselves unsuccessful in their efforts to stop him, they would then find themselves targeted in response with every kind of attack, breaking every kind of rule. Rules of the Senate. Rules of decency. In Washington, Lester Hunt had made the kind of enemy who wouldn’t even think twice about trying to destroy an opponent by attacking a man’s family, by using his own son against him.  Ewig: This is a tough question to ask.  Buddy Hunt: Ask anything you want.  Ewig: Why do you think that your father did kill himself?  Maddow: This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Roger McDaniel: He had seen McCarthy ruin people’s lives, in some cases drive people to suicide.  Reporter: Former senator found shot to death in his Washington home today.  McDaniel: Hunt was one of the very few politicians at the time who challenged McCarthy. Senator Lester C. Hunt: It’s being used as a special privilege for a few, very few, irresponsible members of Congress.  McDaniel: This opportunity presents itself for him to take revenge on Lester Hunt.  ******************************** Maddow: Episode 6: Under Pressure. Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr.: I have introduced an amendment to the Constitution of the United States -- Maddow: As political nicknames go, it wasn’t the strongest. But it fit, and so everybody used it. Everybody called him Young Bob. La Follette: -- which would give the people the right to vote on the question of peace or war.  Maddow: Young Bob La Follette. The “Young” was to distinguish him from his dad, who was also named Bob. The older Bob, Robert La Follette, was political royalty in Wisconsin. District attorney, congressman, governor, U.S. senator. He’d even made a run for president as the candidate for the Progressive Party.  It was one of the most successful third-party presidential runs ever. He was a household name. And then so was his son, Young Bob, who succeeded him in the U.S. Senate. When Young Bob was elected to that Senate seat, he was only 30 years old, one of the youngest senators in U.S. history.  La Follette: I believe that it presents a great opportunity for service to your state and to the nation. Maddow: Young Bob La Follette was a Republican. Like his father, he was also progressive. He was pro-labor, a critic of big business, a champion of civil liberties. He was pro-FDR’s New Deal. And although he had been an isolationist ahead of World War II -- he’d even been involved with the America First Committee -- nevertheless, FDR liked him back. Roosevelt, in fact, liked Young Bob so much that he considered naming him Secretary of State or to the Supreme Court, or even tapping him as a potential vice presidential running mate, even though they were from different parties. Young Bob was also loudly and firmly anti-communist. An issue which was much more important to him than it was at the time to an unknown political upstart who challenged him for his Wisconsin Senate seat in 1946.  Reporter: Today’s guest, Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Maddow: When Joseph McCarthy primaried Young Bob La Follette in 1946, Young Bob wasn’t all that young anymore. He had been in the Senate for a couple of decades. And McCarthy blasted him as a creature of Washington who had lost touch with what was going on back home in Wisconsin. McCarthy told voters that Young Bob actually lived in Virginia, even though he had never lived there.  McCarthy said La Follette was corrupt, that he was using his influence in the Senate to enrich himself. That wasn’t true either. But McCarthy campaigned with incredible energy, and in a low-turnout August primary election, he won that big upset. Before McCarthy had come along, that U.S. Senate seat had been in the hands of someone named Bob La Follette for more than 40 years. But that is how McCarthy got his seat in the Senate, by cutting off a legendary political dynasty.  McCarthy biographer Larry Tye says Joe McCarthy called that race against Young Bob the sweetest political triumph of his entire life. Soon after he lost that race and left the Senate, Young Bob wrote an article for Collier’s magazine on a topic that was still an animating concern for him. He wrote, “I know from firsthand experience that communist sympathizers have infiltrated into committee staffs on Capitol Hill in Washington. A few years ago when I was chairman of the Senate Civil Liberties Committee, I was forced to take measures in an effort to stamp out influence within my own committee staff.” It was 1947 when Young Bob wrote that. He wrote it years before Joe McCarthy ever picked up anti-communism as his signature issue. But once McCarthy did latch on to that issue and rode it to the heights of political power -- Reporter: You believe as of the moment there are Communists in the State Department?  Senator Joseph R. McCarthy: Communists or worse.  Maddow: Young Bob developed a strong suspicion that McCarthy was going to come back for him. That McCarthy would haul him before his committee in Congress, berate him live on television about these communists that Young Bob had admitted to knowing about on his Senate committee staff. He’d admitted to it in that magazine article. Well, why hadn’t he sounded an alarm about it at the time? Why hadn’t he called the FBI? Why was he so soft on this issue? In the end, McCarthy never got his chance to ask. Reporter: Headlines, Washington. Former Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr. of Wisconsin was found shot to death in his Washington home today. Apparently he died by his own hand. He was 58.  Maddow: Robert La Follette, Jr. drove home from work, closed himself in the bathroom, and shot himself with a pistol his father had given him when he was a kid. Young Bob was known to have had a long history with depression. He also reportedly harbored deep regret about losing the U.S. Senate seat once held by his dad.  But according to his own son, it was the threat of being dragged in front of Congress by Joe McCarthy that most directly contributed to him taking his own life. La Follette told multiple people in the days before he died that he thought McCarthy had him in his sights. La Follette’s son told McCarthy biographer Larry Tye that he was fairly sure that McCarthy himself had actually called up Young Bob and personally made the threat that he was going to investigate him. His son said, quote, “My dad committed suicide instead of being called before McCarthy’s committee. No question at all.” McCarthy: I don’t much give a tinker’s damn what anyone says about the methods. I don’t much care about the advice to stop. This job must continue, my good friends. It will continue as far as I am concerned, as long as I am in the United States Senate, regardless of whether we hurt Democrats or Republicans or anyone else.  Maddow: During his time in the Senate, Joe McCarthy racked up a long list of people he hurt. Principled members of both parties who couldn’t stomach what McCarthy was doing and who tried to stop him. There was Senator Raymond Baldwin.  Steven Remy: Raymond Baldwin was a moderate Republican senator. He was fair-minded and he was conscientious.  Maddow: Baldwin chaired the Malmedy investigation in Congress, the committee McCarthy hijacked and turned into a forum to spread false anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda. Baldwin was so exhausted by McCarthy’s behavior, so repulsed by dealing with him, that he up and quit the Senate altogether once the Malmedy investigation was done. The Malmedy report came out in October. Raymond Baldwin resigned his seat and left the Senate by December. Senator Raymond E. Baldwin: It has been indeed a rare privilege and opportunity to serve this grand little state of Connecticut.  Maddow: Next was Maryland Senator Millard Tydings. Tydings was the conservative Democratic senator who had investigated and disproven McCarthy’s claims about supposed communists running rampant in the U.S. State Department.  Senator Millard E. Tydings: Have you in your possession any memorandum, any affidavit, any paper?  Maddow: McCarthy took revenge on Tydings by fabricating that fake photo of the senator posed next to a famous communist. Thanks to that dirty trick and to a blizzard of anti-Tydings attacks in the pro-McCarthy conservative press, Millard Tydings lost his seat in the Senate. McCarthy gloated about it, deriding him as Little Millard. McCarthy: Little Millard is with us no longer.  Maddow: Next would be Senator William Benton.  Announcer: Our distinguished guest for this evening is the Honorable William F. Benton, United States senator from Connecticut. Maddow: William Benton introduced an expulsion resolution against McCarthy to kick him out of the Senate altogether. In an hours-long exposition, which was more like an indictment, Benton laid out McCarthy’s record in detail on the Senate floor. Everything from his lies on behalf of the Nazis in the Malmedy investigation to his personal financial corruption to that fake photo dirty trick he used against Senator Tydings. Benton called McCarthy “an amoral man of corruptibility, mendacity, and gross irresponsibility who had followed a pattern of distortion and deceit.” In response, McCarthy declared war. He hired a lawyer, believe it or not, yet another lawyer who defended Nazis at the Nuremberg trials. And with the assistance of that counsel, he filed a multimillion-dollar libel suit against Senator Benton. He baselessly accused him of having distributed lewd material during his time at the U.S. State Department. He called him the hero of every communist, and he taunted him as Little Willie Benton, Connecticut’s mental midget. Radio Host: So if you are a member of the Senate next year -- Senator William B. Benton: You mean when I’m a member of the Senate next year. Host: Yes, when you’re a member of the Senate next year.  Maddow: After the onslaught from McCarthy, William Benton did lose his seat. He was voted out. Joe McCarthy just plowed down any opponent who stood up against him. And even though he went after Republicans as well as Democrats, members of his own Republican Party mostly just stood by and watched it happen. In awe of his power, how nothing seemed to take him down, how every confrontation, every scandal just seemed to increase his standing with his supporters. McDaniel: When they didn’t stand up to him, it only got worse. It only emboldened him. And the number of lives that he ruined continued to mount up. Maddow: That’s Wyoming author Roger McDaniel. By the time Joe McCarthy had taken down Senator Baldwin and Senator Tydings and Senator Benton, there was almost no one left in the Senate who was brave enough to stand up to McCarthy. Almost no one. Senator Monrad C. Wallgren: It gives me pleasure to introduce to you at this time the Honorable Lester Hunt.  Maddow: Lester Hunt, senator from Wyoming. Like Raymond Baldwin and Millard Tydings and William Benton, Lester Hunt was disgusted by the way Joe McCarthy conducted himself in politics. Not only what he was doing to his political enemies, but what McCarthy’s type of politics was doing to the country. Unlike his colleagues, though, Lester Hunt had a unique vantage point to it all. Literally. McDaniel: Buddy Hunt told me that their home overlooked Joe McCarthy’s apartment.  Maddow: Lester Hunt and Joe McCarthy were not just fellow senators. They were neighbors in Washington. They shared a property line, which gave Lester Hunt literally clear sight lines into not just how Senator McCarthy behaved in the halls of the Senate when the lights and the cameras were on him, but how he behaved in private, too.  McDaniel: From their backyard, they could look across the way and see the apartment where McCarthy had a patio and they would watch him womanizing and drinking. It was just disgusting to this, well, this man of Lester Hunt’s integrity. Maddow: Lester Hunt had learned from the senators who came before him that publicly calling out McCarthy’s bad behavior came with real risk.  McDaniel: By now, he had seen McCarthy ruin people’s lives, cost them their jobs, their livelihoods, in some cases, drive people to suicide.  Maddow: But Lester Hunt was undaunted and he found a way to fight back. For years, going all the way back to the Malmedy investigation and to McCarthy’s false attacks on Anna Rosenberg, back before Joe McCarthy was famous, Lester Hunt had watched McCarthy at work. He had watched him traffic in disinformation and defamation and just lies, lies that McCarthy told with impunity and also with immunity. McDaniel: He came to understand that McCarthy was protected from any liability for slander or libel by the Constitution.  Maddow: McCarthy was shielded by the U.S. Constitution, by the Speech and Debate Clause, which protects members of Congress from being sued for anything they say in Congress, even if it’s slander or defamation. It’s a constitutional protection for the freedom and independence of the legislative branch of government. It makes sense, but it is also open to abuse, abuse that Senator Joseph McCarthy made into an art form.  And so, problem solver Lester Hunt proposed a reform, one that was designed to hit Senator Joe McCarthy right between the eyes.  Theodore Granik: Senator Lester C. Hunt of Wyoming has introduced a resolution making members of Congress legally responsible and legally liable for their words and actions. Senator Hunt, is our congressional immunity being used today for the purposes originally intended by our founding fathers?  Lester Hunt: It is not. I would say we’re using it today for an entirely different purpose. Maddow: Lester Hunt introduced legislation. He wrote newspaper op-eds. He did interviews. He went on the radio speaking as a senator. He said it was time to stop, to legally stop, senators from making false allegations and lying about people to hurt them. Lester Hunt’s proposal was to limit congressional immunity, basically to allow regular citizens to sue senators for slander. Lester Hunt: Are you contending that as a United States senator, you have the right on the floor of the Senate to call somebody a communist? Not with the true knowledge or facts that he is a communist. He may be an enemy of yours. You may have some ulterior motives. That man is smeared, then, throughout the United States for the rest of his life. Now, do you mean to say that there should be no means whereby that man can get redress for that injury that has been done to him?  McDaniel: That was a direct attack on McCarthy. Lester Hunt was motivated by what he had seen. Lester Hunt: I say it’s being used as a special privilege for a few, very few, irresponsible members of Congress who say things in their remarks and get them printed in the record that never should have been in there.  Maddow: When Lester Hunt made this proposal, when he argued for it in public, he started getting piles of mail from all over the country, people thanking him for what he was doing. One man wrote to him, “It is certainly about time that irresponsible members like Senator McCarthy be prevented from defaming average citizens.” One woman from New York wrote to him, “Millions of decent real Americans read with great pleasure your denunciation of certain senators, and we know whom you have in mind.” McDaniel: He thought that somebody had to make a drastic proposal, and so he chose to do that. There was no mistake who it was aimed at, and McCarthy knew that, but so did everybody else.  Maddow: One of the people Lester Hunt reached out to at the time he was pushing this proposal was the journalist Drew Pearson. Drew Pearson: This is Drew Pearson. I’ll be back in a minute with an exclusive story -- Maddow: Drew Pearson had his own history with McCarthy, and he was about to break some news about exactly what kind of lies McCarthy had told back when Hunt and McCarthy first met during the Malmedy investigation. McCarthy’s actions during that investigation, his promotion of disproven Nazi propaganda, it had remained a bit of a mystery. Why had this American senator acted as a mouthpiece for the Nazis? How had he ever gotten hooked up with that barrage of false information that was coming out of Germany?  Pearson: McCarthy abused American army officers because they convicted the Nazis who shot American soldiers in cold blood at Malmedy.  Maddow: Drew Pearson now reported that during the Malmedy investigation, Joe McCarthy had been receiving packages in brown manila envelopes in the Senate. McCarthy had in fact left behind one of those big brown envelopes in one of the Malmedy hearing rooms. Inside the envelope was the information he had been citing at the hearings and in his speeches and press releases about Malmedy.  This was the inflammatory disinformation about the supposed torture of the innocent Nazis by Jews in the U.S. Army. Where had he gotten that information? Well, funny story. Drew Pearson reported that on the envelope McCarthy left behind in the hearing room, there was a return address listed in the upper left-hand corner. It said, quote, “Rudolf Aschenauer, Munich, Germany.”  Remy: He’s a cagey character and he’s deeply embedded in the quasi-underground post-war German far-right. Maddow: U.S. Army counterintelligence in Germany had told the Senate investigators that the false attacks on the Malmedy prosecution were coming from unrepentant Nazis in Germany who were trying to get back into power. In their report, the senators had described Nazi defense lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer as the key man in that effort.  Remy: Rudolf Aschenauer was a German lawyer and a former Nazi who had not really renounced his allegiance to national socialism. Maddow: What Drew Pearson was now reporting was that McCarthy’s disinformation on Malmedy, what he was pushing to the American public, the so-called evidence that he said demanded an investigation into the Malmedy trial, it was coming to him from the source.  Remy: The evidence indicates that Rudolf Aschenauer was indirectly an important source of the torture stories for Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Maddow: Through a pro-German advocacy group, Rudolf Aschenauer, the Nazi mastermind of the Malmedy torture hoax, the leader in Nazi groups trying to return to power in Germany, he personally was stovepiping totally false, anti-American, anti-Semitic propaganda to an American senator. That senator ripped open the envelopes in which he received this stuff, and then he fed it as propaganda right to the American public.  Reporter: The senators are probing reports that the Germans were beaten and starved to get confessions from them.  Maddow: Drew Pearson now reported that the evidence of what McCarthy had done, his involvement with that Nazi lawyer, had been, quote, “locked in the secret files of the Senate Armed Services Committee, known only to the committee members themselves.” Committee members like Lester Hunt.  Lester Hunt: You will agree with me that certain derogatory, certain slanderous, certain libel, certain smearing statements are made in the halls of Congress. Not often, but they are made. Senator John C. Stennis: Unfortunately, yes. Maddow: And then Drew Pearson had more. He would soon report that that Nazi lawyer, Aschenauer, had been running a number of agents inside the United States, pro-Nazi operators who were working to advance the Nazi cause in post-war Germany and around the world and here in the U.S. One of those agents was a senior figure in the National Renaissance Party, the uniformed street-fighting Nazi militia headquartered in Yorkville, New York, where McCarthy had accepted an invitation to speak at a rally chaired by one of the group’s members.  He only backed out after reporters described the list of Holocaust deniers and fascists with whom he was set to be sharing the bill. The second operator Aschenauer was running in the United States was registered as the official agent for the Socialist Reich Party, the successor to the Nazi party that had been banned by law from competing in Germany’s elections.  The third agent being run by Aschenauer, Pearson reported, was Francis Yockey, whom Joe McCarthy had recently brought in to write a speech for him to deliver at that rally in Yorkville. Pearson reported that the FBI was, quote, “most interested in Yockey. “ Anthony Mostrom: Drew Pearson named Yockey. He named some of Yockey’s other associates.  Maddow: This guy, whom McCarthy was being the mouthpiece for in the U.S. Senate, he was the lawyer who Yockey had been secretly helping at the Nazi war crimes trials. He was a leader of the post-war successor to the Nazi party in Germany. He was running pro-Nazi agents in the United States, including in a uniformed neo-Nazi militia in New York. Drew Pearson had figured it all out. Journalists like Drew Pearson were doing their best to inform the public about what McCarthy had been up to, about who he was involved with. Pearson: What he doesn’t like from his fellow senators now, is anyone who opposes him or exposes him.  Maddow: Among McCarthy’s fellow senators, Raymond Baldwin, Millard Tydings, William Benton, they had all confronted him, and they’d all been run out of the Senate by McCarthy one way or the other. Senator Robert La Follette Jr., Young Bob, had killed himself rather than face what he thought it would mean to become McCarthy’s next target. Practical, problem-solving, devoted dad Lester Hunt was intent not just on confronting McCarthy the way his colleagues had, but on stopping McCarthy’s ability to operate the way he did.  Lester Hunt: Outstanding men in the country today do not care to come into the government and subject themselves constantly to the smearing and remarks, slanderous remarks -- Maddow: Lester Hunt knew what he was up against. And he also knew how McCarthy was likely to respond.  McDaniel: This opportunity presents itself for him to take revenge on Lester Hunt.  Maddow: That’s next. ******************************** Maddow: It’s a summer night in 1953. Buddy Hunt is 25 years old. He’s walking through Lafayette Park right by the White House. And he makes eye contact with another man who’s passing by. Buddy would later say that the man looked like he was trying to catch Buddy’s attention. The two men held each other’s gaze. They started to talk. A proposition was made. But nothing physical happened between them. The man took out a police badge, and he put Buddy Hunt under arrest.  McDaniel: It was an undercover officer that he had made eye contact with that night in Lafayette Park. And there was some discussion about having a homosexual relationship and Buddy gets arrested.  Maddow: The man Buddy had met that night in the park was part of something called the Morals Division of the D.C. Police. Morals Division officers would go out in D.C. at night. Lafayette Park was a frequent target. And they would try to induce gay men to proposition them, to solicit them for sex. And then they’d arrest them. Buddy Hunt says that he wasn’t gay. He wasn’t sure what he was. This was more of an experiment than anything. But he was taken to the police station. Mugshot. Fingerprints. He was too embarrassed to call his parents, too embarrassed to call his father, the senator. So he spent the night in jail. But the charges against Buddy were pretty quickly dismissed. McDaniel: He was not a federal government employee. He was a young man in the seminary. There was no reason to believe that he would offend again. And so it would have been the normal course of events that the charges would have been dismissed.  Maddow: This is where that whole ordeal probably should have ended. This is where it would have ended had word of Buddy Hunt’s arrest not gotten to Joe McCarthy and to two of McCarthy’s closest allies in the U.S. Senate. McDaniel: Senator Styles Bridges, who was a powerful Republican senator from New Hampshire, and a senator from Idaho named Herman Welker, they get pretty excited about the idea that this might be an opportunity to force Lester Hunt out of the Senate.  Maddow: These Republican U.S. senators, they’re both on the committee that oversees Washington, D.C., and they use that political power to interfere with this as a law enforcement issue. After the charges had already been dropped, they called the head of the Morals Squad up to Capitol Hill and they told him to file new charges. They threatened his job if he didn’t. And it worked. Charges were refiled against Buddy. In the process, they accused Lester Hunt, Buddy’s father, the senator, of having paid a bribe to get the charges dropped in the first place.  McDaniel: Senator Welker and Senator Bridges claimed that someone had told them that the detective in charge of the case had taken a bribe from Hunt to drop the charges.  Maddow: There is zero evidence that this was true. The detective himself told them it wasn’t true. But McCarthy and his allies, they smelled blood.  McDaniel: You have this opportunity that presents itself for him to take revenge on Lester Hunt. Maddow: Lester Hunt had publicly called Joe McCarthy a drunk and a liar. And on those two points, he knew of what he spoke. Hunt called out Joe McCarthy’s lies on the Malmedy investigation. Hunt had defended Anna Rosenberg after McCarthy had come for her, also with lies. Hunt was now waging a public crusade to roll back the senatorial immunity that was part of what allowed McCarthy to build all of his political crusades on abject lies.  Lester Hunt: What is the advantage to a member of Congress when he uses such tactics? He gains notoriety, and primarily that’s what he’s looking for, publicity. Maddow: Well, now, Senator Joe McCarthy could make Lester Hunt pay for all of that, because he could use Hunt’s own son against him. Go for the son. Hit the father in the heart. Before Buddy’s trial date, McCarthy and his allies got a message to Senator Hunt that this could all be over, this could all be taken care of. The charges against Buddy could be dropped again if Lester Hunt would just leave the Senate. If he would not seek re-election. Senator Hunt refused to do it. And so, Buddy went to trial.  McDaniel: Buddy is tried in October. There’s a week-long trial. The Hunts don’t dodge it. They set through the trial. Some of his friends said you could watch him visibly age during that week as he watches his son on trial for what then was this really egregious charge. And Buddy is convicted.  Maddow: After he was convicted, Buddy Hunt chooses not to appeal. He’s given the choice between jail time or a fine. He chooses the fine. He does get expelled from seminary school. But the whole ordeal, mercifully, is over. At least that’s what they thought. Buddy had been arrested in June. His trial and conviction had been in October. But then in December, Senator Hunt’s home in Washington, D.C. was broken into.  McDaniel: While he and his wife are back in Wyoming for Christmas, somebody breaks into their apartment in Washington and ransacks it. Nothing of significance is stolen. It’s clear they’re looking for something. And that was incredibly unnerving. Maddow: It’s not a normal burglary. The house is ransacked. Every drawer turned out. But almost nothing is taken. Buddy remembers his father and his mother being profoundly rattled by this.  McDaniel: And then the pressure is really put on.  Maddow: Then the pressure is really put on. McCarthy and his allies try a new approach. Buddy Hunt’s arrest and conviction for soliciting gay sex. How’s that going to play back home in Wyoming? At this point, Buddy Hunt’s arrest and his trial, his conviction, it has made the press a bit, but not a lot. Only in a conservative Washington paper that was part of the Chicago Tribune family. And there was a small AP story, a wire service story. But it didn’t get much pickup. McCarthy and his allies, Senator Styles Bridges and Senator Herman Welker, they threaten to change that.  McDaniel: The threat is that if he stays in the race, Bridges and Welker will print off 25,000, they look like wanted posters, with Buddy’s picture on it and information about the charges and distribute those to every mailbox in Wyoming. It was truly a significant way to try to blackmail Senator Hunt into leaving the Senate. Maddow: Lester Hunt’s son, Buddy, is not only going to be used as a weapon against his father, he’s going to have his life ruined. His face, this incident in his private life, plastered all across the state, delivered to the mailboxes of 25,000 Wyoming homes. For Lester Hunt, that was enough. It was finally enough.  McDaniel: Almost a year to the day from Buddy’s arrest, Senator Hunt announces that he’s decided not to run for re-election and he says it’s because of health problems. That was clearly not the reason, but that’s the reason he gave publicly.  Maddow: After a year of torment, despite having previously announced that he would seek re-election, Senator Lester Hunt changes his mind. He gives in to the threats and the blackmail and the attacks on his son. McDaniel: I think he did agonize over the decision. The polls showed that he would win, but I think he came to realize that winning would have been ugly. It would have dragged his son through this all over again in a very public way. And so I think he was looking at all of that and thought, this will all end if I don’t run for re-election. But he was wrong about that.  Maddow: It still wouldn’t be the end. Sure, getting Lester Hunt to withdraw from running for re-election, that was what they wanted. But then McCarthy decided he wanted more. If they could get Hunt out now, immediately, if they could get him to quit before his term was even up, then they could flip control of the U.S. Senate, which Democrats held by only one vote.  If Hunt would resign and leave, Wyoming’s Republican governor would then get to appoint a Republican to fill his seat. That would give Republicans Senate control. It would give McCarthy even more power than he already had.  McDaniel: For them, it was not enough for him to simply not run for re-election. He had to leave the Senate. And so they weren’t done yet with their threats.  Maddow: The finale of this blackmail campaign, the endgame, it wasn’t carried out by Senators Welker or Bridges, but by Joe McCarthy himself, through an ominous statement to the press.  McDaniel: Joe McCarthy announces that he intends to open hearings to investigate a Democratic member of the Senate. Maddow: “A Democratic member of the Senate,” McCarthy said, who was linked to, quote, “very serious charges,” charges he personally had been checking into and would soon reveal.  McDaniel: If you’re Lester Hunt, you know who they’re talking about.  Maddow: Joe McCarthy made this threat. He announced it to the press on a Friday. The Friday before Father’s Day, 1954. The next day, that Saturday, Lester Hunt woke up early. He drove to the Senate, and he took his own life.  McDaniel: I suspect that that night, Friday night into Saturday, was spent thinking about what it meant to be the target of one of Joe McCarthy’s hearings. Everybody had seen what happens. How ugly they were, how the truth was twisted, how reputations were ruined, lives destroyed. He knew that even though he wasn’t running for re-election now, they intended to put him through this through a different means. And that was a public hearing headed by McCarthy. And so the next morning, he took his life.  Maddow: Lester Hunt, 61 years old, 22 years of service to his state and to the country, gone. Senator Hunt left a handful of notes behind before he fired his gun. He laid them on the desk in his office. There was a note for his wife. Another was written to his son, Buddy.  Ewig: After his death, I’ve seen different reports that he left some letters.  Buddy Hunt: Yes, he did leave some. He left one to my mother, one to me. But the one to me was “this has nothing to do with you” sort of thing. You know? Yeah, “You mustn’t think it does” and you know, so on and so forth.  Maddow: This has nothing to do with you. And that is what Buddy Hunt believed about his father’s suicide, up until the day 25 years later when that young grad student, Rick Ewig, walked into his living room in Chicago with the evidence of how Senator Lester Hunt’s love and care for his son had been turned into a weapon against him.  Buddy Hunt: The only blackmail thing I see here is in regard to me. Am I missing something?  Ewig: No, that’s basically it.  Buddy Hunt: I don’t know anything about that. But maybe I wasn’t supposed to. Maybe that was the whole issue.  Ewig: That could be.  Maddow: After the grad student began to lay out the evidence in front of him, the reporting from Drew Pearson and Marquis Childs and others, the links to McCarthy and his allies, Buddy does start to see it. Ewig: I have one thing in here I thought you might be interested in. This was found in Senator Bridges’ files. A little note on your arrest. Looking at that, perhaps he did use that against your father.  Buddy Hunt: Well, he might have.  Ewig: Yeah, well, it all seems to point to that way. Buddy Hunt: Yeah, maybe so. Bridges had that in his files, huh?  Ewig: Yeah, that was in his files, that’s where I got that. Buddy Hunt: Interesting. I’m learning more from you than you’re learning from me, Richard. Maddow: Buddy Hunt died just a few years ago, in 2020. Years before he passed, Wyoming author Roger McDaniel spent time with him. Roger had found records confirming that Senator Hunt had told at least two friends before he died about the blackmail plot, about what McCarthy and his Republican allies in the Senate were threatening him with, and how desperate he felt about it. It was Buddy himself who suggested that Roger McDaniel should write a book about his dad, about what was done to him.  McDaniel: In the end, Buddy called me after he read the manuscript and he said, thank you, this clears up a lot for me and I’m thankful that you wrote the book so that people understand what really happened. Maddow: Before he died, Senator Lester Hunt had been asked about the widespread expectation that Senator Joe McCarthy would make a run for the White House. Hunt responded that McCarthy didn’t really need to. He said, “As a senator, he’s now acting Secretary of State, acting president, and the chief high executioner of department heads. In the White House, he would merely be a president.” The list of political lives, in some cases the actual lives, that ended because of Joe McCarthy’s reign in U.S. politics was growing. Young Bob La Follette, Raymond Baldwin, Millard Tydings, William Benton, Lester Hunt. For some in the Senate, losing Lester Hunt specifically, his suicide, was the last straw. They knew they had to do something to try to push back.  Lawyer: Senator McCarthy will vigorously defend himself against these three charges. Maddow: But how do you push back? What do you do when every attempt to constrain or confront a figure like that just makes his supporters more devoted to him, some of whom would soon turn up to the U.S. Capitol, intent on stopping the proceedings there against him. To do that, they didn’t have to bring along men with drawn weapons, but they did.  David Austin Walsh: An armored car pulls up to the Capitol building.

Many, many other members of Congress don’t need this immunity or this privilege. You don’t need it. There are a few who do need it, and to my way of thinking, those few shouldn’t have it.  Stennis: Now you say that I do not need it, and I’m flattered by your compliment. I can certainly say, knowing you as I do, that I don’t think you’ll ever need it, as the law is now. But if you repeal that privilege, you will wish you had it. You’ll find the reason there.  Lester Hunt: I hope the time will never come when I need and hope I had that privilege. Stennis: Take that privilege away, and you will need it as certainly as my father did. Lester Hunt: May I make one more point, please, before you take questions?  Granik: All right, I want to give him a little privilege.  Stennis: You’ve served the people long and well, and you’ve been subjected to slander and libel yourself, and you love your country more, though, than you did despise the abuse that you had to take. That’s why you’re here."

How Democrats and Republicans are reacting to Biden dropping out of the 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 5:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-drops-out-reaction-democrats-election-2024-rcna162753,"After weeks of public and private hand-wringing among Democrats, President Joe Biden has announced that he will end his re-election bid and withdraw from the race. On Sunday afternoon, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the top of the ticket. Biden’s announcement was met with a rash of statements from Democrats praising his leadership. It also set off a palpable wave of relief among many in the party, including those who feared that his staying on the ticket could jeopardize the party’s chances in down-ballot races. “Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he’s a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., posted to X. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Biden “a patriotic American who has always put our country first.” “His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” she said in a statement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the president “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.” Former President Barack Obama issued a statement acknowledging the difficulty of the decision that Biden faced. “For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,” Obama wrote. “But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country —  and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.” Democratic governors also lauded Biden. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called him “a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom thanked Biden, calling him an “extraordinary, history-making president.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Biden’s decision “is in the best interest of our country, and our party.” Several Democrats who had publicly called on Biden to step aside also issued statements praising the president’s decision. “Joe’s announcement today reflects what we’ve known all along: he is an American patriot who is willing to put America’s interests over his own,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, thanked Biden for his “years of committed service.” Even progressives, who had stood by the president in the wake of the debate, expressed gratitude. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., thanked Biden, saying, ""This was the president’s decision to make"" and endorsed Harris. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, expressed much the same sentiments. Later Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pledged her ""full support"" to Harris and called on the country to ""swiftly unite"" to defeat Trump in November. Ocasio-Cortez was one of several progressive lawmakers to adamantly stand by Biden as pressure for him to drop out increased among Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez has warned of chaos within the party should he withdraw from the race In a joint statement, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton celebrated Biden’s accomplishments, “with his North Star always being what’s best for the country.” They also endorsed Harris and said they “will do everything we can to support her.” Former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, continued to criticize Biden on a phone call with NBC News, saying, “He should never have been there in the first place. He should have stayed in his basement.” Trump — who had claimed he wanted to unite the country after his assassination attempt — also slammed Biden on Truth Social, writing in a post that he “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., struck a conspiratorial tone, writing in a post on X that the “deep state” and the “elites in power” had started a “coup” against Biden that led to him stepping down from the Democratic ticket. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., took a similar tack, claiming without evidence that the Democratic Party had “forced” Biden off the ballot, adding that Biden should resign from office “immediately.” Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, also a Republican, accused Democrats of “rigging their own elections.” Biden, whose political career has been marked by his ability to defy the odds, had pushed back hard against the calls for him to step aside after his June 27 debate with Trump. At times, he reportedly even lashed out at fellow Democrats. Those calls quieted down briefly after last Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, but soon afterward they picked back up with greater urgency. Although Biden and his aides worked hard to quash concerns about his age and mental fitness, the pressure on him to resign — or the political calculus for his party — ultimately overcame his insistence. First lady Jill Biden responded to Biden’s announcement on X with a hearts emoji. Hunter Biden issued a statement lauding his father as a selfless leader, writing: “He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years.” He added: “I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same.” This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
The Democrats' discord is a sign of a healthy party,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 5:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-trump-biden-drop-out-dnc-rcna161585,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 8:20 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. Republicans’ spirits are high after the party’s national convention. The GOP is fervently unified behind former President Donald Trump as its presidential nominee. Trump is leading President Joe Biden in most national and battleground polls. Despite being convicted of 34 felony counts, Trump’s base remains loyal as ever. And an adoring crowd seemed to hang on his every word during his acceptance speech Thursday night, as Trump used his survival of an assassination attempt to frame his nomination as ordained by God. That picture of harmony is likely the envy of many Democrats as they prepare for their own convention in August. As Trump is feted, Biden is struggling to keep his candidacy afloat. The president faces a tremendous pressure campaign from his own party to drop his White House bid. Poll after poll spells potential disaster for him and his party. Fundraising totals have plunged since last month’s presidential debate. Should Biden depart the race, Democrats would almost immediately have to decide between anointing Vice President Kamala Harris and a divisive open convention. At the same time, dozens of pro-Palestinian groups are planning to demonstrate against Biden’s Israel policy around the convention, hoping to echo the protests on college campuses that captured headlines earlier this year. In short, the contrast between the two parties in both unity and confidence at this moment could not be clearer. But in the longer view, the Democratic chaos is a sign of the party’s health, while the GOP’s unity is a symptom of its sickness as a political entity.   Political parties win and govern effectively by producing candidates who can secure as big of a majority as possible among their constituencies. Yet entering the summer, both parties had opted for candidates who were, by any typical standard, remarkably weak. Trump currently may be ahead in most polls, but he remains a uniquely unpopular presidential candidate, plagued by low favorability ratings. He has never won the popular vote. He was the first and only president to never breach over 50% in approval ratings. Independents remain wary of his criminal convictions and his personal character. And during his leadership of the GOP, the party has performed poorly in midterm elections.  So while the polls indicate that Trump has a very serious chance of winning in November, his vulnerabilities ensure that he does not have a decisive lead. That the GOP is turning over and over again to such a divisive, risky candidate is a sign of party dysfunction. There are multiple sources of that dysfunction: conservative media, which thrives on deception and discord; the party’s diehard base, which buys every conspiracy theory thrown its way and worships Trump as a savior; and GOP lawmakers, almost all of whom tremble with fear at the mere thought of criticizing Trump. But the upshot is that the Republicans have lost most if not all of their identity beyond Trump and his lackeys. Beyond him, they are lost, and with him they’re not much better off. The intra-party debate over Biden reflects a party with a sharply different, healthier goal. The intense debate over Biden’s candidacy reflects the beliefs of many Democratic voters, lawmakers, party leaders, donors, and commentators that, despite Biden’s many accomplishments, he’s no longer in a position to campaign effectively. This conclusion was reached based on a fact-based appraisal of his sustained difficulty at carrying out a politician’s most important job: communicating clearly with the public. And it was made all the more urgent because evidence indicates that this problem is key to explaining his trailing in the polls to an exceptionally weak candidate. For the purposes of the party’s long-term effectiveness as an institution, the party’s splits over Biden reflect a healthy distance from him — a view of the president not as the party itself or an infallible hero, but rather a vessel for its values, policies and ideas. And while the timing of this internal division is far from ideal, it also reflects a nimbleness and sensitivity to the electorate that seems inconceivable in the sclerotic GOP. Right now the Democratic Party is riven by division — some of it rather rancorous, much of it long overdue — but that division will be ephemeral. The scramble is to figure out who the best candidate can be ahead of the party’s convention. After the convention, in all likelihood the overwhelming majority of Democrats will fall in line behind whoever the candidate is and lock arms against Trump and the Republicans. It is possible that this extended period of intra-party division could hurt the Democrats ahead of Election Day. If Biden stays in, maybe he’ll be irreversibly hurt by weeks of infighting and demoralization. If Biden is replaced, it’s possible the new candidate will also be weak against Trump. But it’s also possible that this period of intra-party strife produces the impetus for the party to reset and achieve its goals in a manner it otherwise couldn’t have. What's clear is the party is responding earnestly to the giant electoral warning signs it sees — the kinds of signs that Republicans have socialized themselves to ignore. In the long term, any healthy movement or party must ultimately always balance commitments to unity with introspection and honest reckonings over whether it’s uniting behind the right things. That’s what the Democrats are doing, and it’ll serve them well for the future. "
Joe Biden’s incredibly selfless career has led to this historic moment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 3:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-endorse-kamala-harris-selfless-service-rcna162747,"On Sunday, President Joe Biden made the historic decision to step aside and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place in November. Yet more proof that Aaron Sorkin himself would not have been able to script Biden’s career.   Just weeks before he was set to be sworn in as the youngest member elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden's wife and 1-year-old daughter were killed in a car accident while shopping for a Christmas tree.  The grieving and suddenly single dad of two boys, Biden was encouraged by his new Senate colleagues to stay in Congress, and for years he traveled back and forth on the Amtrak train to make sure he was there for his sons as much as possible. It’s a story packed with enough tragedy and fortitude to last a lifetime. But that is far from the full story of Joe Biden.   He survived a brain aneurysm, an embarrassing exit from his 1988 run for the presidency, the loss of his son Beau and the conviction of his other son, Hunter.   And yet, despite it all, Biden has always chosen to reject bitterness. He refused to give in to his pain and spiral into self-pity or lash outward with hatred. He never went into hiding. He has instead channeled his loss and personal tragedy into a lifetime of public service and an incredibly deep well of empathy for others. Over and over and over again.  It’s easy to say that your job is not your life. But it really isn’t for this president. Biden picks up the phone every time his granddaughters call. He talks about his wife (Dr. Jill Biden) the way a much younger guy might talk about a girl he has a huge crush on. And his love for his son Hunter and concern for Hunter's mental well-being have resulted in decisions that sometimes made no political sense.  At the same time, Biden’s belief that through politics you can make a real difference has been the driving force of his adult life. His career was never about becoming rich (he was one of the least wealthy members of the Senate), nor was it about fame or clout (I don’t think he would know how to tweet if his life depended on it). Obviously, you don’t run for office — and certainly not the presidency — without a healthy sense of self. And Biden has that. I remember sitting with him in the Oval Office early in the first few weeks of his presidency and asking how he was dealing with the weight of the office. He told me he’d been in this office before and knew exactly what he needed to do. But, he added, he was having trouble finding his socks.  It was a funny moment. And a very revealing one. Because Biden did know that office. He’s been visiting it for decades, as he negotiated legislation as a senator and later navigated his responsibilities as vice president — both at home and around the world. No one came into that job with more experience. And perhaps no one in modern history felt more out of place among the ornate trappings of the White House residence than the son of a used-car salesman from Scranton.   Biden doesn’t care about celebrities or fancy events. He would probably eat spaghetti and meatballs and chocolate chip ice cream every day if given the choice. He cares about workers being paid fair wages, about everyone getting a shot at a better education or training. About protecting the fundamentals of our institutions and the people who serve in them.   He also has a chip on his shoulder — and as a result, a particular soft spot for every American who has ever felt underestimated and left behind. His career has been defined by stubbornness and tragedy and by proving many, many doubters wrong. He pledged to get a bipartisan infrastructure deal and did, with the help of 19 Republican senators. He finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary in 2020 and went on to win not only the nomination, but also the presidency. And all of that is why his decision to step back from the Democratic nomination right now is so powerful. Public service has been his life for over 50 years. He doesn’t know anything different.  There is no other campaign.   The next few months will be his last in public office.   Make no mistake: Biden isn’t doing this because he doesn’t think he can do the job. He’s stepping down because he has been convinced that he is not the right person to defeat Donald Trump. Time and time again, Joe Biden proved his incredible strength by getting back up after being knocked down. This time, he shows it by stepping aside."
Trump responds to Biden announcement in a decidedly Trumpian way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-responds-biden-2024-election-announcement-decidedly-trumpian-way-rcna162959,"After President Joe Biden announced his decision not to seek a second term, Donald Trump responded with uncharacteristic class, thanking the Democratic incumbent for his decades of service to the United States and the American people. No, I’m just kidding. The Republican actually responded to Biden’s news with an ugly missive published by way of his social media platform, which read in part: Nearly an hour later, the former president followed up with a similar online message, which read in part: The Republican then concluded in a third online item, “Crooked Joe just got knocked out, so now I’ll have to do it a FOURTH TIME!!!” I’m not altogether sure what that meant, unless Trump was making a rare reference to his ill-fated consideration of the Reform Party’s presidential nomination in 2000. For good measure, the former president went on to suggest, for reasons unknown, that Biden's recent Covid infection was an elaborate ruse for reasons that only make sense to Trump. Regardless, the Republican nominee doesn’t actually gain anything from such viciousness. Biden is exiting the stage anyway. Trump likely would’ve benefited far more from a gracious statement than a spiteful one. But we’re left with the same lesson we saw in his Republican National Convention speech: Trump, in a rather literal sense, simply can’t help himself. Taking the high road after Biden’s announcement would’ve helped his campaign, but the former president is who he appears to be. His instinct is to be needlessly malicious at all times, and he appears incapable of anything else. As last week got underway, Axios reported that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added, “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America.” Four days later, Politico published a related report, noting that in the aftermath of the shooting in Pennsylvania, “Republicans who have observed and spoken with former President Donald Trump say they have detected a new softness to the man whose brand has been anything but.” The article added, “GOP allies, in roughly a dozen interviews, used words like ‘emotional’ and ‘serene’ — even ‘spiritual’ — to describe Trump in the days since the attempt on his life.” To the extent that such descriptions ever had merit, that time has clearly come and gone. This post was updated to reflect Trump's weird Covid-related claims."
Kamala Harris says she intends to ‘win this nomination’ after Biden drops out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:14 PM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:55 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-reaction-biden-dropping-out-rcna162942,"Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that she intends to “earn and win” the Democratic presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced he’s dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsing her in his place. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,” she said. “His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office.  The statement continued:  Harris concluded by noting there are 107 days until Election Day. “Together, we will fight,” she said. “And together, we will win.” Harris, a former California senator, received an outpouring of support from many top Democrats on Sunday. Before serving in the Senate from 2017 to 2021, Harris was California’s attorney general for six years. She sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out before the primary elections. Harris’ vice presidency is historic in several ways: She is the first woman to hold the role, as well as the first Black person and Indian American to do so. This is a developing story.

"Why President Joe Biden is retiring, but not resigning",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/president-joe-biden-retiring-not-resigning-2024-election-rcna162953,"When President Joe Biden announced that he was ending his re-election bid, he specifically referenced his eagerness to do the job he was elected to do for the next six months. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” the Democratic incumbent said in a written statement. The news, of course, has touched off a multifaceted process, but it will also generate a related question from his Republican critics: “Shouldn’t Biden step down now, rather than January?” Sen. JD Vance, his party’s vice presidential nominee, made this pitch via social media just yesterday, ahead of Biden’s announcement: This coincided with an Axios report, which added that Republicans are “laying the groundwork to pressure him to resign from office.” I don’t doubt that voters will hear this argument quite a bit in the very near future, and it might even have some superficial appeal to casual observers. If Biden isn’t up to seeking the presidency, is it unreasonable to think he isn’t up to doing the job in the coming months? The closer one looks, however, the more problematic this argument becomes. First, few seriously believe that the president is incapable of performing his duties between now and January. Second, the “if you can’t run, you can’t serve” argument is plainly wrong. Indeed, as Vance probably knows, plenty of members of Congress, including several of his Senate colleagues from both parties, have announced that they’re stepping down at the end of their current term. This is routine, and it doesn’t mean they have to resign from Capitol Hill. Third, it stands to reason that Biden will explain in the coming days that his decision is about the future, not the present: It’s one thing to say that the Democratic incumbent is up to the job in 2024; it’s something else to say that he’ll still be equally fit in 2028. If I were helping Biden write a speech on this, I’d probably encourage him to say something like, “Lately, I’ve had two jobs: running the executive branch and running for a second term. Going forward, I’ve decided to focus all of my energies on the job Americans hired me to do, and leave the second job to others.” Finally, it’s probably worth questioning the motivations of Republicans who seem a little too eager to show Biden the door. Not only does the party seem to like the idea of running against an incumbent, let’s not forget that under the 25th Amendment, if the president were to step down before his term ends, Harris would assume the office and have an opportunity to select a new vice president — who in turn would have to be confirmed by the House and Senate. The confirmation process in the Democratic-led Senate probably wouldn’t be too difficult, but would the House’s far-right Republican majority handle such a task responsibly? Maybe Republicans will push for Biden to resign the presidency because they genuinely believe he can't fulfil his duties, or perhaps the party is looking for an ugly election-season spectacle."
Trump issues first statement after Biden says he's dropping out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:59 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-reaction-biden-dropping-out-rcna162925,"Donald Trump on Sunday fired off a snide reaction to President Joe Biden’s historic decision to withdraw from the 2024 race, calling Biden the “worst president” in United States history. Trump had called for national unity in the wake of an assassination attempt against him last weekend. But he quickly ditched that message by the time he accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention. His acceptance speech, which ran more than 90 minutes, was filled with insults and vitriol. His Truth Social post about Biden’s withdrawal was no different. “Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” Trump wrote on his social media platform, adding: “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump told NBC News in a brief phone interview on Sunday that if he’s elected in November, he will “fix what he [Biden] has done.” “Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of the United States by far,” the former president told NBC News. “He should never have been there in the first place,” Trump continued, “He should have stayed in his basement.”"
"Biden drops out of 2024 race after weeks of pressure, endorses Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:00 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-drops-out-2024-election-rcna162537,"President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election after weeks of pressure from top Democrats to drop out of the race amid concerns over his cognitive state and his ability to beat Donald Trump in November. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter to Americans. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” Biden said he would address the country “later this week in more detail.” In a subsequent tweet, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. In a statement Sunday, Harris thanked Biden and said she intends to “earn and win” the nomination. Calls for Biden to step aside followed his June 27 debate with Trump, in which the 81-year-old president at times seemed confused, tired and unable to articulate his thoughts. Though there had been some reporting in the weeks leading up to the debate that Biden's mental acuity was slipping, the prime-time debate, watched by more than 50 million people, brought the issue center stage. Biden's performance ignited concerns among Democrats and prompted some prominent party members to urge him to drop out. For weeks, the president refused to exit the race and attempted to control the damage through high-stakes interviews, a news conference at the NATO summit and meetings with governors and congressional lawmakers. But his efforts to reassure voters did little to stem concern at the highest levels of the party. More than two dozen top Democrats — many of them members of the House — publicly called on Biden to withdraw. Others reportedly expressed concern privately about polling that suggested Trump’s support over Biden was growing. “I have great respect for President Biden,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post earlier this month. “He saved our country from a tyrant. He is a man of uncommon decency. He cares deeply about our democracy. He has been one of the best presidents of our time.” “But I, like folks across the country, am worried about November’s election,” he continued. “The stakes could not be higher. We cannot unsee President Biden’s disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night. ... For the good of the country, I’m calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.” By mid-July, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had privately warned Biden that he was unlikely to beat Trump in November, according to multiple reports. As Steve Benen noted Sunday, Harris’ nomination isn’t locked in, despite significant support among congressional lawmakers. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
This is exactly what Trump feared,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-drops-out-trump-joe-scarborough-rcna162935,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC’s special coverage on July 21. Through the weekend, there were an awful lot of questions that were going back and forth from people in the president’s tightest circle, and one of the questions that kept being asked was whether Joe Biden was going to endorse Kamala Harris or not. And the question didn’t revolve around whether he wanted to or not, but whether people in her camp thought it would be better for her to fight for it, win it on her own, and not be seen as somebody who was tapped by President Biden and so, in her own way, have a fresh start going into the campaign. So when I heard that he did come out and endorse Kamala Harris, I think a lot of Democrats that were going back and forth this weekend on this issue felt an awful lot of relief, because Democrats obviously believe Biden did a great job — he has a great record, along with Kamala Harris. And as he said, it’s absolutely necessary for the Democratic Party, if they want to defeat Donald Trump, to unite as one. And so his statement seems to hit all the right notes and comes at a good time. There was a fear that this might drag on another week or two — and in that case, you would have massive Democratic defections every day. So the timing seems to be about as good as it could have been to end what has just been one of the craziest two or three weeks in American politics in quite some time. The morning after the debate, I got on and said that the president needed to ask whether he was capable of doing this and take a little bit of time to figure it out. I think he took a little more time than I was expecting. But after saying that, I heard from people that were extraordinarily close to him, people who work for him, actually calling me up and saying, “President Biden needs space. If Democrats and people in the media say the sort of things that you said today and he’s not given that space, he’s going to be far more likely to get into a corner and stay in the race.” So I think so much of what Biden’s inner circle did over the last couple of weeks was to provide him that space. And it’s what Nancy Pelosi was trying to do — it’s why you didn’t see massive defections of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 people a day, even though it was starting to get bad. I think the whole idea was give him the space to make this decision. He made the decision. And I will say, the most telling thing about how positive this may be for the Democratic Party is the Republican response. Earlier this morning, Newt Gingrich was was going on Twitter talking about how this is a violation of democracy, how it’s shocking and stunning that they’re delegitimizing the votes of 14.5 million Democrats. You also have House Speaker Mike Johnson going around saying that he’s going to do everything he can to try to nullify this, despite the fact Democrats haven’t even had their convention yet. So he’s standing on no ground at all. I’ve also had a good bit of reporting from deep inside the Trump camp that this is the one thing that Donald Trump feared. He has always considered himself to be the ultimate disrupter. And for the first time — not just in his political life, but the first time in his media life, in his professional life — the disruption is on the other side. People are not having to respond to the shocking turn of events from him for once. Trump and his campaign team are going to have to respond to this shocking turn of events — and they’re not happy about it at all. And I think that’s why you’re seeing a lot of Trump’s acolytes in politics and the media coming out and bitterly complaining about this."
"As Biden passes the torch, both parties ask, ‘What happens now?’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-passes-torch-both-parties-ask-happens-now-rcna162938,"In his first television interview after last month’s presidential debate, President Joe Biden told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, “If I stop now, I’d go down in history as a pretty successful president.” By any fair measure, the incumbent had a point. Biden has an impressive record of accomplishments, and when scholars ranked all American presidents earlier this year, Biden fared quite well — which was more than his immediate predecessor could say. But facing daunting odds and a party filled with members who’d lost confidence in his ability to win in the fall, the Democrat’s “if I stop now” comments suddenly have renewed relevance. As my MSNBC colleague Hayley Miller summarized: “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter to Americans. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” He soon after endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. The stunning and historic announcement left the nation with a rather obvious question: “What happens now?” Unfortunately for everyone involved in the process, there is no precedent for such circumstances. Election Day 2024 is just 15 weeks away; the Democratic National Convention is poised to kick off four weeks from tomorrow; and there is no existing road map for officials to follow. For Democrats, the list of questions is long, and the list of answers is not. How will the party choose a nominee? Biden has endorsed Harris, and that will carry significant weight. Similarly, a variety of prominent congressional Democrats have also thrown their support behind the vice president. But others in the party have balked at the idea of a “coronation,” and there’s been talk in recent weeks about a possible “mini-primary” system — what some have referred to as a “blitz” primary — and that conversation is likely to intensify in the coming hours and days. What’s to come of the virtual nominating process? Officials at the Democratic National Committee have said they intend to move forward with plans for a virtual process in early August, not to curtail the debate over Biden, but in order to address potential legal hurdles regarding the ballot in some key states. The president’s announcement will complicate those plans. The Democratic running mate? No matter who the nominee is, they will obviously need a running mate, and the vetting process should’ve started weeks, if not months, ago. That said, a Washington Post report noted overnight that major Democratic donors “are funding a preliminary vetting process for potential vice-presidential nominees,” adding: “In recent days, people involved in the effort have contacted the teams of top Democratic figures, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive effort. The donors are also interested in vetting North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.” What about the money Biden has raised? Election law experts can speak to this with more authority than I can, but a recent NBC News report, published before Biden’s announcement, said: “If President Joe Biden decides to step aside for the 2024 race, Vice President Kamala Harris would be in line to get first dibs on the tens of millions of dollars in his campaign war chest.” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said during a call three weeks ago that in the event of the president dropping out, Harris would then control most of the money in their campaign account. NBC News’ report added, “That appears to be correct, according to some campaign finance experts — but likely only if she then became the Democrats’ presidential nominee.” What about Republicans? It is not a secret that Donald Trump and his party saw Biden as a highly vulnerable, easy-to-defeat incumbent. In fact, The New York Times reported overnight that the former president’s senior team “would prefer that Mr. Biden remains in the race,” adding: “After the debate, the Trump team decided to hold back advertising that could further damage Mr. Biden.” Now that the incumbent president is ending his candidacy, GOP officials and their allies will have to overhaul pretty much everything — their strategy, their messaging, their expectations, their advertising, etc. — and will simultaneously be launching legal challenges in the hopes of making the Democrats’ process as messy and difficult as possible. As recently as Sunday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson explicitly endorsed those legal tactics. Buckle up."
Why Kamala Harris is a stronger candidate than you think,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 5, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:10 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-biden-trump-election-rcna160078,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 4:10 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. The first time Kamala Harris ran for president, the result could generously be described as mediocre. In a post-mortem for her 2020 presidential campaign, which ended before any votes had been cast, NBC News reported that her run “began with an explosion of enthusiasm but fizzled quickly.” Aside from a strong first debate performance — highlighted, ironically, by a clash with Joe Biden — Harris never broke out of the middle of the primary pack. Memories of that failed bid hover over Harris as Democrats consider the possibility that Biden will abandon his attempt at re-election, leaving her the logical nominee of their party. Is she a strong enough campaigner to win a general election? Could she unite the party and win over independent voters? Would she be able to overcome the inevitable torrent of racism and misogyny headed her way? Not long ago, many Democrats would have answered no to those questions. But this is, to put it mildly, a unique circumstance. In fact, this may be the perfect circumstance, if not the only one, for Harris to win a presidential election.  Let’s dispense with one question right away: If Biden does decide to step aside, Harris will be the party’s nominee. That’s due not to any ballot requirement (the party hasn’t yet named Biden as its nominee), but to political reality. Harris is the vice president and heir apparent. Skipping over her would be taken as an insult to Black women, one of the party’s most important constituencies. Because she and Biden share a campaign committee, she would have unfettered access to his campaign funds. Other potential candidates, including Govs. Gavin Newsom (California), Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan) and Josh Shapiro (Pennsylvania), are smart enough to know that an effort to elbow her out of the way would most likely fail and damage their future ambitions.  So why might Harris be a stronger candidate than people give her credit for? First, the fact that she ran and lost before tells us very little; plenty of politicians have run, lost and done better when they ran again. Biden himself ran two abysmal presidential campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, before his 2020 victory. George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon all became president after losing. Their successful races were as much about being in the right place at the right time as learning from their mistakes. The scenario in which Harris replaces Biden involves a brief and intense general election campaign of about three months — and that could work to her advantage. The truncated campaign would upend the prevailing theme of news coverage that emphasizes disillusionment and demobilization by presenting the election as a choice between two unpalatable alternatives. Encouraged by the tone of that coverage, many undecided voters have understood their choice as between a geezer or a lunatic convicted of a felony. Harris, on the other hand, is neither old (she’s 59) nor crazy. Republicans would attempt to portray her as a far-left radical, just as they do with every Democrat. But independent voters might reasonably conclude that she would neither nod off in critical meetings nor erect a sign outside the Oval Office reading “Bribes Accepted Here.” And if she lost the election, she wouldn’t try to overthrow the government. Harris might carry the baggage of things voters don’t like about the Biden administration, but some of his problems wouldn’t transfer to her. Just by being energetic, she would be a step up from Biden as a campaigner. Would the Muslim Americans livid at Biden for his embrace of the Israeli government feel equally angry at Harris and sit out the election? Perhaps, but they might well view her as an opportunity for a fresh start. The same could be true of the younger voters who have been lukewarm on the president. And though it’s true that she occasionally gets mired in banality, today that seems like the most trivial of problems. Her best moments, on the other hand, have come when she’s acting as the prosecutor she once was. And prosecuting the case against Donald Trump is the singular task of the Democratic nominee. Trump has never been popular; he lost the popular vote twice, produced two disastrous midterm elections for his party and is the only president in the history of polling to never crack 50% approval even for a day. Voters need to be constantly reminded of Trump’s misdeeds, and Harris is more capable of making that case than Biden is. She would also bring out the worst in Trump; we can all imagine the repulsive things he would say about her, which would thrill his hateful cultists but reinforce for the rest of the electorate why they don’t like him.  Furthermore, in the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, Harris has become the administration’s chief advocate on reproductive freedom, which is the single most important policy issue in this campaign and could be the key to a Democratic victory. She is far more passionate speaking about it than Biden, whose evident discomfort with abortion often leaves him tongue-tied on the issue.  Would Harris go through periods of savage coverage from a news media that sometimes acts as though its job is to cast Democratic candidates in the worst possible light? Yes. But that will happen to Biden, too.  But Republicans hate her, you might say. That’s true. But they hate Joe Biden, too — and if they didn’t immediately hate anyone who replaced him, they would quickly learn to. There might be Republican-leaning voters who wouldn’t vote in a Trump-Biden matchup but would turn out against Harris, but no one knows if that’s the case or how many of them there are. It’s just as likely, if not more so, that the large number of indifferent or demoralized Democratic-leaning voters who would have sat out a race in which their best option was voting for a feeble Joe Biden would turn out for Harris.  None of this is to say that Harris is a perfect choice or that the race wouldn’t be nail-bitingly close if she were the nominee. But stepping in to save a party in crisis and running against the most dangerous candidate America has ever faced may be her straightest path to becoming president. Sometimes, politics is all about timing — and this most unusual time could be her best chance."

Stop panicking. Replacing Biden on ballots isn't a problem.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-replacement-ballot-access-democrats-rcna162815,"President Joe Biden, after weeks of pressure, has withdrawn from his re-election campaign. In recent days, questions have also been raised about the legal practicalities of Democrats replacing Biden with another candidate, most likely Vice President Kamala Harris. Some have expressed fears that Republicans might attempt to block a Biden replacement from appearing on ballots in November. This is one thing Democrats don’t have to worry about. America’s ballot access laws, the procedures for how candidates are placed on the ballot in each state, are notoriously difficult compared to other democracies’ laws. Experts such as Richard Winger, the longtime publisher of Ballot Access News and the nation’s foremost authority on the topic, have long decried the arbitrarily difficult petition thresholds and discriminatory treatment of third-party and independent candidates. Major-party candidates also run afoul of the rules on occasion. Just this year, former President Donald Trump’s ballot access was imperiled under the 14th Amendment’s bar on insurrectionists before the Supreme Court ruled in his favor. But one thing is clear: There is no credible basis for the claims that the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, whoever that may be, will be kicked off the ballot in any state. As things stand currently, no relevant deadlines have passed. The party remains perfectly free to choose its nominee however it wants, and to choose whomever it wants. Much of the panic stems from claims by the Heritage Foundation (the same organization behind Project 2025) arguing that ambiguities in state election laws could provide an opportunity to challenge a Biden replacement. On the legal merits, these arguments are thin, bordering on specious. But more importantly, they are inapplicable for now. As it currently stands, state Democratic parties wouldn’t be replacing Biden at all, because he is not yet the party’s official nominee. Zack Smith, a senior legal fellow at Heritage, has claimed that “in many states, including in several key states, the deadline for getting on the ballot has already passed.” This is simply untrue, and media outlets should fact-check this assertion rather than taking it at face value. Winger, for good reason, calls much of the coverage about this threat “gullible.” As he notes, “there would be no legal problem in any state.” UCLA professor Rick Hasen, another widely respected election law expert, has also observed “the bottom line is that there is unlikely to be an election law impediment to replacing Biden.” First, it’s worth taking a step back to understand how the Democratic and Republican nominees for president and vice president come to appear on state ballots. In every state, both major parties are qualified for what is known as “automatic” presidential ballot access. In other words, their nominees do not need to gather petition signatures or clear any other hurdles to secure a spot on the general election ballot. Instead, the qualified political parties simply tell the state’s election authorities (in most states, the secretary of state) who its candidates are. This process is never completed prior to the formal nomination by the party’s national convention. With one potential caveat, no state currently requires major parties to certify their presidential ticket any earlier than Aug. 21. Biden is not filed to appear on the ballot in any state at the moment, because he has not yet been formally nominated. The one complication arises in Ohio, which previously had an unusually early deadline of Aug. 7. At the insistence of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, the state Legislature passed a law to accommodate this year’s later Democratic National Convention, scheduled to begin on Aug. 19. Ohio’s new law sets the deadline as Sept. 1. However, the Democratic National Committee remains skittish, noting the contradiction that Ohio’s new law does not actually come into effect until Sept. 1. For this reason, the party had planned to conduct a virtual roll call of convention delegates to formalize the nomination sometime prior to Aug. 7. Even with this wrinkle in Ohio, there is no potential problem. All of the state laws to which Heritage’s commenters have pointed only concern the process for the party to replace one of its candidates later in the calendar, after having previously certified the Biden-Harris ticket. Another concern that has been raised is that the party could be open to litigation for disregarding the results of the primary elections. However, this misunderstands the role of state-run primary elections in the presidential nomination process. The Republican and Democratic parties are not required, and can not be required, to use the primaries at all. The primaries are, in effect, a nonbinding straw poll run by state governments. It is only through the party’s internal rules, as a private organization, that primaries are used to allocate convention delegates among the candidates seeking the nomination. We have already seen both parties decide to ignore state primaries in this election. Democrats did so in New Hampshire, which held its primary too early and out of turn according to the party’s newly adopted schedule. Republicans did the same in Nevada, spurning the state’s primary election in favor of a caucus administered by the party. This presents no legal problem because political parties, in deciding whom to nominate and how, are engaged in their own freedom of speech and association, fully protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has firmly ruled state governments have no power to impose any requirements on how the party conventions function or whom they may choose to nominate. With so much at stake in this year’s election, Democrats are understandably a bit panicked. There are a great many things to be worried about, with the unprecedented reality of an incumbent president dropping out of the race this late, amid serious concerns about his declining mental acuity and physical stamina. But with enough things on their plate to worry about, placing their party’s nominee on the ballot need not be one of them."
Biden is out. Now comes the hard part.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-withdraws-presidential-election-2024-democrats-rcna160452,"We know that America’s two main political parties have very different approaches to public policy. But this historic moment highlights a staggering difference in how the parties pick and treat their leaders. To call Joe Biden’s withdrawal unprecedented is to really sell it short. Yes, there have been cases (including Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968) where presidents have been encouraged by aides and party officials to withdraw due in part to their unpopularity. But those decisions were made long before the candidates’ respective conventions, and with plenty of time for interested party actors to decide on whom the next nominee would be. By contrast, the Democrats have already done the real work of the 2024 nomination. In 2019-2020, the Democratic Party, defined broadly, vetted Biden along with dozens of other candidates through a lengthy series of primaries and caucuses, debates and speeches, meetings, negotiations, and more. Ultimately party insiders determined that they had the most faith in Biden’s ability to both defeat Trump and work toward party priorities on the economy, the environment, labor, student loans, and more. The party’s voters and convention delegates concurred. The lack of a real Democratic Party nomination contest in early 2024 was a sign of another decision; the party remained comfortable with Biden’s progress on the goals it cared about and thought he could continue to work toward those goals in a second term. And again, the party’s voters concurred, and presumably the convention delegates were prepared to re-nominate him. Certainly, prominent people within the party who once thought Biden could win now aren’t so sure. Some voters, too, seem to have changed their minds. But the idea that there can be some sort of final veto stage of this process, after the formal primaries and caucuses are over, is novel — and a little stunning. Contrast this with the Republican Party. Party leaders did not want Donald Trump to be their nominee in 2016, but they ultimately pledged loyalty to him once he won the nomination. They have now functionally nominated him in three consecutive cycles. And any time new damaging information comes out — poor election performances in 2018, 2020, and 2022; helping organize a coup rather than leaving office peacefully; two impeachments; indictments in four separate criminal trials; conviction on 34 felony counts; a multi-million dollar fraud ruling; a court determination that he is liable for sexual abuse; a vow to “terminate” the Constitution, etc. — it only causes the party to support him more. Democrats abandoned their octogenarian leader for seeming cognitively enfeebled and unpopular; Republicans doubled down on their septuagenarian leader for a track record that has gotten increasingly worse with each passing month. Now, the Democrats have work to do. In order for this decision to be proven clever, and not catastrophic, what comes next in the process has to be far better thought out then what came before. If Vice President Kamala Harris is able to swiftly consolidate party support, reassure the constituent groups that were comfortable with Biden that she’d be at least as good on the issues they care about and impress voters and political observers that she has the ability to “prosecute” (her words) Trump in an effective way that brings in votes, this may turn out to be a good use of media pressure and party power. It’s also entirely plausible that Democrats will descend into a massive factional squabble at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, leaving all sides demoralized. In this scenario, Republicans will likely enjoy an even easier election than they would have had otherwise. (We’ve seen that before!) In other words, whether Biden’s withdrawal was a historically good or a historically bad move depends heavily on what comes next. But no matter what happens, it was certainly historic."
Supreme Court reforms could be a fight to the finish line between GOP and Dems,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-reforms-more-seats-rcna162326,"President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse a new package of Supreme Court reforms, a major shift for someone who has been wary about taking on the third branch of government. It’s a welcome move that could finally help rein in a court that has attempted to place itself above the other two branches. It’s also a tacit acknowledgement from Biden that the conservative supermajority isn’t about to temper itself, even as Chief Justice John Roberts publicly frets about the court’s reputation. The changes Biden is considering include “legislation to establish term limits for justices and establishing an updated code of ethics that would be binding and enforceable,” according to NBC News. These are both strong ideas that I wish Biden had endorsed sooner — but they still fall short of what would be the most effective way to transform the court’s workings. It’s long past time for Democrats to accept that the justices are political figures and the Supreme Court is a political arena. Accordingly, rather than run from GOP outrage about “packing the court,” it is in their best interest to campaign on the promise to increase the number of seats on the court. Despite the backlash against President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s failed effort to add Supreme Court seats in 1937 that has kept such proposals at bay, history is well on the side of court expansionists. The size of the court has been nowhere near static over its lifetime. The only requirement on that front under the Constitution is that it have one chief justice. Beyond that, the number of seats has fluctuated over the years, first as the country grew, then as political parties began vying for control over the judiciary. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Supreme Court was established with five associate justices alongside the chief. The act also set up a federal judiciary with three “circuits” that each had two justices assigned to it, along with a district judge. The justices would then “ride circuit,” traveling within their jurisdiction to hear cases, a practice that many early justices absolutely loathed. The number of circuits was soon expanded to six in 1802, requiring a single justice to travel to a smaller area, but only slightly muffling the grumbling from the jurists. Over the next several decades, with the country growing as it expanded westward, so too did the court. By 1807, a seventh circuit was added to encompass Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Another justice was added as well, for the first time tying Supreme Court seats to geographical regions, as the justice was required to reside within one of the three states in the circuit. At its biggest, the Supreme Court consisted of 10 justices to preside over 10 geographical circuits — but in the aftermath of the Civil War, congressional Republicans eliminated the 10th Circuit. Congress also dropped the number of justices to seven to reduce the number of Southerners serving, another point in favor of the size of the court being inherently wrapped up in politics. The court didn’t shrink that much though, as the reduction was meant to take effect as vacancies opened and were left unfilled. Instead, before that could happen, Congress boosted the number into the current total of nine justices in 1869 to align with the nine circuits. That may have been the last major reorganization of the circuit system, but since then two of them have been split in half, giving us the present 11 numbered circuits. Plus, there are two additional unnumbered circuits: the District of Columbia Circuit, which handles cases within the federal capital’s jurisdiction, and the Federal Circuit, a special appeals court that hears cases related to certain administrative areas. At present, each of the nine justices is assigned to at least one of these circuits — Brett Kavanaugh oversees both the 6th and 8th circuits, while Samuel Alito sits over the 3rd and 5th circuits. (Roberts himself sits over the D.C. Circuit and the Federal Circuit.) While justices are no longer required to travel to hear cases within their given territory, they are responsible for handling things like emergency requests and other administrative matters for appeals that come up from their circuits. That’s why you see, for example, Alito’s name on orders to allow an execution to go through in Louisiana. It is therefore entirely reasonable to argue that given the number of issues that certain members of the court must bear, it would be much more equitable to increase the number of justices to share that load. It would just so happen that in doing so, Democrats would be able to rebalance the court after its steady swing to the right over the last several decades. Doing so would shift the court from a 6-3 conservative supermajority to one that has seven liberals and six Republican-appointed justices. There are two interrelated problems, though, that would come from Democrats making this specific argument. First, linking the court’s expansion to the circuits is a move that will work only the once, at least not without a major reorganization of the circuit level. There is a proposal from some Western Senate Republicans to add a 12th Circuit to relieve some of the stress of the 9th, which encompasses the entire Pacific time zone. While that could add yet another justice under a circuit-based setup, this would provide an even number of seats. Should a 12th Circuit ever be established, I think the best course would be to keep the seats at 13, allowing the chief justice to reclaim oversight of the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit. Second, and more important for Democrats in this case, is that timing is key here. Because the court-expansion method I’ve described is entirely constitutional and precedented, it would also be entirely fair for Republicans to pull it off themselves. While some may be content with their current dominance, I’d be shocked to see a GOP trifecta reject cementing an even more unsurmountable grasp on the Supreme Court. And once the viability of this proposal is an accepted fact on both sides, it becomes a race to see who next captures both Congress and the White House and has the political will to carry it out. Democrats squandered their chance to pull this off in Biden’s first two years, even after Senate Republicans held a seat open in President Barack Obama’s final year. Now is the time for Democrats to start laying the groundwork to transform the court at the next possible opportunity."
Don’t be fooled by Trump’s latest gaslighting on abortion,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-abortion-republican-platform-2024-rcna161571,"Donald Trump, his campaign and the Republican Party are in the midst of a transparently dishonest attempt to use the GOP’s 2024 platform, unveiled earlier this month, to transform him into a “moderate” on abortion. Unfortunately, many media outlets have bought into the party’s framing that the new platform “softened” Trump’s abortion stance. Nothing could be further from the truth, and no one should be fooled by this latest Trump deception. “We proudly stand for families and Life,” states the new platform’s brief section on abortion. “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.” (The odd capitalization reflects, as has been reported, that Trump personally edited the document.) In other words, the platform maintains that embryos are people with constitutional rights and must be protected under the law. This idea is the core of a radical anti-abortion movement that seeks to bestow “personhood” rights on fertilized eggs. It’s true that this new platform abandons some of the language of the party’s last platform, from 2016. That platform explicitly called for a national abortion ban and cited the same due process protections to call for “a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to children before birth.” The changes have disappointed some parts of the Christian right. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, in particular, has used his radio show and news site to promote the view touted by himself and other Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, among others, that Trump has unacceptably “watered down” the party’s position. For them, national action, including banning the abortion pill mifepristone, remains a top priority. The new paragraph, however, is a characteristically Trumpian obfuscation, an attempt to please his base and confuse other voters who might have heard claims over the past several months that Trump, supposedly bucking his base, is resistant to a national abortion ban. A casual reader might even see the new platform’s sentence on the 14th Amendment as referring to constitutional rights for people, not embryos. Yet we know from close Trump ally Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, that the former president intends this section to recognize due process rights for embryos. And we also know that the paragraph’s final sentence, opposing “late term” abortions, is meant to signal to the Christian right that a national ban is still on the table. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, confirms the ticket’s anti-abortion bona fides. Vance has compared abortion to slavery, opposed any exceptions for rape or incest in abortion bans, and urged Ohioans to vote against an abortion rights amendment in 2023, arguing it was “not about freedom.” (It passed.) “The Republican Party platform makes clear the unborn child has a right to life that is protected by the Constitution under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment,” Reed wrote. “While aspirational, it applies to both the states and the federal government. The proposed ban on late-term abortion also implies federal as well as state action.” Perkins’ persistence signals that the leaders of the Christian right will not tolerate the party going soft on abortion, and that if Trump regains power they will use their clout within the party to push for the most draconian abortion bans and restrictions possible. In the meantime, criticism from Perkins and others also helps Trump to position himself, preposterously, as bucking his extreme supporters. But no one should forget that Trump has bragged about how “pro-life” his presidency was, particularly his crucial role in appointing three justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump knows his party’s quest to outlaw abortion nationwide is wildly unpopular and a potentially devastating drag on his ability to attract voters beyond his MAGA base. In April, the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a 4-point increase since the Supreme Court struck down Roe two years ago. Last month, Gallup reported that a record 32% of voters said they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion — a position that is “markedly higher among pro-choice voters than it was during the 2020 presidential election cycle, while pro-life voters’ intensity about voting on the abortion issue has waned.” Finally, a Public Religion Research Institute analysis this month similarly found that 37% of voters in seven battleground states said they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion, with Democrats more likely to answer this way (at 46%) than Republicans (at 34%). Leading the way among those litmus test voters are Gen Z voters (47%), who are more likely by at least 10 percentage points than any other generation to say they would only cast a ballot for a candidate who shares their abortion position. Trump’s gaslighting comes amid his base’s march to transform America into a dystopia governed by anti-abortion fanatics, eager to impose their will in hospitals, doctor’s offices and bedrooms. While the 2024 platform may be shorter than its predecessor, newfound brevity does not equal altered ideology. The GOP remains a party of anti-abortion radicals, and no document is going to change that."
George Santos fails to get identity theft charges dismissed from indictment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 2:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/george-santos-fraud-charges-dismiss-rcna162849,"A federal judge has rejected former New York Rep. George Santos’ request to dismiss some of the fraud charges against him, ruling that his motions to dismiss failed to meet the legal standard. Santos’ lawyers had sought to dismiss three of 23 felony charges, including two related to aggravated identity theft. They argued that he was accused of overcharging donors’ credit cards and not of stealing their identities. U.S. District Judge Joanna Seybert tossed out all motions to dismiss in a ruling Friday. The disgraced former House Republican has pleaded not guilty to all counts. His trial is scheduled to begin in September. If convicted, he could face up to 22 years in federal prison. Santos’ tenure in Congress, which lasted just over 10 months, was roiled by controversy even before he was sworn in. In December 2022, The New York Times reported on glaring misrepresentations on his resume and in claims about his background. That led to a series of revelations about his other lies and alleged misdeeds. In May of last year, Santos was charged by the Justice Department in a 13-count indictment; prosecutors filed additional charges against him in October. Then in November, the House Ethics Committee released a report finding that Santos had “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” After two unsuccessful attempts, his House colleagues eventually voted to expel him in December. Legislatively speaking, his track record in office wasn’t a success, either. NBC News reported that all 40 bills he introduced languished in committee without a single vote. Since his expulsion, Santos has tried a number of gambits to claw his way back from irrelevancy. He ran for another New York congressional seat as a Republican, switched to an independent, then ended that campaign as well — all within the space of a few weeks. He joined Cameo, a website for celebrities to make custom short-form videos for a fee; launched subscriptions on X to offer gossip about his former congressional colleagues; and joined the subscription-based social media platform OnlyFans (he said his account would not offer sexual content, as many OnlyFans accounts do, and that he “wanted to stir the pot”)."

U.S. District Judge John Broomes, a Trump appointee in Kansas, issued a broad injunction earlier this month that blocks the enforcement of a new Title IX rule to protect LGBTQ students in Kansas and three other states. It also applies to schools attended by children of members of the groups that sued over the rule, Moms for Liberty, Young America’s Foundation and Female Athletes United. Finalized in April, the new rule expands protections under Title IX — a sex discrimination law aimed at protecting women’s rights in education — to include transgender students, whose rights have increasingly come under attack from Republican lawmakers. The rule, which is slated to go into effect on Aug. 1, set off a raft of lawsuits from GOP-led states. At least 15 states have temporarily blocked enforcement of the rule amid legal challenges. Broomes asked the three plaintiff groups to submit a list of schools attended by their members’ children so those schools can be exempt from the rule. But Moms for Liberty said compiling such a list would be “impossible” and that it does not ask its members about their children’s schools. The group instead requested that Broomes block the Title IX rule in any county where its members live, rather than just in schools attended by their children. In his ruling on Friday, Broomes said he did not have the jurisdiction to do so. Had he granted the request, the rule could have been blocked in hundreds of counties, including in those that contain Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco and most of New York City. Broomes gave Moms for Liberty until July 26 to submit a list of schools attended by its members’ children. However, the judge also ruled that the injunction applies to current and prospective members of the three plaintiff groups, “creating the possibility of a constantly expanding injunction,” as the legal blog Law Dork noted."
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee dies at 74,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 8:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sheila-jackson-lee-dies-cancer-texas-rcna162831,"Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a longtime Texas Democrat who championed progressive policies, has died at age 74 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her family announced her death in a statement on Friday. “A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children,” her family said. Jackson Lee had said last month that she was undergoing treatment for cancer. News of her death led to an outpouring of condolences from Democrats and Republicans. Rep. Nancy Pelosi called her a “powerful voice for our Constitution and human rights.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said she was a “proud Texan and a tireless advocate for the people of Houston.” Jackson Lee was first elected to Congress in 1994, and she went on to serve nearly 30 years in the House. She ran for Houston mayor in 2023 and lost in a bruising primary, but she announced her bid for Texas’ 18th Congressional District again shortly after and won. In Congress, Jackson Lee was as a champion for criminal justice reform and reparations for Black Americans. She led the push to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, as well as a rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act to include protections for marginalized groups. She was a household name in her district, The Texas Tribune reported, often attending local graduations, funerals and baby showers. In an interview with local news station KPRC 2 in 2020, Jackson Lee said she hoped to leave behind a legacy of helping others. “If you were in a ditch, I want my story to be that I tried to help you,” she said, “and in many instances, I was successful in helping you and giving back.”"
The MAGA right sent an unmistakable message to trans people at this year’s RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-mtg-rnc-sent-message-trans-people-year-rcna162422,"In the first major speech of the opening night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Sen. Ron Johnson, speaking in his home state, said Democrats’ “fringe agenda includes biological males competing against girls and the sexualization and indoctrination of our children,” a reference to trans athletes and what he sees as liberal support for trans children. Later that  evening, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was even more explicit. “Let me state this clearly: There are only two genders,” she said, as the crowd erupted into cheers. “And we are made in God’s image, amen. And we won’t shy away from speaking that simple truth ever.” Greene has been at the center of multiple transphobic incidents during her congressional career, perhaps most notably when she used signage outside her office to taunt her then-office neighbor, former Rep. Marie Newman, D-Ill., who has a transgender daughter. Sean O’Brien, who this week became the first Teamsters president to attend the convention, later used his social media account to endorse a written piece from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., that included this sentence: “The C-suite long ago sold out the United States, shuttering factories in the homeland and gutting American jobs, while using the profits to push diversity, equity, and inclusion and the religion of the trans flag.” O’Brien’s post was followed by a response from the Teamsters social media account, which said that “unions gain nothing from endorsing the racist, misogynistic, and anti-trans politics of the far right.” But that public rebuke of the Teamsters leader and the Republican senator was deleted. Even former President Donald Trump got in a dig about ""men playing in women’s sports."" Trans pundits and intellectuals have been warning that these days would eventually come. And now they’re here. The party that met in Milwaukee this week is largely unpopular and has few legislative ideas or successes. But it has had success with its anti-trans agenda. Hundreds of transphobic and punitive anti-trans laws have been put on the books throughout red states in the Deep South and Mountain West over the last four years. It’s not surprising, then, that when putting on a national show to tell voters the story of the 2024 Republican Party, transphobia would lead. It’s clear from the rhetoric at the convention that Republicans hope to escalate their state-level attacks on trans rights into a full-blown national campaign. There have been hints that the party’s proposed pornography ban is actually designed to permanently silence trans public figures such as myself and that it seeks to drive trans life completely underground. It’s a terrifying time to be transgender in America, and many of my trans friends who have the means are looking to flee the country should Republicans retake power. We’ve already seen a mass internal migration of trans people and families with trans kids fleeing oppressive red states with vehement anti-trans laws already in force. A Republican takeover of the federal government this fall would turn that migration international. As for me, I’m not leaving. I have kids here and loving family members. I will resist with everything I have until I’m in the ground. We have a phrase in the trans community that I find myself thinking of often these days: “death before detransition.” The phrase couldn’t be more appropriate right now as I stare down the specter of another Trump term and thousands of Republicans who hate people like me potentially taking over the federal government. For trans people in America, this election will shape our individual futures for the rest of our lives. Death before detransition: If conservatives want a country free of trans people, these are my terms."
JD Vance’s revisionist history about who launched America’s failed wars,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-rnc-republicans-iraq-war-rcna162564,"If you listened to Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, on the third night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, you’d think it was Democrats — and President Joe Biden, in particular — who were to blame for thousands upon thousands of combat deaths and postwar suicides of American military personnel who served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. “When I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq,” said Vance, who enlisted in the Marines and served in Iraq, before attending Ohio State and Yale Law. He later added: “From Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the great recession, from open borders to stagnating wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again.” Yes, Biden did vote for the Iraq War. So did a significant number of Democrats on Capitol Hill — including then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, a fateful choice that a younger colleague, the junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, used to assail her during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. But it was then-President George W. Bush who ignored warnings during the summer of 2001 that Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda group was, as the title of a famous memo goes, “Determined To Strike in U.S.” It was Bush, in the thrall of hawkish Vice President Dick Cheney, who spun a fictitious narrative about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. And it was Republican lawmakers who were almost universally in lockstep with the president on his Bush Doctrine, which legitimized the concept of preventive war with its “you’re with us or against us” view of the world. And Republican voters — most of whom have since become MAGA supporters and “America First” foreign policy isolationists, judging by surveys and polls — overwhelmingly supported both. It was Bush who launched the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which led to 7,000 deaths in foreign operations, as well as 30,000 suicides, according to a database kept by Brown University. He condoned torture. And much of it was made possible by the lies his administration told about the supposed need to topple Hussein. The unfocused campaign against Al Qaeda also demanded extending the “Global War on Terror” — with U.S. military action in 22 countries authorized by Congress’ near-unanimous Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which became law just seven days after the 9/11 attacks. (The lone vote against the 2001 AUMF was by a Democrat, Rep. Barbara Lee of California.) Since then, both Republicans and Democrats have tried to clean up the mess he made. Their failure to do so is a testament to the disaster caused by Bush administration hawks who saw 9/11 as the perfect pretext to realize their vision of American power. Obama tried to extricate U.S. troops, only to order “surges” in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while also creating a regime of legally questionable drone warfare. To his credit, Trump moved to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only to leave the job unfinished. Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was legitimately disastrous, and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as his top deputy Jon Finer, should have resigned. They didn’t, with a subsequent Biden administration review of the debacle essentially blaming Trump for the timeline he’d set. Yet it was neither Biden nor Trump who ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to begin with, or mismanaged it to the point that it was sometimes called “the forgotten war,” even as American troops fought and died in it. It was Bush, who was so popular in the wake of 9/11 that the American media made a “rock star” out of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for his feisty press conferences, even as he was failing to take the steps that would have brought Al Qaeda’s leadership to swift justice. And despite presiding over the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor, voters rewarded Bush in the 2002 with a rare sweeping victory for the incumbent president’s party in Congress. The idea that Republican politicians and voters opposed America’s Republican-led war footing in the early 2000s is fanciful, to put it kindly. For all that has happened since then, 9/11 remains the hinge moment for the American project. In one of the most trenchant analyses I’ve read of the terror attacks, columnist Michelle Goldberg of The New York Times wrote in 2021, “The attacks, and our response to them, catalyzed a period of decline that helped turn the United States into the debased, half-crazed fading power we are today. America launched a bad-faith global crusade to instill democracy in the Muslim world and ended up with our own democracy in tatters.” In his powerful book “Reign of Terror,” the journalist Spencer Ackerman draws a direct line between the militarism that began on 9/11 and the assault on American democracy that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. So many other of the nation’s ills — xenophobia, paranoia, polarization, addiction — began with or were accelerated by Bush’s misbegotten war on “evildoers.” But if you listened to Vance’s speech, and watched the reactions of the GOP delegates in the crowd in Milwaukee, you’d never know that it was Republican politicians and voters who pushed America into two long, disastrous wars. Until they acknowledge their own responsibility for the damage those wars caused our reputations — not to mention the lives they took — they don’t deserve to be taken seriously. Then again, maybe being taken seriously is no longer something they crave."
There is no such thing as a ‘new’ Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/jen-psaki-rnc-new-trump-rcna162800,"I have watched a lot of speeches in my life. Donald Trump’s meandering, nearly 90-minute exhibition, which included a mix of self-involved bluster, a gruesome recounting of the assassination attempt on his life and a series of bizarre stories about everything from UFC President Dana White’s vacation to the “late and great Hannibal Lecter,” was simply not a good speech. The entire point of a prime-time address is to speak to an audience broader than your core supporters. These opportunities don’t come along very often for presidential candidates. And yet, I doubt even Trump’s biggest fans were still listening after 45 minutes of garbled drivel. It certainly wasn’t the unifying speech we were promised. Not that I ever really believed Trump could pull off that sort of dramatic pivot. Indeed, Thursday night was just another reminder that every promised reinvention of Trump is bound to be thwarted by Donald Trump himself. So maybe it’s time that we stop buying into it. All of it. And while we’re at it, let’s also stop treating him and the MAGA movement as if it is some insurmountable genius collective. A prime-time convention speech is only as helpful to a campaign as the person delivering it. And Thursday’s speech may go down as one of the worst acceptance speeches delivered by a nominee from either party. On the first night of this year’s Republican convention, Trump selected Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his vice presidential nominee. Vance has billed himself as a “man of the people” who truly understands the struggles of the Rust Belt, but his work addressing Ohio’s opioid crisis tells a different story. When Vance returned to Ohio after working at a San Francisco venture capital fund, he launched the nonprofit Our Ohio Renewal, claiming it would be a “focused effort on solving the opioid crisis.” However, his nonprofit — which he shut down shortly after winning the Republican primary for Senate in 2022 — didn’t fund a single treatment program. In fact, the largest share of the organization’s budget went to “management services” provided by a company that employed Jai Chabria as its executive director. Chabria would later go on to be a senior adviser for Vance’s 2022 Senate run. Additionally, the organization spent $45,000 on polling — but nonprofit staffers told The New York Times they never saw the results. Coincidentally, The Atlantic reported Vance had commissioned a poll to test his viability for a Senate run. Vance later funded a psychiatrist, Sally Satel, to work in Ironton, Ohio. Vance used Satel to bolster his image as a leader in addressing Ohio’s opioid crisis. However, Satel was later found to have financial ties to Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin. With a carefully crafted persona, Vance has gained the support of Trump and simultaneously revealed his true priority: to achieve political gain by whatever means necessary. And that includes exploiting Ohio’s opioid crisis. One of the key figures in the effort to keep Democrats in control of the Senate is Ohio Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Walters.  Last year, Walters successfully led the Ohio Democratic Party’s effort to protect a woman’s right to choose on a statewide ballot initiative. Now, she is currently steering the state party through a crucial election for Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, but her role has become even more significant this week as Trump selected Ohio’s junior senator as his running mate. You can expect to see much more of Walters in the news, breaking down how Vance failed to advocate for the interests of Ohioans during his brief time in the U.S. Senate.

House GOP’s probe into the Trump assassination attempt is doomed from the start,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 4:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-assassination-attempt-house-investigation-secret-service-rcna162784,"Speeches this week at the Republican National Convention didn’t inspire confidence in Republicans’ ability to lead a trustworthy investigation into last weekend’s shooting at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania. House Republicans have begun their probe, but initial responses from many GOP officials suggest that no small number have already concluded that this is a story of anti-Trump violence inspired by liberals. A theory for which, of course, there’s no evidence. In fact, about all we know so far is that the 20-year-old shooter was a registered Republican who apparently made a $15 donation to a progressive cause in 2021 and that he recently made internet searches related to Trump and the Democratic National Convention. Prominent Republicans, nonetheless, sought immediately in the aftermath to frame the shooting as a consequence of liberals’ rhetoric. That includes the vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said: “The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they’ve demonized him [Trump] and his supporters.” The finger-pointing and blame-casting continued at the RNC and its adjacent events, from speakers who were given top billing like Tucker Carlson and Greene, to state legislators like Arizona state Rep. Alexander Kolodin and even run-of-the-mill Republican attendees, like these who spoke with CNN. There was a palpable sense of victimhood at this convention, with many trying to pin the shooting on liberals. So the consensus that’s building on the right points to one potentially insurmountable hurdle for House Republicans’ investigation: their own lack of credibility in leading investigations. With their handling of their dead-end probe into President Joe Biden, House Republicans have already shown that they’re willing to use outright lies from unscrupulous figures when those lies help to bolster their preconceived and politically opportune conclusions. With their bogus hearings on the purported weaponization of government against conservatives, they’ve demonstrated that they have no qualms about using their official positions to spread right-wing propaganda. None of their behavior thus far suggests they wouldn’t attempt something similar in the case of the Trump rally shooting, particularly since so many of them are already on the record with their preconceived conclusion. When it comes to a matter as serious as an assassination attempt, it’s important that Americans broadly feel they’re receiving information from unbiased, credible sources. But in this case, multiple influential Republicans are already behaving like judges who’ve reached a verdict without hearing the actual case. We’ll know in short order whether the cart is again before the horse. The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who ran point on the empty-handed Biden impeachment probe, issued a statement with ranking committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., demanding that Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testify on Monday. Cheatle has accepted the invitation."

In a remarkable drip of defections, some prominent Democrats have urged the president to drop out and have voiced concerns that he cannot win against Donald Trump in November. Others have stopped short of calling for Biden's withdrawal but have warned that Democrats will lose the election if he stays on the ticket. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said he believed Trump and Republicans are currently on track to win the election by a landslide. “So for me, this isn’t a question about polling, it’s not a question of politics. It’s a moral question about the future of our country,” he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also avoided giving a direct answer about whether Biden should stay on the ticket, telling MSNBC's “Morning Joe” that “it’s up to the president to decide” if he will stay on the ticket or not. “We’re all encouraging him to make that decision,” she said. “Because time is running short.” Here's a running list of top Democrats, including sitting members of Congress, who have called for Biden to pull out of the ticket: Hayley Miller contributed reporting.

Joe Biden must break free of his bubble of denial,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 3:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-denial-2024-democracy-trump-polls-rcna162750,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 19 episode of ""Morning Joe."" Donald Trump’s speech during the final night of the Republican National Convention was a missed opportunity. Despite branding it as a call for national unity, the former president failed to change his divisive tone — seemingly tacking on a somber 20 minutes to what was otherwise a standard rally speech. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that from the Republican Party’s point of view, this was a successful convention. This is a very united Republican Party — united behind Trump. They’ve made it clear they’re not going to stand against his extreme agenda. That makes the former president more dangerous than ever before. Right now, Donald Trump has never been stronger, and President Joe Biden has never been weaker.  As the election quickly approaches, we need to take a deep breath and ask ourselves: What’s at stake here? I understand that the president and his folks are feeling angry and betrayed. But ultimately, it’s not about him. It’s about the country. All the signals are blinking, all the alarm bells are ringing, alerting us to the danger we face if Trump retakes the White House. What we’re seeing on the Democratic side, with the effort to replace Biden at the top of the ticket, is a response to that danger.   It’s a reality check, not a betrayal. The problem is not the people saying, “Oh, my God, there’s an iceberg there. We need to avoid the iceberg. Let’s not hit the iceberg.” The problem is the iceberg. It’s crucial that at some point Biden — who, unfortunately, is in a sort of bubble of denial — gets out of that bubble and understands how important it is for his legacy that he be gracious about this. If he steps back, he would do so with the gratitude of a nation, and we could move on to the future. The way this plays out over the coming days and weeks is very important: Will it be embittered? Will Democrats point fingers at one another? Or will they accept that it’s time to move on because the threat of Trump is just so great? Democrats have to resolve this one way or another, and they have to do it very, very quickly."
JD Vance’s foreign policy ideas are Putin and Orban’s dream come true,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 2:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jd-vance-foreign-policy-rcna162608,"PARIS — All of the world’s worst people must have loved JD Vance’s speech Wednesday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and must be taking great comfort in the plan to push America into a new and profoundly isolationist direction. If the U.S., as Vance proposes, retracts from Europe and much of its traditional activities abroad and, not to mention, erects new barriers to commerce and the free exchange of ideas, it would create a vacuum ready to be filled. Who might fill it? Who would profit from the victory of a Trump-Vance duopoly? Start with Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, both of whom have been doing their best to cement Russia’s dominance of Europe’s eastern fringes and fighting every effort to contain Putin’s expanding ambitions. Orban, who just began his six-month rotation as leader of the European Union, and Putin have worked to cement ties with other similarly inclined political forces in Europe and with the GOP in the U.S., led by Donald Trump. “We need to go deeper, occupy positions, gather allies and fix the European Union,” Orban has said. “It’s not enough to be angry. We need to take over Brussels.” They’ve had no shortage of allies in their expanding ambitions in the rest of Europe: newly empowered far-right forces like the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, Marine Le Pen and her National Rally in France, and, in the U.K., the right-wing firebrand Nigel Farage, who showed up in Milwaukee to pay tribute to Trump and Vance. Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can only be delighted by Vance’s expressed support for winning the war in Gaza “as quickly as possible,” which could mean at a great cost to the people of Gaza. In addition to Netanyahu, there are the deeply religious allies of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Iran — smarting over a recently elected reformist president who’s hoping to get sanctions lifted. A Trump administration would be intent on tightening those sanctions. Brazil’s former right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump admirer ousted by a left-wing opponent, is hoping for return to power in Brazil. After the assassination attempt on Trump, Bolsonaro called Trump “the greatest world leader right now” and pledged to be at what he hopes is Trump’s second inauguration in January. Then there’s Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who’s barely hanging on after a recent tight victory. He cherished the close ties he had with Trump, and he is deepening his ties with Putin. And of course, there’s Putin himself. Vance and Trump seem to share similar views on the war in Ukraine. They favor a quick peace deal, with Kyiv ceding substantial territory to Russia if necessary and agreeing to perpetual “neutrality.” Senior European diplomats fear that any such end to the conflict would only fuel Putin’s expansionist ambitions. It was with a deep sense of relief that the European Parliament Thursday bestowed a second five-year term on former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyden as president of the European Commission. She’s a powerful ally of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Indeed, one of the cornerstones of her platform was a pledge to fashion “a true European Defense Union,” with the continent’s first defense minister, part of Europe’s efforts to Trump-proof its security. This strain of American isolationism is associated with some of the most destructive periods in America’s past. Historically, the U.S. has never done well by disengaging from the world, putting up high tariff walls and avoiding armed conflicts abroad. In the early 20th century, Senate Republicans, bitterly opposed to the Versailles Treaty negotiated by President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, succeeded in rejecting the pact and keeping the U.S. out of a League of Nations that the treaty would have established. That act of isolation laid the foundations for the rise of Hitler in Germany and the onset of World War II. The deeply protectionist Smoot Hawley Tariff, enacted in 1930 and immediately drawing retaliation from its target countries, only intensified the Great Depression at home by slowing demand for American goods and sharply raising the prices of all imports. In turn, the tariff accelerated Hitler’s rise to power. The America First movement, launched at Yale Law School in 1940 (decades before Vance attended) advocated an end to military aid to Britain and staying out of World War II.  The group, more than 800,000-strong and encompassing such luminaries as Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh, argued that buffered by two broad oceans America would be safe if it remained isolated. That group disbanded two days after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Despite that historical record, the similar America First doctrine proclaimed by Vance and Trump appears to be the cornerstone of their foreign policy alongside economic populism. “No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,” Vance declared Wednesday. Trump spent his entire first administration seeking to unravel NATO, demanding that allies pay more for their defense, while withdrawing from a host of international treaties. In Europe, where I’m writing this from, the panic is palpable. As the Economist’s Charlemagne column — written, as it happens, by a direct lineal descendant of the 8th century Carolingian emperor — observed: “In Brussels and beyond, the mere prospect of a Trump-Vance combo in the White House ought to add urgency to the debate about Europe’s future.”  Indeed, it ought to add urgency on both sides of the Atlantic, as the future of the U.S. is also in play."

Trump says leave abortion to the states. Texas nearly killed my wife.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 2:07 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/texas-abortion-law-trump-stance-miscarriage-rcna161130,"My wife says she doesn’t feel right. She’s almost 13 weeks pregnant with our second child. She is bleeding and has severe abdominal pain. We live in rural Texas, where options are limited. At the nearest emergency clinic, my wife goes inside alone, while I wait in the truck with our 9-month-old daughter. We learn the fetal heartbeat stopped about a week ago. Unless you’ve been there yourself, it’s impossible to fathom the devastation we feel. We’re told there’s a high risk of infection if we don’t act fast. We have two options. One is a procedure called “dilation and curettage,” which removes the contents of the uterus. The other is a take-home pill called misoprostol, which causes the pregnancy to be expressed. Both options are the standard of care for people with incomplete miscarriages like my wife’s, and though a D&C is used in some abortions, the procedure is legal in Texas if there’s no fetal cardiac activity detected. Yet the practitioners at the clinic refuse to perform it. Instead, they write her a prescription for misoprostol. It’s too late for me to go to the pharmacy tonight. At home, my wife tries to sleep, but I’ve never heard her cry like this. She cries all night. I’m first in line when the pharmacy opens, and I grab the small paper bag of misoprostol. It can cause bleeding and cramping while it helps flush the uterus. My wife is a strong Texan woman, but the pain proves almost unbearable. We call the emergency clinic for guidance. Because my wife is expelling bright-red blood, not brown, the medical staff explains the pill isn’t working. Though proven effective, misoprostol — like any medication — doesn’t work for everyone. We need another option.  My wife hasn’t slept. She’s still bleeding. We call the emergency clinic as soon as they open. We learn misoprostol can sometimes take two or three attempts to fully work. They ask us to come back in. There’s a new doctor this time, an older man. He’s aware of my wife’s incomplete miscarriage and history of care. My wife hears him huffing outside the exam room: “I’m not giving her some pill so she can go home and have an abortion.” Then he comes in and says he won’t prescribe her the pill “considering the current stance.” He doesn’t mention a D&C. Even the nurse is visibly shocked. We call another hospital — farther away, but one we trust. For the third time this weekend, my daughter and I sit in the truck outside a hospital while I clutch my phone, waiting for updates. Inside, my wife has to start the process all over again — new scan, new questions, more poking and prodding — only to reconfirm what we already know. Then, the strangest thing happens. The medical staff disappears. For hours. When the doctor finally returns, she deems my wife’s condition “not enough of an emergency” to perform a D&C. If we want the procedure, the soonest we can get it is at least a week away. The staffers know my wife is still bleeding. They know there’s been no fetal heartbeat for over a week. They know the risks of infection and sepsis. But they don’t want to risk criminal prosecution. Because in Texas, they can now face a $100,000 fine or life in prison for inducing anything that could be interpreted as an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. They write her another misoprostol prescription and send us home. The dosage is much stronger, with no refills. At this point my wife has been bleeding — bright red — for 48 hours. The medication doesn’t work. Overnight, nothing improves. My wife asks for a heated blanket and a pillow. She lies on the bathroom floor, her visage gray and her skin clammy. For the first time I catch myself thinking, Is she going to die? As I check on our daughter, I look down at my phone and see a missed call. I race back to find my wife unconscious on the floor, a red trail running from the toilet into the pool of blood she’s lying in. I’ll never forget lifting her cold, limp body off that bathroom floor, yelling, “Can you hear me?!” I place our daughter in the car seat and my wife in the passenger seat — still unconscious, still bleeding. Hazards on, I drive to the hospital as fast as I feel comfortable. I sprint through the emergency entrance and scream for help. Staff rushes out. They wheel my wife inside on a stretcher. As I hold our little girl and numbly fill out paperwork, a nurse approaches.  “Thank God you brought her when you did,” she says. Her attempt at reassurance infuriates me. I guess my wife was finally close enough to death to deserve help. My wife survived, but we’re not out of the woods. As I write this, she is once again looking at a positive pregnancy test. She may need a D&C for this new pregnancy, and we have no faith in the doctors here in Texas to provide it. If I have to take her to another state, I will. Make no mistake: The disgraceful lack of care she endured was a direct result of Texas’ deadly new abortion law. Leaving abortion laws up to the states, as Donald Trump promises to do, is not a moderate stance. Doctors are scared and confused. Patient health can no longer be their top priority. Now, it’s avoiding prosecution."
Convening and Kvetching,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-convening-kvetching-rcna162760,"This podcast is all about winning in November, so how does that happen in the political climate of this volatile week? The narrative from Democrats has been evolving each day– so Former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri walk us through it. Then, The Bulwark’s managing editor Sam Stein stops by, after a week on the ground in Milwaukee for the GOP Convention. They note several strange themes that emerged from the gathering of Republicans, as well as the disconnect between JD Vance’s worldview and Trump’s. But the biggest takeaway was the importance of not losing sight of the stakes this November, as Democrats figure out a path forward.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, welcome to How to Win 2024. It’s Friday, July 19th. I’m Jennifer Palmieri and here with my co-pilot Claire McCaskill, who’s back after a week of vacation, but I feel like I’ve seen you so much that I don’t feel like you’ve been on vacation at all. Claire McCaskill: I don’t feel like I’ve been on vacation at all. To tell you the truth, I’m flat worn out. Jennifer Palmieri: I barely remember you being gone, but I guess you were gone. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I was gone and believe me, I was tempted to stay gone. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Claire McCaskill: And you know, we have a conversation here every week and I think it’s really important to say at the very top of this week, how emotionally difficult it is for anybody who cares deeply about this process. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: This is really hard stuff. I mean, President Biden is my friend. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, me too. Claire McCaskill: And I think people that are out there screeching online one way or the other, I think we got to just take a moment to realize that the reason this is so hard is because it’s painful, emotionally painful. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s wrenching, it’s emotionally painful, and also it’s such a close call, you know, you feel like the current option isn’t working, but you open door number one and like, what are you unleashing into the world, right? So after the debate, that first weekend when everybody was like, oh, he’s going to drop out, you know, he’s not going to drop out. He’s going to drop out 48 hours after the debate, like, nor should we want him to, like none of that, you know. It’s going to take at least three weeks to sort this out and that’s going to be painful, but that’s okay because you got to get it right and you got to make the best decision you can because of everything that’s at stake. And people talk about, there’s all this infighting of Democrats, it’s like, no, that’s not what’s happening. Claire McCaskill: No, that’s not. Jennifer Palmieri: No, what it is, is people are trying to figure it out. People are trying to figure out how’s he doing? Is he up to this? What’s the right thing to do? What’s the responsible thing to do given what’s at stake? And I’m just like grateful that we have the kind of leaders that we have in the House and Senate from Schumer and, you know, Leader Jeffries in the House and obviously Pelosi to kind of help navigate this with their caucuses and understand where they’re coming from and have the credibility to go to the president and tell them what they really think what’s right. Claire McCaskill: You know, I was thinking about the name of our podcast and the reason that there is so many gut-wrenching discussions and difficult decisions to make is because of the name of this podcast. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: It is just everyone is unified around the concept of winning this election. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And it’s just people have honest disagreements about how to do it. And that shouldn’t be evil. Those that are maintaining that it’s a huge mistake for Biden to move off the ticket, I get it. Those who believe it’s absolutely horrible to think that Biden would remain at the top of the ticket, I get it. And that’s because there’s no easy or simple answer here. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: So we’re going to talk more about all of that. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: We’re also going to talk with Sam Stein, managing editor at “The Bulwark,” who was on the ground in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention. We want to take a hard look at Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, what themes, if any, emerged from Trump’s official coronation other than macho, macho man, and remind people what the stakes are if he’s reelected. So let’s go gut check, if I were in the room. First, we need to acknowledge the -- Jennifer Palmieri: Well -- Claire McCaskill: -- the unity the whole country has about the near assassination of Donald Trump and how -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my God. I mean, I still can’t even believe that happened. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s almost so shocking that we can’t even absorb it. It’s like, you know, it was absorbed in a day. It felt like it was going to have a huge impact on the race. I think it was a very sobering, scary thing and you realize how tenuous this all is, right? You know, the democracy, how we’ve been lucky that rhetoric hasn’t provoked as much, you know, that we haven’t seen more of this, frankly, you know? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and listen, I recall no one being irresponsible, anybody who’s been in an elected position or is doing the kinds of things we do every day, Jen. I don’t think anybody has been irresponsible in the way they’ve talked about this. I will say that we do know that the shooter was researching on his phone, not just Trump, but also Biden and also the Democratic National Convention. So this is not somebody, I mean, who’s registered Republican. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: So I do think it’s irresponsible for anyone on the right or the left to try to ascribe to either candidate that they’re totally responsible for this. I do think that Donald Trump has gone places that presidential candidates typically have not gone in terms of how he has talked about political violence. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And so I’m not going to sit by and accept from the Republicans that this was the Democrats trying to kill Donald Trump or that they are responsible because of their rhetoric. That is not fair. And I don’t think we have to accept that while still being very respectful of the danger that Donald Trump faced and how glad we are that he avoided serious injury. Jennifer Palmieri: My God, yeah. Okay, because it’s just been so stunning, we’re going to talk about the evolution of the week. So that happened Saturday night, Sunday, is sort of us processing the assassination attempt. Then you have the Lester Holt interview that was on Monday, and even that feels like -- Claire McCaskill: A year ago. Jennifer Palmieri: -- year ago, right. Well, what’s your impression of that? I mean, that was not great. It was not great. Claire McCaskill: It was not great. I mean, he did pivot and punch a little bit about all of Trump’s lies during the debate, which was good. But -- Jennifer Palmieri: But. Claire McCaskill: But -- Jennifer Palmieri: But they are, you know, obviously confused during parts of the interview, not following the thread of the conversation. So that happened on Monday. And then Wednesday happens, and I feel like that’s where it all starts to change. You know, Adam Schiff comes out, a close ally of Nancy Pelosi’s. And I’m going to step back to say I am not operating from independent knowledge. I’m stringing things together as someone with experience and an interested observer. I see a week ago Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi does her shot across the bow on “Morning Joe,” right? She says the president needs to make a decision, even the president’s already made a decision and time is running out. Then Thursday, last week, there’s the press conference after NATO. After the press conference, Hakeem Jeffries goes to the White House right away to talk to the president. We know that a lot of people in the caucus have concerns about him staying. Puts out the statement Friday morning that does not endorse Biden staying in the race. And then we find out this Wednesday, after Schiff goes, we find out that Senator Schumer actually went to Rehoboth last Saturday prior to the assassination attempt to also deliver a very tough message. And then we see it is revealed to us on Wednesday that the whole House and Senate leadership has already spoken to the president to express their very serious concerns. And obviously, if they had some conclusion other than they thought that he should stay in the race, they would have said so. But that is not what they said. Claire McCaskill: And I think, first of all, it really is irritating to me. I’m so glad you talked about the leadership in the House and the Senate -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- because one of the things that’s really irritating to me is that people think that somehow there’s a room somewhere and these big elite leaders get in that room and go, oh, okay, let’s just kneecap Joe Biden. No. Jennifer Palmieri: For better or worse -- Claire McCaskill: No. Jennifer Palmieri: -- there’s no smoke filled room, people. Claire McCaskill: No. Jennifer Palmieri: There’s no one actually in charge. There’s not 12 people somewhere deciding all this. That is not happening. Claire McCaskill: And let me pull back the curtain on what has actually happened behind the scenes. Very quietly and very methodically, there was a decision made by important elected officials in our party that we needed to give Joe Biden time, space and grace, as many have said, to hopefully figure out on his own with the help of his family and close staff that maybe exiting the race was going to be a good thing. That did not happen. So I think most of the battleground state Senate candidates waited seven to 10 days before going into the field with a poll because you want to wait, Jen, as you know -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- at least a week after an event to begin polling to see if it’s had an impact. And they ask questions like, would it impact your vote for, let’s just say, hypothetically, Jackie Rosen if she continued to assert on the campaign trail that Joe Biden was capable of serving out another four and a half years as president. And they had those numbers. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And all of these battleground state Senate candidates, which we have to win the Senate -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- they are in a position -- Jennifer Palmieri: And it’s not like self-interested, like, all I care about is my race. That’s not what’s happening. Claire McCaskill: No, that’s not it. That’s not it. Jennifer Palmieri: That is not it. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And for many of these battleground states, I will just tell you the internal polling had a significant swing. I’m not going to name which candidates, but there was internal polling, for example, that had a candidate who was two up before the debate, who’s three down after the debate. That’s five points swing. That is huge in a battleground state. And I -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. With a race like this where everything is so locked, that is a very big deal. Claire McCaskill: And if you’re campaigning in a tough state, one or two points is the world. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, I used to always say in my races, 46 is easy, 49 is really hard. I can get to 46 in my sleep. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: But 49 is really like climbing 16 Mount Everest. So two points is a huge thing to these battleground state Senate candidates. And Schumer is just carrying the data. He is doing what his job is, is representing millions of Americans who have elected these senators and these senators who want to be re-elected to give this information to the president United States. It’s not any more complicated than that. And I’ve never seen, never seen the kind of swings we now have in these battleground states where there’s an average of 12 points difference between Biden’s numbers and the Senate candidate numbers. That’s crazy time. You don’t see that. That is like the house is on fire we need another fire brigade here to put it out. So I just don’t think it’s fair to these leaders to be castigated the way they have by some in our party for doing their jobs. That’s all they’re doing is their jobs. They’re representing the people in their caucus. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And it’s not even just their jobs as like the Democratic leaders. It’s their jobs as constitutional officers. They are, you know, particularly in the House of Representatives, it is the people’s body. And Leader Jeffries is talking with every member of his caucus and they are representing what they’re polling is showing, but also just what they’re hearing in their districts. And these leaders are going to the president United States to, you know, this is how it’s supposed to work to say not just we have political concerns, but it’s like the stake of losing to Trump, if that’s a likelihood or real possibility, the stake of not having the House of Representatives or not having the Senate when you’re going to be dealing with a Trump administration. And I think that they have handled it so well. And, you know, trying to not inflict any damage on the president. Claire McCaskill: I also want to make this point. There is something that most, not all, but most of the people that are in elected positions that have come out full throated that Biden should not leave the ticket are in very safe seats. Jennifer Palmieri: You’re right. They’re in very safe seats. Claire McCaskill: They can’t imagine their wildest dreams ever being beaten by a Republican. And it is a different animal, I just tell you. All the people yelling at me doesn’t bother me because I’ve been yelled at for 40 years about half the people in my state. Jennifer Palmieri: Democrat in Missouri, man. What are you going to do? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, exactly. So the point is that if you are in a safe seat, it feels different to you than if you are battling out for every scrap of a vote you can get. And that’s how we make majorities. We make majorities in the middle. We don’t make majorities on the ends. We make it in swing districts in the House and we make it in states that are capable of voting for either D’s or R’s in the Senate. And that’s why this is also important. I mean, if we were in the room, obviously, the campaign -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- still needs to be doing contrast constantly. And they’re doing that -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- because we have to keep pushing how bad Trump is, because even if it is not Joe Biden, that message is universal to our party at this point. Jennifer Palmieri: And the thing is, the big thing I think that comes if I were in the room, the Republican convention started strong, but it ended with one conclusion. Wow, this guy is beatable, right? I mean, it was just Trump was so low energy, unfocused, if he can’t attack Biden, he has nothing to say. And you come out of it thinking like, wow, these guys offered nothing. He is unfocused and very beatable and just go after them hard on Project 2025, abortion and democracy. And, you know, the vice president, frankly, has been very effective in doing that. She could do that and the degree to which the president is if the president is staying in, just do that. Just talk about that. Make this a referendum on Trump. Yes, the Biden campaign has got a lot to be proud of, but like we don’t have time to do that anymore about accomplishments. It’s like go, go, go on the referendum on him. Claire McCaskill: Exactly. So we’re going to take a quick break here. When we’re back, Sam Stein, managing editor at “The Bulwark” joins us from Milwaukee to give his impressions of where this convention began and where it wound up. Back with Sam in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. This week, the 2024 Republican National Convention was in full swing in Milwaukee. But what a difference a week makes. Republicans now have a vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, and a very unified Republican Party that rallied around Trump as their guy and MAGA as their platform just days after the shocking attempt on his life. Claire McCaskill: So how did it wind up? Sam Stein has been on the ground in Milwaukee this week. I really feel like we don’t even need to introduce Sam Stein. Most of you know who he is. He is somebody who likes to talk about this stuff like we do and is very, very good at it. He had a front row seat at the convention and he joins us now. He is managing editor at “The Bulwark” and formerly “Politico’s” deputy managing editor for politics. He is also a fellow MSNBC contributor. So he knows why I have no makeup on today, because I have been up for “Morning Joe” and at 30 Rock until after midnight for several days in a row and I just went on strike this morning and said not an ounce of makeup is going to touch my face. Sam Stein: No, you look great, Claire. Jennifer Palmieri: You look great. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, okay. So, let’s talk about the convention. First of all, I want to start by quoting George Bush. That was some weird shit. George Bush from Trump’s 2020 or -- Sam Stein: 2016.   Jennifer Palmieri: 2017 inaugural. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- inaugural, exactly. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Claire McCaskill: So what was it like inside the hall? Did it feel as unified as it looked? Sam Stein: Yeah. I mean, yes, I can confirm it was weird shit, but in the hall it was a very unifying element to it. I mean, they adore the guy, right? Like it’s not just politics. There’s like, you know, there’s a culty element to it. And then obviously in the in the wake of this assassination attempt, there’s a religious element to it now in a way that really, you know, there had been some of that, but it’s been taken to a new level. And throughout the convention over the last three days, especially, you’ve seen people talk about Trump in these sort of providential tones, and which is ironic because the entire convention prior to the assassination attempt was structured to be very secular. Like they had pushed aside the social conservative agenda. They had very few speakers who were from the religious faiths. It was a really secular agenda. And then because of this, it became different. In terms of the mood inside the hall, I think, to a person, they basically are of the belief that he will win. The confidence level was oozing through the attendees. I spent a good chunk of yesterday just talking to delegates around the floor, asking them a very sort of simple, unscientific survey on a scale of one to ten, one being convinced he will lose and ten having the utmost certainty that he will win, where do you stand? Here’s some of the results. New York delegation. I got four 10s, one 12. Alabama delegation, two 10s, three 11s. Illinois delegation, a 12. Pennsylvania, three 10s and 11. I got a nine there. That was one of the two nines. Colorado, a nine, but only because they were worried it might be stolen. I mean, this is the stuff you’re talking about. And so, you know, it sets up the situation where basically people were having an incredibly joyous time. There were conga lines, dancing, things like that. Does that mean they’re overconfident? Maybe. Does it set up a situation where if they do lose that we have, you know, an incredibly suspicious and maybe angry electorate on that side? Yeah, it does. You know, I think Trump’s obviously the favorite candidate here, but I don’t think it’s out of the realm of reason that he could still lose this election. Jennifer Palmieri: And what about, I mean, it’s interesting to see what they presented and what they had planned to present, right? After the shooting, they said that they were going to have a, you know, a unity agenda. What’s his face? Who’s the doofus that’s like, yeah, they loaded my old speech. Sam Stein: Ron Johnson, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin had a fiery speech. Claire McCaskill: By the way, a really intellectual heavyweight. I can speak from serving with him. I mean, the saying, not the brightest light in the marquee was designed for him. Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s like, yeah, I had a toned down speech, but they didn’t load it into the teleprompter -- Sam Stein: They just put the wrong one in there. Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: They put the wrong one in there. Yeah. Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. So, what do you? They had a plan to do. Did they change it? And what actually happened? Because it kind of like, I’m not sure that anything emerged from this, any sort of compelling narrative emerged -- Sam Stein: Oh, no. Claire McCaskill: -- from this convention other than Trump was saved by the hand of God. Sam Stein: God, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: No, I totally agree with you, not just about Ron Johnson. I was struck by how little narrative there was or narrative arc there was. I mean, if you watch J.D. Vance’s speech, you know -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- I don’t know who put it together. It was disjointed. It went back and forth between his bio and random issues. And in Trump’s speech last night was long. There wasn’t really a credible thematic underpinning to it. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: I mean, this convention basically was, it was reshuffled because of what happened. The whole idea that it was a unity convention, I think is silly. The unity was -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- let’s unify as Republicans and be Democrats. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: That was the unity. Oh, the other unity was let’s drop these investigations and probes into my conduct for the good of the country. But if you had to pick out a couple of themes, I guess one was, you know, Trump is here to save us and the other was immigrants are bad. And -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- the entire speech last night, he kept coming back to immigrants. Like it didn’t matter the topic, you know, social security, immigrants are going to steal it from you. Jobs, immigrants are going to steal it from you. Fentanyl, immigrants are going to bring it to you. I mean, it was just a very nativist anti-immigrant speech. I think that’s, if you’re talking just pure policy, that is the one main through line for all of this stuff is we got to close the borders and we got to drill more oil. That’s it. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And, you know, it’s fascinating to me because maybe this is cause I’m a, I’m a woman that I felt this, and maybe I’m looking too carefully, but it felt like also there was a theme that, you know, let’s celebrate men. Sam Stein: Oh yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know, when Trump came out night before last to the theme, it’s a man’s world. And then that Hulk Hogan shit. Oh my God. And you know, it’s really hard for me, Sam, because I think of the Republican party conventions. I mean, I’ve gone to a lot of conventions, right? And I think frankly, mostly they’re a leftover artifice from another time that is unnecessary. And by the way, the numbers for this convention were not good in terms of people watching it. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, they thought they were getting young men by all of this macho shit. Young men weren’t watching. I got news for him. I looked at the numbers from the night J.D. Vance gave his speech. First of all, 5 million fewer viewers watched J.D. Vance than watched Pence in 2016. And secondly, the demographic, I mean, I think it was 14 million people for J.D. Vance and of that 14 million, 12 million of them were over 65. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Right. Claire McCaskill: So it gives you how skewed the audience that he was looking for was to older. And, you know, you would think they’d want to appeal to women at this point in some way, but instead -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- they are all in, and this has always been him, right? That I just need more MAGA. I don’t need to worry about suburban women. There’s two things that they didn’t want to talk about at this convention, Mike Pence and abortion. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: So, no, it’s such an astute observation. We had a story up yesterday from my colleague, Mark Caputo, and basically, you know, for like weeks and months, we’ve been consuming these stories that the Trump campaign is, you know, trying to win over African-Americans and Hispanics, and they’re making inroads into the coalition, but Mark’s piece was sort of a course corrector, and it was saying, no, in fact, they’re trying to juice white male turnout, like they think they can just absolutely juice white male turnout, and they had lost a little bit of the white male margins from 2016 to 2020, and they felt like that’s why Biden won, and maybe so. Claire McCaskill: Right. Sam Stein: And so they wanted to win those back. And this convention was essentially designed around that. Now, of course, don’t talk about abortion because you don’t want to cause harm to your campaign. But if you look at just the speaker lineup, Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Dana White, I mean, this is just let’s get like men to like salivate over this. The issues are what you point out, which is it’s not just white men. It’s sort of generationally how you divide those white men, right? Like older white men, younger white men. And if you’re banking a lot on younger white men to come out and vote for you, you have to be able to reach them. And that’s not always sure because young people don’t really pay attention to the stuff. The one place where I might add a caveat to what you said, Claire is on viewership. Yes, the numbers are down and I, you know, that’s clear. And yes, this is a relic of the past, but their sense, the Trump people sense is that people will view small, shorter packaged clips of this. The reason you have Hulk Hogan do the intro speak is not because you’re reaching people through TV and they’re going to see him. It’s because someone will package Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt on the convention floor to reveal Trump-Vance. And that will be shared in the mediums that younger white men get their news from as opposed to TV. And so that’s what they’re banking on. I do think there’s a little risk in saying, hey, we can reach these younger voters and turn them out. As you and Jen know, it’s like they don’t always vote. Claire McCaskill: It’s harder than it looks. Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It’s harder than it looks. We’re going to make you stick around for another segment here in a minute -- Sam Stein: Love it. Claire McCaskill: -- but we need to talk a little bit about J.D. Vance and you know, there is a, such a disconnect between Donald Trump doing an interview with “Business Insider” and the days before the convention, promising more corporate tax cuts, wanting to put a sign of Wall Street, the Secretary of Treasury, you know, speaking just to CEOs. I mean, he loves, he has always longed to be among those guys and he wants those guys, by and large, they are guys, to love him, the business community. And then you have J.D. Vance getting up there and basically saying, we are going to come and mesh you up Wall Street. We are in your face and you are done. I mean, how in the world do they sell? How does J.D. Vance get around the fact that what Trump talks about more than anything else is making sure he once again, lowers the corporate tax rate? Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: I don’t know. It’s been interesting to see them try to do this economic populist stuff while also keeping a foothold in the CEO world. As has been reported, CEOs, Fox News were not on the Vance train. They did not want him as the pick. They liked Doug Burgum. I think there’s obvious reasons why Vance doesn’t speak their language or at least doesn’t pretend to speak their language, but you know, Trump’s -- Claire McCaskill: He doesn’t pretend to speak their language is correct. Sam Stein: -- Trump is also like done this for eight years, right? He presents himself as the champion of the working man, but he doesn’t actually put together a policy portfolio that would suggest that’s what he wants. Of all the speakers this week that were intriguing to me, I thought it wasn’t Vance. It wasn’t Trump. It was Sean O’Brien. It was the Teamsters president who got up there and was talking about, you know, in roads with Republicans on working class issues. Every single Republican, including Vance, they don’t support the PRO Act. They didn’t support the bill, the COVID relief bill that included the massive pension relief for the Teamsters. I mean, I understand why Vance and Trump try to have it both ways. That’s sometimes what politicians do. And you try to win coalitions and try to bridge people together. What I don’t understand is how union leaders could pretend that that’s not happening. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And most of them aren’t. I mean, and even Sean O’Brien may end up endorsing the democratic ticket -- Sam Stein: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- whatever it may be. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And I think people are underestimating how much Sean O’Brien is playing inside politics within the Teamsters. Sam Stein: Interesting. Claire McCaskill: Sean O’Brien is trying to hold onto the presidency. I mean, once you get one of those jobs, man, you want to hold on to it tightly. And he has watched and he knows. The way you keep your membership supportive of you is to pay attention to the fact that he’s got a whole shitload of members who are Trumpers -- Sam Stein: Who like Trump. Claire McCaskill: -- who are Trumpers. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I think that was just a play for his membership, but ultimately I would be shocked if he endorses that ticket. Especially if we have a different ticket. Sam Stein: We’ll see. Claire McCaskill: We’ll see, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: All right. So we’re going to take a quick pause here, but Sam Stein is going to stick around. When we’re back, more on what the Republican convention reveals about the goals of the party and how the race is shaping up against what I want to charitably call the somewhat big mess on our side of the aisle. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. Sam Stein is still with us. Okay, Sam. So we are post-convention. It’s Friday morning. Beyond all of the unity and Kumbaya, there are some real issues in front of the voters this fall. So let’s talk through a few. Project 2025, abortion, and there seemed to be a full embrace of Trump’s criminal convictions painted both as a fighter and a victim. And then there’s the question of democracy. And would this coalition accept the results? So that’s kind of a little menu for us to dive through Project 2025. Did you feel like you saw an embrace of that, an attempt to distance it? Also, I don’t think, I mean, it matters to some degree, but the Democrats are definitely going to make them own Project 2025. And certainly the J.D. Vance pick sort of cements that. What’s your take? Sam Stein: There’s an obvious attempt to pretend as if that thing didn’t exist, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, right. Sam Stein: Complete disavowal prior to the convention, which of course had the, what is it, the Streisand effect or whatever it is, where you like just draw more attention to it. But, you know, I think the, the instructive case here is like how they put together their platform, which tells you everything about how they feel about policy. The platform was just completely shaved down into a page and a half or whatever. Jennifer Palmieri: That was pre-assassination attempt, right? Sam Stein: Yes, exactly. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Sam Stein: And you know, there was no mention of any of the social conservative issues. The abortion stuff was more or less put to the side. No, you can make the case that like Trump is acting astutely, right? That’s what you do when you want to win is you try to just hide -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: -- everything that’s bad and you tell your people to like go pound sand. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: And that’s what happened. And I was a little surprised at how little dissension was evident on ideological grounds here over the weekend, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: You know, obviously different times and different eras, but you know, 2016 convention Republican side was defined by people literally trying to stage, not a coup, but an insurrection against his nomination on the convention floor, right? And 2020 was defined by COVID, so that was totally weird, but you would expect to a degree that, you know, the pro-lifers here would have put up more of a fuss or that the hawks would have said, hey, why are we picking J.D. Vance? The guy basically wants to get out of, you know, and stop the fighting against Russia and Ukraine. None of that. And this just goes to show you that everything in this moment in time for Republican parties not have built around any sort of cohesive ideology. It’s built around, you know, appreciation for a personality. Jennifer Palmieri: And particularly since it was his third nomination -- Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: -- you know. I don’t think we appreciate that. I don’t know that that’s ever happened before that somebody has gotten three nominations in a row of a major political party. Sam Stein: There’s been Richard Nixon who had three conventions. I don’t think it was in a row. Jennifer Palmieri: But that you’d be like, okay, we have another shot at this. What’s the big agenda that we want to get through? The only speech that I felt hung together sort of thematically was Eric Trump’s. Sam Stein: Interesting. Jennifer Palmieri: Because Eric Trump gave the grievance speech. Sam Stein: Right, right. Jennifer Palmieri: Eric Trump gave the speech they normally would give, but I think they probably, because J.D. Vance’s speech didn’t hang together at all either. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Trump’s speech was like, not just a normal rally speech, but one of the lower energy rally speeches I’ve ever seen him give. And then J.D., I think maybe it was because they were trying to thread the needle of like not being too partisan and sowing too much division, but they don’t know how to do that. Like they have two speeds. Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Like low energy Trump or grievance Trump. Sam Stein: And the sort of other maybe slightly more charitable explanation is that they just didn’t want to rock the boat, right. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: They’re up. Don’t do anything provocative. Don’t like rail against political prosecutions, although that came up frequently, just play it safe. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: And when I was watching J.D.’s speech, that’s the first thing that came to my mind, you know, it’s like a football team playing sort of pre-event defense, right. It’s like -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: -- just don’t do something that might screw you up because we’re winning this thing. All we have to do is just let the conversation be about Biden. We don’t have to, you know, push any buttons. I mean, J.D.’s pick itself was not really an effort to expand the coalition. Claire McCaskill: No, not at all. Sam Stein: Right. So like, just keep doing what you’re doing. If you don’t make any major screw ups, you’ll be okay. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. I actually think that J.D. Vance was picked because it was the only person that Trump saw the kind of ability to do the rhetorical flamethrowing that has been the essence of his appeal to voters. His willingness to say out loud things that a typical presidential candidate would never say out loud is really what catapulted him into the initial nomination. And I think he sees that capability in J.D. Vance and all the rest of it, even though, you know, he hates the facial hair and probably is not really thrilled about the fact that he is married to the daughter of an immigrant, even though he happens to be married to the daughter of an immigrant. It really is interesting to me that this is more about him finding a personality that he thinks can eventually carry the personality driven nature of the new, not Republican party, but Trump party. Sam Stein: Right. And there’s also the grievance politics -- Claire McCaskill: Yes. Sam Stein: -- the anti-immigration politics. Claire McCaskill: The anger, the total anger. Sam Stein: Yes. Claire McCaskill: I mean, J.D. Vance is just a pissed off guy. Sam Stein: Yeah. He wasn’t always this way. I mean, this changed, obviously -- Claire McCaskill: No. Oh, no. Sam Stein: Yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, no. Sam Stein: And Vance also is really close with Trump’s kids. I mean, he’s gotten really tight with Don, Jr. He’s kind of come up in this new conservative media ecosystem. He’s not a Fox News person. He’s more of like a Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA person. I don’t know if that makes sense, but this is the other thing that was really striking about it, and I’ll bring it back to Vance here, is that the vestiges of the Republican party were evident. Like Fox News was not really the main media channel for this week, and it was a bunch of different influencers. You didn’t have George W. Bush. You didn’t have Dick Cheney. You didn’t have Paul Ryan. You didn’t have Mike Pence. They say it’s unity here, but it’s not. It’s been a purge. Claire McCaskill: Totally. Sam Stein: And Trump has remade this party. And in that context, the Vance pick makes a lot of sense. He’s not really like a classic Republican. He’s part of this new breed of Republicans who’ve been, in this case, opportunistically aligned himself with, but who have been influenced by Trump and Trump’s politics. And he doesn’t really wreak of establishment favor. And I think Trump was drawn to that. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Doug Burgum is definitely more of an establishment figure than J.D. Vance. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, it’s fascinating to me, and this is something that we maybe even ought to spend some time on in a future episode, but Peter Thiel. I think it’s really important for people to understand the invisible hand of Peter Thiel in this convention and in this man that is running to be president of the United States. I mean, Peter Thiel was really the first of now many bro brothers, tech billionaires that got on board with Trump. I mean, he actually spoke at the convention, I think, in ‘16 or -- Sam Stein: Yes, in ‘16. Claire McCaskill: -- I think he spoke in ‘16, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: Yes, he did. Claire McCaskill: And J.D. Vance is a creature. No, I should say it this way. J.D. Vance was created by Peter Thiel. Jennifer Palmieri: In his current incarnation. Claire McCaskill: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: After “Hillbilly Elegy” on, it’s been all Peter Thiel. Every job he’s had, every office he’s won, he was 100 percent got into the Senate because of Peter Thiel. He got Trump’s endorsement because of Peter Thiel. You know, look at Hulk Hogan. That’s a Peter Thiel guy. He funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker. Peter Thiel is everywhere in this. And, you know, for a party that wants to talk about populism, to have a billionaire behind the curtain pulling the levers of power like this is stunning to me. And there needs to be more exposure about Peter Thiel. People need to understand this guy has really got some juice. Sam Stein: Yeah. To your point, there’s also the tech bro culture that’s coming around to Trump. I mean, David Sacks. Like who knew -- Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- who David Sacks was six months ago? He got a speaking gig from the floor and yet they didn’t have like Mitt Romney or George Bush there, but David Sacks. And then, of course, what happened over the weekend was Elon Musk coming out and fully endorsing Trump and then reports emerging that he’s going to give $45 million a month to a super PAC supporting Trump. That’s real money, right? Like, so what does that mean for policy? What does that mean for the future of the country? We have not really fully comprehended what comes with that cash, basically. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and Marc Andreessen. Sam Stein: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, you know, people don’t know these names, but if you were from Silicon Valley and you understand where a lot of the money is in Silicon Valley, I mean, you can look around, whether it’s PayPal or Palantir or Facebook or, you know, any of the big names in tech, the big money, a lot of it now is totally on Trump. And it is fascinating to me. Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, not all of it. Not like, you know, like Apple and LinkedIn and, you know, Google and like -- Claire McCaskill: No, but you’re talking about a lot. Jennifer Palmieri: -- but like a lot. It’s the bro-y side. It’s the disruptors, the people like the Bitcoin people, the crypto people. It’s that crowd that like, you know, the Musk’s, those people. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: Right. But they see in Trump also kind of like, and this is such a classic 2016 trope, because this is what happened in 2016. They see in Trump kind of this empty vessel into which they can push their agenda. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: And we know this because they had Trump on that podcast that they all do. And then I think it was like a couple of days later, he comes out and he’s like, I’m fine with, you know, certain types of visas for immigrants because I talk to these guys and that’s what they want. Jennifer Palmieri: And he changed his position on crypto. Sam Stein: Exactly. And for them, you know, what a wonderful investment, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, right. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, right. Why not? Sam Stein: You get to have the potential president. And frankly, you know, you watch Trump and he’s more likely than not to win. You hedge your bets, right? Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Yeah. Sam Stein: You say, okay, maybe two years ago, they probably wouldn’t have done this because it was uncertain if Trump could win and they would have been socially cascaded and also been politically problematic to them. But now you can get your foot in the door. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: Okay. So let’s turn. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Go, Jen. It’s time for him to weigh in on what’s going to happen. Jennifer Palmieri: I’m going to use a listener question to do this. Sam Stein: Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Michelle, her question was just wondering if the concerns are more about Joe Biden not being able to win by a big enough margin than him not winning at all. I could see the logic being, quote, “We have to win big to rebuild trust in the elections,” end quote. So I think probably what’s embedded in Michelle’s question is like confusion that, you know, people are hearing Democrats, you know, very senior Democrats in the party thinking that Biden really needs to drop out and seeming that it’s likely that he will, or at least possible that he will, I should say. Sam Stein: Your feelings changed by the hour. Jennifer Palmieri: I’m just so wrecked by this whole like drama from the last three weeks because there’s sort of this dichotomy of like people who all they want to do is beat Trump and win the house and win the Senate thinking that he can’t win and then seeing polls that show, you know, the like percentile, like, oh, Biden’s got a 53% chance of winning. I think people are not saying like, I don’t understand why they’re so eager to push Biden out the door if the polls that I’m seeing in the public domain show that the race is still really close. And then what you think is going to happen? I mean -- Sam Stein: Well, let’s just set the stage for when we’re talking because it’s so dynamic that, you know, it could be outdated -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- in like 20 minutes. We’re sitting here Friday. It’s like 9:40 a.m., okay. I’m watching as I’m recording this, that Jen O’Malley Dillon’s on “Morning Joe” and she’s giving a forceful case that he’s not going anywhere. I mean, she has to give that case because as soon as you say, well, he’s open to it, then it’s done. But anyways, let’s put that aside. It’s been a very weird experience here in Milwaukee because obviously everyone’s following what’s happening on the Republican side. There’s a whole convention going on in the city. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: But to a person, every journalist here is riveted by what’s happening on the Democratic side. And half of the reporters here are actually here in Milwaukee reporting on Democratic politics and I’m among them. I’ve been spending the last three days just calling people in the party. And look, to a person, people are freaked out. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: They think that this is not going to end well. They think there’s different degrees of not ending well, right? Like most people I talk to in high ranks and Democratic circles think Biden will likely lose. They don’t think it’s a certainty that he will lose, but it’s like fairly certain. Jennifer Palmieri: And explain why they think that because of the, the internal polling in the battleground states -- Sam Stein: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: -- because I think that we don’t get to this level of discussion on cable, frankly. Sam Stein: Right. So there’s a two reasons, right? Like, so you see these national polls, you’re like, oh, well, he’s got a fighter’s chance. You see these FiveThirtyEight models. You’re like, well -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: -- that’s really interesting. He’s actually favored. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: And then you have to step back and say, okay, the national polls are pretty relevant. We don’t choose presidents by a national popular vote. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Sam Stein: The FiveThirtyEight model takes into account things like historical incumbency advantages and macroeconomic conditions, which, fine, great. Like that’s helpful, but it’s not going to be determinative. Professor Alan Lichtman, who I’ve seen a lot thrown around -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- like he’s got 13 principles for the presidency and yet they’ve lined up most of the time, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be tried and true. So the real sort of bread and butter that I come back to are two things. One is state polls. They’re bad. They’re just bad for Biden -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- and they’ve gotten worse. And I think people need to understand when you’re talking about like three degree, three percentage points worse in state polls, that’s not nothing. That’s a lot, especially in a polarized country. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. That’s why Hillary lost. With three percentage points in polls across the board, like everything dropped by three points. Sam Stein: And so if you started pre-debate already slightly down and you’re now three percentage points, even more down, it just means you have to make up more ground. And here’s where number two comes in, which is there would be more confidence that he could make up ground if not for the fact that the debate was a disaster. And since then, he’s had decent episodes, but he’s also had bad episodes. Jennifer Palmieri: He’s had some bad episodes. Sam Stein: Yeah. And if you’re playing with a hand, that’s not great. The question is, do you change your hand? And so when everyone’s like, well, you know, the vice president doesn’t pull that much better. True. But she’s also got more tools and toolkit. And secondarily, this is what I’m hearing a lot more of is the psychic relief that you would get throughout the party in having that change, having a more deft candidate at the top of the ticket. And then being also able to say this argument about, you know, old candidates who are feeble and can’t handle the job. Like, we can now win this argument. I mean, look at Trump’s speech last night. Like, why can’t we have someone who’s like, actually, no-- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- we’ve made the tough choices. We have a younger candidate who’s generationally more attuned to modern America, and it’s their side that has the candidate who is meandering and out of touch and just gave an hour and a half speech on the convention that made no sense at times. And like, yeah, that’s the case for making the switch. I can also understand the case for not making the switch, but I think it’s less compelling. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And I do think people, you know, the emotional narrative, even if you are 100% in favor of Biden staying at the top of the ticket, you are holding your breath. And what our party has this cycle that we’ve not had in previous cycles is we have Donald Trump on the other side. And I truly believe that if Biden does step down, I truly believe that the emotional relief that people who hate Donald Trump will feel about having a candidate they’re more confident of, even if they are still angry that Biden’s not there, I actually believe that, assuming it’s Kamala Harris, which it should be, would come out of the convention ahead, and I think she’d stay there. Sam Stein: And not only that. I’ve been talking to donors and operatives who work with donors. Biden’s money troubles are about to be very pronounced. Claire McCaskill: Done. Done. Sam Stein: I mean, there are some serious problems there. Conversely, they say if, you know, they made a switch and it was Harris and I’m with you, Claire -- Claire McCaskill: It’s going to rain. Sam Stein: -- the amount of cash that would come in in those first three days would be astronomical. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: And not that cash is everything, but it matters a lot. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Sam Stein: It really does. And look, the party’s in a really tough spot. None of us have experienced anything like this. Jennifer Palmieri: None. Claire McCaskill: No. Sam Stein: And you wake up, I don’t know if this is for you, but I wake up, I’m like, Biden’s going to stick it out. And every night I go to bed, I’m like, there’s no way he’s going to stick it out. Claire McCaskill: I know. Jennifer Palmieri: Well, or whatever it is every day, I mean, it’s been humbling for certain, you know, to like not make predictions, to not, you know -- Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- understand like we’re living in unprecedented times -- Sam Stein: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- and like you can’t know and it’s up to one person and it’s a very tough call. Sam Stein: That convention will be truly interesting. I’m -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Sam Stein: -- somewhat excited for it. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. That will matter. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I was dreading going and now I’m, you know -- Sam Stein: No, no, no. You got to go. Claire McCaskill: I’m excited. Jennifer Palmieri: I wasn’t going to go. Now I’m going to go. Sam Stein: Hell yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. All right. Well, listen, you’re the best, Sam. We are grateful for you to come and hang out with us for a while. Hopefully you can get a chance -- Sam Stein: Anytime. Invite me back. Please. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, no, we will for sure.

Will the Supreme Court justices save Sen. Bob Menendez after his corruption verdict?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/bob-menendez-verdict-supreme-court-corruption-rcna162743,"After he was found guilty on all counts in his federal corruption trial this week, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., expressed confidence that he’ll be vindicated on appeal. At first blush, it’s tempting to cast his stated optimism as wishful thinking from someone fighting for his political and legal future. But the Supreme Court’s decisions siding with defendants in past political corruption cases render Menendez’s legal fate an open question. While the precise appellate issues in his case will take shape once his appeal gets underway, consider some of the high court’s recent decisions in other cases. Just this term, the Republican-appointed majority curbed use of federal bribery law against state and local officials, over dissent that argued the majority was dishonoring congressional intent to punish public corruption. This term’s breakdown aside, siding with defendants in these cases has been a bipartisan effort from the justices. Last year, the court unanimously threw out fraud convictions from New York. In 2020, Justice Elena Kagan wrote the unanimous ruling doing the same for convictions stemming from the Bridgegate scandal. Likewise, the court unanimously narrowed federal corruption prosecutions in its 2016 decision siding with former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. Against that backdrop, Menendez may have reason to hope that he becomes one of the next politicians to benefit from this line of jurisprudence. But an equally notable aspect of his guilty verdicts — for bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent and other crimes — is that the government secured them in spite of the high bar for federal prosecutors set by the Supreme Court over the years. So this may present a political corruption conviction that even the justices let stand. But it could be years before we know the answer.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warns anti-Biden Democrats about what comes next if they succeed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/aoc-biden-nomination-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-rcna162761,"UPDATE: (July 22, 2024, 7:36 a.m. ET): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced he's withdrawing from the 2024 race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Later Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pledged her ""full support"" for Harris. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has issued a dire warning to her party about the chaos that could ensue if they succeed in pushing President Joe Biden off the ticket. And she criticized Democrats who’ve given off-the-record quotes that suggest the party has resigned itself to a second Trump term.  In an Instagram Live video on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez warned liberals that a brokered convention could lead to chaos, in part because she says some of the Democratic “elites” who want Biden out also don’t want Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee in his place.  “If you think that is going to be an easy transition, I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class and these elites who are pushing for the president not to be the nominee also do not want to see the VP be the nominee,” she said.  Ocasio-Cortez claimed none of the people she’s spoken with who are calling on Biden to drop out — including lawmakers and legal experts — have articulated a plan to swap out the nominee without minimizing the serious legal and procedural challenges that are likely to ensue.  Ocasio-Cortez also highlighted the racial, ethnic and class divisions that appear to have formed between the majority of those pining to blow up the ticket — led mostly by white Democrats and media pundits — and those elected officials who feel they and their constituents have too much at stake to upend the process at this point and so are willing to do the work to re-elect Biden-Harris. She alluded to this cultural divide in her video when she spoke out against anonymous sources expressing a sense of fatalism on behalf of Democrats about what might happen if Biden remains on the ticket:  The important context here is that Ocasio-Cortez represents a majority-minority district, where a large number of her constituents are foreign-born. Earlier this week, I noted similar criticism voiced in a letter from the voter advocacy group Black Voters Matter that denounced some Democrats’ haphazard effort to overrule primary voters, oust Biden and potentially leapfrog Harris as the obvious second-in-line to be the party’s nominee. Part of that criticism stemmed from the fact that mobilizing Biden-Harris voters to cast a ballot for an entirely new set of nominees would most likely prove difficult. And the criticism didn’t end there. In fact, hours before Ocasio-Cortez's post to Instagram on Thursday, more than 1,400 Black women who are activists signed a separate letter calling out Democrats who are seeking to push Biden out and install someone other than Harris atop the ticket.  Democrats ought to heed these warnings and cease their hasty effort to oust Biden (or, failing that, to push aside Harris in the process) at the risk of fomenting resentment among voting blocs that are essential to their electoral goals.

Ben Sasse resigns as University of Florida president after wife's epilepsy diagnosis,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 1:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/ben-sasse-resign-university-florida-president-wife-rcna162745,"Ben Sasse, a former Republican senator who represented Nebraska for eight years, said he will resign as University of Florida president at the end of this month to spend more time with his wife, who has been struggling with medical issues. “In recent months, Melissa has been diagnosed with epilepsy and has been struggling with a new batch of memory issues,” he said Thursday in a statement. “It’s been hard, but we’ve faced it together.” Sasse was appointed president in November 2022 and took office in February 2023. The university said its board of trustees will announce an interim president and start the search for a new president. Sasse detailed his wife’s recovery from past medical conditions, including an aneurysm and series of strokes in 2007, calling her “the strongest person I know” and a “warrior.” But, he said in his statement, her recent diagnosis has led to “a lot of late nights, a lot of hard decisions, and a lotta ‘what matters most?’ conversations.” Sasse, 52, said that his duties to his family and the university “are significantly at odds with each other right now.” “Gator Nation needs a president who can keep charging hard, Melissa deserves a husband who can pull his weight, and my kids need a dad who can be home many more nights,” he said. The couple has three children, two college-aged and one turning 13, Sasse said in his statement. He was in the Senate from 2015 to 2023. As a senator, Sasse reliably sided with Trump-backed bills, but he was a vocal critic of the former president, whom he once called “needy and desperate.” He was one of seven Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump in the Senate over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Sasse’s appointment at UF was not without controversy. His opposition to same-sex marriage in 2015 came under scrutiny, and critics said the selection process was not transparent enough. Yet he couldn’t stay away from politics as university president. In September, The New York Times reported on Sasse serving as a ""combatant"" in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' war on public education. In March, the university ended all positions focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as DEI-related contracts."
A chilling pattern at the RNC reveals what the Republican party has become,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 12:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-disturbing-anti-immigration-rhetoric-rcna162637,"In his rambling acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee Thursday night, former President Donald Trump unsurprisingly doubled down on anti-immigrant messaging, saying things like: “You know who’s taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens.” But throughout the four-day convention, a distinct and disturbing pattern emerged when it came to discussing immigration onstage: First, there’d be someone using violent rhetoric against migrants; then there’d emerge a Latino or Latina Republican to give the party cover. Take, for example, former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro, who spoke at the convention hours after being released Wednesday from a Miami federal prison, where he served a sentence for contempt of Congress. “Joe and Kamala, they threw out the woke blue carpet across the Rio Grande, opened our borders, to what? Murderers and rapists,” Navarro said, adding that when Trump called Mexicans “rapists” in 2015, he was viewed as racist. “We read the papers,” Navarro said. “It’s murderers and rapists. Drug cartels. Human traffickers. Terrorists. Chinese spies. And a whole army of illiterate illegal aliens stealing the jobs of Black, brown and blue-collar Americans.” At the RNC, facts were damned. Despite what Navarro and others said, there is no “migrant crime surge.” But according to Trump and Republicans, migrants are the country’s greatest security threat. Right after Navarro spoke, Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, took the stage. The juxtaposition was clear. A Latina Republican was there to give permission to the audience — both in the arena and watching from afar — to accept and validate what Navarro had just said. “I am the proud granddaughter of Mexican farmworkers, who came here with little more than faith in God,” De La Cruz began her remarks. “They never had much money, but they instilled in us strong Texas values. They taught me that through hard work, anything is possible in America.” “I’m living proof that the American Dream, el sueño americano, can become reality,” De La Cruz added. Later, she claimed that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “say their immigration policies are compassionate, but there is nothing compassionate about open borders. They threaten our national security and flood our country with deadly drugs, killing our precious children. Biden and Harris don’t care about immigrants, They just use them for political gain.” After Trump was shot Saturday, just two days before the start of the convention, Republicans promised to tone down their violent rhetoric. But clearly an exception was made for migrants, the vast majority of whom come from Latin American countries. As Navarro spoke, for example, convention attendees were waving “Mass Deportation Now!” signs.   This is what the Republican Party has become in 2024: Rattle the cage with fears of “invasions,” while positioning enough Latinos on stage to say there is nothing to see here. But the anti-immigrant agenda is blatant. See the first two items in the preamble of the official 2024 RNC program: “SEAL THE BORDER AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION” and “CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.” It should scare us all. The prospect of millions of people being rounded up and forcefully deported would be yet another dark stain on American history, just like slavery, the Trail of Tears, Japanese internment camps or the “Operation Wetback” efforts of the 1950s. A mass deportation plan would be a logistical nightmare and incredibly expensive, too. But this has not and will not detract Republicans, who appear more united on the call to “Send them back!” than on toning down the violent immigration rhetoric. It certainly has not inspired work on a realistic fix to this country’s failed bipartisan plans to finally achieve comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans worked hard during the convention to divide Latinos between those who came into this country “the right way” and those who didn’t. The Trump camp emphasized that theme last year during a controversial Univision interview, an emphasis that proves the “Latino Americans for Trump” rebrand outreach was more than just a change of semantics. Linda Fornos, who said she came to Nevada from Nicaragua 60 years ago and regrets voting for Biden in 2020, proclaimed from the RNC stage that “it’s upsetting to see millions of dollars being sent to help immigrants who came here illegally, while hard-working families who did it the right way are left struggling.” Peruvian American Vanessa Faura said that living under a Biden-Harris administration “feels more and more like I’m back in Latin America.” Faura left Peru when she was 9 years old.  Colombian American Bernie Moreno, the Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio, made sure he started his remarks by saying, “Many years ago, my parents brought me and my siblings to America legally.” In the eyes of Trump supporters, migrants lack humanity and are “poisoning the blood of our country.” A goal of the convention was to convince us that there are enough Republican allies from Latino communities who agree that mass deportation is the only solution and favor reducing immigration. This week, the White House posted on X that unlawful border crossings “dropped more than 50%.” Biden’s historic announcement to provide a legal pathway to undocumented spouses of American citizens will become reality on Aug. 19, days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His Covid diagnosis didn’t allow him to promote this game-changing policy at the UnidosUS conference this week, but the DNC has a massive opportunity to present a more accurate picture of what immigrants have done to benefit the United States. They have a duty to put a face to these individuals, who are big drivers in saving the country’s economy and reducing inflation. That narrative will provide a necessary counter to what was a week of straight-up migrant bashing from Republicans. "
Speaker Mike Johnson has an unfortunate fondness for ‘intuition’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 10:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-mike-johnson-unfortunate-fondness-intuition-rcna162752,"As part of Fox Business’ coverage of the Republican National Convention, Maria Bartiromo sat down with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who claimed that officials believe there are now “terrorist cells set up around the country.” Not surprisingly, the host asked how many. “I don’t know,” the Louisiana Republican replied. “It’d be conjecture on my part, but intuitively we know that this is a serious problem.” This made far less sense than Congress’ top Republican official seemed to realize. First, he doesn’t need to speculate: As the House speaker, Johnson receives briefings on sensitive, highly classified security information. If he’s learned about “terrorist cells set up around the country,” he could speak to the problem with authority. Instead, the GOP leader decided it’d be responsible simply to speculate on national television about a terrorist threat based on what people “intuitively” know. Second, information about terrorist cells is not something that people can “intuitively” know. It simply falls outside of what “intuition” means: No one has instincts about the existence of terrorists forming groups and/or networks on domestic soil. People in positions of power either have seen evidence or they haven’t. It's not the sort of thing someone can know by way of a gut feeling. But as relevant as these details are, there’s a larger problem: Johnson's reference to what is “intuitively” known is part of an unfortunate pattern. After Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat, for example, Johnson insisted that “a lot of us know intuitively” that there were problems with the process. After the Senate rejected the House’s impeachment effort against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Johnson said “know already intuitively” that Mayorkas “had a fantastical breach of duty.” When the House speaker unveiled legislation to ban non-citizens from voting — which is already illegal, and which effectively never happens — Johnson declared at a press conference, “We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections.” What we’re dealing with is a Republican leader who appears to rely on “intuition” a bit too much. Time and again, Johnson lacks the evidence to support his beliefs, so he references “intuition” as if it were a legitimate substitute for knowledge. It’s not."
"Barron Trump, initially expected at the RNC, was nowhere to be seen",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 10:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/barron-trump-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162711,"The Trump family, dressed in red, white and blue, showed up in force on the last night of the Republican National Convention on Thursday. But as Donald Trump delivered what would be the longest-ever convention acceptance speech, one person conspicuously missing at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee was his youngest son, Barron Trump. ""We love our Barron,"" Trump said in his speech. But the 18-year-old did not join his father and siblings as they walked onto the convention floor during the event, nor was he seen with his mother, Melania Trump, who entered the VIP box by herself to applause. He was also absent when the family took the stage after the speech. The youngest Trump son attended the RNC in 2016 and 2020. NBC News reported in May that he had been included as an at-large delegate by the Florida Republican Party, but two days later, he declined the role through his mother's office. “While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines due to prior commitments,” Melania Trump said in the statement. Barron Trump, who graduated from high school this year, did recently feature at one of his dad's campaign events. At a rally in Florida earlier this month, Trump introduced his youngest son to supporters. ""You're pretty popular,"" Trump told him as the crowd cheered. With Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump looking on, he added: ""He might be more popular than Don and Eric."""
How Clarence Thomas and Aileen Cannon may help Hunter Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 10:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/hunter-biden-aileen-cannon-clarence-thomas-rcna162689,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon broke new ground this week when she dismissed Donald Trump’s classified documents case on the rationale that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed. Now, Hunter Biden wants the same treatment for his criminal cases brought by another special counsel, David Weiss. Biden’s success is far from guaranteed, partly because Trump’s ultimate success isn’t guaranteed. Cannon’s trial-level ruling only applies to Trump’s case, and if she’s reversed on appeal then it won’t even affect Trump’s case. Smith is challenging Cannon’s ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and whichever side loses in the appeals court is likely to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. A Supreme Court ruling could set a nationwide standard applying to both defendants. At least one justice, Clarence Thomas, is poised to agree with Cannon if the Supreme Court rules on the issue. In the Trump immunity case earlier this month, Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion that questioned the lawfulness of Smith’s appointment. Cannon cited Thomas’ concurrence to support her dismissal of the classified documents case on Monday. No other justice joined Thomas’ concurrence, but Smith’s appointment wasn’t at issue in the immunity case, so we don’t know what a majority of the court would do if the appointment issue were squarely presented. That is, just because Thomas was the only one to raise it in the immunity case doesn’t mean that the Supreme Court would therefore side with Smith 8-1 on the appointment issue. Like Cannon’s trial-level ruling, Thomas’ solo concurrence isn’t binding. But as a Supreme Court justice, his view will ultimately be more important than Cannon’s for the legality of special counsels generally. There are also distinctions between Smith and Weiss that could lead to different outcomes for Trump and Biden. One of the defense criticisms of Smith is that he wasn’t appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Weiss was. That distinction doesn’t necessarily end the analysis, however, because the issue that Cannon and Thomas raised goes to the heart of Attorney General Merrick Garland’s statutory authority (or lack thereof) to appoint special counsels. That could doom Weiss as well as Smith if a Supreme Court majority heeds Cannon’s and Thomas’ view.   Biden’s lawyers make that point in their motion to dismiss on Thursday, writing that Garland “relied upon the exact same authority to appoint the Special Counsel in both the Trump and Biden matters, and both appointments are invalid for the same reason.” He was found guilty of gun-related charges last month in Delaware and hasn’t been sentenced yet. He also faces separate tax charges brought by Weiss in California and his lawyers have raised the appointment issue there in an effort to get those charges dismissed, too. It may take a while before the final impact, if any, of Cannon’s and Thomas’ opinions are fully realized in the Trump and Biden cases. Weiss will respond before trial judges rule in Delaware and California. Both of those federal trial courts fall under different federal circuits from one another and from the 11th Circuit, which covers Florida and will review Cannon’s ruling. Whatever happens in the lower courts, the Supreme Court may have the last word — and while we don’t know what that last word would be, a Trump win wouldn’t necessarily be a win for the president’s son.

The Republican National Convention offered Russia a lot to like,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 9:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-national-convention-offered-russia-lot-rcna162728,"Shortly before last month’s presidential debate, NBC News reported on a network of pro-Kremlin social media accounts that were “attempting to spread false narratives” to help Donald Trump. The Wall Street Journal added soon after that Vladimir Putin’s government has launched a “whole of government” effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and return the Republican to power. As recently as last weekend, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the Kremlin rushed to echo far-right talking points in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt, suggesting that Democrats bore responsibility for the gunman. And then the Republican National Convention got underway, at which point the public was reminded why Russia is so eager to help the party win. On the opening night of the convention, for example, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene delivered remarks condemning Democrats for a bipartisan bill intended to “secure Ukraine’s borders.” Also on Monday night, tech investor David Sacks delivered remarks and insisted that Biden “provoked — yes, provoked — the Russians to invade Ukraine with talk of NATO expansion.” Trump then tapped Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — one of Congress’ fiercest opponents of U.S. security aid to Ukraine — for the party’s ticket, which was a move that drew praise from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. As the convention neared its end, attendees heard from far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, who also took the opportunity to push a message that was likely well received in Moscow. As NBC News reported: “We know where the drugs are coming from. We know the supply routes,” Carlson declared from the stage. “You don’t see our commander in chief suggesting that we use our military to protect our country or the lives of its citizens? No, that’s for Ukraine. And it’s too much. Actually, it’s too insulting. It’s too insulting. It’s a middle finger in the face of every American. It’s a very clear statement which is unmistakable, and that is ‘we don’t care about you.’” Soon after, Trump, a benefactor of Russia’s earlier electoral assistance, accepted his party’s presidential nomination. It stands to reason that Putin was pleased with how things went in Milwaukee this week."

'Twisters' doesn't mention climate change. That's just the first problem.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 8:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/twisters-review-climate-change-missing-storm-sequel-rcna162322,"The new movie ""Twisters"" finally provides an answer to the age-old joke about how everyone talks about the weather but nobody ever does anything about it. While the storm chasers of the 1996 original drove after tornadoes in order to study them, the reboot ups the stakes: stronger storms — including one filled with columns of fire — and heroes who have a so-crazy-it-just-might-work plan to stop them. It makes for a fun two hours, but it leaves us a little worse off when we leave the theater. The first problem starts with those stronger storms, which one character laments are ""getting worse every year"" and an actual Oklahoma TV meteorologist describes in a cameo as a ""once-in-a-generation tornado outbreak."" That's a phrase that may already need to be retired, as we have seen ""once-in-a-generation"" winter storms, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts and windstorms in recent years amid signs that these won't be one-off events. The most likely cause is two words you won't hear in the movie: climate change. Now, to be clear, scientists remain uncertain of the links between climate change and tornadoes. As climate scientists Hope Jahren and Kerry Emanuel explained to me, we know that large outbreaks of tornadoes and off-season tornadoes are increasing but not why, and there is much less certainty than there is with the links between climate change and hurricanes, for example. That's how science works. But in the real world, one of these characters might, you know, mention it as a possibility? Especially when the mother of one of the heroes says storms and floods are becoming more common and wheat and seed are getting more expensive. Not to be a backseat screenwriter here, but maybe two characters could argue about it briefly? And then kiss? I dunno. This summer movie stuff doesn't seem that hard. In case you think I'm imagining things, director Lee Isaac Chung has made it clear that it was a deliberate choice not to mention climate change. “I wanted to make sure that we are never creating a feeling that we’re preaching a message, because that’s certainly not what I think cinema should be about,” he told CNN. “I think it should be a reflection of the world.” Look, if I'd just been handed $200 million to make a summer movie, I'd be pretty cautious about not offending anyone, too, and no one likes a preachy blockbuster, especially on a subject that so many politicians insist isn't a real problem. We're not expecting Hollywood to make a fictionalized version of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" here. Tornadoes bad; pickup trucks good. We get it. But a moment of introspection wouldn't kill the movie, either. Even if viewers make the connection themselves, the movie fails in a second and more crucial way. (Spoiler ahead, but I promise it's not about any part of the movie you'll care about.) The film's heroine, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, is a scientist who has developed a Mark Rober-like machine that can shrink tornadoes by filling them with tiny balls of superabsorbent polymer. Her plan fails, and she retreats to the relative safety of New York City until she gets a second chance with a tornado-chasing social media influencer, played by Glen Powell, and uses rockets filled with silver iodide to precipitate the moisture first and save the day. You've seen this plot point before: Check the alluvial dampers! Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow! Cross the proton streams! Scan the quantum fissure using a subspace differential pulse! Again, I get it. You've written the heroes of your $200 million summer blockbuster into a corner, and you need some kind of deus ex machina to save the day. They can't just drive their pickup next to a supercell tornado and post YouTube videos about it while innocent Oklahomans die all around them. The problem is that this kind of magical thinking has infected how we approach climate change in the real world, too. Sure, we could reduce greenhouse gases by building more solar and wind power, subsidizing electric cars and e-bikes, improving mass transit, stopping deforestation and planting more trees, improving agricultural techniques or adding a price to carbon and letting the market sort it out. But what if, instead, some people suggest, we put a giant solar shade in outer space? Or dump tons of iron dust into the ocean? Or build a machine that vacuums carbon out of the atmosphere? Or paint all the rooftops white? Or even an entire mountain? Or spray sulfur dioxide particles into the stratosphere? Or throw a bunch of tiny glass beads on the ice caps? Or just build machines to create more ice? I'm not saying these ideas wouldn't work or that we shouldn't study them. But too often they seem to be proposed as a shortcut to doing the hard work to slow climate change, an Ozempic for the Earth. And that's ultimately the problem with ""Twisters,"" a movie that says tornadoes are getting worse without ever naming a possible cause and presents as its only solution a bunch of technobabble. Maybe we were better off when all the movie characters did was talk about the weather."
"After shooting, Team Trump keeps medical care info under wraps",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shooting-team-trump-keeps-medical-care-info-wraps-rcna162705,"When the White House announced on Wednesday that President Joe Biden had tested positive for Covid, his team issued a written statement noting his symptoms and self-isolation plans. It was accompanied by a message from the Democrat’s physician describing Biden’s condition in more detail, including information about the president’s respiratory rate, temperature and pulse oximetry. A day later, the White House issued another letter from Biden’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, with updated information about the president’s symptoms, condition and treatment plan, as well as assurances about additional updates. This is, of course, precisely what one would expect from an operation that believes transparency, especially about health matters, is important. It also stands in contrast to Biden’s Republican rival. The Associated Press reported: The AP’s report quoted Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at The George Washington University, saying, “It’s an understatement to say that it’s bizarre that a presidential candidate has sustained an injury from an attempted assassination and no medical report is issued to describe his evaluation and the extent of his injury.” I’m mindful of the fact that there are plenty of conspiracy theories surrounding Saturday’s shooting, none of which have been substantiated with any credible evidence. One need not take those theories seriously, however, to wonder why Team Trump has been reluctant to share basic medical information about such a serious matter. Recent history doesn’t help matters. The Republican, for example, has long adopted a rather untraditional approach to sharing information about his medical exams. Indeed, it started before he took office. As regular readers may recall, in late 2015, during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Team Trump released an unintentionally hilarious, four-paragraph letter from the late Dr. Harold Bornstein, asserting that Trump’s “physical strength and stamina are extraordinary” and his lab tests results were “astonishingly excellent.” The doctor added at the time, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” We learned several months later that Bornstein wrote the letter in five minutes while a limo, dispatched by Trump, waited for the document. In the years that followed, disclosures did not improve. Last fall, Trump released the first updated report on his health in more than three years, but it came by way of a statement issued by one of his golf club customers, and it omitted basic details such as his blood pressure and medications. It’s against this backdrop that Team Trump also hasn’t provided the public with information about the Republican nominee’s medical care in the wake of Saturday’s shooting. There might be a benign explanation for this lack of transparency, but for now, I have no idea what it is."
Democratic effort to nudge Biden off ticket appears to gain momentum,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 7:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democratic-effort-nudge-biden-ticket-appears-gain-momentum-rcna162699,"A couple of days ago, the public saw multiple reports about Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — Congress’ top two Democrats — having taken steps to encourage President Joe Biden to forgo his re-election plans. There was related reporting that House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi has also privately told Biden “that she and other Democratic lawmakers worry that he’s dragging down the party.” A day later, however, the reports were considerably worse for the incumbent president. The Washington Post, for example, reported that Barack Obama has “told allies in recent days that President Biden’s path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy.” The public also learned about a letter Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin sent to the president, suggesting he step aside. The Post also reported that Pelosi has told some House Democrats she believes Biden “can be persuaded fairly soon to exit the presidential race amid serious doubts he can win in November,” which dovetailed with a New York Times report that said several people close to the president said that they believe “he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race.” Unfortunately for the incumbent, there’s more. Bloomberg News reported that some members of Biden’s White House Cabinet have also had “private discussions among themselves” about whether to “reckon with him” about his electoral future. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the number of Democratic members calling on the president to pass the torch keeps growing — in both chambers — and even the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been unyielding in its support for Biden, acknowledged that “things are fluid.” In case this weren’t quite enough, The Wall Street Journal highlighted a polling report from Blue Rose Research, a Democratic firm, which found Biden losing every battleground state, and struggling in New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia, Maine, and even New Jersey — states he won with ease four years ago. And yet, despite all of this, as the day came to an end, the Biden campaign sent out talking points that read in part, “The president is his party’s nominee. ... He’s running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.” Technically, that wasn’t true — the party’s nominee will be chosen at the convention, which is still weeks away — but the statement nevertheless indicated Team Biden isn’t prepared to look for an offramp, at least not yet. It was against this backdrop that NBC News reported that Biden “feels personally hurt and betrayed by the way so many Democrats, including some of the party’s top leaders, have left him hung out to dry.” The same report quoted a source close to the president who appeared eager to lash out at Democratic leaders. As much as I can appreciate Team Biden's frustrations, as a rule, when campaigns are behind, and the team reaches an everyone-is-wrong-except-us stage, that’s not great. Complicating matters, when a Democratic incumbent’s political operation is lashing out at Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer — blaming them for Trump — that’s not great, either. And finally, when Biden demands to see polling evidence that he’s losing, only to have his team say that “polls are BS” when the data says he's losing, that’s also not great."
"At Republican convention, Tucker Carlson completes transformation",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 6:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-convention-tucker-carlson-completes-transformation-rcna162691,"We don’t need to wonder what Tucker Carlson genuinely believed about Donald Trump after the Republican’s 2020 defeat because we already know. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem noted last year, the since-settled Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News produced a treasure trove of communications from the network’s hosts, including candid messages from Carlson that his viewers weren’t aware of in real time. In early January 2021, for example, Carlson texted, “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait.” He added soon after, “I hate him passionately,” and he confessed that he “can’t handle much more of this.” This came on the heels of Carlson telling a colleague, in reference to Trump, “What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that.” The former Fox host went on to say that he found it “disgusting” how many Americans believe Trump’s rhetoric. Reflecting on Trump’s failed term, Carlson also wrote, “We’re all pretending we’ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it’s been is too tough to digest. ... But come on. There isn’t really an upside to Trump.” That was three and a half years ago. A lot has changed since. In fact, Carlson has not only taken his shtick online, he’s also managed to position himself as an influential ally to the Republican he hated “passionately.” It was Carlson who helped Trump choose his running mate. It was Carlson who seemed to be having a grand time at the Republican convention. And as a New York Times report noted, it was Carlson who made a return to prime time with remarks at the Republican National Convention. To be sure, more than a few prominent Republican voices have made the transition from Trump critic to Trump sycophant. In fact, I’m aware of only one current member of the U.S. Senate who has characterized Trump as “America’s Hitler,” and the former president just tapped him as his running mate. Has Carlson experienced a genuine change of heart, or is he opportunistically sailing on the prevailing winds in Republican Party politics? Only the right-wing host knows for sure, though his 2021 messages seem to offer a hint. Either way, however, a HuffPost report raised a point that stood out for me. We don’t know who the president will be next year, but if it’s Trump, it’s safe to say Carlson will have walk-in privileges in the Oval Office, his 2021 assessments notwithstanding."
Trump's speech veered from somber to maudlin to unhinged,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 6:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-acceptance-speech-tone-rcna162414,"On Thursday night, my party bent the knee and enthusiastically nominated a man convicted of numerous felonies for president of the United States. In a Milwaukee convention hall full of activists and party loyalists whom I have known for years, there were also election deniers, organizers of the fake electors scheme and active participants in the insurrection against our nation on Jan. 6. Then, in that most poignant of moments when a political party says “here is the best among us that we have to offer for service to our nation,” Donald J. Trump accepted his third Republican presidential nomination. From the opening of his acceptance speech, Trump appeared to be deliberately somber, not leaning into the fiery affect that he so often uses at his rallies. This version of Trump was just weird. He still can’t read a teleprompter properly, even as he launched into an account of the attempt on his life last weekend.  Now, I’m not going to begrudge a man from sharing his thoughts about a brush with death, and certainly many in the audience appeared visibly moved by it. But by the time he decided to kiss the helmet of former volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore, the whole scene was just a little too maudlin and unserious. It was also a weird bit of stagecraft considering that Trump took three days to call Comperatore’s widow. Once we were past the emotional part of the program, it did not take long for Trump to return to form, offering his usual diatribe of lies and exaggerations about cities flooded with crime and inflation spiraling out of control. But of all the untrue things he said, perhaps the biggest was when he claimed “this movement has never been about me.” It’s only ever been about him, and he has spoon-fed Republicans so much of himself that it’s now all they want, no matter how incoherent or offensive it may be. On Thursday night, the Party of Lincoln finally solidified itself as the Party of Trump. And it wasn’t even his speech that did it. It happened the moment he accepted the nomination.

Meet the new Donald Trump; he’s the same as the old Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/meet-new-donald-trump-convention-speech-2024-election-rcna162677,"It might seem like six months ago, but it was just six days ago when a gunman in Pennsylvania nearly killed Donald Trump. In some political circles, people assumed that the outrageous assassination attempt wouldn't just change the 2024 election cycle, it was also change the candidate who was targeted. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United,” the former president wrote on his social media platform the morning after the attempt on his life. Hours later, the Republican was even more succinct, adding, “UNITE AMERICA!” As the week got underway, Axios reported that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Trump going forward. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added, “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America.” During the Republican nominee’s convention address, some observers would be forgiven for thinking the assurances were true — at least initially. In the first part of his remarks, Trump spoke in a somber tone while describing the awful events of Saturday and at least paid lip service to the “unity” theme he’d promoted days earlier. “Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” the former president said. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.” And then Trump ripped off the mask, abandoned the pretense and reverted to form. As a Washington Post analysis summarized: I’ve seen a great many convention speeches from presidential nominees, and I think it’s fair to say Trump’s was the worst. At times, it seemed as if he were trying to make himself even less popular with an American electorate that already holds him in low regard, reminding voters of all the things they don't like about him. The speech was breathtakingly dishonest. It was painfully long — to the point that even some of his loyalists left the convention floor before it was over. It rewrote recent history. It made fools of those who genuinely believed his “unity” rhetoric and took seriously the idea that Saturday’s shooting had changed him. But most of all, it was familiar. CNN’s Daniel Dale noted overnight that fact-checking the former president’s convention speech was surprisingly easy “because he’s told almost all of those lies before.” He added, “Trump is hardest to fact check because of the extreme volume of false claims but easiest to fact check because he does the same false claims dozens of times over years.” This was partly a convention speech and partly a greatest hits package, filled with petty lies, conspiracy theories, cheap shots, juvenile taunts (""Crazy Nancy""? Seriously?), borderline incoherent asides about Trump’s overwhelming sense of grievance, praise for the authoritarian leaders he admires, and the latest in a series of weird references to “the late, great Hannibal Lecter.” Meet the new Trump; he’s the same as the old Trump. By some measures, this was the best news Democrats have received in weeks. If the former president had demonstrated real leadership on the Republicans’ convention stage, his opponents would have new reason to worry. Instead, in a rather literal sense, Trump simply couldn’t help himself."
The case against Biden's candidacy remains as strong as ever,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-drop-out-schiff-pelosi-trump-shooting-rcna162384,"In the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there was a pause in the Democratic campaign to pressure President Joe Biden to drop his White House re-election bid. That moment of quiet was appropriate, as the nation took a brief break from politics as usual to take in what had just happened and sought calm to ensure the shooting did not spark further chaos. But that slowdown has come to an end. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California called on Biden to “pass the torch” in one of the most high-profile objections to Biden’s candidacy to date. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not deny an ABC report claiming that in a meeting he had with Biden he pressed the president to step down. And CNN, citing four sources briefed on the phone conversation, reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told Biden he cannot win the race and that his candidacy could ruin his party’s chances of winning the House.  The renewed pressure campaign on Biden is welcome news. The case against Biden’s candidacy did not grow any weaker in light of an assassination attempt against Trump. All the reasons Biden is ill-suited to be a candidate — and ill-suited to be president for four additional years — remain intact. In fact, the case is stronger than ever.  The polls present an unceasing torrent of terrible news for the president. Trump continues to best Biden in the polls despite his felony convictions and authoritarian rhetoric. According to New York Times and Siena College polling records, Trump holds his largest lead over a Democrat since his 2016 White House bid. A poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a remarkable 65% of Democrats want Biden to drop out of the race and allow his party to select a different candidate. Biden is still getting clobbered by Trump in polls of swing states and lagging far behind his Democratic colleagues in those states, indicating that he is a distinctly weak candidate within the party. Data for Progress’ latest survey finds that swing voters consider Biden’s age to be a much larger concern than Trump’s criminal charges. (The same survey conducted before the debate had found the reverse to be true — swing voters were more concerned about Trump’s charges.) There are concrete signs of how frustration over Biden’s candidacy is already demoralizing the party. NBC News reports that major donations have “fallen off a cliff” and that grassroots fundraising is falling short of campaign needs. In a worst-case scenario, this downturn is a preview of how disenchantment over Biden’s age could dampen his appeal not only to independents and swing voters, but also to ordinary Democratic voters. This is why top Democrats are warning that they fear a full-on wipeout of Democrats in government. Biden’s debate performance has generated a strange and shortsighted media game. Every one of the president’s media appearances these days is scrutinized to determine whether he presents any better than he did during his mumbling and at-times incoherent debate performance. Journalists and Democrats assess the timbre and smoothness of every word he utters and then grade the performance afterward typically on the spectrum of somewhere from “bearable” to “alarming.” The problem is that these performances are measured against the unacceptably low standard of Biden’s debate performance, and that Biden is ultimately not defined by his unremarkable moments, but his most troubling ones. It is naive to think Biden can fix this. Widespread concerns about his age predate the debate, and for good reason: For years — and especially during the past year — Biden has displayed a striking decline in his capacity to communicate clearly and display the level of energy appropriate for the most powerful political office in the world. The perception of him as too old is thoroughly entrenched, and challenging Trump to a golf showdown is not going to remedy that. Trying to game out how strong Biden is relative to other potential Democratic candidates is the wrong way to think about this issue. Every potential candidate possesses pros and cons, and electability is mostly poor-quality guesswork. The way to think about this issue is to acknowledge that Biden cannot do his job. These days Biden cannot explain his policy accomplishments. He cannot respond with confidence to politically sensitive questions from reporters that he needs firm responses to. He cannot speak sentences that are consistently intelligible or audible. He cannot paint a vivid and attractive picture of what America should look like in the future. In other words, he cannot make the case for his own candidacy. If he cannot do these things, then he cannot fulfill one of the most basic requirements of any politician: to communicate ideas and persuade people to join them in an endeavor to make them a reality. Such a task will always be required of a politician, whether in private meetings with power brokers or at public rallies ahead of elections. It requires willful denialism — of the polls, of common sense — to suggest that Biden's communicative problems do not help explain why he is trailing in the polls against one of the weakest presidential candidates in modern political history, and why it's hard for him to close the gap. The leaders of any responsible party would attempt to intervene and find someone who can do the job, and it is refreshing to see reports that, for all their flaws, Democratic leaders are doing just that. If the campaign to persuade Biden to step aside fails and he remains the Democratic nominee, the choice between him and Trump will be a no-brainer for the majority of Democratic voters. Biden’s values and judgment — even if executed poorly — are far better alternatives to Trump’s ethno-nationalist authoritarian fantasy. But most voters are not partisan Democrats. And less-engaged Democrats, independents, true swing voters, disenchanted Republicans and potential third-party voters are all persuadable demographics who will play a critical role in who wins the election. The Democrats need someone capable of persuasion — not just through rhetorical competence but also a meaningful and ambitious policy vision. First they must persuade Biden that, as much as he may wish that he could, he is no longer capable of doing what waging a presidential campaign and leading the country demand."
The return of Melania Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 12:03 PM PDT / Updated July 18, 2024, 10:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/melania-trump-rnc-will-not-speak-rcna161908,"A year ago this spring, when the 2024 presidential campaign was just kicking off, it seemed evident that Melania Trump, wife of former President Donald Trump, had decided to give it a miss. Little has changed since then. Her continued detachment from campaign events and rallies, her absence in all the primaries save Florida’s (where she voted), her skipping her husband’s lengthy hush money trial and his June 28 debate against President Joe Biden come alongside the strong speculation that she won’t live full-time in the White House again should Trump be re-elected. All of it taken together seems only to confirm that her distance from Trump’s political life will continue no matter what happens Nov. 5. Melania Trump has, it is true, held two campaign fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans at her homes; but by contrast, first lady Jill Biden has held frequent fundraising tours with multiple destinations. Jill Biden, described as “defender-in-chief” of her husband’s campaign by the Economist, and described by The New York Times as “comforter-in-chief” to some jittery Democrats, has visited red states and blue ones, often alone, and been an actively political surrogate for her husband. Melania Trump’s limited appearances could not be in starker contrast. Though she has been harder to find, Melania Trump did attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. However, unlike she did in 2016 and 2020, this time she did not speak. Her silence ends an unbroken tradition that goes back to Barbara Bush in 1992 of first ladies and candidates’ spouses giving significant addresses at conventions. As long as she is visible at the convention, even if she’s silent, Melania Trump will win plaudits from Trump fans, many of whom only want more of her. Still, her silence and her rare appearances are further evidence, as Katie Rogers noted recently, that Melania Trump has significantly reshaped the role of first lady: “She broke open the role and actually showed us [that] you don’t have to do anything with it if you don’t want to.” For more than a century, whether they desired it or not, first ladies have been highly visible campaigners. As many American women got to vote for the first time in 1920, for example, Florence Harding eagerly stood on her front porch, in what was called the Front Porch Campaign, hosting tens of thousands of visitors alongside her husband, President Warren G. Harding. Similarly, Eleanor Roosevelt called for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented third term during her “no ordinary time” speech at the Democratic convention in 1940, a step that, as First Ladies Association for Research and Education President Nancy Kegan Smith notes, “was credited with helping FDR to unify the convention.” Two decades later, Lady Bird Johnson was the first to take to the hustings on her own, with the whistle-stop tour in 1964 — a bold venture into a hostile South that helped bring about LBJ’s victory. Pat Nixon was the next to appear at a convention, in 1972, thrilled to offer remarks about her husband, Richard Nixon, following an eight-minute standing ovation. Then in 1992, Barbara Bush, already known for a significant speech at Wellesley College, had the opportunity to speak “about the centrality of family … in a model of conciliatory rhetoric,” as scholar Myra Gutin explains. Since then, first ladies’ speeches at conventions have often focused on family matters; Hillary Clinton spoke of children and family in 1996, as did Michelle Obama in 2008: “I come here as a wife; I come here as a mom.” In 2012, Michelle Obama further highlighted hers and President Barack Obama’s humble family histories. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Jill Biden offered a speech “as a mother and a grandmother” from a classroom at a high school where she once taught. Both Melania Trump’s speeches in 2016 and 2020 were similarly focused on family, addressing mothers like herself — and women as a whole.        This theme of family was also echoed by Melania Trump this past weekend in the wake of the assassination attempt on her husband. In an effort to reach across the aisle, she pointed out that “every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.”  Her statement was heartfelt and empathic, calling for Americans to see each other as “human beings.” Considering her absence during so much of the campaign so far, her outspokenness at this moment was notable — and will likely carry significant political weight. Her comments, of course, stand in stark contrast to the way her husband told supporters to ""fight like hell"" right before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Melania Trump’s words were important in humanizing her husband, and they suggest that GOP strategist Alex Conant is overlooking something significant when he claims that “people vote for the presidential candidate, not their spouse or their vice president.” This is because for more than a century now, whether they are particularly interested in politicking or not, first ladies have served their spouses’ campaigns immeasurably, by humanizing and broadening their appeal. With her statement, Melania Trump did just that after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. And Jill Biden’s call to her in the wake of the attack underlined the sisterhood of first ladies, all of whom know that what happened Saturday is what each of them dreads the most."
"Trump gives RNC speech, recounts assassination attempt: Highlights",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-speech-rnc-republican-convention-live-updates-rcna160910,"Chris Hayes speaking on MSNBC moments ago: First part of the speech, I was struck by the fact that this was a 78-year-old man who had just gone through a profoundly traumatic experience and was forced to reckon with his own mortality and how scary this was for him. The time comes for all of us, and that part of it was a part of Trump you don’t see because I don’t think he likes thinking about it at all. I also felt like the biggest takeaway after what has been three of the most painful weeks I have ever seen in Democratic politics: this is not a Colossus. This is not the Big Bad Wolf. This is not a vigorous and incredibly deft political communicator. This is an old man in decline who’s been doing the shame schtick for a very good long time and it’s really wearing pretty thin. And he is a beatable candidate. And Democrats have been feeling a lot of pain and fear and anxiety and understandably so but I don’t think anyone watched that speech and thought, ""Wow that’s going to be hard to top, that’s going to be hard to beat, how are we going to message against this guy."" And that is what he does at every rally. That was just a Trump rally with some speech woven through. I just think you got to look at that and think it’s really important if you’re on the pro-democracy side of this country to stop him from getting back into office but that should be a doable thing. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: From being a part of many convention speeches in the past, I think we can all agree this was not a traditional one. The first 35 to 40 minutes were about himself, about Donald Trump. He only stuck to the teleprompter for a page and a half or so. Also, for a man who is not a person of faith, but has struck a chord with the faith community in our country. There was one line that stuck out to me: “I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God … Many people say it was a providential moment.” He was surrounded by photos of his own bloody face that were projected in the arena. Obviously, that was a very traumatic moment for him and for the country, but he also spoke about this as if it was sort of a calling from God. We'll see how he speaks about this moving forward. But I also think if you’re tuning in and not really paying attention, or you’re undecided, you may see his speech and think maybe I'll go with the other guy. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: To paraphrase Erik Killmonger: “MAGA, is this your king?” If Joe Biden had given a rambling, shambling, all-over-the-place speech like that, elected Democrats would be demanding that the 25th Amendment be invoked immediately. They would scramble even worse than they are now to jettison him as the candidate for president. We would be questioning his mental acuity. That speech was proof that there’s not just one old man in the race. Donald Trump is an old man clearly in decline and we must start talking about him the same way that we are questioning Joe Biden, because Donald Trump cannot stay on message for even five to 10 minutes — even when telling a story about the most traumatic moments of his life. Donald Trump is not a candidate that Democrats should be terrified of. Their terror is embarrassing tonight. Again I have to ask: MAGA, is this your king? These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Four years ago, Trump’s acceptance speech ran 75 minutes and landed with a thud. This year, he spoke for nearly an hour and a half, went on a dozen or more tangents, and, after recounting the assassination attempt on him early in the address, made no effort to tamp down the usual rhetoric. Trump declared that Democrats “used Covid to cheat” in the 2020 election. He lied about crime rates, his inflation plan and his tax plan. He didn’t even bother mentioning abortion, because even he knows no one would believe anything he says about it. His only good fortune was that a good portion of the country likely went to bed before he finished. In short, this was among the worst — if not the worst — acceptance speeches any presidential nominee has given. And as more members of Biden’s party ask him to step aside, Democrats on all sides of that issue should ask themselves some hard questions, given that this is the candidate they are losing to in many polls. Nicolle Wallace speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I think if you’re wondering what impact Donald Trump's speech has on the viewing audience, you have to wonder how much of the viewing audience stayed through. It was longer than modern baseball games with a new pitching clock — I don’t even know that all baseball games last that long. It was very lengthy, very meandering. I hope that the bigger message anyone in the pro-democracy side got tonight is that the pro-democracy candidate, the Democrat, can beat him — by a lot and decisively. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Despite being billed by Republicans as a convention focused on national unity, I think it wrapped up true to the form of the Republican Party. Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, Dana White, Hulk Hogan and Trump — five men who've made headlines for bigoted comments — closed it all out. Pretty telling that the RNC felt the people best suited to drive home their purported message of multiracial unity and political harmony were these guys. Trump had said he rewrote his speech to focus on calling for unity after his assassination attempt, but his remarks tonight were classic Trump. The speech was more than 90 minutes long, and he went off script again and again, greatly exaggerating or lying about his administration’s accomplishments in his first term. Trump made brief, sweeping attempts to appeal to a diverse group of voters, but his overall talking points on immigration, foreign policy, the economy and violent crime remained as grim as ever. The dissonance between his call for the country to heal from “discord and division” while having played a major part in sowing such conflict — including criticizing Biden, Democrats and “crazy Nancy Pelosi” tonight — was unmissable. The lack of any abortion talk in Trump’s speech is notable, and it mirrors the other convention speakers’ deafening silence on the issue this week. Abortion rights is a losing issue for Republicans at the ballot box and one that the party remains divided on. The GOP platform this year — parts of which The New York Times reported Trump had dictated personally — had no mention of a national abortion ban for the first time in 40 years. Trump touted his endorsement from Hungary’s authoritarian Viktor Orbán, whose illiberal behavior Trump and fellow Republicans have praised repeatedly.  Orbán, Trump claims, thinks Russia and China fear the former president. That certainly contradicts Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, who said world leaders viewed Trump as a “fool.”  This whole aside felt like a truly self-aggrandizing diatribe, though I’m not sure many folks outside the MAGA bubble lionize Orbán enough to care what he thinks.  Trump took a veiled shot at Biden’s “cancer moonshot” in a part of the speech that was not in the prepared remarks. In the middle of boasting about how American technology will “soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and many other diseases,"" Trump took a swipe at his opponent. “You remember this gentleman that I don’t want to mention other than one time I had to,” he said, referring to Biden. “This man said, we’re going to find the cure to cancer. Nothing happened.” In 2016, then-Vice President Biden launched a project often called the “cancer moonshot” after losing his son Beau to brain cancer, and he relaunched in 2022 after he was elected president. Trump has gone way off script, making this a very rambling speech that feels relatively low energy for a politician known for riling up his crowds. His remarks were supposed to be just over an hour but we're nearing the 90-minute mark at this point. HuffPost's Igor Bobic reported that ""lots of delegates [are] on their phones"" at this point of the speech. In the middle of a diatribe about how much North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un likes him, Trump mocked people who asked how he could possibly get along with someone like Kim. “It’s nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons,” Trump deadpanned to the audience. He may have said it like a joke, but it speaks to why rogue countries like North Korea sought out nuclear weapons in the first place. It undermines the entire concept of nuclear nonproliferation, showcasing how even the mighty United States will be forced to listen if you only get a few nukes to guard your back. Trump has railed against a “woke military” before, but tonight he distinguished between service members and the “fools” in higher positions in the military. He made a brief mention of it, saying: “We have a great military. Our military is not woke, it’s just some of the fools on top that are woke.” Trump has said something to this effect before. Last month, asked by Fox & Friends Weekend if he would fire “the woke generals on top,” Trump said, “I would fire them. You can’t have woke military.” Read more from my colleague Steve Benen on Trump’s vow to remove military leaders who don’t align with his ideology. “Our crime rate is going up,” claims Donald Trump, “while crime statistics all over the world are going down.” But it’s not true. As NBC News reported last month, “the rate of violent and property crimes dropped precipitously in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, according to quarterly statistics released Monday by the FBI.” Overall, violent crime was down 15.2%, with murders down more than 26%. That’s on top of a significant decline in 2023 as well according to the same FBI data. Trump's ""no tax on tips"" proposal has become a catchy rallying cry on the campaign trail lately, and not surprisingly also got a reference during his RNC speech. But experts do not agree that this plan is the best way to substantially help all — or even many — tipped workers in America. As Sharon Block, a professor of practice at Harvard Law School and the executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy wrote for MSNBC back in June: ""The first element of a pro-tipped worker agenda would be to end the tipped minimum wage... The next element of a pro-tipped-worker agenda would be to raise the minimum wage."" Read more below: Trump promised he’d lower taxes and get rid of inflation, but the math says otherwise. A report from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, for example, found that his 10% tariff on all imports — and 60% on imports from China — would impose a $2,500 tax on the average American household. And the tariffs would also increase inflation by as much as 2.5%. Last month, 16 Nobel laureates penned a letter warning that Trump’s economic program would “reignite” the inflation that plagued millions in recent years. Trump just bragged about dramatically slashing the length of the Republican Party’s platform. “This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for America’s renewal,” he said before veering off his prepared script. “You saw that agenda, and it’s very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past, including the Democrats.” “They write these things that are hundreds of pages long, and they never read them after they’re done,” he added. “In their case, fortunately they don’t read them, because they’re pretty bad.” The Trump team dramatically cut the party’s platform by nearly three-fourths, while they pushed delegates to pass it quickly and without any leaks. Still, the platform was more of an effort than 2020, when the party skipped writing a platform entirely due to the truncated convention. Despite the generally optimistic tone, Trump’s speech still had a few moments where partisan rhetoric slipped through. For example, he referred to the “Democrat Party,” an old pejorative that dates back to the 1940s and was revived in the modern era by former Speaker Newt Gingrich, since “Democratic” sounds too much like “democratic,” which has positive connotations. He then referred to the classified documents case, recently thrown out by Judge Aileen Cannon, as “the fake documents case,” the “meaningless Green New Scam” (a reference to the proposed Green New Deal), “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” “Deface the Nation” (a dig at the CBS News show “Face the Nation”) and Democrats “cheating on elections.” These smaller moments — only some of which were in the prepared text of his remarks— were revealing because they tend to grate on the very undecided voters that Trump claimed to be reaching out. Trump, repeating dubious claims he and his supporters have made in the past, argued tonight that “our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III” — and only his isolationist approach to foreign policy can avoid it. Such baseless claims have been undercut, however, by foreign policy experts like Fiona Hill, who served in Trump’s administration. Hill, a key witness who testified against Trump in his first impeachment trial, explained to Politico last year that abandoning the United States’ NATO allies or reneging on our promises of support could drive nations to increase their nuclear arsenal, girding themselves for conflict.  In other words, one could argue Trump’s policy proposals may end up accelerating a global conflict — not avoiding it. Trump claimed that if returned to the White House, he’ll “bring down prices, and bring them down fast” after years of runaway inflation. The plan he pitched is the same plan Republicans have been pitching for years: more drilling for oil and natural gas. The argument goes that by increasing the supply of petrofuels, the costs for everything else will go down. The problem with that is twofold: First, the U.S. is already producing “more crude oil than any country ever,” according to the International Energy Agency, outpacing both Russia and Saudi Arabia this year. Second, and more problematic, oil prices are set internationally and even that glut of American oil isn’t enough to get OPEC to reduce their own profits. Doubling down on petrofuels instead of renewable resources is a move with diminishing returns, especially given the worsening effects of climate change that continued oil production — and Trump’s pledge to back off electric car production — will exacerbate. Trump is increasingly veering off script as he goes on tonight, adding whole sections riffing on the words he’s reading off of the teleprompter. It’s transforming what was already set to be a lengthy address into a much longer speech and adding in non sequiturs like Democrats “used Covid to cheat” in 2020 when talking about his policy toward Iran. He also name-dropped Biden and Nancy Pelosi, despite neither being in the prepared text. It’s hard to tell where we’re going to wind up by the time we get to this end of this speech, compared with his promise of “unity.” Trump just praised Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who just dismissed his classified documents case in Florida. Trump nominated Cannon to the bench during his lame duck period after losing the 2020 election. After the classified documents case was dismissed earlier this week (a ruling special counsel Jack Smith is appealing), Trump used his speech to praise her as a “highly respected federal judge in Florida,” offering rare praise for the widely criticized judge. It’s yet another reminder that Trump seems to believe the legal system should serve his personal interests. “We will make Wisconsin great again,” Trump proclaimed. But he’s made that promise before. In 2017, the Trump White House touted a $10 billion factory from Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn that would create 13,000 jobs. Trump held a gold-painted shovel and boasted the manufacturing campus would be a crown jewel for his “America First” agenda.  By 2021, the investment was scaled back more than 90%, and Foxconn largely abandoned the project. This gap between Trump’s rhetoric and reality can be found across the state, with more counties having lower unemployment under Biden than under Trump. And earlier this year, Biden announced a $3.3 billion data center from Microsoft — on that same property Foxconn and Trump had once promised to make “great” again. In the middle of recounting Saturday’s shooting, Trump told the crowd that “I am not supposed to be here tonight.” In response the audience began to chant “Yes you are! Yes you are!” Trump took in the adulation before responding: “No, I’m not” and continuing with his prepared remarks. The crowd also took up the cue to begin chanting “Fight! Fight!” as Trump reached that point in his recollection, echoing the cry at the rally when the Secret Service led him off stage. And after a moment of silence for firefighter Corey Comperatore, there was a round of “We love Trump” from the assembled masses. Trump went into detail about last weekend’s assassination attempt, saying he realized immediately that he had been struck by a bullet in the ear and ducked, and that the audience “did not move an inch” as the gunshots rang out because they thought he had died and didn’t want to leave him. Videos show some audience members crouching down and moving during the shooting, but the crowd did largely remain in place. Trump also honored Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the shooting, and David Dutch and James Copenhaver, who were upgraded to stable condition after being critically injured. After recounting the attempt against his life, Trump eulogized Corey Comperatore, the man killed during the rally shooting last weekend. Comperatore, 50, died trying to protect his family, officials said. He was a former fire chief for Pennsylvania's Buffalo Township and a father of two. At one point, Trump walked over to a stand that was holding up Comperatore's fire helmet and jacket. Though Comperatore's name is misspelled on the jacket, it was of his part of his official uniform. Trump then called for a moment of silence for Comperatore. Trump’s speech included this confounding bit of verbal judo. “We must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement,” he said. “In that spirit, the Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy, especially since that is not true, in fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country.” Two things: First, it’s honestly bizarre that Trump is criticizing criminalizing dissent when his 2016 campaign’s unofficial slogan was “lock her up.” He also threatened to deploy the military against unarmed protestors in 2020. But more importantly, this MAGA mumbo jumbo proves polls that suggest there is bipartisan concern among Americans for the future of democracy need to be taken with a grain of salt. In the worldview that Trump is promoting, his attempts to overturn the 2020 election were about him protecting democracy — from Democrats’ voter fraud. It follows, then, that his supporters would think Biden and Democrats are the actual threat, no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary. As Trump recounted the attempt on his life on Saturday, he praised the “very brave Secret Service agents” who were “putting themselves in peril.” Not all of his supporters feel similarly. “At least three female agents were among those protecting Trump in the moments after the shooting,” reports NBC News, “and in the days since, their actions have become popular targets of criticism and jokes among conservatives, with several posts on X receiving more than 10 million views.” Republican Reps. Tim Burchett and Marjorie Taylor Greene have also denounced Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle as a “DEI hire” and a “DEI initiative person” respectively. Trump, the 45th president, just formally accepted his party's presidential nomination in the hopes of becoming the 47th president next year. Following his prepared remarks, he went to to describe the assassination attempt against him on Saturday. On retelling his experience, he said: ""You'll never hear it from me a second time because it's actually too painful to tell."" UFC president Dana White, a longtime Trump supporter who faced condemnation last year for slapping his wife on camera, just wrapped up his hypermasculine speech portraying Trump as a strong man Americans want and need in charge. As I’ve written on the ReidOut Blog, White and fighters in the UFC have repeatedly used the company as a platform to promote Trump and play up his purported toughness. I’m not sure that speech or White’s appearance will do much to win over many women voters. But Trump’s campaign seems more focused on appealing to misogynistic men more than anyone else. A number of speakers tonight have said that God saved Trump from being assassinated. Leading the convention in prayer, the Rev. Franklin Graham directly credited God.  “Our heavenly Father, we come before you this evening with grateful hearts,” the noted evangelist leader began. “Thank you for saving the life of President Donald J. Trump. In his own words, it was you and you alone who saved him.” Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said it was “divine intervention.” Speaking directly to his father from the stage, Trump’s son Eric credited “the grace of God, divine intervention and your guardian angels above.” But it was the Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, the pastor of a Black church in Detroit that Trump visited last month, who went the furthest, arguing at the climax of his speech that God saved Trump for the country’s future.  “You can’t deny the power of God on this man’s life. You can’t deny that God protected him,” he said. “You cannot deny that it was a millimeter miracle that was able to save this man’s life. Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for such a time as this?” Sewell added: “Could it be that the king of glory, the lord God strong and mighty, the God who is mighty in battle, protected Donald Trump because he wants to use him for such a time as this?” In his acceptance speech, Trump also said that God protected him last weekend. Recounting the shooting in Pennsylvania, he said: “There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way, I felt very safe, because I had God on my side.” He later added: “I’ll tell you, I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. In watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was.” Lawrence O'Donnell speaking on MSNBC moments ago: When I was working in the Senate in the 1990s, what you saw was the abortion issue doing was exactly what each party needed it to do. You couldn’t imagine the Republican Party without it. There was just no way they could come close to winning a national election without it. They needed that piece in their coalition. But you also knew that they never ever wanted it to go away. I didn’t believe George W. Bush wanted it to go away, because then what do you do? How do you how do you campaign on the issue? I never dreamed Ronald Reagan wanted it to go away, or George H.W. Bush. And the Democrats were very good at using it against them. Both sides were using the issue for enormous fundraising. It just seemed like a status quo that served both parties. What the Democratic Party was saying was preserve Roe v. Wade, and the Republican Party was saying get rid of it. But then they got rid of it and now, the guy who got rid of it is afraid of talking about it. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Don Jr. has long been heralded as the heir apparent for the Trump family. After all, he is the eldest son and the one with the deepest ties to the alt-right movement that helped fuel his father’s initial presidential run. But in this new era, it’s Eric whose wife is running the RNC, Eric who got the better RNC speaking slot, addressing the convention ahead of his dad. It’s also worth noting that while the New York civil fraud case is being appealed, the Trump family's main business is politics. Either way, Eric is clearly a workhorse when it comes to his dad’s interests, even if his older brother is the one who has historically garnered the most attention. Following the theme of Trump amnesia, Eric mentions how cheap gas was when his dad was president. Eric seems to have forgotten about the once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that caused gas to be so cheap. Eric complains about how mean everyone is to his dad. Lots of good conservative grievances from Eric. Eric tells everyone how his dad is going to fix everyone’s problems but it feels like he’s forgotten that his dad was president for four years. Despite how weirdly angry and long his speech was, Eric always just makes me sad. The former first lady has finally arrived on the convention floor in the final hours of the RNC. Her entrance followed Eric Trump's speech. Just one speech remains ahead of Trump's — UFC President Dana White — and a couple of musical performances — one from Kid Rock and one from Lee Greenwood. It looks like most of Trump’s immediate family members are here tonight. Before Hulk Hogan took the stage, Trump walked out onto the convention floor and into the VIP booth with his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle; his older daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner; the former president's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, and her husband Michael Boulos; and others. Trump's second-oldest son, Eric Trump, is set to speak later tonight. His wife, Lara Trump, was also seen in the VIP box. There’s been a lot of commentary over the past several days about the confidence among Republicans in Milwaukee. Nowhere is that confidence more obvious than among Trump’s campaign, and his selection of JD Vance as his running mate is being interpreted as a sign of confidence in the polls. (Never mind that Mike Pence was hardly a choice designed to woo swing voters either.) And yet Thursday has capped off the convention of a campaign that, if it is as much in the lead as it claims, has done so in spite of itself. The speakers’ list has been almost entirely employees on Trump’s payroll or rich celebrities. Tucker Carlson, Dana White, Alina Habba: These are not names who will win over the sliver of persuadable Americans. And the night’s proceedings have been marked by the house band filling time, again and again. There haven’t been any attempts to shore up Trump’s weaknesses or cement his strengths. Trump may be ahead right now, but four months is a long time in politics, especially in 2024. Nothing about this week suggests that Trump’s staff is ready to save him if and when things go sideways. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We should note that the Republican National Convention is unified around Donald Trump’s candidacy. But when it comes to literally anything of substance, even within the convention hall itself, different camps have differing opinions. JD Vance got up there last night and said the Republican Party isn’t the party of Wall Street anymore, they’re the party of the working class. He did that the same day there was reporting that Trump was interested in tapping Jamie Dimon to be the head of the head of the Treasury Department. Those two statements are at odds with one another.  On mass deportations — there are people holding up mass deportations signs but then we have reports that Hispanic men, in particular, don’t think Trump’s going to follow through on that policy. The Republican Party largely hasn't been held to account by its voters on any of the policies that Trump seeks to enact, or any of the plans he says he has for a second term. Donald Trump and JD Vance are telling voters: full lockdown, don’t ask us any questions, get in line and pull the lever. This is what you got. That’s unity. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Ahead of wrestler Hulk Hogan’s speech tonight, social media users are raising awareness about racist comments he made in the past. From Tucker Carlson to Trump, this convention has welcomed plenty of people who’ve been derided for their racist rhetoric — Hogan included. In 2015, he apologized after a recording surfaced of him saying he is “a racist to a point” and repeatedly using the N-word while decrying his daughter dating a Black man. Not the gifted orator I remember, but he did seem very enthusiastic. Hogan mentioned “real Americans” — am curious what that means. Also, he did in fact rip his shirt off, which the crowd loved and honestly could be the high point of this whole convention. It’s worth remembering that Peter Thiel funded Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker. Very interesting to hear Hogan talk about how he has known Trump for over 30 years and why he thinks he will stand up for everyday Americans.  In the lead-up to his speech, allies of the Biden campaign shared video of Hogan mocking Trump — including Trump’s hair — and claiming the former president turns his back on everybody that’s close to him and everybody who has done business with him. Trump was expected to speak around 10 p.m. but there are still several speakers to get to and the house band has been playing for over 20 minutes since the last speech. It's unclear what's causing the delay. Meanwhile, Melania Trump has reportedly arrived to the convention, according to a photo snapped by The New York Times. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson repeated an old story about protesters coming to his house in his speech tonight. The incident happened in 2018, as about 20 protesters with the anti-fascist group Smash Racism D.C. showed up at his house, chanting “Tucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!” One woman could be overheard in a video posted online saying she wanted to bring a pipe bomb to his house. The protest was widely condemned and Facebook and Twitter removed the group’s videos of it from the internet. In his RNC speech, Carlson said that “antifa came to my house,” defining the group inaccurately as “the Democratic Party’s militia.” He also said that the protesters “tried to come in through the front door,” a claim that he made at the time which was not backed up by police reports or evidence. Tucker Carlson, whose main platform is social media after Fox News fired him last year, still has huge sway over the Republican Party. He took the stage to one of the biggest applauses so far tonight, and he reportedly played a major role in pushing Trump to pick JD Vance as his running mate: The New York Times reported that when Trump was wavering on Vance as his VP pick, Carlson called up the former president and warned him that if he didn't go with Vance and instead chose a ""neocon,"" U.S. intelligence agencies would be incentivized to assassinate him. In a statement to the Daily Montanan, Tester said, “While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.” Tester becomes the second sitting senator after Vermont’s Peter Welch to suggest Biden step aside. Earlier this week, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for California's Senate seat, also asked Biden to step aside. Tester, who is in a tight race with businessman Tim Sheehy, also told the Daily Montanan that he supports an open nominating process, rather than designating Vice President Kamala Harris as the new nominee. Days after waxing nostalgic about an era when American men felt empowered to “punch out” school employees, and warning about the spiritual battle being waged with “anti-human” liberals, Tucker Carlson finally got his chance to gush over Trump on the official RNC stage.  But just like fellow speakers Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis before him, Carlson hasn’t always had such nice things to say about the former president.  Last year, Carlson tried to walk back anti-Trump texts that were unearthed during the Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit. In those texts, Carlson said he hated Trump “passionately” and called Trump’s presidency a “disaster,” noting “there isn’t really an upside to Trump.” “The only crime [former] President Trump has committed is loving America,” said Trump lawyer Alina Habba onstage just now. In fact, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide an affair ahead of the 2016 election. Two other criminal cases against him are ongoing, and while a third was recently dismissed, special counsel Jack Smith has appealed that dismissal. And Trump has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in multiple civil suits involving fraud, defamation and sexual abuse. Alina Habba, an attorney who represented Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation trials, lauded Trump’s character in a dramatic speech. “Tonight, I want to take you behind the law and behind the headlines, and share with you a side of President Trump that reveals his character, his kindness and his commitment to saving this great country,” said Habba, whose client was ultimately found liable of sexual abuse against Carroll. At one point, Habba seemed to tear up as she recounted when a bystander in Manhattan shouted his support for Trump while Habba was on the phone with the former president, and Trump asked to speak to the man. Several other prominent women in Trump’s orbit have also gone to lengths to talk up Trump’s “softer” side in an attempt to humanize him at the RNC. A short video shown between speakers featured Trump in full election denial mode. Clearly filmed before last weekend’s shooting, the video shows Trump saying that if he’s re-elected he will move to eliminate all early voting and electronic voting machines and require voter ID across the country. “We’re going to do it properly,” he said. “We’re going to have good, secure, beautiful elections. We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.” The video is part of a broader effort to persuade voters to “use every appropriate tool available” to vote, including voting early and by mail. Trump’s repeated attacks on voting by mail during the 2020 election put the GOP at a strategic disadvantage as the party has to rely more on Election Day turnout. In the video, Trump also encouraged voters to look for election fraud, which is vanishingly rare despite Trump’s baseless claims. “Keep your eyes open because these people want to cheat, and they do cheat, and frankly it’s the only thing they do well,” he said. Thursday’s speaker schedule has plenty of Trump employees and has-been celebrities. What it won’t have is any former Republican presidents, vice presidents or nominees for either office. ""At this year’s RNC, it’s as if there was no Republican Party before Trump came along,"" Michael A. Cohen wrote earlier this week. ""And, in a sense, that’s true. The current incarnation of the GOP bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan or the Bush family. The only real blast from the past is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich."" Read more below: New York real estate executive Steve Witkoff is the latest in a string of people who apparently were given speaking slots to talk about what a nice guy Trump is in his private life. Witkoff is a longtime friend of Trump’s who was brought in as the first expert witness for the defense in the New York civil fraud trial against Trump and his business last year. The polite applause Witkoff got from the audience tonight shows his speech did more to boost Trump than his courtroom appearance, which didn’t help prevent a $355 million fine against the Trump Organization. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: These ideas being pushed at the RNC, that immigrants are taking your jobs, that we have an immigration problem, this notion that immigrants are stealing American jobs is simply not true. Now, if you’re worried about the economy, Donald Trump’s plan of mass deportation is only going to hurt our economy. If you take all of these people out of the country, they’re no longer going to be contributing spending here and that’s going to shrink our economy. We’re going to be further short on labor. We know that under the Biden administration, $2 trillion in infrastructure spending is happening. We need a labor force. For me, the takeaway that I’m scratching my head on, there are all sorts of policies that JD Vance and Donald Trump represent, like extending the corporate tax cut. JD Vance is anti-supporting Ukraine, obviously overturning Roe v. Wade was their crowning achievement, but they’re not talking about any of those things. JD Vance last night and Donald Trump tonight are pushing this pro-worker populist message. It’s amazing because in the state of Ohio there is a senator who has had a populist message who’s worked for the working man and woman for years, and it’s Sherrod Brown. If you’re talking about unions, you’ve got the head of the Teamsters here the other night, which was amazing that Trump is potentially getting their vote, but you didn’t see a lot of these people in the crowd cheering them on because the Republican platform is not pro-union. For me, my big takeaway is just this giant disconnect. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump entered the convention hall to a raucous reception tonight and sat next to country singer Jason Aldean.  Aldean, whose single “Try That in a Small Town” was accused of endorsing lynching, is closing out the four-day convention on Thursday night with a performance. At a concert this week, he dedicated the song to Trump after the attempt on the former president’s life. Pompeo’s speech tonight, besides repeating falsehoods about Chinese spy balloons and foreign policy, also clashed with Trump’s actual record on veterans and the military.  “I’m disgusted by the Biden administration’s incompetent pullout from [Afghanistan],” Pompeo claimed. But a report from the National Security Council determined Trump’s haphazard announcement that the U.S. would be pulling out of Afghanistan was largely to blame for the chaos that followed once Biden took over. Pompeo also portrayed the MAGA movement as friendlier to veterans than the Biden-Harris admin — a strange claim considering Trump’s disparaging comments about veterans like the late John McCain, and the fact that Trump’s RNC is currently suing Michigan over directives state officials say would make it easier for veterans to register to vote. John Nieporte, the head pro at Trump’s golf club, was a truly baffling speaker. He made me wonder what are we even doing here? I don’t know. Trump’s golf pro said, “Donald Trump, 21 club championships; Joe Biden, zero.”  Is Joe Biden a member of Trump’s golf club? He is not. That golf portion marked one of the most sycophantic parts of this convention. Nieporte praised Trump’s golf game and gushed over his purported athletic prowess. With that in mind, I advise you to read this interview with sports writer Rick Reilly on Trump’s alleged tendency to cheat in golf and how it seems to explain some of his political tendencies Trump, still wearing a bandage over his right ear, joined the RNC moments ago, walking into booming applause and cheers. He shook hands with several attendees on the way to his seat, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has endorsed Trump once again despite all the nasty things the former president has said about him and his wife. There is nothing as bipartisan as a good attack line, as Mike Pompeo just proved again. In a speech harshly criticizing Biden’s foreign policy, Trump’s onetime secretary of state recycled a line from his predecessor, Hillary Clinton. “The entire administration has failed to tell us the truth, the truth that we all know and is so dangerous to our nation, the truth that Joe Biden can’t handle that 3 a.m. phone call,” he said. “Indeed he won’t take a phone call after about 4 p.m.” The “3 a.m. phone call” originated back in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, when a Clinton ad used it to try to raise doubts about Barack Obama’s lack of foreign policy experience. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rewrote a lot of Trump’s foreign policy in his speech, but one of the biggest lies was about Biden’s supposed weakness in the face of China. “Not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States — four years,” he said. “If I was the secretary of state and a Chinese spy balloon flew across the country, I’d have been the former secretary of state — and rightfully so.” Except that didn’t happen only because Trump’s administration didn’t notice when it happened. Pompeo was one of several Trump administration officials given classified briefings last year because “incidents that occurred during Trump’s presidency weren’t discovered until after Biden took office.” That’s a bit less of an applause line, though, so I guess Pompeo’s strategic amnesia makes sense here. It was interesting to watch a newly svelte Mike Pompeo try to engage the crowd. Spoiler: He failed. Instead we got a lot of the usual lies about Trump’s foreign policy, but just a little bit more boring. GOP convention attendees clearly feel like nothing can stop Trump from retaking the presidency. It’s a sense of inevitability that not only says Trump will win, but that he can’t lose. As I explained yesterday, that narrative is a red flag when you consider how much can change between now and November — and how unlikely Republicans are going to be to accept any result other than a total victory for Trump. You can read more below: “For Twitter to deserve public trust,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk once wrote, “it must be politically neutral.” That pretense of neutrality, on life support ever since Musk purchased the site now known as X, is not just dead but now 6 feet underground. Visitors to X tonight will find that the #MAGA and #Trump2024 hashtags now have custom emojis and icons on the site. To top it all off, those who click on #Trump2024 are greeted with raining American flags. A representative for X told tech news website Mashable that this is a paid promotion for Trump’s campaign. Twitter and X have long provided custom emojis for advertising campaigns, nonpartisan events such as NFL games and bipartisan events like Election Day. But never before has a presidential campaign been allowed to purchase such promotion. While unprecedented, though, this development is hardly unexpected when Musk’s pledge to donate $45 million a month to Trump for the rest of the campaign. It’s another reminder, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem wrote, of “how acutely vulnerable our civil society is to being hijacked by billionaires who want to reshape the world to their liking.” Businesswoman Diane Hendricks, who just spoke, is one of the RNC’s so-called “everyday Americans” who have been featured throughout the convention this week. But the idea that Hendricks would be able to sympathize with the average voter is somewhat laughable. As Rolling Stone reported, Hendricks is the co-founder of a massive roofing wholesale business and a billionaire Trump donor who benefited greatly from his rich-friendly tax cuts during his first term. She was, according to Forbes, the 92nd-richest person in the world in 2024. “Everyday” she is not. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Let’s talk about some of the hottest fashion trends at this convention, like the cowboy hats the Texas delegation brings every year. This year, we’re seeing some Republican delegates give another stylistic show of support for their presidential nominee Donald Trump: white bandages on their right ear, just like the one Trump is wearing to cover the wound he received Saturday. This is not the first time that delegates at a Republican convention have used a bandage to send a message. But it’s quite different from the one we saw 20 years ago that managed to take away 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry’s advantage over incumbent president George W. Bush at the height of the Iraq War. Then-Senator Kerry had served in combat in Vietnam as a Swift boat captain, while Bush, whose father was a U.S. congressman, wound up serving stateside in the Texas Air National Guard.  During the 2004 campaign, a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, bankrolled by a Republican megadonor, emerged to smear Kerry’s service record and the injuries that earned him one of three Purple Hearts. At the 2004 Republican convention, some delegates were Band-Aids with Purple Hearts on their faces to mock what they called a self-inflicted scratch Kerry had sustained. It didn’t matter it sold a lie about combat veteran Kerry, amplifying a baseless charge that he was somehow dishonorable. While George W. Bush sold himself as a wartime president, albeit one who conveniently avoided combat in the war that defined his generation. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump’s claim that he wanted to stress “unity” at the Republican convention after the attempt on his life seemed to fall by the wayside when it got underway. But looked at another way, Trump is getting unity; it’s just among Republicans only. The convention has shown the party coming together in support of the nominee, with Trump’s former rivals speaking on his behalf and an overall jubilant mood in the room.  And that may have been what Trump meant all along. Consider that as president, he had a habit of bragging about his poll rating among Republicans and with Republican pollsters. Once he memorably claimed that 52% of women supported him in the 2016 election, which as fact-checkers noted was actually the numbers he got among white women. So Trump may be getting the unity he meant after all. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., has the job of trying to keep control of the House in Republicans' hands. During his speech, he told RNC attendees that “to save America we need to grow our majority.” It’s a tacit admission that there’s no way for the GOP to govern with the size of its very slim majority. What he had the tact not to say though is that it’s thanks to the chaos caucus members who list themselves as Trump’s biggest supporters that Republicans have spent the last two years swinging from internal crisis to crisis. Diane Evans, labeled as one of the “everyday Americans” speaking tonight, just made a dig at Biden: “I’ve never spoken at a convention before; I’ve never used a teleprompter before. But I figure if Joe Biden can, I can manage all right.” Evans, it’s also worth noting, is on the executive committee for the Palm Beach GOP — and indicated that she got involved in politics because of Trump’s 2020 lies. She told the crowd that they should ”tell 20 people to tell 20 people to vote — and they can’t cheat or rig their way out of a landslide.” It’s one of the first direct references to Trump’s claim that he can only lose if Democrats cheat, but likely won’t be the last. Anyone under the belief this convention is truly about “unity” could take one look at the Arizona delegation of Republicans in attendance to be proven otherwise.  I wrote earlier this week about Shelby Busch, the election-denying Arizona delegate selected to announce her state party’s support for Trump at this year’s convention. Busch was in the news recently after video surfaced of her saying she'd like to ""lynch"" Republican Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richer, who’s been targeted with baseless election conspiracy theories.  Senate candidate Kari Lake of Arizona used her RNC speech to attack the press and push false claims about immigrants voting in federal elections. Her icy relationship with the press was further exposed in viral footage of her withering during an interview in which she was asked about her election conspiracism.  And Arizona state Rep. Alexander Kolodin, a fellow election-denier, was captured on camera telling Democracy Now host Amy Goodman that Goodman and Democrats tried to “assassinate” Trump, peddling a far-right conspiracy theory that claims liberals are responsible for the recent shooting at a Trump rally.  So much for “unity.” Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was the first major speaker tonight and made the case for an “America First majority” in the Senate. The speech was what’s become standard boilerplate for the GOP at this point, calling out liberal Democrats who “speak like moderates but vote with Joe Biden” for opposing the Keystone Pipeline and “taking away your Second Amendment rights.” But he got the biggest response when attacking trans kids, trotting out the tired line that Democrats “can’t even define what a woman is.” But “back in Montana, we know the difference between a cow and a bull,” Daines said. A reminder, though: Anti-trans rhetoric failed to win over voters during the 2022 midterms, and it’s unlikely that it will this time around either. Fmr. Gov. John Kasich speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Will we see a different Donald Trump tonight? He’s been talking about love and compassion but a lot of people are skeptical about it. If he is going to talk about love and unity, and all that other stuff, we’ve got to see if that’s for real. Words are one thing and actions are another. Republicans think they’ve got an excellent chance of winning this but I do think they are very unsettled by the prospect of President Joe Biden not being the candidate. Republicans have had a good convention — any way you want to look at it. Now, the question is, what kind of a convention are the Democrats going to have? When you look at what’s happened, by and large for the Republicans, it’s been pretty good. They seem to be together and have largely controlled some of the rhetoric — we’ve not seen Jan. 6 people parading around. What’s going to be interesting is what kind of a convention the Democrats will have. If Democrats go into a convention that is sort of, but maybe not totally, wide open, it will be exciting and different. That would be something much different than what you’re seeing with the Republicans right now.  These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. At a sound check at the convention this afternoon, musician Kid Rock changed the lyrics to his 2000 song “American Bad Ass” to reference the recent assassination attempt on Trump. Rock’s original lyrics: “They call me cowboy, I’m the singer in black / Throw a finger in the air, let me see where you’re at / And say (hey, hey).” As sung during a sound-check earlier this afternoon: “They call me cowboy, I’m the singer in black / Throw a fist in the air, let me see where you’re at / And say (fight, fight).” The new lyrics reference Trump raising his fist after the failed assassination in Butler, Penn., and chanted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” to the audience.  Attendees at the convention have adopted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” as their own chant at several points, and a Trump-owned sneaker company is also selling shoes with the slogan and an image of Trump’s bloodied face. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: RNC attendees are not talking about cutting taxes for the rich or extending the corporate tax cut. They are not talking about the crowning achievement, which is overturning Roe v. Wade. We are not hearing about ending support for Ukraine, and the question is why. And the answer is, those policies — the actual policies that Donald Trump stands for — are not popular with the majority of American people. Obviously, the people in this arena are going to vote for Trump — win, lose or draw. But there are not enough people here to win the next presidential election. Trump knows this. JD Vance knows this. So the challenge is for Democrats: are you going to educate the American people, and independent and swing voters, to say their populist message, their blue-collar worker message, isn’t reflective of what their policies are going to be? Two nights ago, the head of the Teamsters was here. News flash: The Republican Party does not support unions. So my question is going to be, is there ever going to be a connection between the message Donald Trump has and this audience realizing that his policies don’t reflect it? These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump’s speech tonight will be a crowning moment for a politician who has defied massive odds to solidify his control over the GOP. The former president left the White House in 2021 having lost the election and incited a failed insurrection at the Capitol, with many prominent Republicans disavowing him. In the years that followed, he was relegated to the political sidelines as criminal investigations into his conduct after the 2020 election slowly progressed. He was indicted in four separate cases last year, and two months ago, one of those cases resulted in a conviction on 34 felony counts. He had initially been scheduled to be sentenced just four days before the start of the convention. Yet the past few weeks have seen a stunning turn of his fortunes. Biden’s disastrous debate performance has overshadowed Trump’s incessant lying, and the public narrative has shifted from Trump’s alleged criminal behavior to Biden’s age. Then the Supreme Court ruled in one of those criminal cases that, as president, Trump enjoys some immunity from prosecution, a decision that jeopardizes the other indictments against him and has delayed his sentencing in his hush money conviction. On Monday, the first day of the convention, the Florida classified documents case against him was dismissed by a judge. Trump, having narrowly survived an assassination attempt on Saturday, has also elevated his already-exalted stature within the party.  His moniker, “Teflon Don,” is perhaps more apt now than ever. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley just officially opened tonight's session. Several more presentations will take place before the speakers take the stage, including the invocation, the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of the National Anthem. Political conventions can make or break a career. But one of the breakout stars of the Republican National Convention this year appears to be the house band, which has ranked among the top searches on Google about the RNC over the last four days. The band, Sixwire, can be heard playing what could be described as “dad rock” during breaks and in between speeches, covering hit songs like “Don’t Stop Believin’” and “Life is a Highway.”  The Nashville-based band, which released one album back in 2002, has experience as a house band on reality TV shows such as “Nashville Star” and “Next Great American Band” and at various professional sports gigs. The investigation into the Trump assassination attempt continued this week as the RNC unfolded in Milwaukee. And while many details about the attack have come into focus, one key detail remains unknown: the shooter's motive. Federal investigators have been unable so far to determine the underlying ideology of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who fired at Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. As NBC News reported today: ""Investigators looked into his internet history and found that Crooks made searches this month specific to Trump, a rally, and the [Democratic National Convention], according to a senior U.S. law enforcement official."" Crooks was a registered Republican but also made a $15 donation to a progressive cause in 2021, according to NBC News. Despite the lack of evidence about a potential motive, some top Republicans immediately blamed Biden, Democrats and ""the media"" in the wake of the shooting. Let's see if Trump and his allies stick to the ""unity"" message they promised to deliver tonight. Ari Melber speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Trump's address tonight is significant and historic: a former president who was extremely close to an assassin’s bullet and death returning here to address his party and also the nation. And that is true regardless of one’s view of Trump, his policies or his politics. It’s true even for critics who note that he has not always extended sympathy or proper gravity after political violence targeting others. And that kind of debate is about whether other people uphold the civic and peaceful traditions and whether we do that regardless of what others do, what they do. The test for America right now ultimately is about us. For anyone who fails to consistently reject violence — well, that would be on them. For those who want to continue to uphold our civic values and peace and justice, it’s a different path. That’s the serious context for tonight’s address in a nation that has lived through so many attempted and completed assassinations. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. The Trump campaign has leaned heavily on celebrity endorsements this go-round. Many of the people with government experience and relevant knowledge from his first presidency — including Trump’s own vice president, of course — have refused to back him, with many painting the former president as a threat to democracy. In lieu of that support, the Trump campaign has tried to highlight its support from celebrities and influencers instead. The RNC has underscored this, relying on model Amber Rose to tell voters that the MAGA movement is welcoming to all people — a message undercut by the adherents’ widespread opposition to diversity measures and immigrants — and reality show participant Savannah Chrisley to push Trumpian falsehoods about politicized prosecutions. Tonight will be more of the same, as WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan, UFC president Dana White and country music singer Lee Greenwood are scheduled to speak. But this strategy seems to have limitations. A USA Today/Suffolk poll released in May showed that celebrity endorsements — with the exception of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama — have little to no impact on the overwhelming majority of voters’ decisions. Trump claimed in a pair of interviews last week that the acceptance speech he’d been ready to give tonight was tossed out. “I had all prepared an extremely tough speech, really good, all about the corrupt, horrible administration,” the former president told the New York Post. “But I threw it away.” Trump told the Washington Examiner: “The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger. Had this not happened, this would’ve been one of the most incredible speeches.” He added: “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now.” It’s unclear exactly who the actual author of the speech is, given that Trump is not known for drafting his own lengthy remarks and used ghostwriters for all of his books. Longtime aide Stephen Miller was the wordsmith behind his 2016 acceptance speech and most of Trump’s other major addresses in office. Quick update: The Washington Post actually reported earlier that the speech was originally drafted “by aides including campaign policy adviser Vince Haley and former White House adviser Stephen Miller,” before Trump “decided to overhaul much of the draft after Saturday’s assassination attempt.” If that’s the case, I can’t imagine that the newer draft didn’t get a polish from Miller and Haley, but I can believe that he gave a sense of what he wanted to say instead. Charlie Sykes speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We need to talk about how united this Republican Party is and how committed they are to this agenda. I think we need to take it seriously. Trump 2.0 will be much more serious, much more extreme than Trump 1.0. And we need to be very, very clear-eyed about what it would mean to have Donald Trump in the White House and 53 or 54 Republican senators. Anyone who thinks that they are not serious about this is naive. What right now are the guardrails? What are the limits? The Supreme Court has told Donald Trump that in effect, he is above the law. The law will not deter him. If he gets in, he doesn’t have to worry about impeachment. He won’t have to worry about Republicans pushing back against him. So as Democrats decide what they’re going to do, I think they really need to step back and go, ""You know, if we really do think that this is an existential crisis, maybe we should behave like it."" These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump is pretty freewheeling at his rallies, news conferences and TV interviews, but his two previous convention speeches (in 2016 and 2020) were among the few times he stuck to the script. But that script is still classic Trump, even if the rhetoric is more high-flown than usual. His 2016 convention speech stands out for its darkness. Nicknamed the “Midnight in America” speech by Time magazine, it described an America besieged by violent criminals, flooded with immigrants in the country illegally, humiliated abroad, and impoverished by bad policy choices. After the assassination attempt over the weekend, Trump said he was rewriting his speech to focus on unity and less on tearing down Biden’s record. We’ll see how much he follows through on that. But even if he aims for a more optimistic tone, the dark moments will still be there.  His 2020 convention speech is a good example of how this could play out. As the incumbent, he couldn’t repeat his previous approach and he began by talking about how he was “brimming with confidence” about the nation’s future. But that tone soon faded as he began contrasting the choice between re-electing him or voting for a “socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny” and “give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” “In this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,” he said. We’ll see tonight which direction Trump goes with this speech, whether it’s more like his 2016 speech, his 2020 speech or a new thing entirely. As Republicans prepare to fete Trump tonight, Democrats appear to be edging closer to the tipping point for Biden to withdraw as major figures in the party reportedly have spoken with the president and his allies about his chances in November and as big donations slow down dramatically, according to NBC News. Some of Biden’s fiercest backers are privately conceding that the end of his candidacy seems inevitable now, NBC News reported, with one person close to the president saying: “We’re close to the end.” Sen. Chuck Schumer had a “blunt” discussion with Biden about the race. Rep. Nancy Pelosi reportedly told Biden that he cannot win and that he could jeopardize Democrats’ hold on the House. And even former President Barack Obama has told allies that Biden should “seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,” according to The Washington Post. None of these top Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside, but this reporting only adds to the pressure on the president. The New York Times reports that Biden himself may be resigned to dropping out. ""Several people close to President Biden,"" reports the Times, ""said on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race, bowing to the growing demands of many anxious members of his party."" The Times also reports that Biden is getting particularly strong pushback from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""In a recent call, when Mr. Biden insisted he had polls showing he could win, Ms. Pelosi said 'put [Biden senior adviser Mike] Donilon on the phone,' so she could cite her own polls showing the opposite — a direct challenge to the president and an implication that he was not being fully informed."" Last weekend’s shooting apparently is on Trump’s mind as he prepares to give his speech tonight. A source told NBC News that the former president looked around while being shown the stage where he’d be speaking and commented that it’s a lot safer inside. It will be interesting to see when Trump resumes outdoor rallies and whether his demeanor will be different in comparison with indoor events. A senior Trump adviser said Thursday that Project 2025 is a “pain in the ass” for the campaign. Trump has sought, unsuccessfully, to distance himself from the 920-page plans for a second term put together by the far-right Heritage Foundation think tank led by several of his former staffers. That’s largely because the proposal includes a lot of unpopular ideas, such as dismantling the Department of Education and withdrawing Food and Drug Administration approval of abortion pills. In a Politico-sponsored event at the Republican convention, senior Trump adviser Chris LaCivita said that the think tank’s proposals aren’t helping. “The issues that are going to win us this campaign are not the issues that they want to talk about,” he said, blaming the media for talking about them as well. “And you guys know it which is the reason why you write about it.” He also mocked the authors as nobodies, even though they include Trump’s own former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, his former acting Defense secretary, his former Housing and Urban Development secretary, his former deputy chief of staff, and his former Justice Department senior counsel. “Let’s go find another guy who worked, you know, cleaning up the West Wing or some back office who’s going to write a policy statement and you guys are going to write a story about it,” LaCivita said, sarcastically. Vought, it should be noted, is not only one of the key authors of Project 2025 but also the Republican National Committee’s platform policy director. Though it was reported last week that Melania Trump would attend the RNC, marking a rare public appearance by the elusive former first lady, she has been noticeably absent from the event so far. She is expected to show up for her husband's speech, and though she addressed the 2016 and 2020 conventions, she isn't scheduled to speak tonight. It's unclear why she has decided not to attend much of the RNC this year. Some people close to Melania Trump reportedly say she's shaken by the assassination attempt against her husband. But, as NBC News reported, she's largely avoided public events since before the shooting and has only joined a handful of events on the campaign trail. Read more below: While Nikki Haley espouses or accommodates many MAGA values, she still waged war against Trump during the primaries by attacking his character and calling him unfit for office. She described him as “totally unhinged” and pushed back against his thirst for “revenge.” She warned that he is “declining” cognitively and called him a “toxic” agent of “chaos” who lacks “moral clarity.” And she diverged from a key pillar of the MAGA worldview by stating that America doesn’t “rig elections” and acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.  Nonetheless, Haley offered Trump an endorsement that was not only full-throated, but even helped revise his record and boosted him in an area where she has had sharp policy differences from him in the past: foreign policy. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, Haley diverged from Trump by staking out more hawkish positions on Russia than he did, including by making clear her belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. During the primaries, Haley denounced Trump for encouraging Russia to attack NATO allies. But in her RNC speech, Haley praised Trump as a guarantor of a “strong America” and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden — you know, the guy who is a NATO traditionalist and helped organize an unprecedented sanctions regime against Putin. Read more below: Trump's and Biden’s running mates may not have agreed to terms for a debate yet, but Vice President Kamala Harris is already gearing up. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Thursday, Harris said that Vance told a “compelling story” about his life at the convention but argued that “it was not the full story.” She went on to talk about Project 2025, saying it’s “extreme” and “divisive."" She argued that the Trump-Vance campaign has not lived up to its promise of unity. “If you claim to stand for unity, you need to do more than just use the word,” she said. “You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity and dignity.” She went on to criticize the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and proposals to cut access to abortion and cut taxes for the wealthy. Today's session features the theme ""Make America Great Again"" — what else? — and is scheduled to begin at 6:45 p.m. ET and end around 10:30 p.m. ET. More than a dozen Trump allies will address the convention tonight before the nominee takes the stage as the final speaker. Kid Rock is slated to perform right before Trump speaks. Here are the speakers, in order of expected appearance: It’s noteworthy how much this week has been designed to play up Trump’s purported toughness. Because Trump has modeled himself after dictators and authoritarians around the globe, this was likely on the campaign’s vision board even before last weekend’s shooting at a Trump rally. But in the wake of that attack, it was all but guaranteed that Republicans would want to portray Trump like a war hero. (Some supporters at the RNC have donned an ersatz ear bandage in a nod to Trump's injured ear.) Trump’s surrogates have gone to great lengths over the last few days to portray him as the candidate of choice for macho guys. For example, check out some of these clips of UFC President Dana White, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and far-right activist Charlie Kirk gushing over Trump, trying to convince men that the former president is the strong man they’ve always wanted to see in charge.  For more on this PR campaign, check out my previous blogs here, here and here. Tonight’s speakers include former WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan, who has connections to Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Hogan helped bankrupt Gawker Media after winning a lawsuit over the publishing of a sex tape. It was later revealed that Thiel had financed the lawsuit. Thiel was a big backer of Trump in 2016 and even had a prime speaking spot at that year’s RNC, but later broke with him. Another big tie to Thiel: Trump’s running mate. Thiel hired Vance at his venture capital firm and later spent $15 million to help elect him to the Senate. Looming over the RNC is the unsettled question of who the Trump-Vance ticket will run against in November. Whether Biden ends up as the Democratic nominee is still up in the air, and that uncertainty has been reflected at the convention in how often the speakers have attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, who seems among the most likely options to replace Biden at the top of the ticket should he withdraw. It’s also plausible that Trump will seek to contrast the disarray among Democrats with Republicans’ show of unity under his leadership this week. The official RNC calendar this week features several showings of ""Reagan,"" an upcoming biopic about Ronald Reagan. The movie, which has been under development for 14 years, is set to be released in August, but it will probably never have a better audience than this week. (Watch a trailer for it here.) It’s clearly a movie aimed mainly at conservatives; it's based on a book by an author whose other works include “The Devil and Karl Marx” and another about American progressives called “Dupes.” Dennis Quaid stars as Reagan in a bit of stunt casting that is less about looking like Reagan and more about hitting a similar level of Hollywood stardom (although he nails the voice.) The movie also features arch-conservative actors Jon Voight and Kevin Sorbo and in another bit of stunt casting, the lead singer of Creed as Frank Sinatra.  Anticipation for Trump’s speech tonight is higher than ever after Saturday’s shocking turn of events. After quite literally dodging a bullet to survive an assassination attempt, the GOP nominee has claimed to want to unite the country. He told the New York Post that he ditched a previous convention speech that he said was “all about the corrupt, horrible administration” and was rewriting a new one focused on unity. On the campaign trail, Trump has frequently hit the same notes in his speeches, using similar terms to criticize Biden and Democrats, vowing to punish his political enemies and lamenting what he characterizes as the country’s downward trajectory. As he receives a hero’s welcome from his party tonight, his ability to stick to this ostensible new message of unity — after years and years of railing against his perceived foes — is likely to be sorely tested."
Trump’s RNC speech proved again there’s never a ‘New Trump’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-rnc-acceptance-speech-rcna162654,"For a minute there, former President Donald Trump sounded different on Thursday night. “Whether you’ve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American Dream,” Trump told a sea of conservative believers at the Republican National Convention. “With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country.” The acceptance speech he delivered lacked the soaring phrasing of Ronald Reagan telling the RNC crowd in 1980 that “the time is now, my fellow Americans, to recapture our destiny, to take it into our own hands.” The overall tone of the prepared text distributed ahead of his speech was a far cry from his first acceptance speech eight years ago, let alone his inauguration address, later dubbed the “American Carnage” speech. It was a shift in line with the reported “new softness” he’d displayed since last week’s assassination attempt. As with most things Trump, though, any shift away from his usual bombast was surface level — at best. The facade of a new Trump evaporated quickly, just like the last several times we were promised a new Trump. Even when he has managed to momentarily project a calmer persona, a state that lasted only minutes into an address that broke records as the longest acceptance speech ever, Trump remains substantively the same: impulsive, xenophobic and more than happy to go on the attack in exchange for the applause of a crowd. In his remarks, Trump initially portrayed himself as a happy warrior, one fighting for all Americans, in sharp contrast to his usual polemics against Democrats. “Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” he intoned toward the beginning of his speech. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.” If you’d handed me that quote before Thursday night, I would have sooner guessed it came from President Joe Biden or almost any other political figure before I ever landed on Trump. In promising to be the “president for ALL of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,” Trump played against type in a way that I hadn’t expected even having read the reporting that he’d torn up his original speech in the aftermath of the shooting. But despite promising unity, his speech only grew Trumpier as it continued, as he leaned into his worst instincts, riffing to the crowd’s delight as he threw it red meat. Even in the prepared text, though, he was still disparaging of LGBTQ Americans when declaring “we will not have men playing in women’s sports.” It was still filled with lies about a supposed surge in crime fueled by migrants sneaking across the border. It still framed the criminal cases against him as partisan witch hunts from Democrats, rather than the results of his own actions. It was still packed with pie crust promises, easily made and easily broken, that “incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never before.” It is hard to find the unity in promising to “launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country,” darkly warning that “bad things are going to happen” otherwise. He miraculously managed to (mostly) avoid directly attacking Biden, using his name directly only once, saying the “damage he’s done to the country is unthinkable.” But I’m pressed to find anything meant to win over skeptical Republicans who couldn’t bring themselves to vote for him in the primary campaign, let alone disenchanted Democrats and independents. Even if he did rewrite the speech he was prepared to give as he claimed, Trump couldn’t help but go off script and attack “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” drawing boos from the crowd, and accusing Democrats of “destroying our country” and “cheating at elections.” There was nothing he said that contradicted the conservative agenda laid out in Project 2025, even as he urged listeners to “rise above past differences and disagreements and go forward united, as one people and one nation.” In the end, Trump may have offered to “a hand of loyalty and friendship” to “every citizen, whether you are young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic,” but he did little to disguise the racism and fearmongering at the heart of his campaign. The Trump we saw on display Thursday night wasn’t the chastened, humbled man some predicted might be on display. It was exactly the Trump we’ve come to know over the last nine years. The bottom line is this: Donald Trump still wants the same things for this country that he did before Saturday’s attempt on his life and is still willing to do it in the least unifying way possible."

Jamie Raskin urged President Joe Biden to reconsider his re-election bid, joining dozens of other prominent Democrats who have publicly called for their presumptive nominee to step aside. In his four-page letter, first reported by The New York Times and later obtained by NBC News, Raskin doesn't explicitly call for Biden to drop out. Rather, he warns that the country is ""under siege every day by the autocrats and monarchists, from Moscow to Mar-A-Lago"" and that the stakes of the November election are high. ""I am not writing to presume to tell you what to do, Mr. President, because that is up to you and Jill and your family entirely,"" Rasking wrote, adding: ""No one envies the choice you must make now, Mr. President, but remember this as the great politician you are and have always been."" ""The hard questions that have been raised about your mental and physical stamina ... are not just medical and scientific questions now,"" he added. ""They are also political questions because both political leaders and tens of millions of voting citizens have formed judgments based on the events of the last few weeks.""

Joe Biden has big plans — and terrible timing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 2:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-campaign-second-term-agenda-rcna162330,"Timing has not been President Joe Biden’s strong suit lately. Hours after he declared in an interview released Wednesday that he would consider ending his campaign if doctors told him he had “some medical issue,” the White House announced he had tested positive for Covid. The only reason his exit is even being discussed is his performance in the first debate with former President Donald Trump. It was his team’s decision to hold the abnormally early faceoff before the Democratic National Convention, leaving enough time for second thoughts about his candidacy to percolate. Among the fears his performance sparked is whether, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem argued, his campaign has been too focused being anti-Trump rather than presenting a second-term policy agenda. With that in mind, it makes sense that Biden finally has begun to roll out his plans for what he’ll do if he wins. You’d be forgiven if you missed the announcement for his plan for the first 100 days of his second term. It came during a Friday night event in Detroit — the day before the failed assassination attempt on Trump. Such has been the case for Biden the last several weeks, as forces outside his direct control have overshadowed his attempts to steady his wavering campaign. Biden’s pitch for his second term included some familiar agenda items, unfinished business from when the Democrats held both houses of Congress in his first two years. He pledged that the first bill he sends Congress will be to “restore Roe v. Wade to make it the law of the land.” Biden also said that he’d sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, both of which ran into a Republican filibuster when last presented to the Senate in 2022. Other portions of his proposed plans would expand or codify actions his administration has already taken. Last month, Vice President Kamala Harris and Lena Khan, head of the Federal Trade Commission, announced a new rule that would ban medical debt from being included in credit reports. Biden said on Friday that he would go after medical debt writ large if he returned to the White House, drawing applause from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Likewise, he vowed to cap insulin costs at $35 per month for all Americans with diabetes, the same way the the Inflation Reduction Act did for Medicare enrollees. But there were some new announcements in his speech that will hopefully get more attention over the coming months. One was a pledge to finally tackle the cost of housing, a crisis that affects Americans across the country. Biden told the crowd that he’d advocate a plan to “build 2 million housing units and cap rent increases at 5% a year so corporate landlords can no longer gouge everyone like they’re doing.” Since then, his administration has already rolled out details on his new housing plan in hopes of getting traction on the issue ahead of November. And while it wasn’t mentioned in his Friday address, we’ve also learned that that he’s developing a proposal to reform the Supreme Court, a major shift for him to address Democrats’ angst over the deeply conservative court and the ethics scandals circling several of the justices. On the one hand, this is exactly what Zeeshan was calling for in his piece, offering up a substantive, positive agenda to counter Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next GOP president’s agenda. It also reportedly comes after progressives like Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., threw Biden a political lifeline following the initial calls for him to step aside. Looking down ballot, announcing these policies now also gives Democrats running for Congress items to sell to their voters, as many of them would require retaking the House and retaining the Senate. The immediate question, though, isn’t whether these are good policies — which they are, offering up a clear difference for Americans about what a Democratic president will do compared to Trump. For that matter, it’s not even about whether it will move the needle for undecided voters ahead of this fall. That’s a question that’s more up in the air, as a Gallup poll from last month showed that more independents surveyed said that Biden is too liberal than thought Trump is too conservative. Instead, the question has become whether Biden would necessarily be the one to implement those policies next year. While the intense scrutiny he’s faced since the debate has been a bit much at times, it was still eyebrow raising when he mangled his housing policy when speaking at the NAACP earlier this week. And after a brief respite in the aftermath of this weekend’s shooting, the tide against him remaining in the race has continued to pummel him. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., became the most prominent Democrat to publicly call for Biden to drop out in favor of another candidate. Hours later, the White House announced that he has Covid, taking him off the campaign trail. Curiously, Biden’s inability to sell these second-term policies on the stump for the next few days highlights how few of them are uniquely associated with Biden. Much of what’s been announced could easily be the position of any Democrat running for president in 2024. Without a competitive primary season to distinguish between the alternative candidates whose names have been floated, the debate has been over who voters will believe is best equipped to win against Trump. Maybe that wouldn’t have been the case if Biden had started making his case earlier — but, again, timing is everything here."
"Thursday’s Mini-Report, 7.18.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/thursdays-mini-report-71724-rcna162594,"Today’s edition of quick hits. * On Capitol Hill: “The Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee issued a subpoena Wednesday to the Secret Service director compelling her to appear before the committee on Monday for what is scheduled to be the first congressional hearing into the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.” * In related news: “[I]n addition to the Congressional inquiries, [Director Kimberly Cheatle] and the Secret Service are also facing an inquiry by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general.” * More information on the shooter: “The 20-year-old Pennsylvania man who tried to kill former president Donald Trump at a rally last weekend had searched online for information about Trump and President Biden and had photos of both men saved on his phone, according to lawmakers and others briefed on the investigation. ... In addition to Trump and Biden, the shooter had photos of Attorney General Merrick Garland and a member of the British royal family saved on his phone, two people familiar with the probe said.” * This White House sure is serious about student loan debt relief: “The Biden administration announced Thursday it will cancel $1.2 billion in student debt for 35,000 workers, as a result of its recent fixes to a popular debt relief program for public service workers.” * On the other hand: “A federal appeals court blocked the implementation of the Biden administration’s student debt relief plan, which would have lowered monthly payments for millions of borrowers. In a ruling Thursday, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a motion for an administrative stay filed by a group of Republican-led states seeking to invalidate the administration’s entire student loan forgiveness program.” * A case worth watching: “The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the former CEO of the blank-check company that merged with Trump Media, accusing him of lying about his firm’s plans to combine with Donald Trump’s social media startup. Patrick Orlando allegedly lied in public filings when he said his company, Digital World Acquisition Corp., had not contacted any possible merger targets and had no specific merger plans, the commission said in the lawsuit filed Wednesday night in Washington, D.C., federal court.” * Onto the 11th Circuit: “Special counsel Jack Smith formally filed notice on Wednesday that he will appeal a Florida judge’s decision to dismiss Donald Trump’s 40-count indictment for allegedly mishandling classified documents and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.” * A familiar face in Nevada politics: “Michele Fiore, a Nevada politician known for her fiery brand of conservatism, was indicted on fraud charges on Tuesday for what prosecutors said was a scheme to spend charitable donations on personal expenses.” See you tomorrow."
"With Roe gone, abortion foes tee up another precedent for the Supreme Court to overturn",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 1:55 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-abortion-clinic-hill-v-colorado-rcna162543,"When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority complained that prior abortion rulings had “distorted First Amendment doctrines.” The case the court cited for that proposition was Hill v. Colorado, a 2000 decision that upheld a law that barred approaching people without consent outside of a health care facility for the purpose of leafletting, displaying signs, protesting, educating or counseling.  A new petition to the justices this week asks the court to overrule Hill — and there’s reason to think the court will do it. Hill was decided 6-3 in 2000, when the court’s composition was much different than it is today (as one may have guessed from the Dobbs majority’s disapproving citation). Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented in Hill, is the only justice from that original ruling who is still on the court. The new petition comes from the anti-abortion group Coalition Life. It challenges a Carbondale, Illinois, ordinance that it says is virtually identical to the one that the court upheld in Hill, which set the zone within 100 feet outside a facility and within 8 feet of a person. “The lower courts had no choice but to uphold that carbon-copy measure,” the group said in the petition filed by the group's legal representatives, the Thomas More Society and Paul Clement, a top conservative Supreme Court lawyer. “This Court has a better option,” it said: overrule Hill.  The city has an opportunity to respond before the court considers whether to grant review, which takes four justices. Based on the majority’s negative reference to Hill in the Dobbs decision — on top of the court’s First Amendment rulings since Hill — it appears there are at least that many justices who would consider overturning Hill. And Coalition Life's is not the only petition seeking to ditch the 2000 precedent.

Why JD Vance’s record on abortion rights matters in 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-record-abortion-rights-trump-2024-race-rcna162554,"NBC News published an interesting report in March on Donald Trump’s search for a new running mate and the importance the former president had placed on abortion rights. The Republican, the report noted, was “laser-focused on the abortion issue, especially when it comes to his vice presidential pick,” mindful of the Democratic advantage on the issue. NBC News quoted a source close to Trump saying, “He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position.” To be sure, “too staunch” is a matter of perspective, but if the presumptive GOP nominee tapped Sen. JD Vance for the ticket assuming that his views on reproductive rights would seem mainstream, Trump made a poor choice. Take this Washington Post report, for example. Unfortunately for the Republican ticket, this is just one of many relevant data points. While Trump has avoided endorsing a national abortion ban, for example, CNN reported that Vance, during his Senate candidacy, said, “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.” Vance, the year before reaching Capitol Hill, said at the time, “I’m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here’s a situation — let’s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let’s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately Black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity — uh, that’s kind of creepy.” “And, and it’s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?” Vance said, “I’m pretty sympathetic to that actually. So, you know, how hopefully we get to a point where Ohio bans abortion in California and the Soroses of the world respect it.” The comments are hardly ancient history: The Republican said this just two years ago. What’s more, Vance’s campaign website described him as “100 percent pro-life” — under a headline that read, “END ABORTION” — though the text was quietly removed after Trump chose him for the GOP ticket. In case that weren’t quite enough, Talking Points Memo ran a related report this week, noting that the Biden administration finalized new regulations under HIPAA that limited law enforcement access to medical records tied to reproductive health. Eight Republican senators pushed back against the administration’s efforts — and Vance was one of the eight. And did I mention that Vance publicly endorsed his home state’s six-week abortion ban, which does not include exceptions for rape or incest? Because he did that, too. All of which brings us back to the concerns Trump reportedly expressed in the spring. “He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position”? By any fair measure, Vance is one of the Senate’s most far-right Republicans when it comes to reproductive rights, with a series of beliefs that most Americans would see as extreme."
Why haven’t Senate Republicans called on Bob Menendez to resign?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 10:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/havent-senate-republicans-called-bob-menendez-resign-rcna162379,"Sen. Bob Menendez was already facing a bleak political and legal future, but things went from bad to worse for the New Jersey Democrat after a jury found him guilty on 16 federal corruption counts. Ahead of the verdict, most of his colleagues in the Senate Democratic conference had called for Menendez’s resignation, and after the verdict, the number grew — quickly. Indeed, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wasted no time in calling for Menendez to step down. Others, including Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, raised the prospect of expelling their criminal colleague if he failed to resign. But it was a point from another member of the Senate Democratic leadership that stood out for me. NBC News reported: “I strongly reiterate my call for him to step down,” Murray said in a written statement. “No one is above the law — it’s pretty straightforward. Now if only my Republican colleagues would apply the same standards to the convicted felon who is running for President of the United States as their nominee.” In fact, while the list of Senate Democrats calling on Menendez to resign grew — and continues to grow — there was no comparable push among Senate Republicans. GOP senators learned that one of their colleagues had just been convicted on corruption charges, but they made no real effort to show him the door. Circling back to our earlier coverage, there might very well be an ideological dimension to this: When it comes to foreign policy, Menendez is to the right of most of his Democratic colleagues. Senate Republicans could be content to have him stick around because, on matters related to international affairs, they agree with him quite a bit — and no matter which Democrat replaced him, the GOP would almost certainly disagree with him or her more. But Murray’s point is ultimately the more persuasive one: If Republicans were to agree that Menendez’s crimes leave him unfit for office, it would almost certainly mean that Donald Trump is equally unsuitable for positions of public trust. For most Democrats, there’s no inconsistency to reconcile: They’re comfortable saying Trump has disqualified himself and showing Menendez the door. But for the GOP, it’s apparently easier to stay silent on Menendez than to try to explain why the senator should resign but the Republican Party’s felonious presumptive nominee should return to the White House.

Voters’ incredulity gives Trump an important edge in 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/voters-incredulity-gives-trump-important-edge-2024-race-rcna162534,"Before Donald Trump took over Republican politics, most of the party exercised some caution while targeting immigrants. The political calculus was simple: GOP officials and candidates didn’t want to risk a voter backlash, especially in Latino communities. Trump, however, felt comfortable testing those assumptions. He used racist rhetoric toward immigrants in 2016, for example, but nevertheless fared better among Latino voters than Mitt Romney did four years earlier. He implemented ugly anti-immigrant policies while in office — even separating Latino children from their families and locking them in cages — and his share of the Latino vote went up, not down. As part of the former president’s comeback bid, the Republican has targeted migrants with dehumanizing rhetoric that echoes Hitler, all while promising to create militarized mass deportations and detention camps if voters reward him with a second term. He’s even talked about putting migrants into a ring to fight for Americans’ entertainment. It’s against this backdrop that Republican National Convention attendees waved professionally made “MASS DEPORTATIONS NOW!” signs, while chanting “Send them back” on the convention floor. And Trump nevertheless expects to fare even better among Latino voters in 2024, and recent polling suggests none of his recent antics have hurt him with Latino voters at all. There are a variety of possible explanations for this, but a New York Times report published this week raised an important point about public perception: In other words, these Latino voters are well aware of the fact that Trump says he wants militarized mass deportations and detention camps, but they don’t believe he’ll actually follow through on such a policy. It’s a position that effectively says, “I’ll vote for the guy because I assume he’s lying.” If you spend enough time online you’ll probably see references to the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party. This summary is as good as any: “Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party refers to a parody of regretful voters who vote for cruel and unjust policies (and politicians) and are then surprised when their own lives become worse as a result.” It appears to have started in 2015 with someone who wrote, “‘I never thought leopards would eat MY face,’ sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party.” It came to mind reading about voters who oppose mass deportations but who nevertheless plan to vote for the candidate running on a platform of mass deportations. Stepping back, there’s a larger phenomenon to keep in mind. For many years, focus group participants have expressed great skepticism when confronted with accurate information about Republican policies. Provided with the truth, many voters found it impossible to believe that GOP proposals were real because the measures simply sounded too radical. As New York magazine’s Jon Chait summarized several years ago, focus group participants have received facts about Republican plans, but the truth “struck those voters as so cartoonishly evil that they found the charge implausible.” If the Times’ report is accurate, many Latino voters are responding to Trump’s deportation plans the same way. “It’s all just campaign talk,” they apparently assume. “It won’t be that bad.” For all the talk about Americans being cynical, sometimes they’re not quite cynical enough. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
A reminder of why former Trump adviser Peter Navarro actually went to prison,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/peter-navarro-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162498,"Fresh out of prison, Peter Navarro told the crowd at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that “if they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful: They will come for you.” Putting aside the fact that the Supreme Court’s recent immunity ruling broadly insulated Trump from criminal liability, Navarro is correct — to the extent that anyone who fails to comply with a congressional subpoena does risk prosecution. But Navarro's remarks to the party don’t signal a full appreciation for why he was incarcerated. The former Trump White House adviser cast his prosecution for contempt of Congress and his imprisonment as part of an unjust Democratic plot against him and the Constitution. The truth is simpler: Navarro was convicted after he failed to comply with a subpoena from the House Jan. 6 select committee. He told the crowd in Milwaukee that the committee demanded he violate executive privilege and betray Trump, but that he refused. Yet, a court found that Trump didn’t assert or authorize Navarro to assert privilege in the first place. Navarro’s narrative of Democratic “lawfare” by all three branches of government is further complicated by the fact that, in the end, it was the same Roberts Court that bestowed broad immunity on the president that also declined to keep Navarro out of prison while he appeals his conviction. To be sure, Navarro’s underlying appeal is still pending, and the court could still take up the issue someday, whether in his or in Steve Bannon’s appeal, which is also pending. (Bannon is currently locked up after the court similarly declined to keep him free while he appeals his contempt of Congress conviction.) But contrary to Navarro’s RNC claim that he “went to prison so you won’t have to” — whatever that even means — he went to prison because he failed to comply with a subpoena, was convicted at trial, and even the GOP-supermajority Supreme Court didn’t see fit to keep him free during his appeal."

Trump-owned company sells shoes with image from assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 8:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-owned-company-sells-shoes-image-assassination-attempt-rcna162513,"As difficult as this might be to believe, the Associated Press reported that people can now purchase $299 sneakers featuring an image of Donald Trump with his fist in the air after Saturday’s assassination attempt. As part of the pitch — which I am not making up — prospective buyers have been told, “These limited edition high-tops, featuring Trump’s iconic image with his fist raised, honor his unwavering determination and bravery. With only 5,000 pairs available, each one is a true collector’s item. Show your support and patriotic pride with these exclusive sneakers, capturing a defining moment in history.” These are not to be confused with the $399 Trump-related gold high-tops, which are also sold by the same Trump-owned company, which the Republican candidate’s campaign officials have promoted online. In fact, for consumers with a special fondness for the former president, there’s a seemingly endless stream of other products to choose from. Remember “the only Bible endorsed“ by Trump? And the “official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection”? All of which comes on the heels of the steaks and the board game? How about Trump selling off pieces of the suit he wore while taking his mug shot after one of his criminal indictments? On a related note, after the Republican was arraigned in Atlanta, his political operation started selling mug shot-related campaign swag — including, but not limited to, mugs, sweatshirts and beverage coolers. One could presumably wear the mug shot sweatshirt while also wearing “Victory 47” cologne and perfume — available for just $99. I’m reminded of a recent Washington Post analysis with a great headline: “Trump used to sell the perception of opulence. Now he just sells Trump.” That was true when the piece was published in February. As the shoes featuring an image related to his assassination attempt help prove, the situation appears vastly worse now."
"Out of prison, Peter Navarro receives hero’s welcome at RNC",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 6:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prison-peter-navarro-receives-heros-welcome-rnc-rcna162484,"On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird boasted about her party’s approach to law enforcement: “We put criminals where they belong: in jail.” She neglected to add, “And also on the RNC stage.” One Republican speaker after another on Tuesday night denounced those who ran afoul of the law. “Cops are good, criminals are bad,” Montana Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy declared. “Donald Trump stands with the people and the police — our men and women in blue — not with the criminals and rioters,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer added. The obvious problem with the rhetoric was the fact that a jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies — which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault — who’s running on a platform rooted in his support for rioters. The less obvious problem is who would speak to the convention the day after attendees were told “criminals are bad.” As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained, former White House adviser Peter Navarro was scheduled to speak at his party’s gathering, just hours after being released from federal prison. We now know that’s precisely what happened — and how he was received. NBC News reported: For those who might’ve missed his appearance, convention attendees didn’t just give the released criminal a standing ovation, they also chanted, “Welcome home.” Part of what made all of this notable was the jarring contradiction: Navarro, a member of the so-called “Team of Felons,” was celebrated as a hero at the Republican National Convention literally one day after the party pushed a “criminals are bad” message. Complicating matters was the former White House’s adviser’s rhetoric. Navarro declared, for example, that the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee “demanded” that he “betray Donald John Trump” and “break the law.” That wasn’t even close to being true. But stepping back, there’s a larger context to consider. Why in the world would the RNC invite a criminal to the convention stage, just hours after his release and one day after touting a “law and order” message? Because as Rubin’s piece explained, “The party’s embrace of Navarro fits well within its ‘law and order’ mantra, which doesn’t mandate a literal application of the law but is rather about maintaining a certain social order.” Quite right. I’m reminded of a New York Times op-ed that MSNBC’s Chris Hayes wrote in 2018: Navarro is on the right “team,” which — as far as Republicans are concerned — transforms his criminality into nobility."
JD Vance’s ‘populism’ comes with some Trump-written fine print,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-populism-2024-trump-election-fine-print-rcna162409,"On the first night of the Republican National Convention, the party focused on “Making America Wealthy Again,” despite the fact that the United States has the strongest economy on the planet and is currently “the envy of the world.” On the second night, Republicans emphasized a “law and order” message, despite the fact that the party has nominated a criminal to lead its presidential ticket. On the third night of the gathering in Milwaukee, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee tried to sell voters on the idea that the party is prepared to shift its focus away from the wealthy elite as Donald Trump pitches tax breaks for billionaires at his glorified country club. Perhaps the “Make America Great Again” theme should be replaced with “Impose Cognitive Dissonance on America Again.” Voters unfamiliar with Sen. JD Vance might’ve tuned in to his convention speech, if for no other reason than to see and hear what the Ohio Republican had to say as he introduced himself to a national audience. His remarks were notable for a variety of reasons, though it was his economic vision that stood out. From the transcript of his remarks: The senator added soon after that he sees Trump as “America’s last best hope” for the nation’s working class. Vance went on to say, “We need a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business.” For viewers who didn’t know better, Vance’s rhetoric might very well have sounded like a refreshing break from party orthodoxy. It’s not exactly a secret that the Republican Party has championed the interests of the wealthy and corporate America for generations, so Vance’s version of “populism” appeared to represent an important shift. There was, however, a rather dramatic problem hanging overhead: Trump’s record and future plans. Indeed, literally one day before Vance boasted about Republicans no longer “catering to Wall Street,” the GOP’s presumptive presidential nominee boasted about his eagerness to slash the corporate tax rate in a prospective second term. The same day, The New York Times published a striking report on the degree to which Trump’s plans for trade tariffs would “widen the gap between the rich and the poor” and hit “lower-income households” the hardest. This is the same Trump who not only rewarded the wealthy and big businesses with massive tax giveaways in his first term, but who also supports undoing Wall Street safeguards — which helps explain why billionaires are rallying behind his candidacy. As for Vance’s idea that the United States needs ""a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business,” the Washington Post recently reported on the former president recently huddling with Big Oil leaders at Mar-a-Lago. If the account is accurate, the Republicans’ presumptive presidential nominee told the oil industry executives that they should raise $1 billion to return him to the White House — and if they did, he’d reward them by eliminating environmental safeguards and approving new tax breaks. The “deal” that Trump described, the Post added, “stunned several of the executives in the room.” Soon after, three oil executives organized an event for Trump — attendees paid $250,000 per person to be there — where the Republican assured his wealthy supporters that he’d do everything the oil industry wants, including lifting the natural gas export ban, scrapping existing energy safeguards and opening up more federal lands to oil drilling. After Vance exited the convention stage, I was left with one question: Does he have any idea what his new boss intends to do after the election?"
The worst thing about Ted Cruz’s dystopian RNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speech-ted-cruz-immigration-border-control-rcna162400,"If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the last nine years, it’s that when reality proves inconvenient for MAGA, MAGA simply creates its own reality. This was certainly true of Tuesday’s “Make America Safe Once Again” night at the Republican National Convention, at which the speaker’s podium was the rhetorical equivalent of a wrench-opened fire hydrant, as one speaker after another recklessly sprayed lies, fear and demagoguery in every direction.  Sen. Ted Cruz’s undiluted rage was particularly dishonest, and because it was Ted Cruz, it was as awkward as it was angry. His clumsy attempt to coax the crowd into a refrain of “every damn day” — a reference to how often he claimed that “teenagers, girls and boys” are raped, murdered and “sold into a life of sex slavery” because of “our open border” — mostly fell flat.  There are, of course, some documented examples of horrific crimes committed by undocumented people, as there are with any demographic group that numbers in the millions. But on the whole, immigrants both legal and undocumented commit crimes (violent crimes, in particular) at rates lower — often much lower — than the native-born population.  The much-maligned “sanctuary cities” have lower crime rates than other cities. Cities that have been hospitable to migrants seeking asylum have seen less crime than other cities. Crime in most of those cities has dropped since they began receiving migrants from the most recent wave of immigration, including the cities where Republican governors have been shipping migrants.  If such gruesome crimes were really happening “every damn day,” you’d think Cruz, R-Texas, could find more a recent horror story than, for example, the death of Kate Steinle, who died, as Cruz put it, after a man who “had been deported five times” fired a bullet that “ripped through her heart.”  If that name sounds familiar, it’s because Donald Trump also mentioned Steinle in his acceptance speech at the 2016 RNC. Steinle died nine years ago, after a man named José Inez García Zárate found a gun wrapped in cloth under a bench on a pier in San Francisco.  It’s true that Zárate had been deported five times. He was also a felon, though for nonviolent drug crimes. The gun had been stolen from an agent with the Bureau of Land Management, who left it unsecured in his car. Zárate testified at his trial that the gun went off when he picked it up. Ballistics reports confirmed that the bullet ricocheted off a concrete block and struck and killed Steinle, who was 90 feet away. There is no evidence that he intentionally fired the gun, much less that he intended to kill Steinle. A jury acquitted him on all charges but one (being a felon in possession of a firearm), and that charge was later thrown out by a judge. He pleaded guilty to related federal charges in 2022 and was deported this year. Steinle’s family has repeatedly asked politicians to stop politicizing her death. For politicians like Cruz, a family’s grief is legitimate only when it can be harnessed to hoover up votes.  Cruz also claimed that “Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children,” reiterating the central claim of conspiracists who push the racist “great replacement theory.” There is, of course, no evidence that undocumented people vote in significant numbers, that there’s some coordinated campaign to get them to the polls or that voting plays any role in the Biden administration’s immigration policy. (There is also evidence that Biden has actually been tougher on illegal border crossers than Trump.)   House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., repeated Trump’s brazen lie about other countries’ “emptying prisons” by sending their felons to the U.S. (Trump often includes “mental institutions” in his claim). There’s no evidence this is true. Ironically, it’s a line first used by Fidel Castro to denigrate refugees fleeing his communist regime and that Republicans today often use to slander Venezuelan migrants fleeing the socialist government of Nicolás Maduro.  Several speakers also repeated the tired claim that fentanyl has been flowing through the border because of the Biden administration’s lax enforcement.  According to data compiled by Dan Bier of the Cato Institute, just 2 of every 10,000 people caught trying to enter the country illegally possess any fentanyl at all. Over 90% of fentanyl seizures come at legal points of entry, and 86% of people convicted of smuggling the drug are U.S. citizens. Moreover, smuggling of fentanyl, which is easier to conceal and far more concentrated than other illicit drugs, actually increased during the Covid travel restrictions. The idea that Biden has been lax on border enforcement will come as a surprise to the immigrant advocates who are furious with him.   There’s also zero evidence that terrorists are traipsing across the southern border, as several speakers claimed. There has yet to be a single documented case of an American citizen killed or injured by a terrorist who illegally crossed the southern border, and since 1975 there have been only nine documented cases of anyone ultimately being convicted of terrorism after illegally entering the country.  Beyond immigration, speaker after speaker attempted to terrify viewers into the voting booth with claims about crime that have been disproven over and over again. We heard much about “Soros-funded” prosecutors’ unleashing a wave of crime and violence on America’s cities. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lamented that these prosecutors “care more about coddling criminals than protecting their own communities” and that they “impose their will on us without our consent.”  This is a particularly rich accusation to come from DeSantis, who removed two prosecutors overwhelmingly elected (and re-elected) by their constituents and replaced them with the very sort of law-and-order prosecutors those voters had rejected. Though DeSantis accused the prosecutors of being “soft on crime,” there’s little evidence that crime has been higher in their districts than in similar districts around the state. There’s also no evidence that progressive or reformist prosecution policies more broadly correlate with an increase in violent crime.  Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde claimed the Biden administration has “made us less safe at home with their ‘defund the police’ movement.”   That statement may be the most impressive lie-to-word-count ratio yet.  Biden didn’t support the “defund” movement; he was openly critical of it. The Biden administration hasn’t cut federal funding to law enforcement; it has increased it (sometimes over the objections of Republicans). In the two years after the George Floyd protests, 8 in 10 departments’ funding increased at least 2%. A handful of departments saw marginal cuts in funding, but no police department was “defunded.” There’s also zero evidence that more police funding corresponds with a reduction in crime or that less funding corresponds with an increase. (Otherwise, Hovde’s claim is accurate!)  Finally, here’s some context you didn’t hear: When Trump took office in 2017, he inherited the lowest murder rate of any president in half a century. He was then the first president in three decades to finish his term with a higher murder rate than when he started. Trump isn’t to blame for all of that. He presided over a once-in-a-generation pandemic that disrupted black markets, took witnesses off the streets and brought a wave of desperation and despair. His term also included the largest civil rights protests in U.S. history, which only reinforced the (understandable) antipathy toward police in many marginalized communities.  For the most part, presidents and their policies have little effect on crime. But there is some research suggesting that crime tends to go up when people see the government as corrupt, incompetent or hostile to their interests, particularly among marginalized groups. The theory here is that when people lose faith in government, they’re less likely to cooperate with state institutions like police and the courts. And it seems safe to say that from 2017 to 2021 there was ample reason to see the government as corrupt, incompetent and discriminatory. Immigrants, in particular, were less likely to report crimes and cooperate with police during the Trump years, most likely out of fear that they or their families would be subjected to immigration investigations.  All of that having been said, most of what drove the surge in crime was beyond Trump’s control. But this isn’t a courtesy Trump has given his opponents.  Back in 2016, Trump and his surrogates blamed Barack Obama for a surge in crime that never happened. They’re now doing the same thing to Biden. So it only seems fair to point out that the only major surge in crime in 40 years occurred while Trump was in the White House.   There is at least one class of crimes that has increased exponentially since Biden took office: crimes committed by former presidents. But that probably isn’t a trend the RNC wants to emphasize. "
What JD Vance’s conversion to Catholicism adds to Trump’s ticket,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-rnc-speech-donald-trump-abortion-catholic-rcna162140,"Sen. JD Vance of Ohio made his prime-time debut on Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention. While a relative newcomer politically, it already seems clear that Vance will be an asset to former President Donald Trump’s third run for president because his hard-line stance against abortion, coupled with his Catholicism, will push back critics of the Republican National Committee’s watered-down platform. Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, is ""good friends"" with Vance and was reportedly elated that Trump had chosen him as his running mate. Besides running alongside Trump, Vance and former Vice President Mike Pence have one thing in common: both have adult conversion stories. Pence was raised Catholic and converted to evangelical Christianity as an adult. Vance was raised Protestant and was baptized into the Catholic Church in 2019 by Dominicans. The similarities end there. Pence was of the Republican establishment, but Vance has embraced MAGA and Trump just like he has the Catholic Church. And he may ultimately end up the vanguard of the next MAGA generation. Vance has the fervor that new converts to religion always have when they want to change the world. In a piece about his conversion, titled “How I joined the Resistance: On Mamaw and becoming Catholic,” Vance says that after his Protestant upbringing, he became an atheist out of a desire for social acceptance among American elites. His conversion to Catholicism came not as a blinding flash of light, he says, but by reading Augustine and being persuaded by a passage from Augustine’s “City of God” on Genesis. The senator said that another pivotal part of his journey to Catholicism was an encounter he had with Peter Thiel, who gave a talk at Yale Law school when Vance was a student there. Thiel, founder of PayPal, Palantir Industries, one of the first investors in Facebook and a big financial supporter of MAGA, is a venture capitalist with a particular kind of religiously inflected axe to grind. Thiel, a staunch supporter, donated $15 million to Vance's 2022 Senate campaign. Just last month, Thiel said, “If you hold a gun to my head, I’ll vote for Trump,” but he said he wouldn't donate to Trump’s super PAC. That may change now that Trump has chosen Vance. Perhaps most importantly, Vance ticks boxes with anti-abortion groups upset that the RNC watered down the party platform by removing its long-stated goal of a nationwide abortion ban. Vance is strongly opposed to abortion. Although his views on the specifics of how anti-abortion restrictions should work have sometimes shifted — his office declined to tell NBC News what his current abortion stance is — he has previously voiced support for a nationwide ban on abortion and has likened abortion to slavery. What’s the need to put a nationwide abortion plan on the platform when the vice presidential pick has been vocal about wanting one? Having Vance on the ticket signals to Republicans who are upset at the way the platform was changed that a national abortion ban is still on the table. Vance has a story that lends itself to a triumphal American story. His first book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” was a hit, but the second book he was contracted to write, titled “A Relevant Faith, Searching for a Meaningful American Christianity,” was called off with mutual agreement of publisher Harper Collins and Vance before his successful Senate run in 2022. Vance seems to always be looking for acceptance through belonging to what he perceives to be powerful groups or leaders. By going from faith to atheism to a different faith, and by going from a full-on criticism of Trump to a full-on embrace of Trumpism, Vance keeps remaking himself. His obsequiousness to Trump includes pledging to do what Mike Pence would not do in 2020 and 2021: accept an alternate slate of electors. That fealty has led to Vance becoming the vice presidential candidate despite his withering critiques of Trump in the past. Vance may be the perfect MAGA candidate, yet some would also squarely place him as a political religious actor. In May 2024, in “First Things,” Matthew Schmitz called Vance a “religious populist” because he’s not only concerned with abortion but also with economic and religious issues, and has shown a willingness to work with senators he disagrees with to achieve his aims. I believe, however, that Vance is more aligned with what is called Catholic integralism, the belief that Christians can use a “soft power” approach to exert influence over society. Wallace Throckmorton talks about the potential for Vance to be an integralist and to use his religious views to influence government. This falls in line with how Vance is not only concerned with curtailing reproductive choices but also with promoting economic prosperity for families. Vance may not tick every box of what the Republicans wanted as a vice presidential candidate, but he will be able to tap into his Catholicism and his story of poverty to wealth. He is also a much more fervent MAGA believer, someone who can bridge the intellectual and populist wings of the Republican Party. Most importantly, he is the perfect white male candidate because of his antiquated beliefs about women and reproductive rights. It will be instructive to see how Catholics, as well as other religious groups in the party, receive Vance as running mate and if his presence will give absolution to Trump the same way Pence’s did."
Alleged neo-Nazi is accused of plotting mass attack in New York,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 4:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/new-york-city-attack-white-supremacist-plot-rcna162424,"A federal grand jury in New York City has handed down an indictment charging an alleged neo-Nazi leader with plotting a deadly attack on Jews and racial minorities. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that a 21-year-old Georgian national named Michail Chkhikvishvili had allegedly tried to recruit people to commit hate crimes and a mass casualty attack in Brooklyn. Authorities say he was known as “Commander Butcher” and led a white supremacist group called the Maniac Murder Cult. He was arrested in Moldova on July 6, officials said. According to a news release from the Justice Department: Authorities allege that Chkhikvishvili gave the undercover agent tips about how to carry out an attack: One of the schemes Chkhikvishvili is accused of plotting involved having someone dress up as Santa Claus and give out poison-laced candy to racial minorities and children at Jewish schools in Brooklyn. (Chkhikvishvili had no defense lawyer listed in online court records, NBC News reported.) By my count, this is the second federal indictment in a little over a month involving allegations of a foiled mass murder plot fueled by racist hate. In June, the Justice Department accused an Arizona man of plotting to spark a race war with a mass shooting at a rap concert in Atlanta. Combined with a resurgence of racist hate speech on X and other social media platforms — along with neo-Nazis comfortably marching through city streets, as we’ve seen in Nashville recently — these indictments point toward a spike in unabashed racism. And they underscore a fact highlighted by officials from both Donald Trump’s administration and Joe Biden’s: White supremacists remain a top domestic threat to Americans."
I've led battleground Republicans to victory. 'MAGA baggage' will cost them in 2024.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-maga-battleground-republicans-2024-rcna162362,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC’s special coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention on July 16. Republican Senate candidates took center stage on the second day of the 2024 Republican National Convention, including two notable and familiar faces: failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and Pennsylvania’s Dave McCormick. Both Lake and McCormick’s races will be critical as Republicans and Democrats battle for control of the Senate this November. Let’s start with McCormick’s bid against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania. I remember Casey’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate. I was working very hard with the Republican Party to defeat him — we were ultimately unsuccessful. At that time, I recognized some of the dynamics Casey brought to the table that made him a successful swing state candidate. He appealed not just to the more liberal parts of the state — southwestern Pennsylvania or Philadelphia — but also to the more traditionally conservative or center-right portions. Casey was and still is, in many respects, a quintessential Pennsylvanian candidate who has across-the-board appeal to voters. The same can’t be said for McCormick, who comes into November’s election with a serious handicap: the Republican Party’s MAGA baggage. The lies of the MAGA agenda are dissected a lot cleaner and a lot easier in statewide races where the margins are tighter. Now, if you’re Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or any Republican running in a heavily red district, that’s not something you necessarily have to worry about. But for McCormick in Pennsylvania and Lake in Arizona that should be top of mind.  As for Lake, she spent her time onstage Tuesday lying about a number of topics, including that her Democratic opponent in Arizona, Rep. Ruben Gallego, wants to let “millions” of undocumented immigrants vote in the upcoming election. Those lies, which are a key part of the MAGA playbook under Donald Trump, will catch up to her in November.  As long as Democrats quickly put the concerns over President Joe Biden’s candidacy behind them, they’re in a much stronger position this election cycle. There’s no Biden baggage on policy; Democrats don’t have to lie to voters. They can talk about abortion, they can lean into the Supreme Court, and they can run on the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS Act.  That ability to have that clear and concise narrative is essential for victory at the ballot box. It’s how I helped the Republican Party win in 2010. Under my leadership as Republican National Committee chairman, the GOP scored huge wins in the House and the Senate. Those victories didn’t come because we focused on battleground states alone. We had to create momentum elsewhere that boiled back into those battleground races. With the MAGA baggage weighing the Republican Party down, that task will be much harder today.  Join Michael Steele, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7 in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its kind live event. You’ll get to see your favorite hosts in person, and hear thought-provoking conversations about what matters most in the final weeks of an unprecedented election cycle. Buy tickets here."
Matt Gaetz and Kevin McCarthy’s feud flares up at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 2:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/matt-gaetz-kevin-mccarthy-republican-national-convention-rcna162365,"The feud between Rep. Matt Gaetz and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy flared up yet again when the two men had a brief, tense encounter on the floor of the Republican National Convention. Footage of the Tuesday incident shows Gaetz approaching McCarthy, who is mid-conversation, and taunting him. “What night are you speaking? Are you speaking tonight, or ... ?” Gaetz asks as someone pushes him away. He then goes up to the California Republican again, saying: “If you took that stage, you would get booed off of it.” As Gaetz walks away, someone tells him to “shut up.” Gaetz’s instigation of McCarthy in such a public venue is not out of character for the 42-year-old Florida Republican, who is prone to trolling tactics. It also underscores the bad blood between the two, which previously resulted in McCarthy’s ousting as House speaker and weeks of disarray among the House GOP. And the feud shows no signs of ending. When asked about the incident later in the day, McCarthy suggested that Gaetz was upset that McCarthy had not halted a congressional ethics investigation into allegations that Gaetz paid a 17-year-old to have sex with him. (Gaetz has vehemently denied the allegation and any wrongdoing.) McCarthy told NBC News: “Well, it’s all about he had an ethics complaint four years ago that he paid an underage girl. ... And he came to me to try to leverage me to stop the ethics investigation. That’s illegal — I’m not doing that.” Last year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against Gaetz in a sex trafficking probe. The House Ethics Committee announced last month that it was continuing to investigate several allegations against him. On Tuesday, Gaetz railed against the investigation in a post on X and appeared to blame McCarthy, who resigned from Congress in December 2023. “This is Soviet. Kevin McCarthy showed them the man, and they are now trying to find the crime,” Gaetz wrote. “I work for Northwest Floridians who won’t be swayed by this nonsense and McCarthy and his goons know it.” In his interview with NBC News, McCarthy also seemed to suggest that Gaetz should be in prison. “Look, everybody has different people in their party,” he said. “Unfortunately, Matt happens to be here. I think at the end of the day, he probably shouldn’t be on the streets.”"
Tucker Carlson decries 'weak men' unwilling to beat up school employees,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 2:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tucker-carlson-rnc-heritage-foundation-rcna162393,"Thus far, the Republican National Convention’s speakers have undermined some conservatives' claims that this year's event would focus on promoting national “unity.” Remarkably, though, some of the most disturbing speeches from right-wingers this week have come not from the main stage, but rather from a few blocks away at an event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, the group that coordinated the drafting of Project 2025, a far-right plan to increase Donald Trump's power and politicize federal agencies if he's elected in November. The Heritage Foundation's Policy Fest, an extremist-fueled speaker series keynoted by fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson, unfolded just down the street from Fiserv Forum, where the RNC is taking place. The physical distance seems to have been strategic. Trump has tried to publicly distance himself from Project 2025, though several of its authors were members of his administration. So perhaps some Republicans thought holding a Heritage Foundation event that’s ostensibly separate from the RNC would help the GOP’s effort to appear less radical.  But Monday proved that plenty of GOP power brokers are all in on Project 2025 and the politics that inspired it. Heritage Foundation CEO Kevin Roberts doubled down on Project 2025, calling it “a plan among a unified movement to speak on behalf of the everyday American, the forgotten American.” In reality, it reads more like a plan to remake the government under Christian nationalist and far-right ideals that include defining heterosexual marriage as “biblically based,” supercharging religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, withdrawing Food and Drug Administration approval of abortion medication and concentrating power in the presidency. Carlson boosted these alarming ideas in his Policy Fest speech on Monday, telling the crowd the recent shooting at a Trump rally proved there is a “spiritual battle” underway and claimed liberals are motivated by an “anti-human” force that seeks to “eliminate” Christians. Carlson later decried the abundance of “weak men” unwilling to commit violence against school employees. He falsely claimed schools are trying to ""indoctrinate"" kids and turn them into “circus freaks” before he fantasized about harming school employees.  “In the country that I grew up in, the dad would just punch the counselor out. You know, ‘Put me in jail, I don’t care,’” Carlson said, before baselessly suggesting school counselors are engaging in “child molester stuff.” He continued:  Policy Fest featured several other speakers well-known among the MAGA faithful, including failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Tom Homan, acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Trump administration. Homan, whom Trump has said he would tap for a job if he’s elected again, tried to downplay Trump’s authoritarian goals related to immigration. Although Trump has publicly refused to rule out building camps for mass detention as part of his campaign’s vow to establish the most massive deportation effort in history, Homan claimed — without evidence — that a Trump immigration policy wouldn’t include any of the things reported in the media.  “People say, 'Trump’s threatening this historic deportation operation. He’s going to build concentration camps. He’s going to sweep neighborhoods,'"" Homan said. ""Let me be clear. None of that will happen."" He went on to issue a warning that seemed to apply not only to newly arriving immigrants but also to recipients of protections offered under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, too. “No one’s off the table,” he said. “If you’re in the country illegally, it’s not OK. If you’re in the country illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”"
Jon Stewart still has some soul-searching to do. His first RNC show proved it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 1:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-bill-oreilly-daily-show-interview-rnc-rcna162375,"Jon Stewart and “The Daily Show” on Tuesday executed what Deadline.com called a “Milwaukee pivot” — a programming change forced upon them by last weekend’s tragic violence in Butler, Pennsylvania. Originally, the idea was to air the popular fake news show live from the site of the Republican National Convention. The attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Stewart revealed, scuttled the plan. His Milwaukee venue was placed under lockdown. With “cages built around the theater,” Stewart and his team decided that it wouldn’t be prudent to perform live comedy “without,” the host deadpanned, “people.”  Taped on Tuesday, the episode was stuck rehashing RNC highlights from Monday. Stewart thus missed an opportunity to skewer the speeches of former Trump detractors Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio. Each performed variations, albeit less deserving of our enduring awe, of JD Vance’s ability to forget he once called his new boss “America’s Hitler” and “cultural heroin.” (Vance’s opioid analogy must be the most remarkable observation I’ve ever read about Trump).  Stewart also interviewed his longtime interlocutor, frenemy and sparring partner Bill O’Reilly, and quipped about the two of them being “somewhat fossilized practitioners of the rhetorical arts.” In relation to their past popularity and influence on this generation of political rabble-rousers, Stewart observed, “We made a pretty spectacular living pushing those envelopes.” This isn’t the first time Stewart has wondered aloud whether he is predator or prey (or peripheral) in the new social media ecosystem. In February he called himself “the captain of this dying medium.” He does seem to intuit that what worked artistically, and maybe even politically, in the Bush and Obama eras is perhaps outdated or irrelevant or actually not entirely helpful in this MAGA moment.  If Stewart is pondering that, then good on him. I guess the venue change, and the terror that prompted it, should compel him to pose hard questions about the intersection between art and politics. Questions like: What exactly are entertainers as influential as Jon Stewart supposed to be doing at a point in American history as troubling as this one? I’m starting to believe that Stewart and his team actually don’t know how to answer this question. No disgrace in that. I don’t either. The current moment is as baffling as it is frightening. Although, when your theater is caged in and your audience can’t attend for their own safety because yet another young white male tried to murder people with a perfectly legal killing machine — then, well, maybe it’s a good time to reflect.   Tuesday night’s program indicated that the usually self-aware Stewart is still thinking this through, and has not yet made any discernible pivot. His jokes about odd noises made by Marjorie Taylor Green were funny enough. The analysis of how Lee Greenwood refused to cede the stage while introducing Trump was fairly hysterical. Trump himself gestured that the long-winded singer-songwriter should move this along (“Is it possible to bring out another band to play a band off?” Stewart quipped). The Bill O’Reilly interview best encapsulated many of these contradictions that Stewart has to confront. These men, by my count, have interviewed each other some two dozen times over the years. They have excellent chemistry. They like each other. (Or, perhaps, they like to hate each other.) O’Reilly even recently attended Stewart’s show. The hard-charging conservative “newsman,” who was fired by Fox News in the wake of five sexual harassment suits (which he has denied), is sort of avuncular when conversing with Stewart. O’Reilly made reasonable points about rage and today’s politics. “We are now in a society,” he opined “where hatred is rewarded.” Stewart jumped in: “It’s incentivized, it’s monetized!” Dialogue. Consensus. I like it! One problem, though, is that the same O’Reilly who was bemoaning “the hate brigade” Tuesday night has been eminently hateful himself. I am not going to rehash his views on Trayvon Martin’s murder, on gay marriage, victim blaming, comparing the ACLU to terrorists, blatant and pervasive sexism, anti-LGBTQ and transgender rants, religious fearmongering (such as his yearly diatribe against the “war on Christmas”), or his discomforting white power vibes.  I am going to say that Jon Stewart has to figure something out. When he’s choppin’ it up with Bill O’Reilly is he: a) fostering open and honest discussion across the ideological divide, thereby enriching our liberal democracy? Or, b) platforming a voice that is both cause and effect of the lethal danger that is threatening the existence of liberal democracy itself? Because it sure as hell can’t be both.  When O’Reilly started reading off unflattering statistics about Biden’s economy, Stewart did push back, literally. He prompted his guest to explain how Biden is solely responsible for high food prices, gas prices, mortgage rates, etc., given what he inherited from his predecessor. When O’Reilly responded he didn’t know, Stewart guffawed, comically pushed back his own chair, got up and walked away.  An interesting gesture, that was. No one is asking Stewart to walk away from his comedic throne. But I’d hope the events of the past few months might stimulate deeper reflection on what artists are supposed to do in dark times."
A heartbreaking story at the RNC peddles a horribly misguided narrative,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 1:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speeches-push-dangerous-trump-narrative-biden-border-policy-rcna162374,"On the second night of the Republican National Convention, a woman named Anne Fundner shared a heartbreaking story. A few years ago, she and her husband and their four children were living in Southern California, she told the crowd. She painted an idyllic picture of their family life. Her 15-year-old son, Weston, played hockey and football and loved to surf. The family had barbecues on the beach. Then Weston, succumbing to peer pressure, got high with friends — and died of fentanyl poisoning. It’s an unspeakable tragedy, one felt by too many Americans in the relentless wave of an opioid epidemic that continues to claim more than 74,000 lives a year. Unfortunately, Fundner’s story of personal loss is being used to promote a dangerous and false narrative about the state of crime under the current administration. In her speech, Fundner had no doubt about who was to blame. It happened, she said, because President Joe Biden “opened our borders.” And the solution, according to her and many speakers present in Milwaukee Tuesday night, is to re-elect Donald Trump, who will close them again and, she urged, classify Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. When she said this, Trump apparently leaned over to his running mate JD Vance and mouthed, “We should do it.” Hour after hour, speakers hit the same themes. Biden had “opened the border.” Sen. Marco Rubio said when Trump was president “our border was secure and our laws were enforced” — but that those days are gone. Ben Carson said, “We have a wide open border.” Tom Cotton said, “Joe Biden thinks borders are racist.” The implication for all of them was that an open border is to blame for the country’s fentanyl crisis. This narrative of course is complete nonsense. That doesn’t mean that the pain of parents like Fundner isn’t all too real. I myself know it is, having someone I cared about die of a fentanyl overdose three years ago. But the problem has absolutely nothing do with Biden “opening our border” because no such event has occurred. The available statistics expose the RNC speeches about “open borders” as a dispatch from an alternate dimension. To start, the Department of Homeland Security’s total number of “encounters” with migrants (“encounters” is DHS speak for “arrests”) was far greater during Biden’s first two years in office than the corresponding years of the Trump administration. And greater percentage of those “encountered” under Biden have been deported than under Trump. In fact, immigrants’ rights groups are furious at Biden for reasons anyone who believed what they saw at the RNC would have found incomprehensible. Biden championed a bipartisan bill that would have shredded many of the rights of asylum-seekers. People who in some cases have reason to be terrified that they’ll be tortured or killed if they returned to their home countries, are going to have their cases heard faster, not because the existing system would be expanded to deal with the backlog but because their cases would be moved from the Department of Justice to the DHS, where they’d get “a much faster review, often without attorneys or a deliberative process,” according to reporting from PBS. When that bill failed, after most Republicans followed Trump’s lead in opposing it, Biden acted unilaterally by executive order to curtail the rights of many asylum-seekers. He’s now being sued by several immigrants’ rights groups as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, which notes: “These executive actions will effectively shut off any access to asylum protections for the vast majority of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, no matter how strong their claims. The proclamation echoes the Trump administration’s previous asylum entry ban, which immigrants’ rights advocates successfully challenged."" Ted Cruz said at the RNC that the influx of undocumented immigrants was an “invasion” — not, he clarified, a figurative invasion but a literal one. He named a number of Americans who were raped or killed by criminals who had entered the country illegally, claiming to “speak for” these individuals (it is unclear whether or not the individuals approved of Cruz and his politics). The best available data shows that the undocumented migrant population is far less likely to commit crimes (beyond the initial illegal entry) than native-born Americans, likely because they’re afraid of being deported. American citizens who are the victims of violence are, in the overwhelming majority of cases, victims of other American citizens. And while we’re at it, a crushingly overwhelming majority of those arrested for smuggling fentanyl —86% — are American citizens, and more than nine out of 10 fentanyl seizures “occur at legal crossing points or interior vehicle checkpoints, not on illegal migration routes.” This stands to reason, given U.S. citizens crossing legally are far less likely to be seized and searched. Fentanyl overdoses are aptly classed as “deaths of despair,” statistically concentrated in Rust Belt areas ravaged by deindustrialization. To actually tackle the fentanyl crisis, we’d need to start by devoting far more resources to treatment for addicts, but above all you’d need to do something about the despair, by moving toward a more economically equal society. That is likely the last thing Trump and JD Vance plan to do should they be elected in November. The first Trump administration was a four-year orgy of tax cuts for rich people, deregulation and union-busting. He even went after Medicaid expansion. If Trump returns to office and gives us four more years of these policies, the result will be a society mired even more deeply in poverty, inequality and mass despair than it is right now. And that’s a recipe for a whole lot more grieving mothers looking for someone to blame."
Real hillbillies like me don’t trust JD Vance. You shouldn’t trust him either.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-trump-vp-appalachia-rcna162105,"It’s easy to understand why “Hillbilly Elegy,” the 2016 memoir by JD Vance, piqued the interest of the American people. It recycles a narrative America has relied on for a century to sleep soundly despite the everyday horrors of our society: Rich people do well because they are morally better than the poor. Add some powerful tropes — a firebrand “pistol packing lunatic” mamaw who protects at all costs, a rags-to-riches story in which Vance, a Marine,  escapes the “worst of my cultural inheritance” (p. 253) of unsophisticated, drug-addicted, murderous hillbillies — and you’ve got a bestseller. You’ve also got a dangerous lie, one relying on ugly stereotypes that harm real Appalachians in order to advance a political career. Former President Donald Trump announced Monday that Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, is his pick for his running mate. Unlike me, Vance is not Appalachian.  He was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, well outside any maps of the distinct geographical and cultural region. Trump picking this Rust Belt charlatan as his running mate Monday sparked a resounding and unifying rant among conservative and liberal hillbillies alike in my social media feed: We do not acknowledge him. Why would we? Vance introduces his reader to Appalachia by immediately profiling the worst behaviors of each of his uncles, including a scene of grotesque violence. He calls us a “pessimistic bunch” living in a “hub of misery” (p. 4), and over and over again he uses a wide brush to paint Appalachians as lazy, ignorant and unwilling to try at life. Though there are dozens of offensive stories to choose from in “Hillbilly Elegy,” perhaps the most ridiculous one occurs when, during boot camp, Vance says he meets an eastern Kentuckian who, never having heard the term, asks “What’s a Catholic?” because, as Vance presents it, “down in that part of Kentucky [where he says that man is from], everybody’s a snake handler.” (p. 160). It’s an addictively stereotypical image: the ignorant, isolated, snake-handling hillbilly. But it’s not reality. There are a half dozen churches in that Kentuckian’s county seat, mostly Baptist and Methodist.  Just 20 miles away, in Hazard, there’s a Catholic Church. Another 20 miles away, where Vance’s family lives, there’s a Catholic Church with more than 4,000 Facebook followers. Vance’s memoir of Appalachia, full of gun-toting, drug-addicted “lunatics” aimlessly awaiting death, is at best a cherry-picking of the worst moments of his life. At worst, it’s a concoction of real memories and some of television’s worst stereotypes of what Appalachia is. I do not see my Appalachia in it. I am not alone. Anthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll’s “Appalachian Reckoning,” a response to Vance’s bestseller, anthologizes more than 400 pages of responses from real Appalachians describing their lives in all the nuance they deserve. But nuanced stories aren’t useful in politics. Appalachia is simply a rhetorical device for Vance that he used to launch a political career. If your political goal is to blame the poor for their own problems, then using the regional ethnicity of your grandparents to present yourself as “authentic” can compel readers to believe your narrative or to feel good about having already believed it. After all, the narrative of the lazy hillbilly has existed for as long as rich folks outside of Appalachia needed an explanation for mountain poverty that doesn’t include blaming themselves. Did the poverty come from the rest of the country ignoring a region they thought had no resources? Did the poverty come from coal barons stealing resources once they were discovered? Did the poverty come from outside coal companies not paying coal miners actual money for decades? Why blame complex issues that implicate rich white folks when “lazy” is only two syllables? Vance builds on this narrative, ignoring nuance and context, presenting supposed anecdote after supposed anecdote of cultural depravity and portraying himself as a hillbilly who survived and knows the answer to what ails Appalachia is political conservatism. For Vance, issues of poverty, drug abuse and neglected children are “issues of family, faith, and culture.” (p. 238) He goes so far as to claim that these “problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else.” (p. 255) That’s insulting. Individuals living in poverty did not invent opioids. Individuals living in poverty did not refuse to regulate opioids. He puts the blame entirely on poor Americans, on mothers on food stamps and on fathers who are out of work, extending the roots of that blame directly to Appalachians and some inherent moral flaw. In convincing readers outside of Appalachia that they need the solution he is selling, he paints the Appalachian as the moral problem in America: “If there is any temptation to judge these problems as the narrow concerns of backwoods hollers, a glimpse at my own life reveals that Jackson [Kentucky]’s plight has gone mainstream. Thanks to the massive migration from the poorer regions of Appalachia to places like Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, hillbilly values spread widely along with hillbilly people.” (p. 20) The dog whistle is pretty clear: The immoral hill folks are already in your area. Trust me, I escaped them. I know the answer to save you from them. The “hillbilly” twist is a particularly clever political move because it allows poor white folks living in swing states (like those listed above) to draw a quick line of demarcation around themselves — hardworking but poor Americans — and the supposed immoral, lazy welfare queens and absent, violent hillbilly fathers spreading into their cities and towns. Vance paints himself as having narrowly escaped  “the deep anger and resentment” (p. 2) of those who raised him and laments the supposed white working class feeling that “our choices don’t matter.” (p. 176) Wednesday morning, my sister, who has known overwhelming pain and difficulty, signed up for nursing classes at a community college. Last week, my nephew, a young man with everything stacked against him, asked me to meet him to talk about vocational school.   I see people making choices. I see no anger. Vance confuses frustration in a difficult system with anger and resentment; he misrepresents  Appalachians acknowledging that the choices they have are few and far between and require great levels of personal sacrifice as their belief that the choices they make don’t matter. He sees the drowning person and decides they lack determination in swimming. He ignores those creating the flood. Vance does identify one hillbilly trait that I will, at this moment, agree with: We can be distrustful of outsiders. I might add that I am most distrustful of outsiders pretending to be insiders and of outsiders with a political agenda.  This hillbilly does not trust JD Vance."
One of Biden's Supreme Court reform obstacles: the Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/joe-biden-supreme-court-reform-expansion-rcna162339,"President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse Supreme Court reforms like term limits and a binding ethics code for the justices. Generally speaking, it’s a positive development at a time when the Roberts Court is exerting outsized power over the other two, nominally coequal branches of government. But even if Congress (which is partly Republican controlled) were to pass such reforms, the Republican-majority Supreme Court could strike them down as unconstitutional. There’s debate over whether term limits require a constitutional amendment, and the court has resisted perceived intrusions on its operations. The court last year did adopt its own code of conduct, but that lacks an enforcement mechanism. That doesn’t mean that the court’s protective view of itself is correct, or that Democrats shouldn’t push for change in any event. But a Supreme Court that jealously guards its power imposes a practical reality on any efforts to curtail that power.     Perhaps counterintuitively, the most significant potential reform could be the least legally controversial: adding seats to the court to balance the 6-3 Republican supermajority. Legislation could accomplish that and wouldn't require a constitutional amendment. The court’s size has changed several times throughout its history. Yet, Biden doesn’t appear to be pushing for court expansion. But while the court itself would be unable to stop it on constitutional grounds, expanding the court would — like any other attempt to diminish the court’s power — have to get through Congress with its Republican-controlled House first.

"In speech to the NAACP, Biden says denouncing violence won’t stop his criticism of Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 11:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/biden-speech-naacp-trump-political-violence-rcna162353,"In his first campaign speech after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, President Joe Biden said the need for rejecting political violence doesn’t mean he’ll be shying away from denouncing the former president’s illiberal behavior or record. Conservatives have baselessly argued that the shooting in Pennsylvania was an outgrowth of liberals’ criticism of his authoritarian behavior. And Biden is pushing back on that bogus claim. Addressing Black voters and lawmakers during a speech to the NAACP in Nevada, the president reiterated his call for everyone to reject political violence. But he received applause after he name-checked Black people who have been the victims of violence and violent threats in recent years. He said: The applause in response to Biden name-checking Goodman, Freeman and Moss was noteworthy. This was the president acknowledging a sentiment that many liberals have been expressing — that any conversation about stemming political violence can’t, in earnest, ignore the actions of Trump and his followers. Goodman, the U.S. Capitol Police officer, was recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal for his heroism in the face of violent, pro-Trump insurrectionists on Jan. 6. Freeman and Moss were innocent election workers in Georgia who faced death threats after Trump and his movement targeted them after the 2020 election. And if it wasn’t clear enough from their resumption of political ads, Biden made clear that he won’t be treating Trump with kid gloves. “Now, just because we must lower the temperature in our politics as it relates to violence doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth,” Biden told the NAACP audience, before lambasting Trump for deploying the National Guard to quell racial justice protesters in 2020, his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic and his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After hitting pause on political attacks for a few days, it’s officially “game on” again for the Biden campaign."
What Nikki Haley’s RNC speech says about Trump's grip on the GOP,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 10:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nikki-haley-rnc-speech-trump-endorsement-rcna162187,"Nikki Haley, former President Donald Trump’s chief rival in the Republican primaries, called for the party to unite behind him at the Republican National Convention Tuesday evening. “Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” the former South Carolina governor declared to a roaring crowd. Haley addressed her speech to Trump skeptics in the party, saying, “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him” and argued that a unified GOP was required for “saving” the nation.    Haley’s plea to her supporters to fall in line behind Trump was more forceful and comprehensive than her soft endorsement of Trump in May. It marks the official end of her dalliance with pseudo-independence from the MAGA wing of the party. And her decision to do it without winning any concessions from Trump illustrates how much power he has, and how little leverage she has in trying to preserve some remnants of the old GOP. Haley ended her presidential bid after losing to Trump in all but two small GOP primaries. She suffered a blowout loss on Super Tuesday. She argued then that Trump had work to do after a primary season to win over the roughly 15% of the Republican electorate who preferred her to him. “It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,” she said when she ended her campaign in March. “At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.” While Haley espouses or accommodates many MAGA values, she still waged war against Trump during the primaries by attacking his character and calling him unfit for office. She described him as “totally unhinged” and pushed back against his thirst for “revenge.” She warned that he is “declining” cognitively and called him a “toxic” agent of “chaos” who lacks “moral clarity.” And she diverged from a key pillar of the MAGA worldview by stating that America doesn’t “rig elections” and acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.  Trump has, unsurprisingly, not heeded Haley’s calls for civility, nor has he tempered his rhetoric on revenge or rigged elections. He remains wedded to a divisive and combative rhetorical style in which he signals authoritarian ambition. He has continued to reject the results of the 2020 election and, after being convicted of 34 felony counts, he has impugned the legitimacy of the legal system. Nonetheless, Haley offered Trump an endorsement that was not only full-throated, but even helped revise his record and boosted him in an area where she has had sharp policy differences from him in the past: foreign policy. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, Haley diverged from Trump by staking out more hawkish positions on Russia than he did, including by making clear her belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. During the primaries, Haley denounced Trump for encouraging Russia to attack NATO allies. But in her RNC speech, Haley praised Trump as a guarantor of a “strong America” and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden — you know, the guy who is a NATO traditionalist and helped organize an unprecedented sanctions regime against Putin. Toward the end of her speech, Haley spoke about the importance of making the Republican Party bigger and more appealing to the general public. But she’s too smart and savvy of a politician to delude herself into thinking Trump has or ever will have an interest in changing his worldview to do so. Haley is a creature of the party, she has significant political talent, and she wants to remain a player. It would be surprising if she didn’t have her eye on 2028. Her conspicuous bending of the knee to Trump is the simplest way to ensure she has a chance to stay in the game.  "
Dems hoping to replace Biden on 2024 ticket get a clear deadline,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-hoping-replace-biden-2024-ticket-get-clear-deadline-rcna162344,"As far as President Joe Biden is concerned, the intraparty debate over his electoral future has run its course. NBC News reported this week, for example, that in recent days, the incumbent “has started to privately convey a new message to Democrats: The conversation about my future is over, and I’m getting irritated that you’re not realizing that. Biden has called several prominent allies individually to tell them to spread the word.” The president’s impatience notwithstanding, the Democratic discussion remains ongoing. The challenge for those in the party who still hope to replace Biden on the ticket is the rapidly closing window. In fact, The New York Times reported this week that Democratic National Committee officials were “moving swiftly” to confirm Biden as the party’s presidential nominee “by the end of July.” To put it mildly, Democrats who still want the conversation to continue were not pleased. In fact, congressional Democrats began circulating a letter seeking more time. It’s against this backdrop that NBC News reported: Ordinarily, Democrats wouldn’t nominate their presidential candidate until the convention, but party officials said the earlier virtual process is necessary to avoid a legal mess in Ohio. Republican officials in the Buckeye State insist there is no need for such steps, but DNC officials have responded that they don’t trust those officials’ word. And so, the window of opportunity — which, again, Biden already sees as closed — appears exceedingly narrow. Major Democratic donors still hope to wield some influence and nudge the incumbent off the ballot, not because they oppose him or his agenda, but because they’re convinced he’ll lose. For his part, the president has said he’s more concerned with the attitudes of Democratic voters than the party’s financial backers. The problem with this is that many Democratic voters seem to agree with the donors: A newly released national poll from the Associated Press found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats prefer to see Biden forgo his re-election plans. That number is roughly the same as the results of the latest NBC News poll, which found that 62% of Democratic voters want to see Biden end his candidacy. Survey data like this makes it difficult for the president to say the chatter is limited to “the elites.” It also comes against a backdrop of several other recent polls that show Biden losing the 2024 race to Donald Trump. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the list of members calling on the president to stand down is still inching higher: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who reportedly raised private concerns, is now going public, urging Biden to step aside. If there are others in the party who want the same thing, they’ll have to speak up in the coming days or forever hold their peace."
An Unsettling Few Days,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-unsettling-days-rcna162356,"After a traumatic weekend for the nation, MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord use their law enforcement expertise to take stock of the alarming assassination attempt of former President Trump. Then, they turn to Monday’s stunning dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case, after Judge Aileen Cannon took a page from Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence to view Jack Smith’s appointment as illegal. Andrew and Mary explain what options are available to the Special Counsel in appealing the dismissal. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” So, we’re taping late in the day on Monday, July 15th, because we wanted to get this to you as early as possible. So it’s going to come out Tuesday morning, but we didn’t want to wait to record until tomorrow and then have it come out at the end of the day because there’s a lot to talk about. And so let’s get started. Hi, Mary, how are you? Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: This is going to be maybe a little bit different because there’s two things that we’re going to be discussing. We’re going to talk about the shootings and the attempted assassination over the weekend. But then we’re going to turn to something that happened today, which is why we’re doing this today to get this out to all of you to talk about the Judge Cannon decision, what she did and some issues legally with what she did. And then, Mary, you and I have not had a chance to talk about this, but like what we would do next. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: What are the options for Jack Smith? I’m going to be really interested to hear what you think. But why don’t I turn it to you, but just let me remind people when we talk now about the shootings over the weekend. I think people need to remember that, Mary, you were in both, not just in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C., which you know, is the home base for all sorts of major things like inaugurations and big events that have potential violence, but you were head of the National Security Division. And before that, you were a senior official there. And so foreign and domestic terrorism are so much a part of your makeup in terms of both lawyers and the FBI and other parts of the intelligence community dealing with those situations. So I just want to make sure people were aware that we have you in a different role to draw on. And I have just a little bit of that from the FBI. Mary McCord: I was going to say, but you as well. Yes. I mean, not only were you at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, but also at the FBI and the General Counsel’s Office. Andrew Weissmann: So anyway, you don’t have to debate that. Mary McCord: That’s right. That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: This is like Alphonse Gaston. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So with that, Mary, I thought it would make sense. And I know when we were talking over the weekend, when this happened, what would you, if you were still in the National Security Division, what would you be looking for? What would you be doing? What kind of preventative things would you be concerned about when something like this happens? Mary McCord: Well, I appreciate that we’re going to lead off with this topic today, because obviously this is enormously significant. There was an attempted assassination of the major political candidate running for the presidential, I guess he’s still technically running for the nomination, but is the de facto nominee. And we have an election this year. Andrew Weissmann: I think actually, as we’ve been talking, I think he -- Mary McCord: Has already, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- technically been proclaimed. Mary McCord: That might be because we are Monday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time recording this. And, you know, you and I, Andrew, and many listeners will remember when the sitting president, Ronald Reagan, was shot in 1981, the last assassination attempt. Again, Donald Trump is not a sitting president, but he is a former president. He’s a major candidate for president. And so, you know, that’s been more than 40 years since we’ve had anyone come this close to actually killing someone in the presidency or a former president. And it should make everyone and it clearly has made at least most people across party stop, take note, and do, I think, some soul searching about where are we in this country that the rhetoric and the language that’s used in a lot of our discourse may have, we don’t know, contributed to this event. And also, even if that had nothing to do with this particular shooting, because we don’t know, and I want to foot stomp that, we do not yet know the shooter’s motive. Certainly, it’s time to think about where we are and are there things that we want to change. And even the former president, and you and I have certainly been critical about him many times, and there’s still many, many, many reasons to be critical about him. But he has actually, at least over the weekend, I think it might have changed a little bit today, has called for unity, and I understand has completely changed his speech for the RNC and is actually his campaign directed other speakers to not try to cast blame across the aisle and say things that there’s no proof of at this point. So just to start there, the other thing I think that’s so important, you appropriately said we’re going to talk about the shootings, and I started with assassination attempt, but shootings is accurate because no one should ever forget that a person was killed, a person did lose his life, and two other people were critically wounded. So this was a fatal attack, really, on our democracy. Andrew Weissmann: It was a murder and attempted murder. Mary McCord: That’s right. And so I want to talk about and get your thoughts too on the kinds of investigations that are happening and why. But one thing I want to say right off the top, particularly because you indicated my former role in national security, is that, you know, this is appropriately being investigated as a potential domestic terrorism attack. And people say, well, why is that and why do you say potential? So domestic terrorism under the U.S. code is not its own crime. It’s a crime of violence that violates any state law that’s done with the intent to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or to influence the policy of government through intimidation or coercion or in retaliation for government conduct. Andrew Weissmann: And what you just said, Mary, is that you’re reading from the definition in the United States Code of domestic terrorism. Mary McCord: Right. I’m paraphrasing, not reading from the statute because I know it so well. And the definition of domestic terrorism in the U.S. code is very similar, almost identical, almost word for word as the definition of international terrorism. It’s just that international terrorism can involve the same kinds of conduct that occur outside the United States but have some tie to the United States or they occur inside the United States, but they’re motivated by, say, a foreign terrorist organization like Al-Qaeda or ISIS, whereas domestic is sort of purely domestic, not motivated by a foreign terrorist organization. So, for one, it’s because it would at least, we don’t know until we know the motive, but there is at least some reason to believe because this was a political rally, right, that the intent would have been to affect government policy, to intimidate or coerce the people who are there at that rally, et cetera. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: The other reason that it is appropriately considered, at least in the initial stages as a domestic terrorism investigation, is because one of the potential crimes here, if the shooter had survived, would be a crime that is considered to be a terrorism crime, and that is an attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. You know, most of our crimes that are designated by law of crimes of terrorism are about things that have to do with foreign terrorist organizations like we talked about, but in the domestic sphere, it can include attacks on U.S. government officials, members of Congress, the sitting president, vice president, justices of the Supreme Court, et cetera. And there is actually a statute that also applies to attempted assassinations of major presidential candidates. And so that, when done with this intent, is actually a crime of terrorism under U.S. law. Andrew Weissmann: And for our nerds, which I’m including ourselves in that, we will put in the show notes the site for the statutory definition, as well as the citation for the domestic terrorism law that, Mary, you were referring to. Mary McCord: Yeah. So the crime I was referring to is 18 United States Code Section 351. But for all the nerds out there, we’ll put all these in the show notes. Andrew Weissmann: So I had a reaction to something you said, and it does relate to what I know if I were still at the FBI, what our teams would be focusing on, because there would be, as you said, Mary, very much this focus of what happened, a whole exegesis of who is this person, learning everything you can about the shooter and his motivation, and looking at social media, e-mails, texts, talking to witnesses, learning as much as you can to understand how this happened and why this happened. Mary McCord: But I think that’s for two purposes, actually, because I put this investigation in three buckets, right? I just wanted to get out there that it’s properly called, you know, terrorism investigation, or at least potentially. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, yeah. Mary McCord: So that first that you were just getting at, Andrew, to me, that serves two purposes. One is law enforcement needs to know now, is there any current ongoing threat, right? Is there still-- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- possibly someone that the shooter was working with, domestically or foreign? Are there other explosive devices in other places that could still pose harm? Because we know they’ve recovered some sort of explosive device from the car and some from the house. And so part of this is looking at, you know, the contents of the phone, laptop, his internet searches, social media posts, his acquaintances, where was the gun purchased? If it was purchased by his father in 2013, which is being reported, did his father know he had taken it? Where was the ammunition purchased? All those kind of things, first are like, do we have an ongoing threat? But secondly, all those same things that you were talking about, and I was elaborating on are to figure out, did law enforcement miss clues? Like, were there red flags that they should have had this guy on their radar? And are there things -- Andrew Weissmann: Lessons learned. Mary McCord: Yeah, lessons learned. Andrew Weissmann: Yep, absolutely. And this, by the way, reminds me so much, I think both of us were in national security roles during the Boston bombing. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And, you know, I was at the FBI and that was very much the sort of lessons learned and was somebody else involved. And, you know, so those are two big pieces. So I think that is sort of the looking backwards. The looking forwards piece, and obviously, if other people were involved, that’s a looking forward and actually lessons learned is also has a -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- looking forward piece. But another part of the looking forward is the concern of heightened threats and copycats going forward. And so an enormous amount of activity right now will be on other targets that either within the same genre or retaliatory targets. And how do you harden the, what was the phrase? Harden the shell -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and harden the target so that it’s harder for any of those things to occur. And that’s where I just want to take us back to a conversation we would have had a month ago or three months ago or six months ago. Actually, let’s just go back to the motion that was before -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- Judge Cannon with respect to the concern that was being raised by Jack Smith about threats to the FBI. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And both of us, if you remember, were very upset -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that it wasn’t heard sooner because both of us having been in law enforcement, but you don’t have to, you could just be a sentient human being who cares, knew that we didn’t want to be in the situation where violence has happened and there was more that could have been done. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And it is worth going back to the fact that violence has happened and threats of violence have happened. And obviously January 6th isn’t a good example. Paul Pelosi is a good example. But just to make this apolitical, Steven Scalise is a good example. Mary McCord: Threats to Brett Kavanaugh. Andrew Weissmann: I was going to say justices in the Supreme Court, regardless of stripe. Gretchen Whitmer and then judges, witnesses, poll workers, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss. I’m not saying that it’s wrong to have the reaction now that I hope this causes people to rethink that they should all be saying violence is never the answer. But it is ironic, to say the least, that this is what it takes. I mean, we were saying this for so long and there’s so -- Mary McCord: Years, really. Years. Andrew Weissmann: -- many people who have been threatened and actually hurt. Mary McCord: Harmed. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And if you belittle attacks on people and you make it the norm, I’m certainly not saying you’re asking for it, not in any way, shape or form. It’s that this kind of thing was bound to happen. And I hope this is a wake-up call, but I’m concerned it’s not. In terms of law enforcement, though, in terms of what we would be doing, looking at that future issue of like, is there going to be some immediate retaliation? Are there other targets? Are judges, are prosecutors, et cetera, going to have increased threats and increased security and concerns is certainly something that is going to be keeping the bureau, the Secret Service, the local law enforcement very busy. Mary McCord: Yes, no question about it. And we haven’t even talked about the fact that a whole separate investigation into the Secret Service’s behavior here is another thing that will be happening. And I can tell you, I am sure if they had their druthers, there would be no outdoor rallies and events like what we saw in Pennsylvania on the weekend. It’s just so much more difficult to protect than an indoor venue. And I’m sure that history will reveal that there was probably a lot of back and forth between Secret Service and the campaign over these type of events. But nevertheless, there clearly was a rooftop within striking distance that was not adequately protected. And so that will be the course of a lot of criticism. Last thing to say about this, and, you know, we could do a whole episode about this. It’s not obviously about prosecuting Donald Trump, although he has now today at least posted on True Social that all cases against him should be dropped, as well as apparently all former civil cases, including E. Jean Carroll. But putting that aside, I do think it’s important to realize, you know, just to your point, what’s going to come from this, right? And one man’s act does not control what we as Americans are going to do going forward, or what foreign adversaries will be encouraging some Americans to do going forward. We control that and how we react, regardless of our politics, will do far more to influence whether we’re going to have copycat crimes, whether we’re going to have retaliation. And some of that will be in the rhetoric that people use. Some of it will be social media. Some of it could be how people speak at events like the convention this week and the conventions coming up. But one man doesn’t control that. And that dead shooter who did a heinous thing at an event where people were expressing their constitutional rights, right, to go and have a rally in support of the candidate of their choice, that shooting is very much undermines our democratic processes, our constitutional rights. And we can decide to reject that. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, in the same way that we can decide that it has nothing to do with and, in fact, should make us value more the rule of law. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And so it has nothing to do with weaponization. And that’s maybe a very good segue to Judge Cannon because one of the things that, just to give a tease before we take our first break, is that in many ways, her ruling is the antithesis of weaponization. And if you look at the substance of what she’s saying, and I’ll talk about that a little bit more when we break, but the sort of Donald Trump claim that these are all weaponized cases that have been brought in, she is actually in substance rejecting that. Her whole claim is that Jack Smith was not sufficiently under the thumb of the Biden administration, and because of that, it was unconstitutional. So it’s actually quite the opposite of the claim that there’s weaponization. And just to bring it back and close out to your point, which is that the truly heinous acts of one individual does not mean that we are suddenly not a nation of laws. In fact, it should be why we’re a nation of laws and should make us value that more. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Let’s take a break and then go back to Judge Cannon and we’ll get into the details of her ruling issued this morning. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As we were going into the break, we were teeing up Judge Cannon’s decision and judgment today. Basically, the case in front of her is right now over. She dismissed the indictment, the superseding indictment in its entirety, and she did so really based on one ground, which is that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. She also indicated that it violated the Appropriations Clause, but said she wasn’t going to decide a remedy for that because it didn’t matter after all because she was dismissing the entire case based on the Appointments Clause. So we’re going to talk during this segment about her ruling, and then we will close out after another break by talking about what are the options now, what happens going forward. But just before I hand it to you, Andrew, I want to just orient people on what this Appointments Clause says in the U.S. Constitution, right? Andrew Weissmann: Perfect. Mary McCord: It says that the president shall have the power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties provided two-thirds of the senators present concur. And here’s the kicker. And he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint various people and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law, right? Okay, so that’s key. And those various people include ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court, okay, and all other officers for the United States. But the clause goes on to say, but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. Okay, so heads of departments would be people like the attorney general. And the key point of Judge Cannon’s 93-page opinion is there is no statute that gives the attorney general the power to appoint a person like Jack Smith, the special counsel. And she does that, I will say, and I’m curious whether you agree, I think based on the roadmap that Justice Thomas laid out for her in his concurring opinion in the immunity case that we talked about the very first day we talked about the immunity decision, because it was something not briefed, not part of the question in front of the court, and just something he decided to write about. And she grabbed it, and she cites it repeatedly. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So again, big picture things. We’ve had the special counsel rules for about 25 years. They replaced the independent counsel rules. And the independent counsel was in many ways more separate from the Department of Justice than the special counsel and was found to be constitutional in a case called Morrison. So that’s a case that’s somewhat controversial, but it is a binding Supreme Court case that said that the independent counsel rules were constitutional. So this, because it seems better, it’s people are like, how is this going to be infirm? And in fact, until Judge Cannon, no judge has actually found it to be improper. There have been special counsels appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents. There have been Republican and Democratic appointed judges who have found it to be constitutional. I keep on referring to Dabney Friedrich, a judge appointed by Donald Trump during the Mueller investigation, found this to be constitutional. So Judge Cannon is the first judge to find that it was unconstitutional. I totally agree with you that she is following the Justice Thomas blueprint, the gratuitous blueprint. Very, very unusual for him to do that. It’s very political. She does not, I think, follow binding Supreme Court precedent. She rejects all of the other, I think it’s eight judges who have found against her. And basically, the clause that you were reading, what you need to look for is, since the special counsels was not appointed by the president, you’re trying to see, is there some statutory authority that gave Merrick Garland, the attorney general, the ability to appoint the special counsel? And I have to tell you that part of her decision, I’m going to say this, but it doesn’t convey the depth of how wrong it is, but it is. To say it is weak is charitable. There is congressional authority to do this. Let me just give you an example of something she does that I just think is so silly. The attorney general can appoint employees, obviously, because the Department of Justice is filled with employees, and those employees can be given all sorts of job responsibilities. Mary McCord: Including prosecutors. We were both assistant U.S. attorneys -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- with a lot of authority, not, you know, nominated by the president or confirmed by the Senate. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I was the head of the fraud section. I was the general counsel of the FBI. Neither of those are Senate confirmed. I had tons of authority. I could go ahead and indict people as the head of the fraud section, as a federal prosecutor. I had lots and lots of authority. And one of the things that she says is, oh, yes, it’s true that the attorney general is given the ability to hire employees, but the special counsel is not an employee. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Mary McCord: I wonder where he got his paycheck from. I mean, that should tell us something. Andrew Weissmann: The reason it’s wrong is she latches on to the special counsel under the special counsel rules, should be hired from outside the department. But then they are brought into the department -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and they are called a confidential employee under the statute. And it specifically provides for the fact that they’re a confidential employee. This, by the way, is at page 24 of her decision. And so this is just one where she says, well, I’m going to look at their status before they were appointed a special counsel, as if that’s the time period you want to look at it. The time period is obviously after. So I really think that she completely blew it legally. I also think that it really is a sign that she’s never worked at main justice because she keeps on thinking about, oh, well, he’s sort of like a U.S. attorney, but he’s not been confirmed by the Senate. But you know what? I was the head of the fraud section. I had over 100 people working for me. That’s larger than many, many, many U.S. attorney’s offices people could indict all the time. The other thing is she sort of doesn’t take account of and makes it sound like the special counsel could just do whatever the hell he wanted and doesn’t have to comply with DOJ rules. And I think I’ve talked about this on the podcast. That is so not true. You have to comply with every single Department of Justice rule because you are within the Department of Justice. So I have given as an example of that when I was working for Special Counsel Mueller, we wanted to bring tax cases, we had to get tax division authority. That means they had to approve, not us, they had to approve this going forward. Why? That’s DOJ policy. We wanted to bring a Foreign Agents Registration Act charge, which is a type of national security charge. You know who we had to approve that? Mary McCord: National Security Division. Andrew Weissmann: The National Security Division. Mary McCord: I sure do, because I was there. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So again, we had to go through all of those internal rules. It’s not like we had just a notice requirement. We had to get approval. We had to do all of the approvals that anybody in the Department of Justice had. And I keep on saying when I was in the special counsel, I have never been more overseen, certainly far more than when I was the head of the fraud section. Mary McCord: I mean, it’s in the regulations. It’s not day to day, but it’s not day to day of an AUSA or a U.S. attorney either. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But still, they have to comply with what you and I know as and which are specifically referenced in here, what we call urgent reports, which means any U.S. attorney in the special counsel, when they’re getting ready to take an action in a sensitive investigation involving, you know, either a sensitive target or a controversial action, they have to run that up the flagpole in what is aptly called an urgent report so that the deputy attorney general and the attorney general have the chance to say, wait a minute, stop the presses. You’re not doing that. Andrew Weissmann: And the key word there is they have to. Mary McCord: Yes, it’s not optional. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not like, you know, we’d like it, Mary, if you would, could you just come by if you have time? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Doesn’t work that way. Mary McCord: In fact, at some point, she basically says it’s completely within the special counsel, their own discretion, whether to discuss things with the attorney general. But she takes that part of the regulations completely like out of context and ignores the reg that we were just talking about that requires mandates, urgent reports. So there’s a lot wrong with that. But I want to post something to you, though, because we can spend a lot of time talking about how she gets wrong her, you know, what type of officer he might be. But ultimately, I think her ruling doesn’t rest on that because she says, I’m going to sort of with reservations say he’s an inferior officer. But it doesn’t really matter because if you were a principal officer, then clearly this violates the appointments clause because he should have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. And so even if I consider him an inferior officer, the basis for her ruling is, in her view, there is no explicit statute that Congress passed that says Attorney General of the United States of America shall have the authority to appoint special counsels to investigate whatever the issue might be when there’s an investigative need. That I saw as the heart of her ruling. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And to me, that’s kind of insane, and how’s that for not using great legal language, which is that there are statutes like 28 U.S.C., I think it’s 533. Mary McCord: 533 that she says, oh, that’s about the FBI and inferior. She writes that one off. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. But I mean, I didn’t see that why that’s just about the FBI. So, again, just to be clear, the attorney general can appoint just to personalize it, can appoint someone to be the head of the Enron task force. They could appoint someone to be head of the fraud section. And you are within the Department of Justice and you have lots of authority, but you’re an inferior officer because you ultimately report to the attorney general and so I just don’t understand. Once you cave on the issue of, okay, this is an inferior officer, I think you lose because the department’s made up of inferior officers. That is like, what are you going to say that every single employee can’t be hired? And so she really doesn’t wrestle with what would be the limits on that authority. If there is no authority to hire underlings, then are the tens of thousands of employees at the Justice Department, all Congress had no idea that they could be appointed. And by the way, this is where the history of this is so much against her because you don’t have Congress in any way pushing back going, oh, wait, you’re doing something wrong and I didn’t understand it. Mary McCord: For decades and decades, through multiple special counsels, right? Not only did they never push back -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- not only did they withhold funding, they continued to put money, you know, to allow for money to go into the very source of funding for these various appointments. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, do you want an interesting factoid? Mary McCord: Sure. Andrew Weissmann: Because this may affect our -- Mary McCord: Our next discussion? Andrew Weissmann: -- our next discussion about what to do next, because I have like an idea. Mary McCord: Okay. Andrew Weissmann: But here’s a factoid that may be of interest to folks, but also could maybe something to think about in deciding what to do. When the independent counsel law was sunsetting and the independent counsel law was very critiqued because of sort of the Ken Starr people going overboard. Mary McCord: Six years or something, wasn’t it? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And remember, Brett Kavanaugh worked for Ken Starr, just, you know, FYI. And when it was sunsetting, there was a group of people on the Hill who were sort of tasked with thinking about what to do. And there were a whole bunch of people who were thinking about what is a way to have something that is more tethered to the Department of Justice, that is less independent. And ultimately, the department put out the regulations under Janet Reno. But in that group that came up with essentially the blueprint for this, one of the people who worked on the blueprint for what is the special counsel rules is. Mary McCord: Drumroll. Andrew Weissmann: Current Chief Justice John Roberts. Mary McCord: John Roberts. Andrew Weissmann: So he worked on these. It would be so interesting. And to me, it’s sort of like it’s how Brett Kavanaugh was so bizarre, in my view, in his immunity decision, given his role in the Ken Starr case and -- Mary McCord: And you may recall during argument, somewhat out of the blue, he also talked about Morrison v. Olson being, he thought, one of the worst decisions of all time. This is the decision that upheld the Independent Counsel Act, which has since sunsetted. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. So we have the current chief justice who was fashioning something to make this more tethered to the Department of Justice that would make it a stronger case for constitutionality than Morrison, which dealt with the independent counsel rules. So even if Morrison is good law, by the way, aren’t you struck by the fact that Judge Cannon just basically ignores that decision? Mary McCord: She doesn’t. Well, she talks about it, but when she’s trying to decide whether he’s inferior or not and she does apply things, but then she still, you know, says, well, in light of a case that came after that, I’m not so sure that’s right. She does a lot of very long winded explanations for things and oftentimes concludes, but I don’t have to decide this. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: I will say one other major factor, I think, of the opinion, and you’ve kind of alluded to it, is that many, many courts have upheld this and a lot of those courts have done so in reliance on U.S. v. Nixon, an obvious Nixon era case that was not about a prosecution of the president, but it was about seeking evidence from the president for a criminal prosecution of others related to Watergate. And so the issue of the independent counsel there, was he called a special counsel at that point? I think that’s before Independent Counsel Act. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: Yes. Leon Jaworski. Andrew Weissmann: Special prosecutor. Mary McCord: Right. Special prosecutor. There are a couple of sentences in that opinion, and that opinion does say that when there is a demonstrable need for evidence that can overcome the executive privilege of the president to withhold that evidence, that was the conclusion there. And that’s why when we go back and talk about the immunity case, I feel like the immunity case sort of seemed to overrule U.S. v. Nixon, but doesn’t say that it did. That’s for another day. But there’s another key part of this case, which says, Congress has vested in the attorney general the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States. It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties, citing a bunch of statutes that Merrick Garland relied on in his appointment of Jack Smith and which other attorneys general appointed by both parties have relied on. Then it goes on to say, acting pursuant to those statutes, the attorney general has delegated the authority to represent the United States in these particular matters to a special prosecutor with unique authority and tenure. They don’t call that into question. They don’t say, we’re not sure this is right. They don’t say this might violate the appointments clause. They just state this all as a fact. And then they go on to decide that the special prosecutor could subpoena that information from the sitting president, Richard Nixon, and overcome the president’s executive privilege. So what does Cannon say about that? She says, that’s dicta. Dicta, of course, is when the court says something that is not like load bearing to the merits of the opinion, is not necessary to the merits of opinion. And she says, no one had argued about whether the special prosecutor was constitutionally appointed there. The court didn’t really have to decide the issue. So their statement, essentially saying that he’s got valid authority, is mere dicta. Mind you, you really couldn’t have gone on to issue the decision -- Andrew Weissmann: Of course, right. Mary McCord: -- in that case if they’d have thought that the special prosecutor was unconstitutionally appointed. But that, she jettisons in her opinion. Andrew Weissmann: Quick anecdote, and then we’ll go to the question of what would you do now? When we were litigating this and won in front of every court, when Special Counsel Mueller was bringing his cases and every defendant was challenging this and every judge was affirming it, we used to joke with him and we said, well, you’re just a subordinate officer. Mary McCord: I’m sure you did. No question about it. Andrew Weissmann: You’re just inferior. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And he’s like, that’s very funny. But that was the critical language that he is subordinate to, inferior to the head of the department -- Mary McCord: It’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that is the attorney general. Okay, let’s take a break, and then we’ll come back with, if you’re Jack Smith, what would you do? (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. I know you’re dying to say what you would do. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, but I was going to turn it to you first, but what do you want? Do you want to go first? Mary McCord: Well, it doesn’t matter. I mean, okay, I’ll go first. So I would not make a decision immediately if I were Jack Smith, right? I would take some time. I would sleep on this. I would reread it again tomorrow. And then I would consult with my whole team. I would at least seek to consult with the deputy attorney general and the attorney general, not to mention the solicitor general, because if he decides to appeal this, which is very much an option, because this is one of the things, again, that prosecutors can appeal, a complete dismissal of your case. If he decides to appeal this, he has a decision to make about whether he wants to try, as he did in the immunity case, to go straight to the Supreme Court and skip the 11th Circuit, ask certiorari before judgment, or whether he wants to just go ahead and appeal as a matter of course to the 11th Circuit. So that’s clearly an option for him. Because there is some risk there that if and when this gets to the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas and a court that we no longer seem to be able to predict very well will not render a favorable decision. There’s another option. Andrew Weissmann: Guilty. Guilty. By the way, the 11th Circuit, you could also have, you know, this issue of whether they would bounce her because you could ask to have her removed or the 11th Circuit could do it on its own. But as you said, the Supreme Court could weigh in on that too. Mary McCord: That’s right. Anything in front of the 11th Circuit would be appealable to the Supreme Court. Now, they don’t have to take the case, right, if they agree with what the 11th Circuit did. And that all takes time, lots of time. Another option is that either the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida, technically it could be elsewhere like D.C., can just start over and indict the case, bring in a grand jury, present the evidence, and seek a new indictment. And in fact, you know, the National Security Division could, with respect to at least the classified information charges, also using another grand jury, do the same thing. And I kind of lean that way a little bit because then you avoid this entire issue of the appointments clause. You avoid it ever getting to the Supreme Court. But the problem here is I wouldn’t want to do it in D.C. because it would just look like you’re judge shopping. So I’d probably suggest that it happen in Southern District of Florida, which means you could just get Judge Cannon again. Then she’d maybe find a different way to dismiss the case. But you’d at least get beyond the appointments clause issue. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So this is really interesting. So my first reaction, and again, I would sleep on it, is that I would just go ahead and get a U.S. attorney’s office to bring in -- Mary McCord: Same thing I just said. Okay, we’re in agreement here. Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: I know. This is like a violent agreement. And the reason is Judge Cannon is saying the flaw here is that it wasn’t brought by a confirmed United States attorney. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Well, go ahead and do it. Mary McCord: Do it. Andrew Weissmann: It happens every day of the week. And by the way, when people say what’s involved, super easy. You have a grand jury, let’s impanel all the time. You could bring an agent in, they can put the transcripts of the prior proceeding, and it’s just a very easy process. And that way you just avoid delay and the uncertainty. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And I personally would want to avoid the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: Absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: You know, like the plague, because they’re so result-oriented. And so you could just be like, you know what, you think this is a problem? Mary McCord: You do it. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not, you’re wrong, but I can remedy this in about two seconds. So that is, I think, sort of step one. The harder issues are the sort of where do it is sort of a euphemism for, do you seek to remove her? Do you finally make a motion for her to recuse herself and try and take that up or have it go to the chief judge in the district court level or the 11th Circuit? And that’s where, in some ways, what you’re doing is the merits of the decision could be litigated in the context of how wrong she was in this. And that would also have some delay in it, which I think, I guess I’m a little less worried about -- Mary McCord: Same. Andrew Weissmann: -- because this case is never going to trial before the general election. And so I think I would sort of do it that way. There also is the ability to sort of have your cake and eat it too, in the sense that you could go ahead and bring this new indictment. And I still think there’s a little piece that’s alive for purposes of appeal. I’m not sure you’d have to do it that way. But because I think that there’s residual issues that remain, for instance, what would happen to the work and the evidence that was done when Jack Smith was -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- doing the work but wasn’t officially supposed to be there? And is there prejudice from that? What do you do with it? This is a way of saying there still might be standing that the case wouldn’t be totally mooted out if you were to bring a new charge, but then say that there shouldn’t be these ramifications. Mary McCord: I think it would just be procedurally different because she has dismissed this one. If they don’t appeal it, this is a closed case. If they re-bring and it gets assigned to her, and even if it doesn’t get assigned to her, I suspect that Mr. Trump’s team would argue that you couldn’t even introduce -- they don’t have a good argument here, but that you couldn’t even introduce the transcripts to a new grand jury because those transcripts were the result of subpoenas by Jack Smith, who was acting outside of any authority. So I think I’m getting it the same thing as you, but I think it would all be in the context of a new matter. And -- Andrew Weissmann: Unless you appealed it. Unless you did kind of both, you both appealed this matter. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Anyway, you know, this is like super technical, but the bottom line is that because this is such a technical decision, there is a way to remedy it. And I’d just like to go back to something I was saying at the outset, which is, as we’ve talked about, what she is saying is that the special counsel here was not sufficiently tethered to the Department of Justice, was not sufficiently tethered to the president of the United States. He wasn’t appointed by the president, and he wasn’t sufficiently under the control of the attorney general. That is the antithesis of the attack on the special counsel’s investigation by Donald Trump, which is that it is weaponized as being political. And she is not dismissing it for that reason. In fact, it is the opposite reason. And it’s really important for people to sort of realize that when he says, oh, look, everything’s weaponized, whatever her motives are, you know, when we can guess what they are and have a pretty good guess, her reasoning is the opposite. Mary McCord: Completely inconsistent with his claims and his rhetoric, yeah, throughout, which may change, but may not change in light of this new unity messaging that we’re looking forward to. And I’m not trying to be facetious there. I’m trying to be serious, but I’m not a hundred -- Andrew Weissmann: Skeptical. Mary McCord: -- percent yes, exactly. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, once again, it is, with all of this breaking news, but highly serious, the legal opinion that came out, and it’s so great to be able to talk to you about it. We have something special planned for next week because we’re going to be together and we’ll be doing a live show next week. And we’ll talk some more about that at the time. But in the meantime, really great to talk to you. Mary McCord: Same, Andrew. Thanks so much for listening. To send us a question, you can leave us a voicemail at 917-342-2934.

Ex-Trump aide Peter Navarro to speak at RNC after prison release,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/peter-navarro-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162294,"Former Donald Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro was released from federal prison in Miami on Wednesday morning. His next stop is Milwaukee, where he's scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention. Navarro served his four-month term following his conviction for contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with a House Jan. 6 committee subpoena. The Supreme Court rejected his bid to stay free while he appeals and his legal challenge is pending. Trump ally Steve Bannon is currently incarcerated for his own contempt of Congress conviction, which he’s appealing from behind bars after the Supreme Court also rejected his bid to stay free in the meantime. Navarro’s expected appearance on the convention stage comes shortly after Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey was found guilty on 16 counts in his federal corruption trial; top Democrats quickly called on him to resign. Meanwhile, Navarro’s criminal history isn’t a hindrance to him being platformed by the Republican Party. Indeed, the former Trump adviser’s speaking engagement doesn't come in spite of his conviction but because of it. The party's embrace of Navarro fits well within its “law and order” mantra, which doesn’t mandate a literal application of the law but is rather about maintaining a certain social order. The party’s presidential nominee was criminally indicted four times and convicted once so far, in New York state court (he pleaded not guilty in every case). Trump was supposed to have been sentenced in that case last week, but the sentencing was postponed after the immunity ruling handed down by the Supreme Court majority he helped appoint. If he wins in November, Trump is poised to get his federal cases dismissed by a new attorney general who’d presumably still apply the nation’s laws to those deemed the real criminals by the administration. Or Trump could attempt a legally untested self-pardon should he return to the White House. He has already said that he would grant clemency to Jan. 6 defendants, and he pardoned Bannon before leaving office last time. With that in mind, whatever Navarro’s political plans, his best legal strategy may be staying in Trump’s good graces.  "
VP Kamala Harris emerges as a main target at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republican-national-convention-kamala-harris-biden-border-rcna162291,"With President Joe Biden's nomination still on shaky ground, Republicans at their party's national convention this week have sharpened their criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden's likeliest replacement on the ticket. Harris was featured prominently in speeches over the first two days of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Speakers made sure to name her while criticizing the Biden administration's policies, and they sought to tie her to major election issues, including the border crisis — repeatedly referring to her as the ""border czar"" — and violent crime. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Tuesday accused Biden and Harris of welcoming a “Third World invasion” through the border. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley warned of “four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris” in her speech. She mischaracterized Harris' role in leading the administration’s effort to address the root causes of migration in 2021. “Kamala had one job — one job — and that was to fix the border,"" Haley said. ""Now imagine her in charge of the entire country?” Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt claimed that Biden and Harris opened the border “to terrorists, to criminals.” He also pointed to violent crime during the pandemic, saying Harris “shares in those failures.” Violent crime surged in 2020 — when Donald Trump was still president — but it has steadily dropped in the following years. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer also tried to link violent crime to Harris. “When Minneapolis was in flames and businesses were in ruins, Kamala Harris encouraged and enabled the criminals and the rioters,” he said, presumably referring to the 2020 racial justice protests. The attacks on Harris at the RNC are part of a broader GOP strategy to cast the vice president as a bigger target ahead of the November election. Reporting has indicated that while the Trump campaign hopes Biden stays in the race, believing it is easier to defeat him than any other Democrat, it is homing in on its attacks on Harris in case the president bows out. Trump himself has increasingly criticized Harris on the campaign trail in recent weeks, mispronouncing her first name and painting her as part of the “radical left.”"
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 7.17.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-71724-rcna162337,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * At the 2004 Republican National Convention, some attendees put bandages on their faces as a way to mock then-Sen. John Kerry’s Purple Heart. Twenty years later, at the 2024 Republican National Convention, some attendees have put bandages on their ears as a sign of solidarity with Donald Trump. * On the second night of the Republicans’ convention, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice declared, in apparent reference to his fellow partisans, “We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.” * Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. JD Vance reportedly spoke yesterday and agreed to debate. The details, however, are still being negotiated. * While abortion rights proponents in Arkansas apparently collected enough signatures to force a vote on a constitutional amendment, Republican Secretary of State John Thurston concluded that there was a technical problem with organizers’ paperwork. Not surprisingly, this is now the subject of a new lawsuit. * In related news, voters in Arizona are slated to vote in the fall on an abortion rights measure, but a Republican-dominated legislative panel wants to include language in a voter pamphlet that refers to a fetus as an “unborn human being.” This, too, is the subject of a new lawsuit. * In New Jersey, Democratic primary voters this week chose LaMonica McIver, the Newark city council president, as their choice to replace the late U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. The general election in this race is Sept. 18, and McIver will face Carmen Bucco, a small-business owner who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. * Late last week, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, announced it’s rolling back some restrictions on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. The New York Times reported, “Under the restrictions on Mr. Trump’s accounts, he could have been suspended from Meta’s services — which also include Threads and WhatsApp — if he had posted content that sought to delegitimize this November’s election, among other things. But Meta said it was now relaxing those restrictions, reducing the potential for a suspension if Mr. Trump violated the company’s terms of service.”"
"On crime, Republican convention speakers turn reality on its head",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 8:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/crime-republican-convention-2024-biden-reality-head-rcna162318,"Every time new data is released on U.S. crime rates, the political world ponders the same question: Why is it that the public believes crime is getting worse, when the evidence makes clear that crime rates are getting better? The answer is multifaceted, but it’s hardly unreasonable to think deceptive Republican rhetoric has made the problem worse. On the second night of the Republican National Convention, for example, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik railed against President Joe Biden’s “violent crime crisis.” House Speaker Mike Johnson made similar comments, declaring, “We can’t survive the dramatic increases in violence, crime and drugs that the Democrats’ policies have brought upon our communities.” Note the over-the-top hyperbole: To hear the Louisiana Republican tell it, crime hasn’t just reached crisis levels, it’s also reached the point at which the United States “can’t survive” such rampant crime. For now, let’s put aside the irony of Republican officials denouncing crime rates while simultaneously nominating a criminal for the nation’s highest office. Instead, let’s focus on the degree to which Stefanik, Johnson and several other convention speakers turned reality on its head. In fact, CNN reported a month ago on the latest statistics from the FBI showing a 15% drop in violent crime this year. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a written statement that the latest data “makes clear that last year’s historic decline in violent crime is continuing.” The reference to last year was especially notable because of the encouraging results from 2023. NBC News reported in March, for example, “that crime in the U.S. declined significantly in 2023, continuing a post-pandemic trend and belying widespread perceptions that crime is rising.” All of this, of course, follows a dramatic spike in the murder rate in 2020 — the final year of Donald Trump’s presidency. As for the political implications of the recent progress, I’m reminded anew of a line in a recent Axios report that stood out for me: “Polls show crime is a top concern ahead of the 2024 election — and it’s an issue where Republicans regularly edge Democrats. But falling homicide rates could take the steam out of the crucial GOP advantage.” That’s true; it could. That said, it’s difficult to have confidence that it will. Prominent Republican voices likely know that crime rates are falling. That apparently doesn’t stop them from telling the public the opposite of the truth, working from the assumption that many voters will simply believe the falsehoods and never hear about actual crime data. Circling back to our recent coverage, political campaigns have long followed some intuitive rules. Those looking to win tend to identify rivals’ areas of weakness and focus attention accordingly. Similarly, candidates have also taken care to learn about their foes’ strengths and steer their races away from those issues. But crime rates offer a great example of how contemporary Republican politics rejects the intuitive rules for a different model. The evidence makes clear that Biden has a compelling story to tell: Crime rates, most notably murder rates, spiked toward the end of his Republican predecessor’s term. Under the incumbent Democratic president’s leadership, Americans are now safer. Common sense might suggest that GOP officials would see the news and try to move the public conversation away from this area of strength for Biden. But as it turns out, they find it far easier to effectively say, “Why don’t we just make stuff up and wait for the public to buy it?” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why the GOP's ‘rule of law’ focus is literally unbelievable,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 7:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-convention-rule-law-trump-2020-rcna162302,"During her remarks at the Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird delivered an odd boast about her party’s approach to law enforcement. “We put criminals where they belong: in jail,” Bird said to applause. “That’s why we need to elect President Donald J. Trump.” If the Iowa Republican was aware of the contradiction, she didn’t show it. After all, a jury recently found the former president guilty of 34 felonies, which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault. By Bird’s reasoning, she and her party should be eager to put Trump behind bars, not in the White House. The state attorney general, however, was hardly alone. Vivek Ramaswamy, ignoring the former president’s crimes, insisted on the convention stage that Trump would “restore law and order in this country.” House Speaker Mike Johnson similarly declared, “We in the Republican Party are the law-and-order team. We always have been, and we always will be, the advocates for the rule of law.” My personal favorite was the speech from House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who practically shouted this incredible message: “Donald Trump stands with the people and the police — our men and women in blue — not with the criminals and rioters.” So, a few things. First, it was kind of amusing to hear the Minnesota congressman say Trump doesn’t stand with “rioters” when much of the former president’s candidacy is rooted in his support for rioters. Second, the idea that the former president stands with “the police” isn’t quite that simple. In reality, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. So much for ""back the blue."" Third, the House speaker’s claim that the Republican Party honors “the rule of law” is belied by overwhelming evidence. Revisiting our recent coverage, it remains true that a party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t nominate a person convicted of felonies for the nation’s highest office. A party that cares about the rule of law also wouldn’t try to undermine public confidence in the judicial system without cause. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t try to defund law enforcement agencies based on nonsensical conspiracy theories. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t endorse retaliatory, politically motivated prosecutions against innocent people. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t reward accused criminals, elevating them to positions in which they could help steer the party’s future. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t have a suspected criminal, indicted on election-related charges, oversee the party’s election-year legal efforts. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t rally behind a presidential nominee who’s running on a platform of pardoning violent criminals and putting them back onto the streets. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t nominate for president a criminal who’s surrounded himself with other convicted criminals. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t scramble to condemn one of its own after he encouraged voters to respect the legal process. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t boo police officers for telling them inconvenient truths. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t invite a convicted criminal to speak at their national convention within hours of his release from prison. The contemporary Republican Party, however, has done all of this and more — recently. It’s the same Republican Party that was indifferent toward Trump-era White House corruption, saw some of its members sentenced to prison, expressed indifference when their party’s then-president tried to weaponize federal law enforcement, and participated in a radical, dangerous, and unprecedented plot to overturn the results of a free and fair American presidential election. Partisans such as House Speaker Mike Johnson are welcome to claim that the Republican Party is “the law-and-order team,” but that won’t make it true. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Nikki Haley takes a circuitous route to a pro-Trump convention speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 6:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nikki-haley-takes-circuitous-route-trump-convention-speech-rcna162288,"Last year, after Donald Trump mocked House Majority Whip Tom Emmer and derailed the Minnesotan’s bid for House speaker, Emmer would’ve been justified in holding a grudge. Instead, the congressman went to great lengths to curry favor with the former president, offering Trump sycophantic support. “They always bend the knee,” Trump said soon after. The phrase came to mind watching Nikki Haley endorse her former primary rival at the Republican National Convention. A Washington Post report summarized: Haley nevertheless declared that she was giving Trump her “strong endorsement, period.” The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations didn’t have to do this. Indeed, plenty of her GOP contemporaries chose a different course. But Haley still wants a future in Republican politics, so she played the role of a loyal, partisan soldier. It’s worth pausing, though, to acknowledge the weird and circuitous path the South Carolinian has followed. Eight years ago, when there was still some question as to whether Trump would be able to take over the Republican Party, Haley was categorical in rejecting Trump — and Trumpism. “I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party,” she said in 2016. “That is not who we want as president.” Around the same time, Haley added, “I have to tell you, Donald Trump is everything I taught my children not to do in kindergarten.” A year later, Haley reversed course and joined Trump’s team. After Jan. 6, Haley reversed course again, telling Politico after the attack on the Capitol that Trump “went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. And we can’t let that ever happen again.”  Soon after, Haley reversed course again, re-embraced party orthodoxy, defended Trump, and vowed not to run against him in 2024. A year and a half later, Haley reversed course again and challenged Trump for their party’s nomination. During their primary fight, she told voters that the former president had become “unstable and unhinged.” After Trump went after her husband, Haley said Trump is “not qualified” to be president. She later reversed course again, leading to her convention endorsement. I’m reminded of something National Review’s Philip Klein wrote in 2021: “A few weeks ago, back when she thought tide was turning against Trump, Haley said he would be ‘judged harshly by history.’ Now she realized she got ahead of her skis and is trying to take it back. As I’ve written, she is a human chameleon. She thinks we’re too dumb to notice.” Plenty of Republicans have made the transition from Trump critic to Trump supporter. His own running mate falls into the category. But no one in public life has changed their minds about Trump more than Haley."
Why Ted Cruz’s ugly speech at the Republican convention matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ted-cruzs-ugly-speech-republican-convention-2024-rcna162274,"Eight years ago this week, Sen. Ted Cruz delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention. They were not well received. The Texas senator had just wrapped up his own failed presidential bid, during which time he got to know Donald Trump fairly well. Their relationship, however, could’ve been better: The future president went after Cruz’s wife and suggested Cruz’s father played a role in the JFK assassination. The senator, meanwhile, told voters that Trump was a “pathological liar,” a “bully,” a “narcissist,” “utterly amoral” and a “sniveling coward” with “a consistent pattern of inciting violence.” With this in mind, when Cruz spoke at his party’s 2016 convention, he couldn’t quite bring himself to endorse his former rival, instead saying, “If you love our country and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience.” The booing from attendees was relentless. In the years that followed, the senator did what most Republicans did and became a Trump sycophant. It was against this backdrop that the far-right senator spoke again at his party’s national convention — and this time, he received a far warmer reception than he did eight years ago. Cruz pleased attendees, not only by throwing his support behind the GOP ticket, but also by feeding the crowd the kind of anti-immigrant red meat that tends to generate strong reactions. Pitching the idea that the United States has become a violent hellscape as a result of undocumented criminals, Cruz went so far as to declare: “How did we get here? It happened because Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children.” To the extent that reality still matters, Cruz combined a series of lies to create one larger lie. The senator told people to believe that non-citizen voting is rampant, which isn’t true. He told people to believe that Democratic officials want support from non-citizen voters, which isn’t true and doesn’t make any sense. And perhaps most importantly, Cruz told people to believe that Democratic officials are willing to sacrifice the lives of American children — deliberately — in order to benefit electorally from the support from non-citizen voters, which is transgressive madness. A Washington Post analysis described the Texas Republican’s rhetoric as “grotesque.” Cruz is not a dumb man. He surely knows that his ugly rhetoric is false. He pitched it to a national audience anyway. So much for “unity.” Watching the senator’s appalling speech, I was reminded of recent chatter about Cruz turning over a new leaf. The Texas Tribune reported in April, for example, that Cruz, as part of his latest re-election campaign, was “casting himself as a bipartisan lawmaker with a penchant for reaching across the aisle.” The Wall Street Journal soon after published a related report, noting that Cruz is “rolling out a softer, bipartisan side,” and taking steps to “recast his image as a dealmaking lawmaker.” The article added, “His campaign even shot ads featuring ‘Democrats for Cruz.’” His convention speech made fools of those who believed such talk."
The dangerous story Trump fans are telling themselves at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-2024-election-inevitable-rcna162149,"Every four years, the two parties hold their national conventions and boast that their nominees are going to win the presidential election in the fall. Conventions are times to project confidence and unity. However, in speeches from and interviews with Republicans and their conservative allies at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, they’re expressing more than confidence in former President Donald Trump’s chances. They’re expressing inevitability. Even before the stunning events of the last several days, the mood among Trump’s devotees was that he can’t lose against President Joe Biden. The convention has seen Republicans double down on that rhetoric, throwing out any caution about predicting a blowout. It’s more than bravado. It’s a flashing warning sign for what may come if the tides shift before November. Since the presidential debate between Trump and Biden in Atlanta last month, Republicans have been more than happy to sit back and watch Democrats panic over their standard-bearer’s performance and debate replacing him on top of the ticket. Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania has further galvanized his followers’ belief that he can’t lose. “Let’s be honest,” former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said at the Heritage Foundation’s Policy Fest, held across the street from the RNC on Monday. “Trump just won. He just won.” Carlson, who will speak from the main stage at the RNC later this week, wasn’t alone in that thinking. Even as official speakers were told to be a bit more restrained in their speeches, the shooting was taken among Trump supporters as a sign that it’s impossible for him to lose. Evangelical leaders like Franklin Graham have joined members of Trump’s family and campaign in referring to his survival in biblical terms, framing the Trump victory that will follow as nothing short of God’s will. The New York Times reported that attendees viewed the incident as “just one more example of the way everything — everything — seems to be going their way.” To wit: Mere hours before Carlson’s speech, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon tossed out the federal classified documents case against Trump. One of his vanquished foes in the primaries, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, was scheduled to encourage her supporters to shift their allegiance to Trump, promoting party unity over her past criticisms. It’s no wonder the crowd went wild when the perfectly timed appearance of Trump, with his ear still bandaged, prompted a chant of “Fight! Fight! Fight!” from the gathered throngs. Republicans are feeling understandably geared up. But the GOP’s success isn’t quite the slam dunk that it’s being made out to be in Milwaukee, not with the election still months away. It’s worth bearing in mind that the predictions of a red wave in 2022 fizzled out, yielding the weakest midterm performance by a party that didn’t hold the White House has had in decades. And the polls still show Biden and Trump running neck and neck even after the tumult of the last few months. And as this week has already shown, there’s a lot that can happen between now and the election. It’s not even certain that the same issues Republicans hope to campaign on will be at play then. The convention’s theme Monday — “Make America Wealthy Once Again” — already clashed with reality. Despite the dire warnings from speakers throughout the day about the supposed horrors of the Biden economy, inflation has leveled off after its post-pandemic peaks, opening the doors to the Federal Reserve’s potentially cutting interest rates between now and November. And unemployment remains low. In these circumstances, some might find it wise to proceed with at least a little caution for fear of jinxing things. But it’s not just a lack of superstition that is undergirding the GOP’s sureness. The narrative that Trump and his allies have crafted is one that rules out any potential loss as illegitimate. According to an AP-NORC poll conducted last year, even before this feeling of inevitability manifested, 46% of Republicans already expressed little to no faith that November’s ballots will be counted accurately. Unlike in 2020, when only the most die-hard MAGA elected officials offered full-throated backing for Trump’s wild claims of Democratic election fraud, he will be supported this time by a vast and growing GOP infrastructure primed to do whatever it takes to ensure that failure isn’t an option. Conservative lawyers are already gearing up to target the U.S. voting system in the election’s aftermath, seeking to nullify a Biden win. The Republican National Committee has shifted resources to focus on “election integrity” over helping states drive people out to the polls. Confidence is a virtue; finding it impossible to believe you could be wrong, as Republicans now do, is hubris that could have dire consequences for the future of democracy. This is what makes it so dangerous for Democrats, reeling from the internal debate over Biden’s future, to buy into the idea that Trump’s win is inevitable, as well. Doing so would be tantamount to endorsing Republicans’ narrative. Democrats need to remember that there’s still time to prove the GOP’s certainty wrong and win in November — even if Republicans are unwilling to admit that such a thing is possible."
"Today’s GOP has no past, present, or future. It’s just Trump.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speakers-donald-trump-snub-rcna161770,"In his seminal dystopian novel, “1984,” George Orwell wrote “who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” Suffice it to say, Orwell would have had a field day at the 2024 Republican National Convention.  Indeed, there is no better example of former President Donald Trump’s hold over the modern GOP than this week’s near-total erasure of the Republican Party’s past. You might not be aware of it by watching the Republican convention this week, but the Republican Party is, in fact, 170 years old. It was formed in 1854 as an abolitionist movement opposed to the expansion of slavery into western territories. Its first standard-bearer was Abraham Lincoln, which is why the GOP is sometimes referred to as the “Party of Lincoln.” Nineteen presidents have been Republicans. But if you watch the 2024 Republican convention, you are likely to hear about only one: Donald Trump. It’s as if MAGA wiped the GOP slate clean and made 2016 its Year Zero. Other than Trump, there’s only one other living Republican ex-president: George W. Bush. He’s one of only four Republican presidents in history to win two presidential elections and serve eight years in office. And the chances of hearing Bush’s name mentioned in a positive light by convention speakers in Milwaukee this week are close to nil.  Twenty years ago, Bush was a revered figure within the GOP (for those of you who are younger, you’ll have to take my word for it).  But in the 16 years since he left office, Bush’s presidency has largely been stuffed down the memory hole — and it has been a bipartisan effort. Even Democrats don’t bother talking about his disastrous presidency anymore. While Bush left office with a historically low approval rating and a cratering economy, that’s not necessarily why he is persona non grata in the party he once led. Bush was an internationalist. Trump is an isolationist. W was pro-immigration and, by and large, opposed to demonizing people of color. Trump is, of course, the exact opposite. And Bush is part of a multigenerational political dynasty. In other words, for MAGA he is the embodiment of the dreaded political establishment.   But it’s not just Bush who has been kicked to the curb. There are also three living Republican vice presidents not in attendance — Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and Mike Pence. Quayle has been out of the limelight for years; Cheney is the father of Liz Cheney, whom Trump despises for her role in co-chairing the House Jan. 6 committee, and, of course, on Jan. 6 Trump helped whip up a mob that threatened the life of Pence, his former vice president — so it’s probably best he didn’t make the trip to Milwaukee. (Incidentally, it was Quayle who told fellow Hoosier Pence that he didn’t have the authority to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election.) How about the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney? He’s retiring from the Senate, in large measure because of his revulsion at the direction the party has taken since Trump won its presidential nod in 2016. (Of course, Trump hates him, too, as Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict at both of Trump’s impeachment trials.) Romney’s 2012 running mate, Paul Ryan, a former speaker of the House, might be in attendance in Milwaukee (he is, after all, from Wisconsin), but he’s not speaking. The same goes for 2008 nominee Sarah Palin. Her running mate, John McCain, passed away in 2018, but there won’t be any glossy tributes for him. Trump, infamously, mocked McCain’s time as a POW in Vietnam. The national convention where McCain is most likely to show up is the Democratic National Convention. McCain’s widow, Cindy, spoke there in 2020. The 1996 presidential nominee (and 1976 vice presidential nominee), Bob Dole, passed away in 2021. What are the chances that there will be a tribute to him at this year’s Republican convention? There wasn’t one in 2020 to honor former President George H.W. Bush, who died in 2018. Will there even be a reference to Ronald Reagan, the president to whom Republicans tied themselves for decades after he left office? It’s hardly a guarantee, which once would have been sacrilegious at a GOP event but today is practically par for the course (although if one wants to see the new Reagan biopic starring Dennis Quaid, it’s showing every day in Milwaukee). Historically, political parties have a tendency to turn their backs on failed presidents or losing candidates. There weren’t many Republican conventions that extolled the virtues of Herbert Hoover after his disastrous one term in office. The same goes for Richard Nixon, the only president who was forced to resign. But even Nixon got a shoutout from the party’s presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996.  For Democrats, Jimmy Carter might have lost re-election in 1980 and is generally considered a failed president — but that didn’t stop Democrats from giving him a prime-time speaking slot at the next three conventions. This year, one can fully expect prime-time speeches from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. It wouldn’t be a surprise if Al Gore, John Kerry or Tim Kaine made appearances.  But at this year’s RNC, it’s as if there was no Republican Party before Trump came along. And, in a sense, that’s true. The current incarnation of the GOP bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan or the Bush family. The only real blast from the past is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. I could identify only two speakers who worked in the Bush administration. It’s now the party of Trump and Trumpism, of political outsiders and rebels — and the only price for entry is pledging one’s fealty to the leader (not the party). Of the dozens of speakers over four days in Milwaukee, virtually all came to prominence in just the past decade or so — and largely on Trump’s coattails. People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kari Lake, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Matt Gaetz are the faces of the modern GOP. Their rises to prominence have little to do with adherence to GOP policy orthodoxy or even their political chops but rather their willingness to prostrate themselves before Donald Trump — and fully embrace his many lies.  In Trump’s GOP, there are no legacy, no coherent ideological beliefs and no enduring political tradition. There is no past, present or future. There’s just Trump."
JD Vance’s ‘populism’ comes with some Trump-written fine print,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-populism-2024-trump-election-fine-print-rcna162409,"On the first night of the Republican National Convention, the party focused on “Making America Wealthy Again,” despite the fact that the United States has the strongest economy on the planet and is currently “the envy of the world.” On the second night, Republicans emphasized a “law and order” message, despite the fact that the party has nominated a criminal to lead its presidential ticket. On the third night of the gathering in Milwaukee, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee tried to sell voters on the idea that the party is prepared to shift its focus away from the wealthy elite as Donald Trump pitches tax breaks for billionaires at his glorified country club. Perhaps the “Make America Great Again” theme should be replaced with “Impose Cognitive Dissonance on America Again.” Voters unfamiliar with Sen. JD Vance might’ve tuned in to his convention speech, if for no other reason than to see and hear what the Ohio Republican had to say as he introduced himself to a national audience. His remarks were notable for a variety of reasons, though it was his economic vision that stood out. From the transcript of his remarks: The senator added soon after that he sees Trump as “America’s last best hope” for the nation’s working class. Vance went on to say, “We need a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business.” For viewers who didn’t know better, Vance’s rhetoric might very well have sounded like a refreshing break from party orthodoxy. It’s not exactly a secret that the Republican Party has championed the interests of the wealthy and corporate America for generations, so Vance’s version of “populism” appeared to represent an important shift. There was, however, a rather dramatic problem hanging overhead: Trump’s record and future plans. Indeed, literally one day before Vance boasted about Republicans no longer “catering to Wall Street,” the GOP’s presumptive presidential nominee boasted about his eagerness to slash the corporate tax rate in a prospective second term. The same day, The New York Times published a striking report on the degree to which Trump’s plans for trade tariffs would “widen the gap between the rich and the poor” and hit “lower-income households” the hardest. This is the same Trump who not only rewarded the wealthy and big businesses with massive tax giveaways in his first term, but who also supports undoing Wall Street safeguards — which helps explain why billionaires are rallying behind his candidacy. As for Vance’s idea that the United States needs ""a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business,” the Washington Post recently reported on the former president recently huddling with Big Oil leaders at Mar-a-Lago. If the account is accurate, the Republicans’ presumptive presidential nominee told the oil industry executives that they should raise $1 billion to return him to the White House — and if they did, he’d reward them by eliminating environmental safeguards and approving new tax breaks. The “deal” that Trump described, the Post added, “stunned several of the executives in the room.” Soon after, three oil executives organized an event for Trump — attendees paid $250,000 per person to be there — where the Republican assured his wealthy supporters that he’d do everything the oil industry wants, including lifting the natural gas export ban, scrapping existing energy safeguards and opening up more federal lands to oil drilling. After Vance exited the convention stage, I was left with one question: Does he have any idea what his new boss intends to do after the election?"
The worst thing about Ted Cruz’s dystopian RNC speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speech-ted-cruz-immigration-border-control-rcna162400,"If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the last nine years, it’s that when reality proves inconvenient for MAGA, MAGA simply creates its own reality. This was certainly true of Tuesday’s “Make America Safe Once Again” night at the Republican National Convention, at which the speaker’s podium was the rhetorical equivalent of a wrench-opened fire hydrant, as one speaker after another recklessly sprayed lies, fear and demagoguery in every direction.  Sen. Ted Cruz’s undiluted rage was particularly dishonest, and because it was Ted Cruz, it was as awkward as it was angry. His clumsy attempt to coax the crowd into a refrain of “every damn day” — a reference to how often he claimed that “teenagers, girls and boys” are raped, murdered and “sold into a life of sex slavery” because of “our open border” — mostly fell flat.  There are, of course, some documented examples of horrific crimes committed by undocumented people, as there are with any demographic group that numbers in the millions. But on the whole, immigrants both legal and undocumented commit crimes (violent crimes, in particular) at rates lower — often much lower — than the native-born population.  The much-maligned “sanctuary cities” have lower crime rates than other cities. Cities that have been hospitable to migrants seeking asylum have seen less crime than other cities. Crime in most of those cities has dropped since they began receiving migrants from the most recent wave of immigration, including the cities where Republican governors have been shipping migrants.  If such gruesome crimes were really happening “every damn day,” you’d think Cruz, R-Texas, could find more a recent horror story than, for example, the death of Kate Steinle, who died, as Cruz put it, after a man who “had been deported five times” fired a bullet that “ripped through her heart.”  If that name sounds familiar, it’s because Donald Trump also mentioned Steinle in his acceptance speech at the 2016 RNC. Steinle died nine years ago, after a man named José Inez García Zárate found a gun wrapped in cloth under a bench on a pier in San Francisco.  It’s true that Zárate had been deported five times. He was also a felon, though for nonviolent drug crimes. The gun had been stolen from an agent with the Bureau of Land Management, who left it unsecured in his car. Zárate testified at his trial that the gun went off when he picked it up. Ballistics reports confirmed that the bullet ricocheted off a concrete block and struck and killed Steinle, who was 90 feet away. There is no evidence that he intentionally fired the gun, much less that he intended to kill Steinle. A jury acquitted him on all charges but one (being a felon in possession of a firearm), and that charge was later thrown out by a judge. He pleaded guilty to related federal charges in 2022 and was deported this year. Steinle’s family has repeatedly asked politicians to stop politicizing her death. For politicians like Cruz, a family’s grief is legitimate only when it can be harnessed to hoover up votes.  Cruz also claimed that “Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children,” reiterating the central claim of conspiracists who push the racist “great replacement theory.” There is, of course, no evidence that undocumented people vote in significant numbers, that there’s some coordinated campaign to get them to the polls or that voting plays any role in the Biden administration’s immigration policy. (There is also evidence that Biden has actually been tougher on illegal border crossers than Trump.)   House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., repeated Trump’s brazen lie about other countries’ “emptying prisons” by sending their felons to the U.S. (Trump often includes “mental institutions” in his claim). There’s no evidence this is true. Ironically, it’s a line first used by Fidel Castro to denigrate refugees fleeing his communist regime and that Republicans today often use to slander Venezuelan migrants fleeing the socialist government of Nicolás Maduro.  Several speakers also repeated the tired claim that fentanyl has been flowing through the border because of the Biden administration’s lax enforcement.  According to data compiled by Dan Bier of the Cato Institute, just 2 of every 10,000 people caught trying to enter the country illegally possess any fentanyl at all. Over 90% of fentanyl seizures come at legal points of entry, and 86% of people convicted of smuggling the drug are U.S. citizens. Moreover, smuggling of fentanyl, which is easier to conceal and far more concentrated than other illicit drugs, actually increased during the Covid travel restrictions. The idea that Biden has been lax on border enforcement will come as a surprise to the immigrant advocates who are furious with him.   There’s also zero evidence that terrorists are traipsing across the southern border, as several speakers claimed. There has yet to be a single documented case of an American citizen killed or injured by a terrorist who illegally crossed the southern border, and since 1975 there have been only nine documented cases of anyone ultimately being convicted of terrorism after illegally entering the country.  Beyond immigration, speaker after speaker attempted to terrify viewers into the voting booth with claims about crime that have been disproven over and over again. We heard much about “Soros-funded” prosecutors’ unleashing a wave of crime and violence on America’s cities. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lamented that these prosecutors “care more about coddling criminals than protecting their own communities” and that they “impose their will on us without our consent.”  This is a particularly rich accusation to come from DeSantis, who removed two prosecutors overwhelmingly elected (and re-elected) by their constituents and replaced them with the very sort of law-and-order prosecutors those voters had rejected. Though DeSantis accused the prosecutors of being “soft on crime,” there’s little evidence that crime has been higher in their districts than in similar districts around the state. There’s also no evidence that progressive or reformist prosecution policies more broadly correlate with an increase in violent crime.  Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde claimed the Biden administration has “made us less safe at home with their ‘defund the police’ movement.”   That statement may be the most impressive lie-to-word-count ratio yet.  Biden didn’t support the “defund” movement; he was openly critical of it. The Biden administration hasn’t cut federal funding to law enforcement; it has increased it (sometimes over the objections of Republicans). In the two years after the George Floyd protests, 8 in 10 departments’ funding increased at least 2%. A handful of departments saw marginal cuts in funding, but no police department was “defunded.” There’s also zero evidence that more police funding corresponds with a reduction in crime or that less funding corresponds with an increase. (Otherwise, Hovde’s claim is accurate!)  Finally, here’s some context you didn’t hear: When Trump took office in 2017, he inherited the lowest murder rate of any president in half a century. He was then the first president in three decades to finish his term with a higher murder rate than when he started. Trump isn’t to blame for all of that. He presided over a once-in-a-generation pandemic that disrupted black markets, took witnesses off the streets and brought a wave of desperation and despair. His term also included the largest civil rights protests in U.S. history, which only reinforced the (understandable) antipathy toward police in many marginalized communities.  For the most part, presidents and their policies have little effect on crime. But there is some research suggesting that crime tends to go up when people see the government as corrupt, incompetent or hostile to their interests, particularly among marginalized groups. The theory here is that when people lose faith in government, they’re less likely to cooperate with state institutions like police and the courts. And it seems safe to say that from 2017 to 2021 there was ample reason to see the government as corrupt, incompetent and discriminatory. Immigrants, in particular, were less likely to report crimes and cooperate with police during the Trump years, most likely out of fear that they or their families would be subjected to immigration investigations.  All of that having been said, most of what drove the surge in crime was beyond Trump’s control. But this isn’t a courtesy Trump has given his opponents.  Back in 2016, Trump and his surrogates blamed Barack Obama for a surge in crime that never happened. They’re now doing the same thing to Biden. So it only seems fair to point out that the only major surge in crime in 40 years occurred while Trump was in the White House.   There is at least one class of crimes that has increased exponentially since Biden took office: crimes committed by former presidents. But that probably isn’t a trend the RNC wants to emphasize. "

Alleged neo-Nazi is accused of plotting mass attack in New York,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 4:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/new-york-city-attack-white-supremacist-plot-rcna162424,"A federal grand jury in New York City has handed down an indictment charging an alleged neo-Nazi leader with plotting a deadly attack on Jews and racial minorities. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that a 21-year-old Georgian national named Michail Chkhikvishvili had allegedly tried to recruit people to commit hate crimes and a mass casualty attack in Brooklyn. Authorities say he was known as “Commander Butcher” and led a white supremacist group called the Maniac Murder Cult. He was arrested in Moldova on July 6, officials said. According to a news release from the Justice Department: Authorities allege that Chkhikvishvili gave the undercover agent tips about how to carry out an attack: One of the schemes Chkhikvishvili is accused of plotting involved having someone dress up as Santa Claus and give out poison-laced candy to racial minorities and children at Jewish schools in Brooklyn. (Chkhikvishvili had no defense lawyer listed in online court records, NBC News reported.) By my count, this is the second federal indictment in a little over a month involving allegations of a foiled mass murder plot fueled by racist hate. In June, the Justice Department accused an Arizona man of plotting to spark a race war with a mass shooting at a rap concert in Atlanta. Combined with a resurgence of racist hate speech on X and other social media platforms — along with neo-Nazis comfortably marching through city streets, as we’ve seen in Nashville recently — these indictments point toward a spike in unabashed racism. And they underscore a fact highlighted by officials from both Donald Trump’s administration and Joe Biden’s: White supremacists remain a top domestic threat to Americans."
I've led battleground Republicans to victory. 'MAGA baggage' will cost them in 2024.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:09 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-maga-battleground-republicans-2024-rcna162362,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC’s special coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention on July 16. Republican Senate candidates took center stage on the second day of the 2024 Republican National Convention, including two notable and familiar faces: failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and Pennsylvania’s Dave McCormick. Both Lake and McCormick’s races will be critical as Republicans and Democrats battle for control of the Senate this November. Let’s start with McCormick’s bid against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania. I remember Casey’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate. I was working very hard with the Republican Party to defeat him — we were ultimately unsuccessful. At that time, I recognized some of the dynamics Casey brought to the table that made him a successful swing state candidate. He appealed not just to the more liberal parts of the state — southwestern Pennsylvania or Philadelphia — but also to the more traditionally conservative or center-right portions. Casey was and still is, in many respects, a quintessential Pennsylvanian candidate who has across-the-board appeal to voters. The same can’t be said for McCormick, who comes into November’s election with a serious handicap: the Republican Party’s MAGA baggage. The lies of the MAGA agenda are dissected a lot cleaner and a lot easier in statewide races where the margins are tighter. Now, if you’re Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or any Republican running in a heavily red district, that’s not something you necessarily have to worry about. But for McCormick in Pennsylvania and Lake in Arizona that should be top of mind.  As for Lake, she spent her time onstage Tuesday lying about a number of topics, including that her Democratic opponent in Arizona, Rep. Ruben Gallego, wants to let “millions” of undocumented immigrants vote in the upcoming election. Those lies, which are a key part of the MAGA playbook under Donald Trump, will catch up to her in November.  As long as Democrats quickly put the concerns over President Joe Biden’s candidacy behind them, they’re in a much stronger position this election cycle. There’s no Biden baggage on policy; Democrats don’t have to lie to voters. They can talk about abortion, they can lean into the Supreme Court, and they can run on the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS Act.  That ability to have that clear and concise narrative is essential for victory at the ballot box. It’s how I helped the Republican Party win in 2010. Under my leadership as Republican National Committee chairman, the GOP scored huge wins in the House and the Senate. Those victories didn’t come because we focused on battleground states alone. We had to create momentum elsewhere that boiled back into those battleground races. With the MAGA baggage weighing the Republican Party down, that task will be much harder today.

Matt Gaetz and Kevin McCarthy’s feud flares up at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 2:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/matt-gaetz-kevin-mccarthy-republican-national-convention-rcna162365,"The feud between Rep. Matt Gaetz and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy flared up yet again when the two men had a brief, tense encounter on the floor of the Republican National Convention. Footage of the Tuesday incident shows Gaetz approaching McCarthy, who is mid-conversation, and taunting him. “What night are you speaking? Are you speaking tonight, or ... ?” Gaetz asks as someone pushes him away. He then goes up to the California Republican again, saying: “If you took that stage, you would get booed off of it.” As Gaetz walks away, someone tells him to “shut up.” Gaetz’s instigation of McCarthy in such a public venue is not out of character for the 42-year-old Florida Republican, who is prone to trolling tactics. It also underscores the bad blood between the two, which previously resulted in McCarthy’s ousting as House speaker and weeks of disarray among the House GOP. And the feud shows no signs of ending. When asked about the incident later in the day, McCarthy suggested that Gaetz was upset that McCarthy had not halted a congressional ethics investigation into allegations that Gaetz paid a 17-year-old to have sex with him. (Gaetz has vehemently denied the allegation and any wrongdoing.) McCarthy told NBC News: “Well, it’s all about he had an ethics complaint four years ago that he paid an underage girl. ... And he came to me to try to leverage me to stop the ethics investigation. That’s illegal — I’m not doing that.” Last year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against Gaetz in a sex trafficking probe. The House Ethics Committee announced last month that it was continuing to investigate several allegations against him. On Tuesday, Gaetz railed against the investigation in a post on X and appeared to blame McCarthy, who resigned from Congress in December 2023. “This is Soviet. Kevin McCarthy showed them the man, and they are now trying to find the crime,” Gaetz wrote. “I work for Northwest Floridians who won’t be swayed by this nonsense and McCarthy and his goons know it.” In his interview with NBC News, McCarthy also seemed to suggest that Gaetz should be in prison. “Look, everybody has different people in their party,” he said. “Unfortunately, Matt happens to be here. I think at the end of the day, he probably shouldn’t be on the streets.”"
Tucker Carlson decries 'weak men' unwilling to beat up school employees,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 2:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/tucker-carlson-rnc-heritage-foundation-rcna162393,"Thus far, the Republican National Convention’s speakers have undermined some conservatives' claims that this year's event would focus on promoting national “unity.” Remarkably, though, some of the most disturbing speeches from right-wingers this week have come not from the main stage, but rather from a few blocks away at an event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, the group that coordinated the drafting of Project 2025, a far-right plan to increase Donald Trump's power and politicize federal agencies if he's elected in November. The Heritage Foundation's Policy Fest, an extremist-fueled speaker series keynoted by fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson, unfolded just down the street from Fiserv Forum, where the RNC is taking place. The physical distance seems to have been strategic. Trump has tried to publicly distance himself from Project 2025, though several of its authors were members of his administration. So perhaps some Republicans thought holding a Heritage Foundation event that’s ostensibly separate from the RNC would help the GOP’s effort to appear less radical.  But Monday proved that plenty of GOP power brokers are all in on Project 2025 and the politics that inspired it. Heritage Foundation CEO Kevin Roberts doubled down on Project 2025, calling it “a plan among a unified movement to speak on behalf of the everyday American, the forgotten American.” In reality, it reads more like a plan to remake the government under Christian nationalist and far-right ideals that include defining heterosexual marriage as “biblically based,” supercharging religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, withdrawing Food and Drug Administration approval of abortion medication and concentrating power in the presidency. Carlson boosted these alarming ideas in his Policy Fest speech on Monday, telling the crowd the recent shooting at a Trump rally proved there is a “spiritual battle” underway and claimed liberals are motivated by an “anti-human” force that seeks to “eliminate” Christians. Carlson later decried the abundance of “weak men” unwilling to commit violence against school employees. He falsely claimed schools are trying to ""indoctrinate"" kids and turn them into “circus freaks” before he fantasized about harming school employees.  “In the country that I grew up in, the dad would just punch the counselor out. You know, ‘Put me in jail, I don’t care,’” Carlson said, before baselessly suggesting school counselors are engaging in “child molester stuff.” He continued:  Policy Fest featured several other speakers well-known among the MAGA faithful, including failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Tom Homan, acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Trump administration. Homan, whom Trump has said he would tap for a job if he’s elected again, tried to downplay Trump’s authoritarian goals related to immigration. Although Trump has publicly refused to rule out building camps for mass detention as part of his campaign’s vow to establish the most massive deportation effort in history, Homan claimed — without evidence — that a Trump immigration policy wouldn’t include any of the things reported in the media.  “People say, 'Trump’s threatening this historic deportation operation. He’s going to build concentration camps. He’s going to sweep neighborhoods,'"" Homan said. ""Let me be clear. None of that will happen."" He went on to issue a warning that seemed to apply not only to newly arriving immigrants but also to recipients of protections offered under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, too. “No one’s off the table,” he said. “If you’re in the country illegally, it’s not OK. If you’re in the country illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”"
Jon Stewart still has some soul-searching to do. His first RNC show proved it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 1:48 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-bill-oreilly-daily-show-interview-rnc-rcna162375,"Jon Stewart and “The Daily Show” on Tuesday executed what Deadline.com called a “Milwaukee pivot” — a programming change forced upon them by last weekend’s tragic violence in Butler, Pennsylvania. Originally, the idea was to air the popular fake news show live from the site of the Republican National Convention. The attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Stewart revealed, scuttled the plan. His Milwaukee venue was placed under lockdown. With “cages built around the theater,” Stewart and his team decided that it wouldn’t be prudent to perform live comedy “without,” the host deadpanned, “people.”  Taped on Tuesday, the episode was stuck rehashing RNC highlights from Monday. Stewart thus missed an opportunity to skewer the speeches of former Trump detractors Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio. Each performed variations, albeit less deserving of our enduring awe, of JD Vance’s ability to forget he once called his new boss “America’s Hitler” and “cultural heroin.” (Vance’s opioid analogy must be the most remarkable observation I’ve ever read about Trump).  Stewart also interviewed his longtime interlocutor, frenemy and sparring partner Bill O’Reilly, and quipped about the two of them being “somewhat fossilized practitioners of the rhetorical arts.” In relation to their past popularity and influence on this generation of political rabble-rousers, Stewart observed, “We made a pretty spectacular living pushing those envelopes.” This isn’t the first time Stewart has wondered aloud whether he is predator or prey (or peripheral) in the new social media ecosystem. In February he called himself “the captain of this dying medium.” He does seem to intuit that what worked artistically, and maybe even politically, in the Bush and Obama eras is perhaps outdated or irrelevant or actually not entirely helpful in this MAGA moment.  If Stewart is pondering that, then good on him. I guess the venue change, and the terror that prompted it, should compel him to pose hard questions about the intersection between art and politics. Questions like: What exactly are entertainers as influential as Jon Stewart supposed to be doing at a point in American history as troubling as this one? I’m starting to believe that Stewart and his team actually don’t know how to answer this question. No disgrace in that. I don’t either. The current moment is as baffling as it is frightening. Although, when your theater is caged in and your audience can’t attend for their own safety because yet another young white male tried to murder people with a perfectly legal killing machine — then, well, maybe it’s a good time to reflect.   Tuesday night’s program indicated that the usually self-aware Stewart is still thinking this through, and has not yet made any discernible pivot. His jokes about odd noises made by Marjorie Taylor Green were funny enough. The analysis of how Lee Greenwood refused to cede the stage while introducing Trump was fairly hysterical. Trump himself gestured that the long-winded singer-songwriter should move this along (“Is it possible to bring out another band to play a band off?” Stewart quipped). The Bill O’Reilly interview best encapsulated many of these contradictions that Stewart has to confront. These men, by my count, have interviewed each other some two dozen times over the years. They have excellent chemistry. They like each other. (Or, perhaps, they like to hate each other.) O’Reilly even recently attended Stewart’s show. The hard-charging conservative “newsman,” who was fired by Fox News in the wake of five sexual harassment suits (which he has denied), is sort of avuncular when conversing with Stewart. O’Reilly made reasonable points about rage and today’s politics. “We are now in a society,” he opined “where hatred is rewarded.” Stewart jumped in: “It’s incentivized, it’s monetized!” Dialogue. Consensus. I like it! One problem, though, is that the same O’Reilly who was bemoaning “the hate brigade” Tuesday night has been eminently hateful himself. I am not going to rehash his views on Trayvon Martin’s murder, on gay marriage, victim blaming, comparing the ACLU to terrorists, blatant and pervasive sexism, anti-LGBTQ and transgender rants, religious fearmongering (such as his yearly diatribe against the “war on Christmas”), or his discomforting white power vibes.  I am going to say that Jon Stewart has to figure something out. When he’s choppin’ it up with Bill O’Reilly is he: a) fostering open and honest discussion across the ideological divide, thereby enriching our liberal democracy? Or, b) platforming a voice that is both cause and effect of the lethal danger that is threatening the existence of liberal democracy itself? Because it sure as hell can’t be both.  When O’Reilly started reading off unflattering statistics about Biden’s economy, Stewart did push back, literally. He prompted his guest to explain how Biden is solely responsible for high food prices, gas prices, mortgage rates, etc., given what he inherited from his predecessor. When O’Reilly responded he didn’t know, Stewart guffawed, comically pushed back his own chair, got up and walked away.  An interesting gesture, that was. No one is asking Stewart to walk away from his comedic throne. But I’d hope the events of the past few months might stimulate deeper reflection on what artists are supposed to do in dark times."
A heartbreaking story at the RNC peddles a horribly misguided narrative,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 1:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speeches-push-dangerous-trump-narrative-biden-border-policy-rcna162374,"On the second night of the Republican National Convention, a woman named Anne Fundner shared a heartbreaking story. A few years ago, she and her husband and their four children were living in Southern California, she told the crowd. She painted an idyllic picture of their family life. Her 15-year-old son, Weston, played hockey and football and loved to surf. The family had barbecues on the beach. Then Weston, succumbing to peer pressure, got high with friends — and died of fentanyl poisoning. It’s an unspeakable tragedy, one felt by too many Americans in the relentless wave of an opioid epidemic that continues to claim more than 74,000 lives a year. Unfortunately, Fundner’s story of personal loss is being used to promote a dangerous and false narrative about the state of crime under the current administration. In her speech, Fundner had no doubt about who was to blame. It happened, she said, because President Joe Biden “opened our borders.” And the solution, according to her and many speakers present in Milwaukee Tuesday night, is to re-elect Donald Trump, who will close them again and, she urged, classify Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. When she said this, Trump apparently leaned over to his running mate JD Vance and mouthed, “We should do it.” Hour after hour, speakers hit the same themes. Biden had “opened the border.” Sen. Marco Rubio said when Trump was president “our border was secure and our laws were enforced” — but that those days are gone. Ben Carson said, “We have a wide open border.” Tom Cotton said, “Joe Biden thinks borders are racist.” The implication for all of them was that an open border is to blame for the country’s fentanyl crisis. This narrative of course is complete nonsense. That doesn’t mean that the pain of parents like Fundner isn’t all too real. I myself know it is, having someone I cared about die of a fentanyl overdose three years ago. But the problem has absolutely nothing do with Biden “opening our border” because no such event has occurred. The available statistics expose the RNC speeches about “open borders” as a dispatch from an alternate dimension. To start, the Department of Homeland Security’s total number of “encounters” with migrants (“encounters” is DHS speak for “arrests”) was far greater during Biden’s first two years in office than the corresponding years of the Trump administration. And greater percentage of those “encountered” under Biden have been deported than under Trump. In fact, immigrants’ rights groups are furious at Biden for reasons anyone who believed what they saw at the RNC would have found incomprehensible. Biden championed a bipartisan bill that would have shredded many of the rights of asylum-seekers. People who in some cases have reason to be terrified that they’ll be tortured or killed if they returned to their home countries, are going to have their cases heard faster, not because the existing system would be expanded to deal with the backlog but because their cases would be moved from the Department of Justice to the DHS, where they’d get “a much faster review, often without attorneys or a deliberative process,” according to reporting from PBS. When that bill failed, after most Republicans followed Trump’s lead in opposing it, Biden acted unilaterally by executive order to curtail the rights of many asylum-seekers. He’s now being sued by several immigrants’ rights groups as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, which notes: “These executive actions will effectively shut off any access to asylum protections for the vast majority of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, no matter how strong their claims. The proclamation echoes the Trump administration’s previous asylum entry ban, which immigrants’ rights advocates successfully challenged."" Ted Cruz said at the RNC that the influx of undocumented immigrants was an “invasion” — not, he clarified, a figurative invasion but a literal one. He named a number of Americans who were raped or killed by criminals who had entered the country illegally, claiming to “speak for” these individuals (it is unclear whether or not the individuals approved of Cruz and his politics). The best available data shows that the undocumented migrant population is far less likely to commit crimes (beyond the initial illegal entry) than native-born Americans, likely because they’re afraid of being deported. American citizens who are the victims of violence are, in the overwhelming majority of cases, victims of other American citizens. And while we’re at it, a crushingly overwhelming majority of those arrested for smuggling fentanyl —86% — are American citizens, and more than nine out of 10 fentanyl seizures “occur at legal crossing points or interior vehicle checkpoints, not on illegal migration routes.” This stands to reason, given U.S. citizens crossing legally are far less likely to be seized and searched. Fentanyl overdoses are aptly classed as “deaths of despair,” statistically concentrated in Rust Belt areas ravaged by deindustrialization. To actually tackle the fentanyl crisis, we’d need to start by devoting far more resources to treatment for addicts, but above all you’d need to do something about the despair, by moving toward a more economically equal society. That is likely the last thing Trump and JD Vance plan to do should they be elected in November. The first Trump administration was a four-year orgy of tax cuts for rich people, deregulation and union-busting. He even went after Medicaid expansion. If Trump returns to office and gives us four more years of these policies, the result will be a society mired even more deeply in poverty, inequality and mass despair than it is right now. And that’s a recipe for a whole lot more grieving mothers looking for someone to blame."
Real hillbillies like me don’t trust JD Vance. You shouldn’t trust him either.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-trump-vp-appalachia-rcna162105,"It’s easy to understand why “Hillbilly Elegy,” the 2016 memoir by JD Vance, piqued the interest of the American people. It recycles a narrative America has relied on for a century to sleep soundly despite the everyday horrors of our society: Rich people do well because they are morally better than the poor. Add some powerful tropes — a firebrand “pistol packing lunatic” mamaw who protects at all costs, a rags-to-riches story in which Vance, a Marine,  escapes the “worst of my cultural inheritance” (p. 253) of unsophisticated, drug-addicted, murderous hillbillies — and you’ve got a bestseller. You’ve also got a dangerous lie, one relying on ugly stereotypes that harm real Appalachians in order to advance a political career. Former President Donald Trump announced Monday that Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, is his pick for his running mate. Unlike me, Vance is not Appalachian.  He was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, well outside any maps of the distinct geographical and cultural region. Trump picking this Rust Belt charlatan as his running mate Monday sparked a resounding and unifying rant among conservative and liberal hillbillies alike in my social media feed: We do not acknowledge him. Why would we? Vance introduces his reader to Appalachia by immediately profiling the worst behaviors of each of his uncles, including a scene of grotesque violence. He calls us a “pessimistic bunch” living in a “hub of misery” (p. 4), and over and over again he uses a wide brush to paint Appalachians as lazy, ignorant and unwilling to try at life. Though there are dozens of offensive stories to choose from in “Hillbilly Elegy,” perhaps the most ridiculous one occurs when, during boot camp, Vance says he meets an eastern Kentuckian who, never having heard the term, asks “What’s a Catholic?” because, as Vance presents it, “down in that part of Kentucky [where he says that man is from], everybody’s a snake handler.” (p. 160). It’s an addictively stereotypical image: the ignorant, isolated, snake-handling hillbilly. But it’s not reality. There are a half dozen churches in that Kentuckian’s county seat, mostly Baptist and Methodist.  Just 20 miles away, in Hazard, there’s a Catholic Church. Another 20 miles away, where Vance’s family lives, there’s a Catholic Church with more than 4,000 Facebook followers. Vance’s memoir of Appalachia, full of gun-toting, drug-addicted “lunatics” aimlessly awaiting death, is at best a cherry-picking of the worst moments of his life. At worst, it’s a concoction of real memories and some of television’s worst stereotypes of what Appalachia is. I do not see my Appalachia in it. I am not alone. Anthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll’s “Appalachian Reckoning,” a response to Vance’s bestseller, anthologizes more than 400 pages of responses from real Appalachians describing their lives in all the nuance they deserve. But nuanced stories aren’t useful in politics. Appalachia is simply a rhetorical device for Vance that he used to launch a political career. If your political goal is to blame the poor for their own problems, then using the regional ethnicity of your grandparents to present yourself as “authentic” can compel readers to believe your narrative or to feel good about having already believed it. After all, the narrative of the lazy hillbilly has existed for as long as rich folks outside of Appalachia needed an explanation for mountain poverty that doesn’t include blaming themselves. Did the poverty come from the rest of the country ignoring a region they thought had no resources? Did the poverty come from coal barons stealing resources once they were discovered? Did the poverty come from outside coal companies not paying coal miners actual money for decades? Why blame complex issues that implicate rich white folks when “lazy” is only two syllables? Vance builds on this narrative, ignoring nuance and context, presenting supposed anecdote after supposed anecdote of cultural depravity and portraying himself as a hillbilly who survived and knows the answer to what ails Appalachia is political conservatism. For Vance, issues of poverty, drug abuse and neglected children are “issues of family, faith, and culture.” (p. 238) He goes so far as to claim that these “problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else.” (p. 255) That’s insulting. Individuals living in poverty did not invent opioids. Individuals living in poverty did not refuse to regulate opioids. He puts the blame entirely on poor Americans, on mothers on food stamps and on fathers who are out of work, extending the roots of that blame directly to Appalachians and some inherent moral flaw. In convincing readers outside of Appalachia that they need the solution he is selling, he paints the Appalachian as the moral problem in America: “If there is any temptation to judge these problems as the narrow concerns of backwoods hollers, a glimpse at my own life reveals that Jackson [Kentucky]’s plight has gone mainstream. Thanks to the massive migration from the poorer regions of Appalachia to places like Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, hillbilly values spread widely along with hillbilly people.” (p. 20) The dog whistle is pretty clear: The immoral hill folks are already in your area. Trust me, I escaped them. I know the answer to save you from them. The “hillbilly” twist is a particularly clever political move because it allows poor white folks living in swing states (like those listed above) to draw a quick line of demarcation around themselves — hardworking but poor Americans — and the supposed immoral, lazy welfare queens and absent, violent hillbilly fathers spreading into their cities and towns. Vance paints himself as having narrowly escaped  “the deep anger and resentment” (p. 2) of those who raised him and laments the supposed white working class feeling that “our choices don’t matter.” (p. 176) Wednesday morning, my sister, who has known overwhelming pain and difficulty, signed up for nursing classes at a community college. Last week, my nephew, a young man with everything stacked against him, asked me to meet him to talk about vocational school.   I see people making choices. I see no anger. Vance confuses frustration in a difficult system with anger and resentment; he misrepresents  Appalachians acknowledging that the choices they have are few and far between and require great levels of personal sacrifice as their belief that the choices they make don’t matter. He sees the drowning person and decides they lack determination in swimming. He ignores those creating the flood. Vance does identify one hillbilly trait that I will, at this moment, agree with: We can be distrustful of outsiders. I might add that I am most distrustful of outsiders pretending to be insiders and of outsiders with a political agenda.  This hillbilly does not trust JD Vance."
One of Biden's Supreme Court reform obstacles: the Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 12:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/joe-biden-supreme-court-reform-expansion-rcna162339,"President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse Supreme Court reforms like term limits and a binding ethics code for the justices. Generally speaking, it’s a positive development at a time when the Roberts Court is exerting outsized power over the other two, nominally coequal branches of government. But even if Congress (which is partly Republican controlled) were to pass such reforms, the Republican-majority Supreme Court could strike them down as unconstitutional. There’s debate over whether term limits require a constitutional amendment, and the court has resisted perceived intrusions on its operations. The court last year did adopt its own code of conduct, but that lacks an enforcement mechanism. That doesn’t mean that the court’s protective view of itself is correct, or that Democrats shouldn’t push for change in any event. But a Supreme Court that jealously guards its power imposes a practical reality on any efforts to curtail that power.     Perhaps counterintuitively, the most significant potential reform could be the least legally controversial: adding seats to the court to balance the 6-3 Republican supermajority. Legislation could accomplish that and wouldn't require a constitutional amendment. The court’s size has changed several times throughout its history. Yet, Biden doesn’t appear to be pushing for court expansion. But while the court itself would be unable to stop it on constitutional grounds, expanding the court would — like any other attempt to diminish the court’s power — have to get through Congress with its Republican-controlled House first.

"In speech to the NAACP, Biden says denouncing violence won’t stop his criticism of Trump",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 11:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/biden-speech-naacp-trump-political-violence-rcna162353,"In his first campaign speech after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, President Joe Biden said the need for rejecting political violence doesn’t mean he’ll be shying away from denouncing the former president’s illiberal behavior or record. Conservatives have baselessly argued that the shooting in Pennsylvania was an outgrowth of liberals’ criticism of his authoritarian behavior. And Biden is pushing back on that bogus claim. Addressing Black voters and lawmakers during a speech to the NAACP in Nevada, the president reiterated his call for everyone to reject political violence. But he received applause after he name-checked Black people who have been the victims of violence and violent threats in recent years. He said: The applause in response to Biden name-checking Goodman, Freeman and Moss was noteworthy. This was the president acknowledging a sentiment that many liberals have been expressing — that any conversation about stemming political violence can’t, in earnest, ignore the actions of Trump and his followers. Goodman, the U.S. Capitol Police officer, was recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal for his heroism in the face of violent, pro-Trump insurrectionists on Jan. 6. Freeman and Moss were innocent election workers in Georgia who faced death threats after Trump and his movement targeted them after the 2020 election. And if it wasn’t clear enough from their resumption of political ads, Biden made clear that he won’t be treating Trump with kid gloves. “Now, just because we must lower the temperature in our politics as it relates to violence doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth,” Biden told the NAACP audience, before lambasting Trump for deploying the National Guard to quell racial justice protesters in 2020, his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic and his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After hitting pause on political attacks for a few days, it’s officially “game on” again for the Biden campaign."
What Nikki Haley’s RNC speech says about Trump's grip on the GOP,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 10:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nikki-haley-rnc-speech-trump-endorsement-rcna162187,"Nikki Haley, former President Donald Trump’s chief rival in the Republican primaries, called for the party to unite behind him at the Republican National Convention Tuesday evening. “Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” the former South Carolina governor declared to a roaring crowd. Haley addressed her speech to Trump skeptics in the party, saying, “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him” and argued that a unified GOP was required for “saving” the nation.    Haley’s plea to her supporters to fall in line behind Trump was more forceful and comprehensive than her soft endorsement of Trump in May. It marks the official end of her dalliance with pseudo-independence from the MAGA wing of the party. And her decision to do it without winning any concessions from Trump illustrates how much power he has, and how little leverage she has in trying to preserve some remnants of the old GOP. Haley ended her presidential bid after losing to Trump in all but two small GOP primaries. She suffered a blowout loss on Super Tuesday. She argued then that Trump had work to do after a primary season to win over the roughly 15% of the Republican electorate who preferred her to him. “It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,” she said when she ended her campaign in March. “At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.” While Haley espouses or accommodates many MAGA values, she still waged war against Trump during the primaries by attacking his character and calling him unfit for office. She described him as “totally unhinged” and pushed back against his thirst for “revenge.” She warned that he is “declining” cognitively and called him a “toxic” agent of “chaos” who lacks “moral clarity.” And she diverged from a key pillar of the MAGA worldview by stating that America doesn’t “rig elections” and acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.  Trump has, unsurprisingly, not heeded Haley’s calls for civility, nor has he tempered his rhetoric on revenge or rigged elections. He remains wedded to a divisive and combative rhetorical style in which he signals authoritarian ambition. He has continued to reject the results of the 2020 election and, after being convicted of 34 felony counts, he has impugned the legitimacy of the legal system. Nonetheless, Haley offered Trump an endorsement that was not only full-throated, but even helped revise his record and boosted him in an area where she has had sharp policy differences from him in the past: foreign policy. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, Haley diverged from Trump by staking out more hawkish positions on Russia than he did, including by making clear her belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. During the primaries, Haley denounced Trump for encouraging Russia to attack NATO allies. But in her RNC speech, Haley praised Trump as a guarantor of a “strong America” and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden — you know, the guy who is a NATO traditionalist and helped organize an unprecedented sanctions regime against Putin. Toward the end of her speech, Haley spoke about the importance of making the Republican Party bigger and more appealing to the general public. But she’s too smart and savvy of a politician to delude herself into thinking Trump has or ever will have an interest in changing his worldview to do so. Haley is a creature of the party, she has significant political talent, and she wants to remain a player. It would be surprising if she didn’t have her eye on 2028. Her conspicuous bending of the knee to Trump is the simplest way to ensure she has a chance to stay in the game.  "
Dems hoping to replace Biden on 2024 ticket get a clear deadline,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-hoping-replace-biden-2024-ticket-get-clear-deadline-rcna162344,"As far as President Joe Biden is concerned, the intraparty debate over his electoral future has run its course. NBC News reported this week, for example, that in recent days, the incumbent “has started to privately convey a new message to Democrats: The conversation about my future is over, and I’m getting irritated that you’re not realizing that. Biden has called several prominent allies individually to tell them to spread the word.” The president’s impatience notwithstanding, the Democratic discussion remains ongoing. The challenge for those in the party who still hope to replace Biden on the ticket is the rapidly closing window. In fact, The New York Times reported this week that Democratic National Committee officials were “moving swiftly” to confirm Biden as the party’s presidential nominee “by the end of July.” To put it mildly, Democrats who still want the conversation to continue were not pleased. In fact, congressional Democrats began circulating a letter seeking more time. It’s against this backdrop that NBC News reported: Ordinarily, Democrats wouldn’t nominate their presidential candidate until the convention, but party officials said the earlier virtual process is necessary to avoid a legal mess in Ohio. Republican officials in the Buckeye State insist there is no need for such steps, but DNC officials have responded that they don’t trust those officials’ word. And so, the window of opportunity — which, again, Biden already sees as closed — appears exceedingly narrow. Major Democratic donors still hope to wield some influence and nudge the incumbent off the ballot, not because they oppose him or his agenda, but because they’re convinced he’ll lose. For his part, the president has said he’s more concerned with the attitudes of Democratic voters than the party’s financial backers. The problem with this is that many Democratic voters seem to agree with the donors: A newly released national poll from the Associated Press found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats prefer to see Biden forgo his re-election plans. That number is roughly the same as the results of the latest NBC News poll, which found that 62% of Democratic voters want to see Biden end his candidacy. Survey data like this makes it difficult for the president to say the chatter is limited to “the elites.” It also comes against a backdrop of several other recent polls that show Biden losing the 2024 race to Donald Trump. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the list of members calling on the president to stand down is still inching higher: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who reportedly raised private concerns, is now going public, urging Biden to step aside. If there are others in the party who want the same thing, they’ll have to speak up in the coming days or forever hold their peace."
An Unsettling Few Days,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-unsettling-days-rcna162356,"After a traumatic weekend for the nation, MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord use their law enforcement expertise to take stock of the alarming assassination attempt of former President Trump. Then, they turn to Monday’s stunning dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case, after Judge Aileen Cannon took a page from Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence to view Jack Smith’s appointment as illegal. Andrew and Mary explain what options are available to the Special Counsel in appealing the dismissal. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” So, we’re taping late in the day on Monday, July 15th, because we wanted to get this to you as early as possible. So it’s going to come out Tuesday morning, but we didn’t want to wait to record until tomorrow and then have it come out at the end of the day because there’s a lot to talk about. And so let’s get started. Hi, Mary, how are you? Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: This is going to be maybe a little bit different because there’s two things that we’re going to be discussing. We’re going to talk about the shootings and the attempted assassination over the weekend. But then we’re going to turn to something that happened today, which is why we’re doing this today to get this out to all of you to talk about the Judge Cannon decision, what she did and some issues legally with what she did. And then, Mary, you and I have not had a chance to talk about this, but like what we would do next. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: What are the options for Jack Smith? I’m going to be really interested to hear what you think. But why don’t I turn it to you, but just let me remind people when we talk now about the shootings over the weekend. I think people need to remember that, Mary, you were in both, not just in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C., which you know, is the home base for all sorts of major things like inaugurations and big events that have potential violence, but you were head of the National Security Division. And before that, you were a senior official there. And so foreign and domestic terrorism are so much a part of your makeup in terms of both lawyers and the FBI and other parts of the intelligence community dealing with those situations. So I just want to make sure people were aware that we have you in a different role to draw on. And I have just a little bit of that from the FBI. Mary McCord: I was going to say, but you as well. Yes. I mean, not only were you at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, but also at the FBI and the General Counsel’s Office. Andrew Weissmann: So anyway, you don’t have to debate that. Mary McCord: That’s right. That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: This is like Alphonse Gaston. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So with that, Mary, I thought it would make sense. And I know when we were talking over the weekend, when this happened, what would you, if you were still in the National Security Division, what would you be looking for? What would you be doing? What kind of preventative things would you be concerned about when something like this happens? Mary McCord: Well, I appreciate that we’re going to lead off with this topic today, because obviously this is enormously significant. There was an attempted assassination of the major political candidate running for the presidential, I guess he’s still technically running for the nomination, but is the de facto nominee. And we have an election this year. Andrew Weissmann: I think actually, as we’ve been talking, I think he -- Mary McCord: Has already, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- technically been proclaimed. Mary McCord: That might be because we are Monday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time recording this. And, you know, you and I, Andrew, and many listeners will remember when the sitting president, Ronald Reagan, was shot in 1981, the last assassination attempt. Again, Donald Trump is not a sitting president, but he is a former president. He’s a major candidate for president. And so, you know, that’s been more than 40 years since we’ve had anyone come this close to actually killing someone in the presidency or a former president. And it should make everyone and it clearly has made at least most people across party stop, take note, and do, I think, some soul searching about where are we in this country that the rhetoric and the language that’s used in a lot of our discourse may have, we don’t know, contributed to this event. And also, even if that had nothing to do with this particular shooting, because we don’t know, and I want to foot stomp that, we do not yet know the shooter’s motive. Certainly, it’s time to think about where we are and are there things that we want to change. And even the former president, and you and I have certainly been critical about him many times, and there’s still many, many, many reasons to be critical about him. But he has actually, at least over the weekend, I think it might have changed a little bit today, has called for unity, and I understand has completely changed his speech for the RNC and is actually his campaign directed other speakers to not try to cast blame across the aisle and say things that there’s no proof of at this point. So just to start there, the other thing I think that’s so important, you appropriately said we’re going to talk about the shootings, and I started with assassination attempt, but shootings is accurate because no one should ever forget that a person was killed, a person did lose his life, and two other people were critically wounded. So this was a fatal attack, really, on our democracy. Andrew Weissmann: It was a murder and attempted murder. Mary McCord: That’s right. And so I want to talk about and get your thoughts too on the kinds of investigations that are happening and why. But one thing I want to say right off the top, particularly because you indicated my former role in national security, is that, you know, this is appropriately being investigated as a potential domestic terrorism attack. And people say, well, why is that and why do you say potential? So domestic terrorism under the U.S. code is not its own crime. It’s a crime of violence that violates any state law that’s done with the intent to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or to influence the policy of government through intimidation or coercion or in retaliation for government conduct. Andrew Weissmann: And what you just said, Mary, is that you’re reading from the definition in the United States Code of domestic terrorism. Mary McCord: Right. I’m paraphrasing, not reading from the statute because I know it so well. And the definition of domestic terrorism in the U.S. code is very similar, almost identical, almost word for word as the definition of international terrorism. It’s just that international terrorism can involve the same kinds of conduct that occur outside the United States but have some tie to the United States or they occur inside the United States, but they’re motivated by, say, a foreign terrorist organization like Al-Qaeda or ISIS, whereas domestic is sort of purely domestic, not motivated by a foreign terrorist organization. So, for one, it’s because it would at least, we don’t know until we know the motive, but there is at least some reason to believe because this was a political rally, right, that the intent would have been to affect government policy, to intimidate or coerce the people who are there at that rally, et cetera. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: The other reason that it is appropriately considered, at least in the initial stages as a domestic terrorism investigation, is because one of the potential crimes here, if the shooter had survived, would be a crime that is considered to be a terrorism crime, and that is an attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. You know, most of our crimes that are designated by law of crimes of terrorism are about things that have to do with foreign terrorist organizations like we talked about, but in the domestic sphere, it can include attacks on U.S. government officials, members of Congress, the sitting president, vice president, justices of the Supreme Court, et cetera. And there is actually a statute that also applies to attempted assassinations of major presidential candidates. And so that, when done with this intent, is actually a crime of terrorism under U.S. law. Andrew Weissmann: And for our nerds, which I’m including ourselves in that, we will put in the show notes the site for the statutory definition, as well as the citation for the domestic terrorism law that, Mary, you were referring to. Mary McCord: Yeah. So the crime I was referring to is 18 United States Code Section 351. But for all the nerds out there, we’ll put all these in the show notes. Andrew Weissmann: So I had a reaction to something you said, and it does relate to what I know if I were still at the FBI, what our teams would be focusing on, because there would be, as you said, Mary, very much this focus of what happened, a whole exegesis of who is this person, learning everything you can about the shooter and his motivation, and looking at social media, e-mails, texts, talking to witnesses, learning as much as you can to understand how this happened and why this happened. Mary McCord: But I think that’s for two purposes, actually, because I put this investigation in three buckets, right? I just wanted to get out there that it’s properly called, you know, terrorism investigation, or at least potentially. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, yeah. Mary McCord: So that first that you were just getting at, Andrew, to me, that serves two purposes. One is law enforcement needs to know now, is there any current ongoing threat, right? Is there still-- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- possibly someone that the shooter was working with, domestically or foreign? Are there other explosive devices in other places that could still pose harm? Because we know they’ve recovered some sort of explosive device from the car and some from the house. And so part of this is looking at, you know, the contents of the phone, laptop, his internet searches, social media posts, his acquaintances, where was the gun purchased? If it was purchased by his father in 2013, which is being reported, did his father know he had taken it? Where was the ammunition purchased? All those kind of things, first are like, do we have an ongoing threat? But secondly, all those same things that you were talking about, and I was elaborating on are to figure out, did law enforcement miss clues? Like, were there red flags that they should have had this guy on their radar? And are there things -- Andrew Weissmann: Lessons learned. Mary McCord: Yeah, lessons learned. Andrew Weissmann: Yep, absolutely. And this, by the way, reminds me so much, I think both of us were in national security roles during the Boston bombing. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And, you know, I was at the FBI and that was very much the sort of lessons learned and was somebody else involved. And, you know, so those are two big pieces. So I think that is sort of the looking backwards. The looking forwards piece, and obviously, if other people were involved, that’s a looking forward and actually lessons learned is also has a -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- looking forward piece. But another part of the looking forward is the concern of heightened threats and copycats going forward. And so an enormous amount of activity right now will be on other targets that either within the same genre or retaliatory targets. And how do you harden the, what was the phrase? Harden the shell -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and harden the target so that it’s harder for any of those things to occur. And that’s where I just want to take us back to a conversation we would have had a month ago or three months ago or six months ago. Actually, let’s just go back to the motion that was before -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- Judge Cannon with respect to the concern that was being raised by Jack Smith about threats to the FBI. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And both of us, if you remember, were very upset -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that it wasn’t heard sooner because both of us having been in law enforcement, but you don’t have to, you could just be a sentient human being who cares, knew that we didn’t want to be in the situation where violence has happened and there was more that could have been done. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And it is worth going back to the fact that violence has happened and threats of violence have happened. And obviously January 6th isn’t a good example. Paul Pelosi is a good example. But just to make this apolitical, Steven Scalise is a good example. Mary McCord: Threats to Brett Kavanaugh. Andrew Weissmann: I was going to say justices in the Supreme Court, regardless of stripe. Gretchen Whitmer and then judges, witnesses, poll workers, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss. I’m not saying that it’s wrong to have the reaction now that I hope this causes people to rethink that they should all be saying violence is never the answer. But it is ironic, to say the least, that this is what it takes. I mean, we were saying this for so long and there’s so -- Mary McCord: Years, really. Years. Andrew Weissmann: -- many people who have been threatened and actually hurt. Mary McCord: Harmed. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And if you belittle attacks on people and you make it the norm, I’m certainly not saying you’re asking for it, not in any way, shape or form. It’s that this kind of thing was bound to happen. And I hope this is a wake-up call, but I’m concerned it’s not. In terms of law enforcement, though, in terms of what we would be doing, looking at that future issue of like, is there going to be some immediate retaliation? Are there other targets? Are judges, are prosecutors, et cetera, going to have increased threats and increased security and concerns is certainly something that is going to be keeping the bureau, the Secret Service, the local law enforcement very busy. Mary McCord: Yes, no question about it. And we haven’t even talked about the fact that a whole separate investigation into the Secret Service’s behavior here is another thing that will be happening. And I can tell you, I am sure if they had their druthers, there would be no outdoor rallies and events like what we saw in Pennsylvania on the weekend. It’s just so much more difficult to protect than an indoor venue. And I’m sure that history will reveal that there was probably a lot of back and forth between Secret Service and the campaign over these type of events. But nevertheless, there clearly was a rooftop within striking distance that was not adequately protected. And so that will be the course of a lot of criticism. Last thing to say about this, and, you know, we could do a whole episode about this. It’s not obviously about prosecuting Donald Trump, although he has now today at least posted on True Social that all cases against him should be dropped, as well as apparently all former civil cases, including E. Jean Carroll. But putting that aside, I do think it’s important to realize, you know, just to your point, what’s going to come from this, right? And one man’s act does not control what we as Americans are going to do going forward, or what foreign adversaries will be encouraging some Americans to do going forward. We control that and how we react, regardless of our politics, will do far more to influence whether we’re going to have copycat crimes, whether we’re going to have retaliation. And some of that will be in the rhetoric that people use. Some of it will be social media. Some of it could be how people speak at events like the convention this week and the conventions coming up. But one man doesn’t control that. And that dead shooter who did a heinous thing at an event where people were expressing their constitutional rights, right, to go and have a rally in support of the candidate of their choice, that shooting is very much undermines our democratic processes, our constitutional rights. And we can decide to reject that. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, in the same way that we can decide that it has nothing to do with and, in fact, should make us value more the rule of law. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And so it has nothing to do with weaponization. And that’s maybe a very good segue to Judge Cannon because one of the things that, just to give a tease before we take our first break, is that in many ways, her ruling is the antithesis of weaponization. And if you look at the substance of what she’s saying, and I’ll talk about that a little bit more when we break, but the sort of Donald Trump claim that these are all weaponized cases that have been brought in, she is actually in substance rejecting that. Her whole claim is that Jack Smith was not sufficiently under the thumb of the Biden administration, and because of that, it was unconstitutional. So it’s actually quite the opposite of the claim that there’s weaponization. And just to bring it back and close out to your point, which is that the truly heinous acts of one individual does not mean that we are suddenly not a nation of laws. In fact, it should be why we’re a nation of laws and should make us value that more. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Let’s take a break and then go back to Judge Cannon and we’ll get into the details of her ruling issued this morning. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As we were going into the break, we were teeing up Judge Cannon’s decision and judgment today. Basically, the case in front of her is right now over. She dismissed the indictment, the superseding indictment in its entirety, and she did so really based on one ground, which is that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. She also indicated that it violated the Appropriations Clause, but said she wasn’t going to decide a remedy for that because it didn’t matter after all because she was dismissing the entire case based on the Appointments Clause. So we’re going to talk during this segment about her ruling, and then we will close out after another break by talking about what are the options now, what happens going forward. But just before I hand it to you, Andrew, I want to just orient people on what this Appointments Clause says in the U.S. Constitution, right? Andrew Weissmann: Perfect. Mary McCord: It says that the president shall have the power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties provided two-thirds of the senators present concur. And here’s the kicker. And he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint various people and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law, right? Okay, so that’s key. And those various people include ambassadors, justices of the Supreme Court, okay, and all other officers for the United States. But the clause goes on to say, but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. Okay, so heads of departments would be people like the attorney general. And the key point of Judge Cannon’s 93-page opinion is there is no statute that gives the attorney general the power to appoint a person like Jack Smith, the special counsel. And she does that, I will say, and I’m curious whether you agree, I think based on the roadmap that Justice Thomas laid out for her in his concurring opinion in the immunity case that we talked about the very first day we talked about the immunity decision, because it was something not briefed, not part of the question in front of the court, and just something he decided to write about. And she grabbed it, and she cites it repeatedly. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So again, big picture things. We’ve had the special counsel rules for about 25 years. They replaced the independent counsel rules. And the independent counsel was in many ways more separate from the Department of Justice than the special counsel and was found to be constitutional in a case called Morrison. So that’s a case that’s somewhat controversial, but it is a binding Supreme Court case that said that the independent counsel rules were constitutional. So this, because it seems better, it’s people are like, how is this going to be infirm? And in fact, until Judge Cannon, no judge has actually found it to be improper. There have been special counsels appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents. There have been Republican and Democratic appointed judges who have found it to be constitutional. I keep on referring to Dabney Friedrich, a judge appointed by Donald Trump during the Mueller investigation, found this to be constitutional. So Judge Cannon is the first judge to find that it was unconstitutional. I totally agree with you that she is following the Justice Thomas blueprint, the gratuitous blueprint. Very, very unusual for him to do that. It’s very political. She does not, I think, follow binding Supreme Court precedent. She rejects all of the other, I think it’s eight judges who have found against her. And basically, the clause that you were reading, what you need to look for is, since the special counsels was not appointed by the president, you’re trying to see, is there some statutory authority that gave Merrick Garland, the attorney general, the ability to appoint the special counsel? And I have to tell you that part of her decision, I’m going to say this, but it doesn’t convey the depth of how wrong it is, but it is. To say it is weak is charitable. There is congressional authority to do this. Let me just give you an example of something she does that I just think is so silly. The attorney general can appoint employees, obviously, because the Department of Justice is filled with employees, and those employees can be given all sorts of job responsibilities. Mary McCord: Including prosecutors. We were both assistant U.S. attorneys -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- with a lot of authority, not, you know, nominated by the president or confirmed by the Senate. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. I was the head of the fraud section. I was the general counsel of the FBI. Neither of those are Senate confirmed. I had tons of authority. I could go ahead and indict people as the head of the fraud section, as a federal prosecutor. I had lots and lots of authority. And one of the things that she says is, oh, yes, it’s true that the attorney general is given the ability to hire employees, but the special counsel is not an employee. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Mary McCord: I wonder where he got his paycheck from. I mean, that should tell us something. Andrew Weissmann: The reason it’s wrong is she latches on to the special counsel under the special counsel rules, should be hired from outside the department. But then they are brought into the department -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and they are called a confidential employee under the statute. And it specifically provides for the fact that they’re a confidential employee. This, by the way, is at page 24 of her decision. And so this is just one where she says, well, I’m going to look at their status before they were appointed a special counsel, as if that’s the time period you want to look at it. The time period is obviously after. So I really think that she completely blew it legally. I also think that it really is a sign that she’s never worked at main justice because she keeps on thinking about, oh, well, he’s sort of like a U.S. attorney, but he’s not been confirmed by the Senate. But you know what? I was the head of the fraud section. I had over 100 people working for me. That’s larger than many, many, many U.S. attorney’s offices people could indict all the time. The other thing is she sort of doesn’t take account of and makes it sound like the special counsel could just do whatever the hell he wanted and doesn’t have to comply with DOJ rules. And I think I’ve talked about this on the podcast. That is so not true. You have to comply with every single Department of Justice rule because you are within the Department of Justice. So I have given as an example of that when I was working for Special Counsel Mueller, we wanted to bring tax cases, we had to get tax division authority. That means they had to approve, not us, they had to approve this going forward. Why? That’s DOJ policy. We wanted to bring a Foreign Agents Registration Act charge, which is a type of national security charge. You know who we had to approve that? Mary McCord: National Security Division. Andrew Weissmann: The National Security Division. Mary McCord: I sure do, because I was there. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So again, we had to go through all of those internal rules. It’s not like we had just a notice requirement. We had to get approval. We had to do all of the approvals that anybody in the Department of Justice had. And I keep on saying when I was in the special counsel, I have never been more overseen, certainly far more than when I was the head of the fraud section. Mary McCord: I mean, it’s in the regulations. It’s not day to day, but it’s not day to day of an AUSA or a U.S. attorney either. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But still, they have to comply with what you and I know as and which are specifically referenced in here, what we call urgent reports, which means any U.S. attorney in the special counsel, when they’re getting ready to take an action in a sensitive investigation involving, you know, either a sensitive target or a controversial action, they have to run that up the flagpole in what is aptly called an urgent report so that the deputy attorney general and the attorney general have the chance to say, wait a minute, stop the presses. You’re not doing that. Andrew Weissmann: And the key word there is they have to. Mary McCord: Yes, it’s not optional. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not like, you know, we’d like it, Mary, if you would, could you just come by if you have time? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Doesn’t work that way. Mary McCord: In fact, at some point, she basically says it’s completely within the special counsel, their own discretion, whether to discuss things with the attorney general. But she takes that part of the regulations completely like out of context and ignores the reg that we were just talking about that requires mandates, urgent reports. So there’s a lot wrong with that. But I want to post something to you, though, because we can spend a lot of time talking about how she gets wrong her, you know, what type of officer he might be. But ultimately, I think her ruling doesn’t rest on that because she says, I’m going to sort of with reservations say he’s an inferior officer. But it doesn’t really matter because if you were a principal officer, then clearly this violates the appointments clause because he should have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. And so even if I consider him an inferior officer, the basis for her ruling is, in her view, there is no explicit statute that Congress passed that says Attorney General of the United States of America shall have the authority to appoint special counsels to investigate whatever the issue might be when there’s an investigative need. That I saw as the heart of her ruling. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And to me, that’s kind of insane, and how’s that for not using great legal language, which is that there are statutes like 28 U.S.C., I think it’s 533. Mary McCord: 533 that she says, oh, that’s about the FBI and inferior. She writes that one off. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. But I mean, I didn’t see that why that’s just about the FBI. So, again, just to be clear, the attorney general can appoint just to personalize it, can appoint someone to be the head of the Enron task force. They could appoint someone to be head of the fraud section. And you are within the Department of Justice and you have lots of authority, but you’re an inferior officer because you ultimately report to the attorney general and so I just don’t understand. Once you cave on the issue of, okay, this is an inferior officer, I think you lose because the department’s made up of inferior officers. That is like, what are you going to say that every single employee can’t be hired? And so she really doesn’t wrestle with what would be the limits on that authority. If there is no authority to hire underlings, then are the tens of thousands of employees at the Justice Department, all Congress had no idea that they could be appointed. And by the way, this is where the history of this is so much against her because you don’t have Congress in any way pushing back going, oh, wait, you’re doing something wrong and I didn’t understand it. Mary McCord: For decades and decades, through multiple special counsels, right? Not only did they never push back -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- not only did they withhold funding, they continued to put money, you know, to allow for money to go into the very source of funding for these various appointments. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, do you want an interesting factoid? Mary McCord: Sure. Andrew Weissmann: Because this may affect our -- Mary McCord: Our next discussion? Andrew Weissmann: -- our next discussion about what to do next, because I have like an idea. Mary McCord: Okay. Andrew Weissmann: But here’s a factoid that may be of interest to folks, but also could maybe something to think about in deciding what to do. When the independent counsel law was sunsetting and the independent counsel law was very critiqued because of sort of the Ken Starr people going overboard. Mary McCord: Six years or something, wasn’t it? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And remember, Brett Kavanaugh worked for Ken Starr, just, you know, FYI. And when it was sunsetting, there was a group of people on the Hill who were sort of tasked with thinking about what to do. And there were a whole bunch of people who were thinking about what is a way to have something that is more tethered to the Department of Justice, that is less independent. And ultimately, the department put out the regulations under Janet Reno. But in that group that came up with essentially the blueprint for this, one of the people who worked on the blueprint for what is the special counsel rules is. Mary McCord: Drumroll. Andrew Weissmann: Current Chief Justice John Roberts. Mary McCord: John Roberts. Andrew Weissmann: So he worked on these. It would be so interesting. And to me, it’s sort of like it’s how Brett Kavanaugh was so bizarre, in my view, in his immunity decision, given his role in the Ken Starr case and -- Mary McCord: And you may recall during argument, somewhat out of the blue, he also talked about Morrison v. Olson being, he thought, one of the worst decisions of all time. This is the decision that upheld the Independent Counsel Act, which has since sunsetted. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. So we have the current chief justice who was fashioning something to make this more tethered to the Department of Justice that would make it a stronger case for constitutionality than Morrison, which dealt with the independent counsel rules. So even if Morrison is good law, by the way, aren’t you struck by the fact that Judge Cannon just basically ignores that decision? Mary McCord: She doesn’t. Well, she talks about it, but when she’s trying to decide whether he’s inferior or not and she does apply things, but then she still, you know, says, well, in light of a case that came after that, I’m not so sure that’s right. She does a lot of very long winded explanations for things and oftentimes concludes, but I don’t have to decide this. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: I will say one other major factor, I think, of the opinion, and you’ve kind of alluded to it, is that many, many courts have upheld this and a lot of those courts have done so in reliance on U.S. v. Nixon, an obvious Nixon era case that was not about a prosecution of the president, but it was about seeking evidence from the president for a criminal prosecution of others related to Watergate. And so the issue of the independent counsel there, was he called a special counsel at that point? I think that’s before Independent Counsel Act. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: Yes. Leon Jaworski. Andrew Weissmann: Special prosecutor. Mary McCord: Right. Special prosecutor. There are a couple of sentences in that opinion, and that opinion does say that when there is a demonstrable need for evidence that can overcome the executive privilege of the president to withhold that evidence, that was the conclusion there. And that’s why when we go back and talk about the immunity case, I feel like the immunity case sort of seemed to overrule U.S. v. Nixon, but doesn’t say that it did. That’s for another day. But there’s another key part of this case, which says, Congress has vested in the attorney general the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States. It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties, citing a bunch of statutes that Merrick Garland relied on in his appointment of Jack Smith and which other attorneys general appointed by both parties have relied on. Then it goes on to say, acting pursuant to those statutes, the attorney general has delegated the authority to represent the United States in these particular matters to a special prosecutor with unique authority and tenure. They don’t call that into question. They don’t say, we’re not sure this is right. They don’t say this might violate the appointments clause. They just state this all as a fact. And then they go on to decide that the special prosecutor could subpoena that information from the sitting president, Richard Nixon, and overcome the president’s executive privilege. So what does Cannon say about that? She says, that’s dicta. Dicta, of course, is when the court says something that is not like load bearing to the merits of the opinion, is not necessary to the merits of opinion. And she says, no one had argued about whether the special prosecutor was constitutionally appointed there. The court didn’t really have to decide the issue. So their statement, essentially saying that he’s got valid authority, is mere dicta. Mind you, you really couldn’t have gone on to issue the decision -- Andrew Weissmann: Of course, right. Mary McCord: -- in that case if they’d have thought that the special prosecutor was unconstitutionally appointed. But that, she jettisons in her opinion. Andrew Weissmann: Quick anecdote, and then we’ll go to the question of what would you do now? When we were litigating this and won in front of every court, when Special Counsel Mueller was bringing his cases and every defendant was challenging this and every judge was affirming it, we used to joke with him and we said, well, you’re just a subordinate officer. Mary McCord: I’m sure you did. No question about it. Andrew Weissmann: You’re just inferior. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And he’s like, that’s very funny. But that was the critical language that he is subordinate to, inferior to the head of the department -- Mary McCord: It’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that is the attorney general. Okay, let’s take a break, and then we’ll come back with, if you’re Jack Smith, what would you do? (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. I know you’re dying to say what you would do. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, but I was going to turn it to you first, but what do you want? Do you want to go first? Mary McCord: Well, it doesn’t matter. I mean, okay, I’ll go first. So I would not make a decision immediately if I were Jack Smith, right? I would take some time. I would sleep on this. I would reread it again tomorrow. And then I would consult with my whole team. I would at least seek to consult with the deputy attorney general and the attorney general, not to mention the solicitor general, because if he decides to appeal this, which is very much an option, because this is one of the things, again, that prosecutors can appeal, a complete dismissal of your case. If he decides to appeal this, he has a decision to make about whether he wants to try, as he did in the immunity case, to go straight to the Supreme Court and skip the 11th Circuit, ask certiorari before judgment, or whether he wants to just go ahead and appeal as a matter of course to the 11th Circuit. So that’s clearly an option for him. Because there is some risk there that if and when this gets to the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas and a court that we no longer seem to be able to predict very well will not render a favorable decision. There’s another option. Andrew Weissmann: Guilty. Guilty. By the way, the 11th Circuit, you could also have, you know, this issue of whether they would bounce her because you could ask to have her removed or the 11th Circuit could do it on its own. But as you said, the Supreme Court could weigh in on that too. Mary McCord: That’s right. Anything in front of the 11th Circuit would be appealable to the Supreme Court. Now, they don’t have to take the case, right, if they agree with what the 11th Circuit did. And that all takes time, lots of time. Another option is that either the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida, technically it could be elsewhere like D.C., can just start over and indict the case, bring in a grand jury, present the evidence, and seek a new indictment. And in fact, you know, the National Security Division could, with respect to at least the classified information charges, also using another grand jury, do the same thing. And I kind of lean that way a little bit because then you avoid this entire issue of the appointments clause. You avoid it ever getting to the Supreme Court. But the problem here is I wouldn’t want to do it in D.C. because it would just look like you’re judge shopping. So I’d probably suggest that it happen in Southern District of Florida, which means you could just get Judge Cannon again. Then she’d maybe find a different way to dismiss the case. But you’d at least get beyond the appointments clause issue. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So this is really interesting. So my first reaction, and again, I would sleep on it, is that I would just go ahead and get a U.S. attorney’s office to bring in -- Mary McCord: Same thing I just said. Okay, we’re in agreement here. Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: I know. This is like a violent agreement. And the reason is Judge Cannon is saying the flaw here is that it wasn’t brought by a confirmed United States attorney. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Well, go ahead and do it. Mary McCord: Do it. Andrew Weissmann: It happens every day of the week. And by the way, when people say what’s involved, super easy. You have a grand jury, let’s impanel all the time. You could bring an agent in, they can put the transcripts of the prior proceeding, and it’s just a very easy process. And that way you just avoid delay and the uncertainty. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And I personally would want to avoid the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: Absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: You know, like the plague, because they’re so result-oriented. And so you could just be like, you know what, you think this is a problem? Mary McCord: You do it. Andrew Weissmann: It’s not, you’re wrong, but I can remedy this in about two seconds. So that is, I think, sort of step one. The harder issues are the sort of where do it is sort of a euphemism for, do you seek to remove her? Do you finally make a motion for her to recuse herself and try and take that up or have it go to the chief judge in the district court level or the 11th Circuit? And that’s where, in some ways, what you’re doing is the merits of the decision could be litigated in the context of how wrong she was in this. And that would also have some delay in it, which I think, I guess I’m a little less worried about -- Mary McCord: Same. Andrew Weissmann: -- because this case is never going to trial before the general election. And so I think I would sort of do it that way. There also is the ability to sort of have your cake and eat it too, in the sense that you could go ahead and bring this new indictment. And I still think there’s a little piece that’s alive for purposes of appeal. I’m not sure you’d have to do it that way. But because I think that there’s residual issues that remain, for instance, what would happen to the work and the evidence that was done when Jack Smith was -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- doing the work but wasn’t officially supposed to be there? And is there prejudice from that? What do you do with it? This is a way of saying there still might be standing that the case wouldn’t be totally mooted out if you were to bring a new charge, but then say that there shouldn’t be these ramifications. Mary McCord: I think it would just be procedurally different because she has dismissed this one. If they don’t appeal it, this is a closed case. If they re-bring and it gets assigned to her, and even if it doesn’t get assigned to her, I suspect that Mr. Trump’s team would argue that you couldn’t even introduce -- they don’t have a good argument here, but that you couldn’t even introduce the transcripts to a new grand jury because those transcripts were the result of subpoenas by Jack Smith, who was acting outside of any authority. So I think I’m getting it the same thing as you, but I think it would all be in the context of a new matter. And -- Andrew Weissmann: Unless you appealed it. Unless you did kind of both, you both appealed this matter. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Anyway, you know, this is like super technical, but the bottom line is that because this is such a technical decision, there is a way to remedy it. And I’d just like to go back to something I was saying at the outset, which is, as we’ve talked about, what she is saying is that the special counsel here was not sufficiently tethered to the Department of Justice, was not sufficiently tethered to the president of the United States. He wasn’t appointed by the president, and he wasn’t sufficiently under the control of the attorney general. That is the antithesis of the attack on the special counsel’s investigation by Donald Trump, which is that it is weaponized as being political. And she is not dismissing it for that reason. In fact, it is the opposite reason. And it’s really important for people to sort of realize that when he says, oh, look, everything’s weaponized, whatever her motives are, you know, when we can guess what they are and have a pretty good guess, her reasoning is the opposite. Mary McCord: Completely inconsistent with his claims and his rhetoric, yeah, throughout, which may change, but may not change in light of this new unity messaging that we’re looking forward to. And I’m not trying to be facetious there. I’m trying to be serious, but I’m not a hundred -- Andrew Weissmann: Skeptical. Mary McCord: -- percent yes, exactly. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, once again, it is, with all of this breaking news, but highly serious, the legal opinion that came out, and it’s so great to be able to talk to you about it. We have something special planned for next week because we’re going to be together and we’ll be doing a live show next week. And we’ll talk some more about that at the time. But in the meantime, really great to talk to you. Mary McCord: Same, Andrew. Thanks so much for listening. To send us a question, you can leave us a voicemail at 917-342-2934.

Ex-Trump aide Peter Navarro to speak at RNC after prison release,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/peter-navarro-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162294,"Former Donald Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro was released from federal prison in Miami on Wednesday morning. His next stop is Milwaukee, where he's scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention. Navarro served his four-month term following his conviction for contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with a House Jan. 6 committee subpoena. The Supreme Court rejected his bid to stay free while he appeals and his legal challenge is pending. Trump ally Steve Bannon is currently incarcerated for his own contempt of Congress conviction, which he’s appealing from behind bars after the Supreme Court also rejected his bid to stay free in the meantime. Navarro’s expected appearance on the convention stage comes shortly after Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey was found guilty on 16 counts in his federal corruption trial; top Democrats quickly called on him to resign. Meanwhile, Navarro’s criminal history isn’t a hindrance to him being platformed by the Republican Party. Indeed, the former Trump adviser’s speaking engagement doesn't come in spite of his conviction but because of it. The party's embrace of Navarro fits well within its “law and order” mantra, which doesn’t mandate a literal application of the law but is rather about maintaining a certain social order. The party’s presidential nominee was criminally indicted four times and convicted once so far, in New York state court (he pleaded not guilty in every case). Trump was supposed to have been sentenced in that case last week, but the sentencing was postponed after the immunity ruling handed down by the Supreme Court majority he helped appoint. If he wins in November, Trump is poised to get his federal cases dismissed by a new attorney general who’d presumably still apply the nation’s laws to those deemed the real criminals by the administration. Or Trump could attempt a legally untested self-pardon should he return to the White House. He has already said that he would grant clemency to Jan. 6 defendants, and he pardoned Bannon before leaving office last time. With that in mind, whatever Navarro’s political plans, his best legal strategy may be staying in Trump’s good graces.  "
VP Kamala Harris emerges as a main target at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republican-national-convention-kamala-harris-biden-border-rcna162291,"With President Joe Biden's nomination still on shaky ground, Republicans at their party's national convention this week have sharpened their criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden's likeliest replacement on the ticket. Harris was featured prominently in speeches over the first two days of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Speakers made sure to name her while criticizing the Biden administration's policies, and they sought to tie her to major election issues, including the border crisis — repeatedly referring to her as the ""border czar"" — and violent crime. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Tuesday accused Biden and Harris of welcoming a “Third World invasion” through the border. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley warned of “four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris” in her speech. She mischaracterized Harris' role in leading the administration’s effort to address the root causes of migration in 2021. “Kamala had one job — one job — and that was to fix the border,"" Haley said. ""Now imagine her in charge of the entire country?” Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt claimed that Biden and Harris opened the border “to terrorists, to criminals.” He also pointed to violent crime during the pandemic, saying Harris “shares in those failures.” Violent crime surged in 2020 — when Donald Trump was still president — but it has steadily dropped in the following years. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer also tried to link violent crime to Harris. “When Minneapolis was in flames and businesses were in ruins, Kamala Harris encouraged and enabled the criminals and the rioters,” he said, presumably referring to the 2020 racial justice protests. The attacks on Harris at the RNC are part of a broader GOP strategy to cast the vice president as a bigger target ahead of the November election. Reporting has indicated that while the Trump campaign hopes Biden stays in the race, believing it is easier to defeat him than any other Democrat, it is homing in on its attacks on Harris in case the president bows out. Trump himself has increasingly criticized Harris on the campaign trail in recent weeks, mispronouncing her first name and painting her as part of the “radical left.”"
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 7.17.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-71724-rcna162337,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * At the 2004 Republican National Convention, some attendees put bandages on their faces as a way to mock then-Sen. John Kerry’s Purple Heart. Twenty years later, at the 2024 Republican National Convention, some attendees have put bandages on their ears as a sign of solidarity with Donald Trump. * On the second night of the Republicans’ convention, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice declared, in apparent reference to his fellow partisans, “We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.” * Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. JD Vance reportedly spoke yesterday and agreed to debate. The details, however, are still being negotiated. * While abortion rights proponents in Arkansas apparently collected enough signatures to force a vote on a constitutional amendment, Republican Secretary of State John Thurston concluded that there was a technical problem with organizers’ paperwork. Not surprisingly, this is now the subject of a new lawsuit. * In related news, voters in Arizona are slated to vote in the fall on an abortion rights measure, but a Republican-dominated legislative panel wants to include language in a voter pamphlet that refers to a fetus as an “unborn human being.” This, too, is the subject of a new lawsuit. * In New Jersey, Democratic primary voters this week chose LaMonica McIver, the Newark city council president, as their choice to replace the late U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. The general election in this race is Sept. 18, and McIver will face Carmen Bucco, a small-business owner who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. * Late last week, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, announced it’s rolling back some restrictions on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. The New York Times reported, “Under the restrictions on Mr. Trump’s accounts, he could have been suspended from Meta’s services — which also include Threads and WhatsApp — if he had posted content that sought to delegitimize this November’s election, among other things. But Meta said it was now relaxing those restrictions, reducing the potential for a suspension if Mr. Trump violated the company’s terms of service.”"
"On crime, Republican convention speakers turn reality on its head",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 8:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/crime-republican-convention-2024-biden-reality-head-rcna162318,"Every time new data is released on U.S. crime rates, the political world ponders the same question: Why is it that the public believes crime is getting worse, when the evidence makes clear that crime rates are getting better? The answer is multifaceted, but it’s hardly unreasonable to think deceptive Republican rhetoric has made the problem worse. On the second night of the Republican National Convention, for example, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik railed against President Joe Biden’s “violent crime crisis.” House Speaker Mike Johnson made similar comments, declaring, “We can’t survive the dramatic increases in violence, crime and drugs that the Democrats’ policies have brought upon our communities.” Note the over-the-top hyperbole: To hear the Louisiana Republican tell it, crime hasn’t just reached crisis levels, it’s also reached the point at which the United States “can’t survive” such rampant crime. For now, let’s put aside the irony of Republican officials denouncing crime rates while simultaneously nominating a criminal for the nation’s highest office. Instead, let’s focus on the degree to which Stefanik, Johnson and several other convention speakers turned reality on its head. In fact, CNN reported a month ago on the latest statistics from the FBI showing a 15% drop in violent crime this year. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a written statement that the latest data “makes clear that last year’s historic decline in violent crime is continuing.” The reference to last year was especially notable because of the encouraging results from 2023. NBC News reported in March, for example, “that crime in the U.S. declined significantly in 2023, continuing a post-pandemic trend and belying widespread perceptions that crime is rising.” All of this, of course, follows a dramatic spike in the murder rate in 2020 — the final year of Donald Trump’s presidency. As for the political implications of the recent progress, I’m reminded anew of a line in a recent Axios report that stood out for me: “Polls show crime is a top concern ahead of the 2024 election — and it’s an issue where Republicans regularly edge Democrats. But falling homicide rates could take the steam out of the crucial GOP advantage.” That’s true; it could. That said, it’s difficult to have confidence that it will. Prominent Republican voices likely know that crime rates are falling. That apparently doesn’t stop them from telling the public the opposite of the truth, working from the assumption that many voters will simply believe the falsehoods and never hear about actual crime data. Circling back to our recent coverage, political campaigns have long followed some intuitive rules. Those looking to win tend to identify rivals’ areas of weakness and focus attention accordingly. Similarly, candidates have also taken care to learn about their foes’ strengths and steer their races away from those issues. But crime rates offer a great example of how contemporary Republican politics rejects the intuitive rules for a different model. The evidence makes clear that Biden has a compelling story to tell: Crime rates, most notably murder rates, spiked toward the end of his Republican predecessor’s term. Under the incumbent Democratic president’s leadership, Americans are now safer. Common sense might suggest that GOP officials would see the news and try to move the public conversation away from this area of strength for Biden. But as it turns out, they find it far easier to effectively say, “Why don’t we just make stuff up and wait for the public to buy it?” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why the GOP's ‘rule of law’ focus is literally unbelievable,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 7:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-convention-rule-law-trump-2020-rcna162302,"During her remarks at the Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird delivered an odd boast about her party’s approach to law enforcement. “We put criminals where they belong: in jail,” Bird said to applause. “That’s why we need to elect President Donald J. Trump.” If the Iowa Republican was aware of the contradiction, she didn’t show it. After all, a jury recently found the former president guilty of 34 felonies, which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault. By Bird’s reasoning, she and her party should be eager to put Trump behind bars, not in the White House. The state attorney general, however, was hardly alone. Vivek Ramaswamy, ignoring the former president’s crimes, insisted on the convention stage that Trump would “restore law and order in this country.” House Speaker Mike Johnson similarly declared, “We in the Republican Party are the law-and-order team. We always have been, and we always will be, the advocates for the rule of law.” My personal favorite was the speech from House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who practically shouted this incredible message: “Donald Trump stands with the people and the police — our men and women in blue — not with the criminals and rioters.” So, a few things. First, it was kind of amusing to hear the Minnesota congressman say Trump doesn’t stand with “rioters” when much of the former president’s candidacy is rooted in his support for rioters. Second, the idea that the former president stands with “the police” isn’t quite that simple. In reality, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. So much for ""back the blue."" Third, the House speaker’s claim that the Republican Party honors “the rule of law” is belied by overwhelming evidence. Revisiting our recent coverage, it remains true that a party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t nominate a person convicted of felonies for the nation’s highest office. A party that cares about the rule of law also wouldn’t try to undermine public confidence in the judicial system without cause. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t try to defund law enforcement agencies based on nonsensical conspiracy theories. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t endorse retaliatory, politically motivated prosecutions against innocent people. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t reward accused criminals, elevating them to positions in which they could help steer the party’s future. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t have a suspected criminal, indicted on election-related charges, oversee the party’s election-year legal efforts. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t rally behind a presidential nominee who’s running on a platform of pardoning violent criminals and putting them back onto the streets. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t nominate for president a criminal who’s surrounded himself with other convicted criminals. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t scramble to condemn one of its own after he encouraged voters to respect the legal process. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t boo police officers for telling them inconvenient truths. A party that cares about the rule of law wouldn’t invite a convicted criminal to speak at their national convention within hours of his release from prison. The contemporary Republican Party, however, has done all of this and more — recently. It’s the same Republican Party that was indifferent toward Trump-era White House corruption, saw some of its members sentenced to prison, expressed indifference when their party’s then-president tried to weaponize federal law enforcement, and participated in a radical, dangerous, and unprecedented plot to overturn the results of a free and fair American presidential election. Partisans such as House Speaker Mike Johnson are welcome to claim that the Republican Party is “the law-and-order team,” but that won’t make it true. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Nikki Haley takes a circuitous route to a pro-Trump convention speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 6:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/nikki-haley-takes-circuitous-route-trump-convention-speech-rcna162288,"Last year, after Donald Trump mocked House Majority Whip Tom Emmer and derailed the Minnesotan’s bid for House speaker, Emmer would’ve been justified in holding a grudge. Instead, the congressman went to great lengths to curry favor with the former president, offering Trump sycophantic support. “They always bend the knee,” Trump said soon after. The phrase came to mind watching Nikki Haley endorse her former primary rival at the Republican National Convention. A Washington Post report summarized: Haley nevertheless declared that she was giving Trump her “strong endorsement, period.” The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations didn’t have to do this. Indeed, plenty of her GOP contemporaries chose a different course. But Haley still wants a future in Republican politics, so she played the role of a loyal, partisan soldier. It’s worth pausing, though, to acknowledge the weird and circuitous path the South Carolinian has followed. Eight years ago, when there was still some question as to whether Trump would be able to take over the Republican Party, Haley was categorical in rejecting Trump — and Trumpism. “I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party,” she said in 2016. “That is not who we want as president.” Around the same time, Haley added, “I have to tell you, Donald Trump is everything I taught my children not to do in kindergarten.” A year later, Haley reversed course and joined Trump’s team. After Jan. 6, Haley reversed course again, telling Politico after the attack on the Capitol that Trump “went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. And we can’t let that ever happen again.”  Soon after, Haley reversed course again, re-embraced party orthodoxy, defended Trump, and vowed not to run against him in 2024. A year and a half later, Haley reversed course again and challenged Trump for their party’s nomination. During their primary fight, she told voters that the former president had become “unstable and unhinged.” After Trump went after her husband, Haley said Trump is “not qualified” to be president. She later reversed course again, leading to her convention endorsement. I’m reminded of something National Review’s Philip Klein wrote in 2021: “A few weeks ago, back when she thought tide was turning against Trump, Haley said he would be ‘judged harshly by history.’ Now she realized she got ahead of her skis and is trying to take it back. As I’ve written, she is a human chameleon. She thinks we’re too dumb to notice.” Plenty of Republicans have made the transition from Trump critic to Trump supporter. His own running mate falls into the category. But no one in public life has changed their minds about Trump more than Haley."
Why Ted Cruz’s ugly speech at the Republican convention matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ted-cruzs-ugly-speech-republican-convention-2024-rcna162274,"Eight years ago this week, Sen. Ted Cruz delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention. They were not well received. The Texas senator had just wrapped up his own failed presidential bid, during which time he got to know Donald Trump fairly well. Their relationship, however, could’ve been better: The future president went after Cruz’s wife and suggested Cruz’s father played a role in the JFK assassination. The senator, meanwhile, told voters that Trump was a “pathological liar,” a “bully,” a “narcissist,” “utterly amoral” and a “sniveling coward” with “a consistent pattern of inciting violence.” With this in mind, when Cruz spoke at his party’s 2016 convention, he couldn’t quite bring himself to endorse his former rival, instead saying, “If you love our country and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience.” The booing from attendees was relentless. In the years that followed, the senator did what most Republicans did and became a Trump sycophant. It was against this backdrop that the far-right senator spoke again at his party’s national convention — and this time, he received a far warmer reception than he did eight years ago. Cruz pleased attendees, not only by throwing his support behind the GOP ticket, but also by feeding the crowd the kind of anti-immigrant red meat that tends to generate strong reactions. Pitching the idea that the United States has become a violent hellscape as a result of undocumented criminals, Cruz went so far as to declare: “How did we get here? It happened because Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children.” To the extent that reality still matters, Cruz combined a series of lies to create one larger lie. The senator told people to believe that non-citizen voting is rampant, which isn’t true. He told people to believe that Democratic officials want support from non-citizen voters, which isn’t true and doesn’t make any sense. And perhaps most importantly, Cruz told people to believe that Democratic officials are willing to sacrifice the lives of American children — deliberately — in order to benefit electorally from the support from non-citizen voters, which is transgressive madness. A Washington Post analysis described the Texas Republican’s rhetoric as “grotesque.” Cruz is not a dumb man. He surely knows that his ugly rhetoric is false. He pitched it to a national audience anyway. So much for “unity.” Watching the senator’s appalling speech, I was reminded of recent chatter about Cruz turning over a new leaf. The Texas Tribune reported in April, for example, that Cruz, as part of his latest re-election campaign, was “casting himself as a bipartisan lawmaker with a penchant for reaching across the aisle.” The Wall Street Journal soon after published a related report, noting that Cruz is “rolling out a softer, bipartisan side,” and taking steps to “recast his image as a dealmaking lawmaker.” The article added, “His campaign even shot ads featuring ‘Democrats for Cruz.’” His convention speech made fools of those who believed such talk."
The dangerous story Trump fans are telling themselves at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-2024-election-inevitable-rcna162149,"Every four years, the two parties hold their national conventions and boast that their nominees are going to win the presidential election in the fall. Conventions are times to project confidence and unity. However, in speeches from and interviews with Republicans and their conservative allies at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, they’re expressing more than confidence in former President Donald Trump’s chances. They’re expressing inevitability. Even before the stunning events of the last several days, the mood among Trump’s devotees was that he can’t lose against President Joe Biden. The convention has seen Republicans double down on that rhetoric, throwing out any caution about predicting a blowout. It’s more than bravado. It’s a flashing warning sign for what may come if the tides shift before November. Since the presidential debate between Trump and Biden in Atlanta last month, Republicans have been more than happy to sit back and watch Democrats panic over their standard-bearer’s performance and debate replacing him on top of the ticket. Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania has further galvanized his followers’ belief that he can’t lose. “Let’s be honest,” former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said at the Heritage Foundation’s Policy Fest, held across the street from the RNC on Monday. “Trump just won. He just won.” Carlson, who will speak from the main stage at the RNC later this week, wasn’t alone in that thinking. Even as official speakers were told to be a bit more restrained in their speeches, the shooting was taken among Trump supporters as a sign that it’s impossible for him to lose. Evangelical leaders like Franklin Graham have joined members of Trump’s family and campaign in referring to his survival in biblical terms, framing the Trump victory that will follow as nothing short of God’s will. The New York Times reported that attendees viewed the incident as “just one more example of the way everything — everything — seems to be going their way.” To wit: Mere hours before Carlson’s speech, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon tossed out the federal classified documents case against Trump. One of his vanquished foes in the primaries, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, was scheduled to encourage her supporters to shift their allegiance to Trump, promoting party unity over her past criticisms. It’s no wonder the crowd went wild when the perfectly timed appearance of Trump, with his ear still bandaged, prompted a chant of “Fight! Fight! Fight!” from the gathered throngs. Republicans are feeling understandably geared up. But the GOP’s success isn’t quite the slam dunk that it’s being made out to be in Milwaukee, not with the election still months away. It’s worth bearing in mind that the predictions of a red wave in 2022 fizzled out, yielding the weakest midterm performance by a party that didn’t hold the White House has had in decades. And the polls still show Biden and Trump running neck and neck even after the tumult of the last few months. And as this week has already shown, there’s a lot that can happen between now and the election. It’s not even certain that the same issues Republicans hope to campaign on will be at play then. The convention’s theme Monday — “Make America Wealthy Once Again” — already clashed with reality. Despite the dire warnings from speakers throughout the day about the supposed horrors of the Biden economy, inflation has leveled off after its post-pandemic peaks, opening the doors to the Federal Reserve’s potentially cutting interest rates between now and November. And unemployment remains low. In these circumstances, some might find it wise to proceed with at least a little caution for fear of jinxing things. But it’s not just a lack of superstition that is undergirding the GOP’s sureness. The narrative that Trump and his allies have crafted is one that rules out any potential loss as illegitimate. According to an AP-NORC poll conducted last year, even before this feeling of inevitability manifested, 46% of Republicans already expressed little to no faith that November’s ballots will be counted accurately. Unlike in 2020, when only the most die-hard MAGA elected officials offered full-throated backing for Trump’s wild claims of Democratic election fraud, he will be supported this time by a vast and growing GOP infrastructure primed to do whatever it takes to ensure that failure isn’t an option. Conservative lawyers are already gearing up to target the U.S. voting system in the election’s aftermath, seeking to nullify a Biden win. The Republican National Committee has shifted resources to focus on “election integrity” over helping states drive people out to the polls. Confidence is a virtue; finding it impossible to believe you could be wrong, as Republicans now do, is hubris that could have dire consequences for the future of democracy. This is what makes it so dangerous for Democrats, reeling from the internal debate over Biden’s future, to buy into the idea that Trump’s win is inevitable, as well. Doing so would be tantamount to endorsing Republicans’ narrative. Democrats need to remember that there’s still time to prove the GOP’s certainty wrong and win in November — even if Republicans are unwilling to admit that such a thing is possible."
"Today’s GOP has no past, present, or future. It’s just Trump.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 17, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-speakers-donald-trump-snub-rcna161770,"In his seminal dystopian novel, “1984,” George Orwell wrote “who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” Suffice it to say, Orwell would have had a field day at the 2024 Republican National Convention.  Indeed, there is no better example of former President Donald Trump’s hold over the modern GOP than this week’s near-total erasure of the Republican Party’s past. You might not be aware of it by watching the Republican convention this week, but the Republican Party is, in fact, 170 years old. It was formed in 1854 as an abolitionist movement opposed to the expansion of slavery into western territories. Its first standard-bearer was Abraham Lincoln, which is why the GOP is sometimes referred to as the “Party of Lincoln.” Nineteen presidents have been Republicans. But if you watch the 2024 Republican convention, you are likely to hear about only one: Donald Trump. It’s as if MAGA wiped the GOP slate clean and made 2016 its Year Zero. Other than Trump, there’s only one other living Republican ex-president: George W. Bush. He’s one of only four Republican presidents in history to win two presidential elections and serve eight years in office. And the chances of hearing Bush’s name mentioned in a positive light by convention speakers in Milwaukee this week are close to nil.  Twenty years ago, Bush was a revered figure within the GOP (for those of you who are younger, you’ll have to take my word for it).  But in the 16 years since he left office, Bush’s presidency has largely been stuffed down the memory hole — and it has been a bipartisan effort. Even Democrats don’t bother talking about his disastrous presidency anymore. While Bush left office with a historically low approval rating and a cratering economy, that’s not necessarily why he is persona non grata in the party he once led. Bush was an internationalist. Trump is an isolationist. W was pro-immigration and, by and large, opposed to demonizing people of color. Trump is, of course, the exact opposite. And Bush is part of a multigenerational political dynasty. In other words, for MAGA he is the embodiment of the dreaded political establishment.   But it’s not just Bush who has been kicked to the curb. There are also three living Republican vice presidents not in attendance — Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and Mike Pence. Quayle has been out of the limelight for years; Cheney is the father of Liz Cheney, whom Trump despises for her role in co-chairing the House Jan. 6 committee, and, of course, on Jan. 6 Trump helped whip up a mob that threatened the life of Pence, his former vice president — so it’s probably best he didn’t make the trip to Milwaukee. (Incidentally, it was Quayle who told fellow Hoosier Pence that he didn’t have the authority to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election.) How about the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney? He’s retiring from the Senate, in large measure because of his revulsion at the direction the party has taken since Trump won its presidential nod in 2016. (Of course, Trump hates him, too, as Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict at both of Trump’s impeachment trials.) Romney’s 2012 running mate, Paul Ryan, a former speaker of the House, might be in attendance in Milwaukee (he is, after all, from Wisconsin), but he’s not speaking. The same goes for 2008 nominee Sarah Palin. Her running mate, John McCain, passed away in 2018, but there won’t be any glossy tributes for him. Trump, infamously, mocked McCain’s time as a POW in Vietnam. The national convention where McCain is most likely to show up is the Democratic National Convention. McCain’s widow, Cindy, spoke there in 2020. The 1996 presidential nominee (and 1976 vice presidential nominee), Bob Dole, passed away in 2021. What are the chances that there will be a tribute to him at this year’s Republican convention? There wasn’t one in 2020 to honor former President George H.W. Bush, who died in 2018. Will there even be a reference to Ronald Reagan, the president to whom Republicans tied themselves for decades after he left office? It’s hardly a guarantee, which once would have been sacrilegious at a GOP event but today is practically par for the course (although if one wants to see the new Reagan biopic starring Dennis Quaid, it’s showing every day in Milwaukee). Historically, political parties have a tendency to turn their backs on failed presidents or losing candidates. There weren’t many Republican conventions that extolled the virtues of Herbert Hoover after his disastrous one term in office. The same goes for Richard Nixon, the only president who was forced to resign. But even Nixon got a shoutout from the party’s presidential nominees in 1992 and 1996.  For Democrats, Jimmy Carter might have lost re-election in 1980 and is generally considered a failed president — but that didn’t stop Democrats from giving him a prime-time speaking slot at the next three conventions. This year, one can fully expect prime-time speeches from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. It wouldn’t be a surprise if Al Gore, John Kerry or Tim Kaine made appearances.  But at this year’s RNC, it’s as if there was no Republican Party before Trump came along. And, in a sense, that’s true. The current incarnation of the GOP bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan or the Bush family. The only real blast from the past is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. I could identify only two speakers who worked in the Bush administration. It’s now the party of Trump and Trumpism, of political outsiders and rebels — and the only price for entry is pledging one’s fealty to the leader (not the party). Of the dozens of speakers over four days in Milwaukee, virtually all came to prominence in just the past decade or so — and largely on Trump’s coattails. People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kari Lake, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Matt Gaetz are the faces of the modern GOP. Their rises to prominence have little to do with adherence to GOP policy orthodoxy or even their political chops but rather their willingness to prostrate themselves before Donald Trump — and fully embrace his many lies.  In Trump’s GOP, there are no legacy, no coherent ideological beliefs and no enduring political tradition. There is no past, present or future. There’s just Trump."

Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week’s top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. Donald Trump’s selection of Sen.

He’s essentially Arizona congressional candidate and gun whisperer Blake Masters with a beard. Or a cherubic Elon Musk with a lighter wallet. By which I mean Vance, a rich Silicon Valley tech bro, is all-in on the idea of a far-right technocracy. After the announcement, social media users started to shine light on a computer programmer turned far-right proselytizer named Curtis Yarvin, a peddler of racist pseudoscience (he espouses a belief in “biological roots of intelligence”) who’s been cited favorably by Vance and Masters, among others. Vox published a piece in 2022 that quotes Vance as name-dropping Yarvin and citing him as the inspiration for his opinion that Trump should replace all the government bureaucrats with “our people.” Here’s how Vox describes Yarvin’s worldview: Definitely something voters might want to consider when they cast their ballots this fall. Elon Musk, who has helped to push voices on his social media platform to the right, is officially wading into the 2024 presidential race with a massive spending campaign — he has promised $45 million per month to a Trump-affiliated PAC — to get out the vote for Republicans this fall.

Americans want SCOTUS reform — but 'arrogant' justices are standing in the way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 2:29 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-supreme-court-reform-ethics-rcna164350,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""Deadline: White House."" On Monday, President Joe Biden announced a slate of new proposals to overhaul the Supreme Court, calling on Congress to establish term limits and a binding code of ethics for the justices. He also asked lawmakers to pass a constitutional amendment to overturn the court's decision allowing sitting presidents immunity from criminal law.  Now I know the chances of these reforms passing or being enshrined in our Constitution anytime soon are not great. But Biden did the right thing. It’s very important that the president put this marker down ahead of November's election. There’s no question the Roberts Court is in a crisis. The American people do not trust it. The justices' ethical lapses have been huge and notable. Most Americans realize there's something wrong with sitting U.S. Supreme Court justices taking all this free stuff from billionaires when everybody else in government has to be very transparent. Committing crimes as president and getting a free get-out-of-jail card is also not acceptable to most Americans. What we're witnessing from the Supreme Court is extreme arrogance. When all of the details of these ethical lapses first came out — the hundreds of thousands of dollars in luxury trips, school tuition, RVs and fishing trips — that would have been a moment for a majority of justices on the court to do a gut check and say it’s time for ethics reform. Instead of doing that, the majority of justices on the bench have told the American people: ""You can’t touch us. Leave us alone."" It’s just arrogant.  It's also infuriating for people like myself, who have served in government and been subject to ethics rules. Almost everyone in government has to abide by ethics rules. It is part of our democracy and has been for a long time. Ethics rules for judges who aren’t Supreme Court judges are tough. Same for members of Congress. If you’re a member of Congress. you can’t even go out to dinner with someone — you have to stand up and eat only hors d’oeuvres for it to qualify under the ethics rule.  Proposals like term limits have always been popular with voters, no matter who they are for. Republicans backing away from reform simply because the court is on their side right now is not a good look. Even if these proposals aren't implemented, I think this could be a winning issue for Democrats at the ballot box.

"Sheriff who hired Sean Grayson, the deputy who killed Sonya Massey, rejects calls to resign",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 2:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sean-grayson-sonya-massey-sheriff-resign-rcna164296,"The Illinois sheriff who hired Sean Grayson, the deputy who killed Sonya Massey in her home, has asked for “forgiveness” from the community over her death but rejected calls for his resignation. “We failed Sonya. We failed Sonya’s family and friends. We failed the community,” Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell told residents in Springfield on Monday night. “I stand here today before you, with arms wide open, and I ask for your forgiveness. I ask Ms. Massey and her family for forgiveness.” Campbell was speaking at a listening session organized by the U.S. Justice Department, which is investigating Massey's death. Grayson, who is white, shot and killed Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman, in her home on July 6 after she called 911 to report a suspected prowler. It was the first time that Campbell has addressed the public in person since Massey's killing. Yet the sheriff maintained that he would not step down. ""You are the reason I ran for sheriff,"" he told residents on Monday. ""My commitment to you has never wavered. It still doesn't. I cannot step down. I will not abandon the sheriff's office at a most critical moment. That would solve nothing; the incident would remain. I vow to listen and learn."" Grayson was hired by the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office in May 2023 — his sixth job at a law enforcement agency since 2020. He was fired on July 17, nearly two weeks after he killed Massey. Massey's family members have questioned why the sheriff’s office hired Grayson in the first place, given his history of disciplinary problems and red flags at law enforcement agencies where he previously worked. It's unclear whether Campbell or any other Sangamon County officials were aware of Grayson's performance issues at his previous jobs, NBC News reported. However, the sheriff's office said it was aware of his misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence in two separate prior incidents. Grayson has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in Massey's death. His attorney, Dan Fultz, declined to comment about his history of disciplinary issues."
R. Kelly appeals sex crime convictions to U.S. Supreme Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 1:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/r-kelly-supreme-court-appeal-rcna164313,"R. Kelly is appealing his federal sex crimes convictions to the Supreme Court, pressing a statute of limitations argument that an appeals court flatly rejected. The disgraced singer’s appeal stems from his conviction in Chicago for producing child pornography and enticing minors to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to 20 years. (In another case in New York that’s under a separate pending appeal, he was sentenced to 30 years, though 19 years of the two sentences are set to be served concurrently.) The 57-year-old, named Robert Sylvester Kelly, is currently slated to be released from prison in 2045.  In his petition to the justices, Kelly’s lawyers argue that he was wrongly prosecuted retroactively under a federal law that they argue bars charges related to his conduct in the 1990s and early 2000s. Prior to 2003, the statute of limitations barred prosecutions after the victim’s 25th birthday. But the law was amended that year to allow prosecutions through the life of the victim. The victims hadn’t turned 25 by then, but they had by the time that Kelly was charged. That timing is crucial, according to the federal appeals court that rejected Kelly’s claim, leading to his Supreme Court appeal. “As a threshold matter, it is not unconstitutional to apply a newer statute of limitations to old conduct when the defendant was subject to prosecution at the time of the change, as Kelly was in 2003,” the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in April. It takes four justices to grant review of a petition, and the court only takes a small fraction each year of the thousands of appeals it receives. Before the court considers whether to take Kelly’s case, the Justice Department has a chance to oppose his petition in writing, with its response currently due Aug. 28.

I didn’t vote for Tim Walz originally. Now I’m completely Walz-pilled.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 12:33 PM PDT / Updated Aug. 6, 2024, 6:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-pick-minnesota-rcna164157,"UPDATE (Aug. 6, 2024, 9:17 a.m. ET): On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz to be her 2024 running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thinks the leaders of the modern Republican Party — especially but not exclusively former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — are extremely “weird.” He has been saying so for months, but ever since Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, he has become one of her most effective messengers, doing the dirty work of attacking the Republicans so Harris can focus on a positive message — “Freedom.”  It has become easy to imagine Walz as the next Democratic nominee for vice president, one of a handful of politicians who have emerged as front-runners for the honor. If it happens, I’ll be thrilled. I’m a Minnesotan and have watched Walz since he started running for governor in the 2018 election. Before that, he was just a “downstate” congressman and not so much on my radar.  But much to my surprise, I’ve become fully “Walz-pilled,” not so much because of the viral clips, but because when he has had the opportunity, he has done everything he can to make Minnesota a better place for everyone. Frankly, I’m surprised at my own enthusiasm, because I wasn’t a Walz supporter when he ran for governor in 2018. This is inside baseball for Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor politics (not technically the Democratic Party), but Walz came into the race as the more electable, more conservative major candidate for governor. He seemed fine but boring, and it felt like in the coming blue wave anti-Trump election cycle, Minnesota could do better.  So I backed his rival, Erin Murphy, and she lost. I was disappointed but naturally voted for Walz in the general election and was happy enough that he won.  But I thought Walz would be a brake on progress, seeking the kind of consensus across the middle that just isn’t possible these days thanks to the devolution of the Republicans. And the Minnesota GOP seemed especially devolved, nominating far-right ideologues instead of trying to compete in a purple state. Turns out I was wrong. Walz’s first term was fine, marked by generally solid health-related leadership during Covid and some questionable decisions during the 2020 George Floyd uprising, but it was last year that everything changed.  In the 2022 elections, Democrats won a trifecta, taking full control of state government, but with a Senate majority of only one seat. DFL leaders never hesitated, taking advantage of a large budget surplus to quickly enact a wide range of progressive policies across the board that changed our state for the better.  They made Minnesota a safe haven for the trans community. They affirmed abortion as a fundamental right and removed restrictions that limited access. They legalized recreational cannabis use and passed laws for driver’s licenses for all Minnesotans regardless of immigration status, automatic voter registration, paid family and medical leave, tax rebates for people making less than $75,000 and new climate goals, and they phased out parental fees for families with kids on Medicaid. This last one is perhaps narrower than the others, but my son has Down syndrome and is on Medicaid, so I sure paid close attention to this. Tim Walz was just one of the Democratic leaders behind the unprecedented sweep of legislation, and arguably not even the most important. House leader Melissa Hortman and Senate leader Kari Dziedzic led the way, kept their caucuses united and got the bills to Walz’s desk. But he never hesitated and quickly became the public face of the movement, especially when he was signing bills for free lunch for all Minnesota school kids, no exceptions. Long before his name was mentioned in the veepstakes, he went viral for pictures of kids hugging him and then lining up for a high-five line as Walz clowned around in the classroom. I’m less interested in the identity politics surrounding Walz, though I recognize that as a Midwestern white dad, a veteran, a former social studies teacher and football coach and a dad from a small rural town, he has a background very distinguishable from Harris’.  But there’s an advantage to this. He can argue, as he did on MSNBC, that the genuine problems facing small-town white Americans are the fault of plutocrats — the Trumps of the world, venture capitalists like JD Vance and their backers. Because the problem isn’t just that they are weird creeps, but that they’re genuinely making lives worse for more people. Walz believes Democratic policies make lives better. At the end of the 2023 legislative session, Walz gave the memorable quote “Minnesota is showing the country you don’t win elections to bank political capital — you win elections to burn political capital and improve lives.”  When I heard that, I became entirely Walz-pilled, delighted to be led by a politician drawing from the best Minnesota traditions of “happy warriors” like former Democratic Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey (also a former vice president) and Paul Wellstone. I’m willing to share him with the nation. Too often, including in January 2021, Democrats have held power in Washington and acted too cautiously rather than risen to the moment. The Minnesota model shows there’s another way.  Sure, Republicans howled about the lack of bipartisanship, but that’s one of the lessons. Do one progressive act or do 50, the howl will be the same. And if you help enough people, voters will reward you. There’s some Midwestern dad energy that the nation sorely needs. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign.

"Team Harris stresses prosecutorial record, calls Trump a criminal",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 11:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-harris-prosecutorial-record-calls-trump-criminal-election-2024-rcna164333,"At an event late last week, Donald Trump declared with confidence, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal,” as if the maxim were just common sense. A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event. “A criminal is a criminal,” he said. “They generally stay a criminal and we do not have time to figure it out.” In context, Trump appeared to be referring to migrants hoping to enter the United States, but there was a degree of irony hanging overhead. In a little more than a year, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in his hush money case, a different jury held him liable for sexual abuse, and a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud. A little self-awareness goes a long way, and by any reasonable measure, “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal” is a phrase the GOP nominee probably ought to avoid. It was against this backdrop that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign made its first big ad buy of the cycle, investing $50 million in support of a spot called “Fearless.” The minute-long commercial is worth watching in its entirety, but of particular interest was the opening message in the spot. “As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,” the narrator tells viewers. “As California’s attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners.” The ad goes on from there, but from the outset, the message was unambiguous: Team Harris wants voters to know about her background in law enforcement, and her role in locking up criminals. A day earlier, the incumbent vice president’s political operation sent a news release to reporters on crime, noting not only the significant improvement in crime rates during the Democratic administration, but also saying plainly: “Our opponent Donald Trump is a criminal.” A campaign spokesperson added, “On crime and the border: Donald Trump’s lies are not facts and Donald Trump’s angry rants are not results. Under Trump, America saw unprecedented violence, ineptitude, and division. Right now, America is stronger and safer because of the work of the Biden-Harris administration: Violent crime is at record lows, the border is more secure, and unlike Donald Trump, the vice president is committed to enforcing the law, not breaking it.” The former president talks about crime as if it’s a campaign issue on which he has an advantage, despite his felonious past. It appears his assumptions are being tested. At a campaign rally last week, Trump told an audience that the Democratic campaign was telling the electorate, “‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’” He added, “I don’t think people are going to buy it.” The trouble, of course, is that the message has the benefit of being true. As for whether voters will buy it or not, we’ll find out in about 98 days."
Project 2025’s plot for a Trump DOJ takeover,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 11:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-doj-fbi-trump-power-rcna164165,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 28 episode of “Velshi.” Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department begins with a bit of a tell: ""Not reforming the Department of Justice will also guarantee the failure of that conservative Administration’s agenda in countless other ways.” A common misconception held by Donald Trump while he was president was that the Justice Department worked for him, not for the American people. Chapter 17 seeks to make that misconception true. Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation and architect of Project 2025, is already on board with Trump’s perspective. In January, he told The New York Times, “[W]e just disagree wholly that the Department of Justice is independent of the president or the executive branch.” Now, Project 2025's 922-page blueprint for a second Trump term isn't an easy read. The words and sentences are deliberately confusing. But make no mistake, Project 2025 calls for a Justice Department working in lockstep with a potential Trump administration. That means if Trump is re-elected, the branch tasked with independently and impartially upholding the rule of law will be in the hands of a man convicted of 34 felony counts, who has promised revenge and retribution against his personal enemies. What could possibly go wrong? Let’s start with Project 2025's plans for the FBI, which is a branch within the Justice Department. While president, Trump was supremely frustrated by his inability to control the FBI. He wanted desperately for the agency to drop its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. So it follows that Project 2025 would encourage the next conservative administration to place the FBI under more “politically accountable” leadership — code words for “loyal to the president.” It also wants the FBI to stop investigating online misinformation, a new initiative that feels more important than ever. The agency wouldn't investigate police misconduct, either. Another hidden detail in Chapter 17 is the call to “Promptly and properly eliminate ... all existing consent decrees.” The Justice Department typically hands down consent decrees to local jurisdictions after investigations into police wrongdoing — think of them like court-ordered improvement plans. These decrees usually compel jails to improve their conditions or police departments to consider their tactics and report back to the Justice Department. Project 2025 argues the Justice Department should “disclaim” its ability to hand down consent decrees. Another target of this chapter is local and state attorneys who use their own discretion to pursue or not pursue prosecution. Project 2025 calls for the Justice Department to “initiate legal action against local officials—including District Attorneys—who deny American citizens the ‘equal protection of the laws’ by refusing to prosecute criminal offenses in their jurisdictions.” This would be a radical departure from the norm, and it goes against the very purpose of local district attorneys. As the Marshall Project's Jamiles Lartey explains, “Choosing which cases to pursue and which to drop is a core responsibility of prosecution, and one of the arguments for the local election of district attorneys is that communities may have different priorities on how these choices get made.” But no such quarter would be given in a second Trump term. If you’d prefer a Justice Department that will defend and uphold voting rights, I have bad news for you: Project 2025 would reorient the federal government’s role from upholding voting rights to suppressing them. It takes specific aim at so-called mail-in ballot fraud and other types of voting and registration that became targets of The Big Lie: “With respect to the 2020 presidential election, there were no DOJ investigations of the appropriateness or lawfulness of state election guidance. ... The Pennsylvania Secretary of State should have been (and still should be) investigated and prosecuted for potential violations.” That paragraph explicitly targets a specific official whom Trump blames for his 2020 election loss. Again, what could go wrong? If implemented, Project 2025’s new-era Justice Department would cement long-standing grudges Trump holds against the various legal guardrails he crashed into during his four years in office and in the years since, and it would mutate the Justice Department into nothing more than a crude beating stick for Trump and his allies to use against their perceived enemies."
Trump’s ‘won’t have to vote anymore’ remarks sounded just like his authoritarian idols,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 10:25 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-wont-vote-remarks-reflect-authoritarian-idols-rcna164167,"Legal scholar Dahlia Lithwick’s sobering comments after the Supreme Court gave Donald Trump broad immunity from prosecution have stuck with me ever since. “As an official representative of the legal commentariat I want to suggest that tonight’s a good news cycle to talk to the fascism and authoritarianism experts,” she tweeted July 1, the day of the ruling. “This is their inning now...” Those words came to my mind over the weekend as Trump was going viral for telling supporters that they “won’t have to vote anymore” in four years because “it’ll be fixed” — remarks that sure sounded like a clear signal that Trump is planning to end democracy if he’s elected president again. I think sometimes people can foolishly minimize such statements from Trump as if they simply reflect a thirst for power. But I doubt we’ve ever had a presidential hopeful as eager as Trump is to fawn over authoritarians. In fact, Trump was given multiple opportunities to explain his concerning comment on Monday night but failed to do so. So I think we should heed Lithwick’s advice and take a look at these strongman idols. Trump has praised the likes of China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. But his party is currently enamored with some lesser-known authoritarians, too, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele. And I question, sometimes, whether people know what kind of governance the MAGA movement is motioning toward with this. Orbán has railed against “mixed-race” countries and touted his vision of an “illiberal state.” His government has consolidated control of media outlets, and his Fidesz party has used gerrymandering to seemingly draw itself into power indefinitely. The party once sought to give parents more voting power than people without children — a plan that Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, pushed in 2021.  Bukele — El Salvador’s self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world” — is another favorite among American conservatives. He once ordered armed soldiers into parliament to pressure lawmakers. He has waged a violent crackdown on gangs, alarming human rights observers, and used that crusade to justify censoring the press. He also stacked El Salvador’s top court, which struck down a seeming constitutional ban on consecutive presidential terms. When you consider such actions against the backdrop of Trump’s repeated antidemocratic statements, it’s more than appropriate for us to consider how he just might try — if he wins in November — to achieve the kind of power his idols have."
JD Vance’s record of deriding people without kids gets even worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 9:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-record-deriding-people-kids-gets-even-worse-rcna164297,"When Donald Trump sat down with Laura Ingraham for his latest Fox News interview, the host noted that his running mate has faced criticisms for his comments about Americans who don’t have children. The Republican nominee shrugged it off. In fact, the former president took the opportunity to insist that Sen. JD Vance is “not against” those without biological kids of their own. Trump added that he’s confident that women “understand” the Ohio senator’s true beliefs. It’s clear, the Republican added, “when you listen to his words.” The trouble is, we’ve been listening to Vance’s words quite a bit, and they’re not getting any less controversial. The Ohioan’s first full week as a candidate for national office was quite dreadful for a variety of reasons, but one comment from his record stood out. As we’ve discussed, during Vance’s first campaign for elected office three years ago, the then-Senate candidate appeared on Fox News and diagnosed what he saw as a crisis plaguing the United States. The country, Vance told a national television audience, was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It’s just a basic fact.” The future senator specifically included Vice President Kamala Harris — who has step-children, but no biological children of her own — in his societal condemnation. The ugliness of Vance’s rhetoric — rooted in the idea that those without biological children are somehow lesser, unreliable, and undeserving of positions of leadership — generated considerable attention, leading the vice presidential candidate to concede his comments were “sarcastic.” But when offered an opportunity to walk back his rhetoric, Vance instead doubled down on the underlying point. In a separate media appearance last week, the Republican also tried to defend himself by arguing that Harris called for “an end to the child tax credit,” which wasn’t true. But making matters even worse is the totality of Vance’s record. CNN reported: As recently as November 2020, for example, Vance said on a podcast that childless Americans, especially those in the country’s “leadership class,” were “more sociopathic” than those with children and made the country “less mentally stable.” Vance went on to say that in his experience, the “most deranged” and “most psychotic” people he sees on social media were also typically childless. The “childless cat ladies” comments, in other words, were not a one-off. Vance has been condemning Americans without kids repeatedly, for years. Indeed, it’s been genuinely challenging to keep up with the avalanche of reporting on this, just from the past few days. Media Matters, for example, uncovered several additional Fox interviews in which Vance lashed out at “childless” Democrats. Media Matters also found a Breitbart news interview in which the Ohio Republican claimed that the left’s “next generation leaders,” including “the Kamala Harrises, they don’t have kids. And so there’s this weird way where they want to take our kids and brainwash them so that their ideas continue to exist in the next generation.”  There’s also been extensive reporting of late about Vance suggesting that parents should have greater voting rights than Americans without children, and federal tax policies should “punish” those without children for their “bad” choices. Mother Jones’ David Corn, meanwhile, uncovered a speech in which Vance said he receives unflattering media coverage because he thinks most journalists are “childless adults.” HuffPost added a report of its own, shining a light on comments the Republican senator made in 2021 about the need to ""go to war” against the idea that women can decide not to have children, suggesting that someone who focuses on building their career instead of making babies will be “a sad, lonely, pathetic person.” Remember, as far as Trump is concerned, Vance is “not against” those without biological kids of their own. All people have to do, the former president said, is “listen to his words.” I have a follow-up question for the GOP nominee: “Have you listened to his words?” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Trump defends JD Vance's 'childless cat ladies' comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 9:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-rcna164236,"Donald Trump is trying to do some damage control as the fallout from his running mate’s comments about “childless cat ladies” continues. In an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham that aired Monday night, Trump defended Sen. JD Vance, saying his vice presidential pick's past attacks on women without children were simply due to his love for family. “He made a statement having to do with families,” Trump said. “That doesn’t mean people that aren’t a member of a big and beautiful family with 400 children around and everything else — it doesn’t mean that a person doesn’t have — he’s not against anything, but he loves family. It’s very important to him.” The GOP presidential nominee pointed to Vance’s “interesting family situation,” which the Ohio senator documented in his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” “He feels family is good. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong in saying that,” Trump said, accusing Democrats of “spinning things differently.” Vance's questionable views on family and women have come under scrutiny in recent weeks. Trump’s attempt to portray his running mate’s past comments as innocuous is not exactly convincing, given the disdain with which the Ohio senator himself spoke about women without children. Vance lamented to Fox News in 2021 that the country was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” Vance’s comments have provoked intense backlash from Democrats and risk jeopardizing the Republican presidential ticket’s support among undecided voters, including women. Last week, Vance himself went on the defensive, saying in an interview that his “childless cat ladies” barb was part of his argument that Democrats are “anti-family and anti-child.” “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment,” he said. “I’ve got nothing against cats.”"
What the Trump immunity ruling says about the Roberts Court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 9:25 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-roberts-court-rcna164239,"Throughout the Donald Trump immunity litigation leading up to the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this month, questions abounded over whether the court would step in to decide the issue, when it would do so, and how — including whether the court might achieve a unanimous opinion on presidential power as it had historically. When we finally saw the decision on July 1, we learned that the court was far from unanimous in Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion granting Trump (and other former presidents) broad criminal immunity. A new report sheds light on the court’s deliberations and Roberts’ further rightward shift, suggesting that a partisan divide on presidential immunity was seemingly inevitable under the chief justice’s leadership. The report by CNN chief Supreme Court analyst and Roberts biographer Joan Biskupic, which hasn’t been confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC, recounted that sources familiar with the court’s deliberations said “there was an immediate and clear 6-3 split” in the case. Biskupic reported that Roberts “made no serious effort to entice the three liberal justices for even a modicum of the cross-ideological agreement that distinguished such presidential-powers cases in the past. He believed he could persuade people to look beyond Trump.” Roberts reportedly declined to respond to CNN’s questions about the recent term and this case.  To recap, the court could’ve taken up the immunity issue in December, when special counsel Jack Smith asked the justices to do so at an earlier stage of litigation in the federal election interference case. The court declined. After the federal appeals court ruled against Trump, the high court granted review of his appeal in February but didn’t schedule a hearing until the last argument day of the term in late April — in fact, the court scheduled a new last day for the immunity case. The July 1 ruling came on the final decision day of the term, months out from the presidential election whose outcome could lead to Trump crushing his federal cases if he wins.  It was a 6-3 ruling, with Republican appointees in the majority, though Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett disagreed with part of Roberts’ opinion that curbed the use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of private conduct. That part of the ruling has called into question Trump’s New York state guilty verdicts, which weren’t at issue in his federal election interference appeal. President Joe Biden just called for a constitutional amendment — the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment” — to counteract the ruling. So, what does Roberts’ handling of the immunity appeal tell us about him and his court? Biskupic wrote that the chief justice “appears to have abandoned his usual institutional concerns.” That’s one way to look at it.  Another is that his institutionalist reputation has long been overblown, at least when it comes to his rulings — which, to be sure, haven’t always represented the furthest right flank of the court, such as his concurring opinion in Dobbs, which wouldn’t have overturned Roe v. Wade; the other five Republican-appointed justices accomplished that without him. But that may say more about the fact that this far-right court doesn’t need Roberts’ vote to achieve its ends. The immunity episode, then, suggests that the chief justice is not only eager to be in on the court’s rightward march but wants to lead the way.

Trump pressed for answers after saying supporters ‘won’t have to vote’ again,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 8:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pressed-answers-saying-supporters-wont-vote-rcna164264,"Given Donald Trump’s apparent discomfort with being described as a threat to American democracy, it’s tempting to think the former president would be cautious when talking about voting and elections. And yet the Republican is doing largely the opposite. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly said that he and his political operation “don’t need” votes — a curious comment from a candidate for public office — which has dovetailed with his latest comments that his Christian supporters “won’t have to vote anymore“ if he wins a second term. It was against this backdrop that the GOP nominee sat down yesterday with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, who offered Trump multiple opportunities to clarify matters and explain what he meant. It didn’t go especially well. The host began by saying Trump’s critics are “attacking” him for “ridiculous reasons,” adding, “They’re saying that you said to a crowd of Christians that they won’t have to vote in the future.” Of course, “they” are saying that because Trump really did tell a Christian audience that that they won’t have to vote in the future. Nevertheless, the Republican initially responded by talking about his popularity with Christian voters, before shifting his attention to Jewish voters. Eventually, he doubled down on his controversial comments, explaining that Christians “won’t have to vote anymore” after he’s done “straightening out the country.” It appeared as if the Fox anchor simply wanted Trump to say that he supports democracy and future elections, but the former president apparently didn’t get the hint. On the contrary, he largely echoed the same point all over again, saying that his “simple” message to Christian voters is, “You have to vote on November 5th. After that, you don’t have to worry about voting anymore.” At that point, Trump added, “We won’t even need your vote anymore.” It would’ve been very easy for him to say, “Of course we’ll have elections in the future, and of course Americans will be encouraged to participate in their own democratic system.” But that’s not what he said — despite having opportunities to do so. Following up on our coverage from yesterday, one possible interpretation of Trump’s rhetoric is that he wants the public to believe that by the end of his prospective second term, his far-right vision will be so entrenched in the American system that it will be effectively election-proof. MAGA world will endure for the indefinite future, the argument goes, so whether the Republican’s followers vote or not in 2028 will be irrelevant — because there will be nothing Democrats can do to reverse what’s been done. The less charitable interpretation is that Trump envisions a future without elections. For his part, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas insisted on Sunday that the former president was “obviously making a joke“ with his controversial comments. At no point during Trump’s interview with Fox’s Ingraham did he say he was kidding."
Kamala Harris might have an opening on the economy that Biden didn't,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 7:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-poll-economy-inflation-rcna164099,"A number of early surveys measuring the popularity of Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, look promising for her and her party. Several show Harris quickly surpassing President Joe Biden when pitted against former President Donald Trump in the polls. But one data point in particular has me feeling optimistic about Harris’ odds. A snap poll conducted by Democratic pollster Blueprint immediately after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris found that registered voters were split 50-50 on whether she or Trump would do a better job “bringing down prices” on goods and services. “The upside for Harris is huge: Voters do not hold her accountable for Biden’s perceived failures on inflation, and she can run hard on economic messaging,” Blueprint lead pollster Evan Roth Smith told Semafor. To use a Bidenism, this is a big f---ing deal.  Harris coming in even with Trump on inflation might not sound all that positive, but it is. Countless polls have shown that Biden was weak against Trump on the economy, and specifically on inflation. Biden struggled to win back voter trust on the economy, despite the fact that inflation has dissipated, wages have grown and the economy is by many metrics, including the unemployment rate, very strong. It seems that, for at least some of the electorate, the memory of high inflation earlier in Biden’s term stuck to him and was hard to shake off, particularly as housing inflation remains high.  But it looks like Harris might have a chance to instantly shed Biden’s second-biggest political liability — behind only questions about his mental acuity. Harris getting an opportunity to reset the Democrats on the economy is an especially big deal because it looms particularly large in the eyes of undecided voters who could play a decisive role in the election. While Biden’s ""defense of democracy"" narrative played well with the plugged-in Democratic base, less politically engaged voters are more focused on their pocketbooks. If Harris is seen as either not responsible for or less responsible for inflation, it could make them more receptive to her pitch on economic issues. Republicans are starting to roll out attacks on Harris as liable for inflation during Biden’s term; it’s unclear how much of it will stick. Inflation has been notably absent from Harris’ opening case to voters in speeches and her first campaign video. It’s possible she wants to avoid drawing attention to the issue during the initial phase of her campaign, during which she wants to focus in positive terms about her vision for the country and exploit a honeymoon period with the press and the electorate.  But she won’t be able to avoid it indefinitely. Harris will need to settle upon strategies for discussing the Biden administration’s record on the issue; unveil her policy plan to address concerns that some costs remain too high (especially housing) or fears that high inflation could return; and determine whether she will home in on Trump’s extremist tariff plans as inflationary. There are no easy answers here, as the Harris campaign will have to balance trying to focus on narratives that most naturally play to her strengths against addressing voter concerns. But her performance in the polls suggest that there’s a window for her to make a case that Biden couldn’t."
GOP leaders make odd choices for task force on Trump rally shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 7:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-leaders-make-odd-choices-task-force-trump-rally-shooting-rcna164254,"During his relatively brief tenure as Congress’ top Republican, House Speaker Mike Johnson has confronted a couple of important personnel challenges. The first came several weeks ago when the Louisiana congressman had to choose two new members of the House Intelligence Committee — and as members of both parties came to agree, Johnson did not choose wisely. His second personnel challenge came this week, and by some measures, the House speaker’s newest failure was even more dramatic than his first. The Washington Post reported: To be sure, there is no controversy surrounding the existence of this new congressional task force. There’s broad support for investigating the attempt on Trump’s life, and the official inquiry will move forward with bipartisan backing. But as the process advances, it’s worth pausing to consider who Johnson appointed to the panel. Indeed, it’s difficult to pick which of the task force’s GOP members is the most controversial. Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, for example, is an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and who’s also faced some unfortunate ethics questions. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee is also an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, and his right-wing background was so controversial in 2017 that the Senate wouldn’t confirm him when Trump nominated him to serve as secretary of the Army. The panel will be chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, who, in addition to being an election denier who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential race, is also up to his ears in the fake elector scandal; has accused Barack Obama of running a secret “shadow government”; and initially responded to the recent assassination attempt targeting Trump by describing it without evidence as an “attack from the left.” But perhaps most notable of all is Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana — an election denier who’s also taken a leading role in concocting deeply weird conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, including bizarre allegations related to the FBI and “ghost buses.” As a recent New York Times report summarized, “Even by a conspiracy theorist’s standards, the wild claims made by Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, stand out.” Some might see this and question the relevance. Perhaps, the argument goes, these House Republicans pushed ridiculous conspiracy theories related to the 2020 elections and the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, but this investigation is about the shooting that nearly killed Trump. It is, some might argue, an entirely unrelated matter. Perhaps, but judgment matters. The shooting in Pennsylvania was deadly serious and deserves to be scrutinized by credible and responsible members of Congress who care about evidence and reality. The goal is to produce findings that the American public will be able to believe. For Johnson to choose fringe figures such as Higgins for this task force was an avoidable mistake."
Mark Meadows cites Trump immunity ruling in his own Supreme Court appeal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 6:53 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/meadows-cites-trump-immunity-ruling-supreme-court-rcna164160,"The full effect of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling on Donald Trump’s criminal cases isn’t yet known, saying nothing of its implications for the future of the presidency and the country. But while the application of Trump v. United States is slowly playing out in the GOP presidential nominee’s cases, another beneficiary of the ruling may be his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Meadows cites the July 1 ruling several times in his new Supreme Court petition, seeking the justices’ help in moving his Georgia state 2020 election interference case to federal court. Both the federal trial and appeals courts rejected Meadows’ claim, with the latter deciding that federal officer removal isn’t even available to former officers like Meadows and that, even if it was, his Georgia charges don’t relate to his official duties so he needs to stay in state court. Represented by top conservative lawyer Paul Clement at the Supreme Court, Meadows calls the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling “egregiously wrong, wholly unprecedented, and exceptionally dangerous,” arguing that “what matters is a federal officer’s status at the time of the conduct at issue, not her status at the time the prosecutor or plaintiff gets around to filing suit.” Even before the high court majority bestowed broad immunity on his former boss, there was reason to think that the justices might take interest in Meadows’ case. The 11th Circuit admittedly broke new ground in its ruling, with the three-judge appeals court panel acknowledging that “in the 190-year history of the federal-officer removal statute, no court has ruled that former officers are excluded from removal.” Notably, that appellate ruling was authored by a jurist well-respected in conservative circles, the circuit’s chief judge, William Pryor. Also notable is that the two Democratic-appointed judges on the panel agreed with the legal outcome but wrote separately to lament the “nightmare scenario” of not extending removal to former officers, arguing that “not extending the federal-officer removal statute to former officers for prosecutions based on their official actions during their tenure is bad policy, and it represents a potential threat to our republic’s stability.” To be sure, they noted that Meadows’ case still shouldn’t go to federal court even if former officers could get removal, because he “has not established that the State has charged him for or relating to an act under color of his office as White House chief of staff.” Nonetheless, to address their broader concerns, they called on Congress to amend the law to expressly include former officers. “The far better course is for this Court to intervene,” Meadows urged the justices in the petition, citing the Trump immunity ruling for, among other things, the proposition that “federal protections cannot prevent the distortion of federal decisionmaking by current officeholders if they expire as soon as they leave office, as this Court reiterated just this past Term.” The Georgia state prosecution brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis against Trump, Meadows (they’ve both pleaded not guilty) and others is currently on hold pending a separate pretrial appeal over the defense attempt to disqualify Willis. Meadows’ petition adds yet another wrinkle if the justices’ agree to review his appeal. Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for updates and expert analysis on the top legal stories.

Arizona mayor becomes the latest Republican to back Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 6:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/arizona-mayor-becomes-latest-republican-back-harris-rcna164241,"Vice President Kamala Harris picked up endorsements this week from several mayors of border towns in Arizona, but one new endorsement from the Grand Canyon State stood out from the rest. John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona’s third-largest city, endorsed the Democrat in an op-ed for The Arizona Republic, despite the fact that Giles is a Republican. The mayor described Harris as “the competent, just and fair leader our country deserves,” while describing Trump as “a felon” and “a serious threat to our nation.” Giles went on to write, “I believe my party has a moral and ethical responsibility to restore faith in our democratic institutions. In the spirit of the late Sen. John McCain’s motto, ‘Country First,’ I call on other Arizona Republicans to join me in choosing country over party this election and to vote against Donald Trump.” This announcement comes on the heels of a similar endorsement from former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a lifelong Republican who threw his support behind Harris last week. For the vice president, this isn’t a bad start. After all, Harris has only been a candidate for nine days, and given the state of the cotemporary GOP, it’s not easy for any Democratic candidate to pick up cross-party backing. Looking ahead, though, it’s only natural to wonder whether Giles and Duncan represent the start of a trend or whether they’ll be 2024 outliers. Before President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, he’d picked up some Republican backing, including a high-profile endorsement from former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson also encouraged people to vote for the Democratic incumbent, and former deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews made a similar announcement. As best as I can tell, they haven’t yet thrown their support behind Harris, though it wouldn’t come as too big of a surprise if they did. But will other Republicans follow suit? I kept a close eye on this dynamic four years ago and found quite a few GOP partisans — former Republican National Committee chairs, former Republican cabinet secretaries, former Republican governors and former Republican members of Congress — who publicly expressed support for the Biden-led Democratic ticket. As Election Day 2024 approaches, they are likely to face some pressure to do the same this year. Watch this space."
Where exactly do Trump's remaining criminal cases stand?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 30, 2024, 6:16 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-legal-cases-where-they-stand-rcna163832,"July 2024 might better be remembered as the month in American politics that felt like a year: Former President Donald Trump avoided an assassination attempt and named his vice presidential nominee in a series of days; his then-political rival withdrew from the 2024 race and endorsed his own vice president. But focusing only on politics ignores a pair of massive developments in special counsel Jack Smith’s two federal criminal cases against Trump, which are expected to end if Trump is re-elected. Still, while both cases have hit serious roadblocks, neither is over by a long shot. Here’s where the federal cases stand: In Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon ruled this month that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s November 2022 appointment of Smith as special counsel and the Justice Department’s funding of the special counsel office’s expenses were inconsistent with not one, but two provisions of Article II of the Constitution: the so-called Appointments and Appropriations Clauses. Therefore, Cannon held that the case could not continue, regardless of whether Trump’s other objections were valid. Smith's office has made clear how and where it plans to forge ahead. Specifically, with the blessing of the DOJ, the special counsel filed an appeal of Cannon’s July 15 order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which oversees federal trial courts in Florida, as well as Alabama and Georgia.  Some legal experts, including former federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst Mary McCord, had argued that having the DOJ reindict the case would be the best and most expeditious way to get that case back on track. But according to former U.S. attorney and MSNBC legal analyst Joyce Vance, “If the special counsel pursues the appeal, the DOJ is extremely unlikely to reindict during its pendency, among other reasons because it would likely moot the appeal.” Note also that to date, Smith's office has only filed a notice of appeal, which is like a declaration of its intent. The actual brief is not due until Aug. 27. Currently, Trump’s opposition to the appeal is due 30 days thereafter, and the special counsel can submit a reply 21 days after that. With briefing ending in mid-October and no oral argument date set, it is unlikely the 11th Circuit would issue an opinion before the election — and to date, the special counsel’s office has not asked the court to expedite briefing and consideration of the appeal. Yet in 2022, Smith requested — and got — an expedited briefing when he successfully appealed Cannon’s appointment of a special master to review materials seized at Mar-a-Lago in August of that year. The time frame for Smith's appeal could be equally critical here. The bottom line: The Mar-a-Lago documents case is over for now — but it could come back with a vengeance after the 11th Circuit rules, assuming Trump is not back in the Oval Office by then. While the classified documents case awaits appellate briefing, the federal election interference case pending in Washington, D.C., before Judge Tanya Chutkan has yet to be restarted after the Supreme Court’s broad immunity decision in Trump v. United States. But that case is widely expected to be curtailed. For example, the majority opinion holds unambiguously that Trump is “absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.” Therefore, going forward, legal experts expect neither the charges themselves nor the evidence can refer to Trump’s conversations with then-Attorney General Bill Barr; his acting successor, Jeffrey Rosen, and Rosen’s deputy, Rich Donoghue; and even Trump’s alleged co-conspirator, then-acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark. Yet the Supreme Court was equally clear that sorting through when immunity applies to the remainder of the indictment, at least “in the first instance,” is a job for Chutkan. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, she must: The court therefore ordered that the case be remanded — or returned — to Chutkan to determine whether these categories of alleged conduct are official or unofficial, and if official, whether the presumption of immunity can be rebutted. What form that process will take has yet to be resolved. Some legal experts believe the Supreme Court’s repeated references to “factbound” or “fact specific” analyses require Chutkan to hold one or more evidentiary hearings ""replete with important witness testimony,"" as MSNBC legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann has written. After all, in classifying Trump’s public statements and tweets on and about Jan. 6, the Supreme Court noted that Chutkan could find relevant “what else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally.” That sort of information is not evident from the indictment and would require additional proof. On the other hand, other aspects of the task thrust into Chutkan’s hands seem to lend themselves to a more straightforward, albeit close, reading of the indictment, supplemented by briefs from the parties, as the Supreme Court suggests. Public reporting also indicates Trump's team intends to argue that Chutkan can resolve which conduct is and is not immune ""based on legal arguments alone, negating the need for witnesses or multiple evidentiary hearings,"" which could be embarrassing or even politically damaging to Trump as he again campaigns for the presidency. But no matter how Chutkan intends to move ahead, she cannot start quite yet. Rather, a Supreme Court rule provides that unless the whole court or an individual justice orders or the parties themselves agree otherwise, a case does not come back to the trial court for 32 days after the judgment is entered. The special counsel did not plan to ask the Supreme Court to expedite that timing, NBC News reported earlier this month. Still, why wouldn't the special counsel attempt to revive the case more quickly? Some believe that in lieu of delving into an extensive fight over which allegations and charges can be leveled against Trump, Smith’s office might first attempt to narrow its case by streamlining its indictment. That could mean substituting a new or superseding indictment for the existing one, but it’s not as simple as merely preparing a revised document. Instead, Smith would need a grand jury to review and approve such an indictment. Experts note that given the extensive testimony previously presented, prosecutors would not need to recall witnesses. A so-called summary witness, such as an FBI agent assigned to the case, could read relevant excerpts of such testimony to a grand jury, for example.  But in any event, the case will not be sent back to Chutkan earlier than Aug. 2. And in February, during a hearing in another Jan. 6-related case, Chutkan revealed plans to be out of the country days later, on Aug. 5, unless the Trump trial were ongoing then. A review of publicly available court calendars reflects that Chutkan does not have any scheduled matters next month until Aug. 15. Assuming, however, that Chutkan does convene some form of public hearing in mid-August or shortly thereafter, the contours of what would transpire at such a conference, or whether any briefing will be ordered in advance, remains unclear. Moreover, some reports suggest Trump’s lawyers intend to file other pretrial motions unrelated to immunity once Chutkan retakes the reins. For example, despite successfully litigating the issue before Cannon, Trump’s team never moved to dismiss the Washington case on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed and that his office was unlawfully funded. That could be because, in 2019, the D.C. Circuit rejected nearly identical arguments concerning the appointment of then-special counsel Robert Mueller. Nonetheless, at oral argument in the presidential immunity case, Trump lawyer John Sauer intimated it was just a question of timing: ""We hadn't raised it yet in this case when this case went up on appeal."" Given Trump's potential challenge to Smith's very authority to indict Trump in Washington and with Chutkan perhaps not assuming control of the case again for several more weeks, it's not clear that the evidentiary hearings some think are warranted will happen any time soon. In fact, Chutkan holding any evidentiary hearing at all before year’s end might be a feat of judicial oversight and control in and of itself.  The bottom line: Though the federal election interference case has technically survived the Supreme Court’s ruling, that decision will almost certainly bog the case down with legal wrangling over the coming months. And whether even a slimmed-down case progresses will hinge on further appeals and the election itself, because if Trump wins in November, this case is effectively over."
‘Duckin’ Don’: Team Harris ridicules Trump over new debate dodge,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/duckin-don-team-harris-ridicules-trump-new-debate-dodge-2024-election-rcna164227,"It was nearly three months ago when Donald Trump and his campaign team agreed to participate in some presidential debates, including an event on Sept. 10, shortly before early voting begins in some states. At the time, of course, the Republican and his political operation assumed he’d share a stage with President Joe Biden. They now know better — and their willingness to honor the original schedule is, at a minimum, in flux. Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed-upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’d been a candidate for less than a week. The likely Democratic nominee went a little further yesterday, explaining that she will, in fact, be on the stage for the event, whether her GOP rival agrees to participate or not. “We’ll see if Trump shows,” Harris’ spokesperson added. As things stand, the odds of Trump agreeing to another general election debate aren’t great. The Associated Press reported on the former president’s latest comments on the subject, aired last night on Fox News. Fox’s Laura Ingraham pressed him on this point several times, and the Republican nominee kept hedging. Trump said he “likes” debating and “wants” to debate Harris, before adding, “But I also can say this: Everybody knows who I am.” When the host asked, “Why not debate her?” Trump didn’t contest the premise of the question. He instead replied, “Because [voters] already know everything.” The former president added that if he agreed to the Sept. 10 debate, it would “reward fake news,” and he’s against making ABC News “rich.” These were not the words of someone who seems eager to share a debate stage with Harris. With this in mind, let’s recap recent events. July 21: Within hours of Biden ending his 2024 candidacy, Trump started hedging on a possible debate and complaining about ABC News, despite the fact that his campaign team had already agreed to have ABC News host the next event. July 23: Trump doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later in the day, he told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate Harris, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything.” July 25: Aides to Trump said they wouldn’t commit to another debate. July 29: Trump appeared on Fox News and hedged some more, arguing that he “can also make a case for not doing it.” After the interview aired, the Harris campaign issued a press release with a headline that referred to the former president as “Duckin’ Don.” The statement from the vice president’s spokesperson added, “Why won’t Donald Trump give a straight answer on debating Vice President Harris? It’s clear from tonight’s question-dodging: He’s scared he’ll have to defend his running mate’s weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president. Vice President Harris will be on the debate stage September 10th. Donald Trump can show up, or not.” This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Kamala Harris got Democrats excited. Mark Kelly can help them win.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-running-mate-arizona-vet-mark-kelly-rcna164194,"The last few weeks have given the country a massive dose of perspective. From the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden’s stepping aside, politicians and voters have endured weeks of political turmoil.   Now, with the Democratic nomination in her sights, all eyes turn to Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate search.  Outside of finding a Republican like former Rep. Adam Kinzinger or an unaffiliated leader like Adm. William McRaven, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is the best pick for the Democrats — especially if they want to attract incredibly important independent voters. First off, Kelly is a Navy combat pilot with significant military experience. That is big. Plus, he’s an astronaut, which means bipartisan respect and exciting star power (and cool stories). He’s more than prepared to be commander in chief if called upon. But despite his decades of leadership, Kelly isn’t a Washington insider.  Kelly is from Arizona, of course, and would bring a somewhat maverick spirit to the ticket in the style of fellow Arizonan John McCain. He is married to the universally beloved and politically experienced former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He’s a straight, white, tough man who can talk guns, abortion and the border, and he is moderate by modern Democratic Party standards — which is critical.  I’ve met Kelly; he’s the real deal as a human. He would be a powerful contrast to the sketchiness of Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. And both Vance and Trump would have a hard time landing blows against this American hero.  Overall (and perhaps most of all), Kelly is the closest to an independent or Republican option among the reported finalists. That may not make the more progressive wing of the party happy, but ultimately the trade-off should be worth it.   In 2020, Democrats did the right thing to win. They picked Biden over some of the more progressive options like Sen. Bernie Sanders and selected Harris for balance. She was a key part of a ticket that needed to mobilize and inspire.  This year is different. Many Democrats are already excited about Harris’ surprise top billing. Some Republicans are, too. But emotion isn’t enough. In June, before Biden stepped aside, polls showed that a quarter of Americans had unfavorable views of both candidates. In 2022, the majority of millennials and Gen Zers old enough to vote identified as independent — a significant antiestablishment rebellion that shows no signs of reversing. At the end of this month, Gallup reported that 41% of all respondents identified as “independent.” (Of these independent respondents, slightly more lean Republican than Democrat.) Winning over these millions of independent-minded voters — especially in swing states — could very well determine the outcome of the election. I didn’t think Harris was Democrats’ best option to replace Biden, especially in the context of an increasingly independent voting population. And she still has some very key weaknesses — namely a lack of military experience and high negatives with both independents and Republicans — that must be offset.  More than any other option floated, Capt. Mark Kelly offsets those weaknesses. Harris is clearly getting Democrats excited. But adding Kelly would mean maybe they can win. Just maybe. Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here and the case for Josh Shapiro here."
This billionaire Democrat’s brazen suggestion puts Kamala Harris in a lose-lose situation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-linkedin-reid-hoffman-ftc-chair-lina-khan-rcna163897,"LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has a request for Vice President Kamala Harris, should she become president: replace Lina Khan as head of the Federal Trade Commission. Khan is “waging war on American business,” he told CNN last week. Hoffman, to be clear, is not just another man with an opinion. The billionaire and political megadonor donated $10 million to the Biden-Harris campaign, pushed his peers to do the same and is planning on a major fundraising push in Silicon Valley for Harris. And his public demand to oust Khan is the latest sign America’s billionaires need to be reminded that government policy shouldn’t be dictated by those with the largest checkbook.   The Biden administration has been the most pro-worker and pro-consumer presidential administration in decades. That charge has been led, in part, by Khan. In her tenure as FTC chair, Khan has spearheaded efforts to block mergers that could result in monopolies in sectors ranging from big tech to grocery stores, and she has stood up for worker rights by moving to ban widely reviled noncompete agreements. It’s no surprise then that after Hoffman made his demand, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the Service Employees International Union came to Khan’s defense. This is a very democratic — with a small d — agenda. It is about freedom — the freedom to start a business and not worry about anti-competitive practices from deep-pocketed rivals, the freedom from unaccountable businesses that have no market incentives to worry about the needs and rights of their customers, and the freedom for workers to move jobs as they wish. It also happens to be a popular agenda — that is, with everyone but the most powerful. Khan’s pro-consumer, pro-worker, anti-monopoly agenda has attracted no small amount of hate from powerful and monied interests. Since Khan became FTC chair just over three years ago, the Wall Street Journal opinion page has printed more than 100 opinion pieces ranting about her record — an average of one screed every 11 days. Billionaires regularly take to CNBC to complain about her record; on Monday, media mogul Barry Diller referred to her as “a dope” and said that, if Harris wins, he would lobby her for Khan’s removal. These plutocrats are speaking up, in part, because Harris’ opinions on Khan are largely unknown. But their opening and influence would be much less if it wasn’t for our campaign financing system, which privileges access to money over the power of the ballot box. A study by Martin Gilens at Princeton University and Benjamin Page at Northwestern University confirmed that government action is much more likely to reflect the wants and sentiments of wealthy Americans and corporate interests than actual majority sentiment. Americans hate this reality. It’s a large part of why former President Donald Trump was able to ride “drain the swamp” to the White House in 2016. But it’s also a part of the reason he got tossed in 2020. Instead of draining the swamp, he appointed the wealthiest Cabinet in American history and opened up the spigots for those who sought to influence his administration. But the power of the corporate purse also helps explain why Democrats quickly embraced any business leader who spoke up and took on Trump. Seeking allies against Trump, it was a natural next step to elevate prominent business leaders who said they didn’t support his administration or re-election. Anti-Trump forces even celebrated Elon Musk when he resigned from a Trump business advisory council after the former president walked away from the Paris climate accords. As we know, Musk soon resumed his right-ward trajectory. Others who were quick to condemn Trump in the wake of Jan. 6, have also made their way back to supporting the former president, seemingly because he’s promising tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Money talks in both our culture and, the more money, the louder the voice. Take, for example, how voter concerns about Biden’s advanced age were largely ignored — until, that is, his shocking June debate performance led donors who had previously backed Biden’s re-election effort to shut their wallets. As for Trump, he barely mentions “drain the swamp” these days. He instead is campaigning on a grab bag of grievances, even as he privately visits major donors, tin cup in one hand and a for-sale sign in the other. Earlier this year, according to The Washington Post, he all but promised to do away with a laundry list of policies and regulations reviled by the fossil fuel companies if, in turn, their executives raised $1 billion for his campaign. All this explains why the wealthiest Americans are increasingly used to getting their way no matter what party is in charge — and why they are so quick to get offended when thwarted.   Hoffman’s got other beefs too — he’s also made it known he would like to see tariffs imposed under both Trump and Biden rolled back. Taken together, this brazenness leaves Harris in a terrible position. While she should keep Khan on, if she wins and decides, for whatever reason, to replace the current FTC chair, it will look like she is doing the bidding of billionaires. Calls for Harris to return Hoffman’s money, on the other hand, don’t solve the underlying problem either. Not only would it be hard to know what to give back, but Hoffman's case raises contributions from many other donors. And the real issue is that the legalized corruption that is the U.S. campaign financing system is hardly a way to run an effective and democratic government. Until that changes, nothing else will. "
The ridiculous moral panic over the Olympics’ opening ceremony,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 5:51 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/olympics-2024-apology-christians-last-supper-elon-musk-mike-johnson-rcna164008,"The moral panic over a scene of drag queens feasting at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics set off a firestorm of outrage from religious conservatives and politicians who believed the scene was a mockery of the Last Supper. Except it wasn’t about the Last Supper at all.  The so-called re-enactment was a scene of a bacchanal, a feast to the Greek god Dionysus. After all, the Olympics originated in ancient Greece, and the Greek gods were a part of the culture of that time. French director Thomas Jolly, who oversaw the opening ceremony show, explained that the scene was Dionysus arriving on a table and that it was meant to be representative of the gods of Olympus celebrating the Olympic Games. Tell that, though, to those unable to see the scene outside the lens of their conservative religious convictions. They inserted those beliefs into an Olympic celebration put on by the country that had a whole revolution against the oppression of the monarchy and Christianity. Criticisms arose from figures such as Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Barron, who took to X to condemn the scene. French Catholic bishops, who really ought to have known better, complained about the “mocking” of Christianity, and some Greek Orthodox Church representatives condemned the opening of the Olympics as “blasphemous.” Churches weren’t the only ones complaining. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform X, also panned the depiction of the drag queens. C-Spire, a tech company, announced that it was pulling its advertising during the Olympics because of the scene. The organizers of the Olympics apologized, saying that they didn’t mean any disrespect for the Christian faith but rather that they wanted to emphasize tolerance. Tolerance, sadly, isn’t what conservatives are noted for, especially since many of them deemed the 2024 Olympics “woke.” It is fascinating and understandable that the Christians and others who condemned the scene automatically went to the Last Supper as their reference point. Much of their worldview is limited and doesn’t consider views that fall outside their faith. First, the classical image of the Last Supper comes from da Vinci’s painting. It doesn’t represent the reality of what the Last Supper looked like. The confusion and misplaced anger over the scene tell us a lot more about conservative Christians and others than perhaps they want us to know. Moral panics like this one demand immediate strong denunciations and lamentations about the decline of morality and society. Moral panics are designed to take control of any narratives in society that are deemed evil or sinful. In this case, drag queens have been the cause of a political and religious firestorm not only in America, but also in conservative religious nations worldwide. Second, the fact that Christians immediately identified the scene as being the Last Supper suggests an intellectual simplicity and a knee-jerk reaction. Had any of these critics looked closely at the tableau, it didn’t resemble da Vinci’s Last Supper at all! The number of people at the table didn’t even match the 13 who would have been Jesus and his disciples. Their immediate gut-level response was telling. Not understanding the allusions to Greek mythology or the origins of the Olympic Games and their cultural context suggests that the book-burning, anti-history contingent of religious conservatives has coincided with their ignorance of art, culture, history and society. The Olympics are being held in Paris! There’s a reason there was a whole scene filled with headless Marie Antoinettes at the very prison in which she was held, listening to Gojira’s heavy metal music. It’s France, folks. It dealt with conservative religion and monarchy in its history in decisive and bloody ways. Curiously, religious conservatives didn’t have much to say about the menage a trois scene that was also included in the opening ceremony. Perhaps that wasn’t as sacrilegious to them as drag queens having a bacchanalia. The outrage surrounding this particular scene at the opening ceremony reveals several important things about conservative religion and politics at the present moment. One, trans persons and queer people continue to be the subject of ire and persecution from conservative religions. Sexuality is often the first place for persecution in societies that have conservative factions in majority politics. It also signals intolerance for not only these people, but also for the cultural context of the nation France. This particular level of criticism against France isn’t new — remember freedom fries from the Iraqi War? That didn’t last long, and I suspect this new moral panic won’t last over the course of the Olympics. After all, the outrage only shows just how limited in scope their imaginations are."
Dobbs was 'just the beginning:' Inside Project 2025's attack on abortion,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 3:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-abortion-trump-rcna164125,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 28 episode of ""Velshi."" Abortion is mentioned 199 times throughout Project 2025 — the Heritage Foundation's ambitious 920-page blueprint for a possible second Donald Trump administration. The forward reads in part: Along with suggesting that the Department of Health and Human Services should instead be known as “the Department of Life,"" the recommendations in Project 2025 target every aspect of reproductive health care. When it comes to medication abortion, the mandate states, “Abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world. ... [The] FDA should therefore: Reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the politicized approval process was illegal from the start.” But it's not just medication abortion that they’re going after. Project 2025 also aims to eliminate both the morning-after pill — which is emergency birth control — and men’s contraceptives, from Affordable Care Act coverage. On page 458, the mandate also suggests cracking down on what the document refers to as “mail order abortion,"" which would entail using the Comstock Act, a law from the 19th century, to prosecute people who send abortion pills — or potentially anything affiliated with abortion, like other medical supplies — by mail. On Page 455, Project 2025 lays out a plan to curb what it calls “abortion tourism,"" or instances in which women must travel to other states to seek medical care that is banned in their home state. It recommends the CDC implement mandatory data collection for all abortions nationwide — literally tracking and surveilling women who choose to get abortions. The plan also threatens to cut funding to any state that resists such surveillance. The mandate also spells out the specifics around emergency intervention, stating that emergency rooms have a legal obligation to protect the life of the fetus: “EMTALA — or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act — requires no abortions, preempts no pro-life state laws, and explicitly requires stabilization of the unborn child.”  In other words, Project 2025 says that in an emergency, when an abortion would save the life of the pregnant person, medical personnel are not required to perform that life-saving abortion. Now, I want to be clear about this: You may see claims that Project 2025 is taking a more moderate stance on abortion. You may hear that Project 2025 doesn’t call for a national abortion ban, or that it calls for differentiation between miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and elective abortion. But do not be fooled. Project 2025’s section on the HSS reads, in part, “The Secretary should pursue a robust agenda to protect the fundamental right to life. ... From the moment of conception, every human being possesses inherent dignity and worth. ... Abortion and euthanasia are not health care.” Littered throughout the 900-page Project 2025 mandate is the repeated declaration that life begins at conception — an idea also known as fetal personhood. Fetal personhood insists that, from the moment of conception, a fertilized egg is a person, endowed with the same rights as you and I. That claim strikes at the heart of everything I’ve listed above. Laws that establish fetal personhood, laws that mandate doctors to treat fetuses even when the pregnant person’s life is at risk — in practice, those laws are abortion bans. Full stop. Any policy that declares “life begins at conception” is an abortion ban for all intents and purposes and will result, in practice, in miscarriage patients being denied care that is needed to save their lives. That is not a guess. That is a fact. We are living in a post-Roe country now and we've seen it happen over and over again. Right now, abortion is banned in 21 states, with total bans in place in 14. Depending on where you live, there are varying exceptions — Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Mississippi, for instance, claim to allow exceptions to their abortion bans to save the life of the mother but not to save the health of the mother. That puts doctors in impossible positions — legally unable to perform an abortion, a necessary medical procedure, and forced to watch patients become sicker and sicker until they reach death’s door before they can move forward. Women who are miscarrying very often need abortions to save their lives, health and future fertility. Take the case of Amanda Zurawski in Texas. During her planned and wanted pregnancy, Amanda developed a condition that meant her fetus wasn't going to survive. The standard medical procedure for her condition was to terminate the pregnancy by performing a dilation and curettage — commonly referred to as a D&C. Also known as an abortion. Without an abortion, Amanda was at risk of developing a serious, potentially fatal infection. But her doctors said they couldn’t perform the procedure under Texas law because her nonviable fetus still had a heartbeat. She was told she wasn’t sick enough and she would have to wait. Days later, Amanda developed the infection she was warned she might get. She went into septic shock. Once her doctors finally performed the abortion, Amanda’s uterus and fallopian tubes were severely scarred. One of her fallopian tubes is now permanently blocked. Amanda sued the state of Texas in a lawsuit that eventually grew to include 20 women, many of whom experienced life or health-threatening complications due to the state's abortion ban. Earlier this summer, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Amanda and the other women. That's the reality of extreme abortion bans. That's the reality of living under governments that push fetal personhood. And that's the plan under Project 2025. As they state so clearly: The Dobbs decision is just the beginning."

Election officials declared President Nicolás Maduro the winner over opposition candidate Edmundo González early Monday during a press conference on Venezuelan state television.” * In the Middle East, on Saturday: “A rocket strike Saturday at a soccer field killed at least 11 children and teens, Israeli authorities said, in the deadliest strike on an Israeli target along the country’s northern border since the fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began. It raised fears of a broader regional war.” * In the Middle East, on Sunday: “Western diplomats were scrambling on Sunday to prevent a surge of fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border, officials said, after a rocket from Lebanon on Saturday killed at least 12 children and teenagers in an Israeli-controlled town. The rocket prompted Israel to retaliate early Sunday with strikes across Lebanon.” * In Ukraine: “The U.S. will send $1.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine, officials announced on Monday, including an array of munitions for air defense systems, artillery, mortars and anti-tank and anti-ship missiles. The package includes $1.5 billion in funding for long-term contracts through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $200 million in immediate military aid taken from Pentagon stockpiles.” * In Iowa: “Iowa’s strict abortion law went into effect Monday, immediately prohibiting most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Iowa’s Republican leaders have been seeking the law for years and gained momentum after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Iowa Supreme Court also issued a ruling that year saying there was no constitutional right to abortion in the state.” * A case of interest: “Two former FBI officials settled lawsuits with the Justice Department on Friday, resolving claims that their privacy rights were violated when the department leaked to the news media text messages that they had sent one another that disparaged former President Donald Trump. Peter Strzok, a former top counterintelligence agent who played a crucial role in the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016, settled his case for $1.2 million. Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer who exchanged text messages with Strzok, also reached a separate settlement.

Steve Bannon steps closer to Supreme Court in seeking full circuit review,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 2:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/steve-bannon-contempt-supreme-court-rcna162120,"The Supreme Court last month rejected Steve Bannon’s bid to stay free while he appeals his contempt of Congress conviction. But lawyers for the former Trump White House adviser are still pressing the appeal while Bannon serves his four-month sentence, bringing the merits of his legal challenge a step closer to the justices. On Monday, Bannon’s lawyers asked the full federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., to rehear his challenge that a three-judge panel of that court rejected in May. Bannon was convicted in 2022 after failing to comply with a House. Jan. 6 committee subpoena under a federal law that criminalizes “willfully” failing to respond to a congressional subpoena. On appeal, Bannon argued that a conviction under that law requires proving bad faith and that his counsel advised him not to respond. But the federal appeals court panel cited D.C. Circuit precedent from 1961, Licavoli v. United States, to say that “willfully” only requires that the defendant deliberately and intentionally refused to comply with a congressional subpoena and that an advice of counsel defense doesn’t apply. The circuit panel also cited that precedent in rejecting Bannon’s motion to stay free while he appealed. Notably, one of the panel judges, Trump appointee Justin Walker, dissented from the release denial, saying that, while the circuit panel was bound by its precedent, the Supreme Court might take a different view. The Supreme Court then denied Bannon’s release bid last month and he reported to prison on July 1, but his underlying appeal is still pending. In his rehearing petition to the full circuit Monday, Bannon’s lawyers said the appeals court “should grant rehearing and eliminate Licavoli’s anomalous mens rea holding” — mens rea being the legal term for criminal intent. Even if the full circuit rejects Bannon, that could just be the next step on the appeal’s way to the justices. Yet, even if the high court ultimately agrees with Bannon, that wouldn’t likely happen before Bannon is released from prison, though he likely would still want his conviction reversed after he’s released. If the justices wanted to help the Trump ally, they could have granted his motion to stay free while he appealed. Nonetheless, they can still choose to get involved in the merits of the appeal even though they rejected his release bid. If the justices ultimately weigh in on the merits of the issue, the court’s ruling would affect not just Bannon but other congressional contempt cases, too. Another former Trump White House adviser, Peter Navarro, also has a pending contempt of Congress appeal in the D.C. Circuit. The justices similarly rejected his release-pending-appeal bid and he is due to be released from prison on Wednesday, after which he’s reportedly expected to speak at the Republican National Convention this week in Milwaukee. As with so much else, Bannon’s appeal is playing out against the backdrop of November’s presidential election. According to the federal Bureau of Prisons, he’s incarcerated in Danbury, Connecticut, and will be released on Oct. 29. At the end of his previous presidential term, Trump pardoned Bannon for separate federal crimes in the alleged “We Build the Wall” scheme, for which Bannon faces related New York state charges that presidents can’t pardon. Trump can’t be elected in time to spring Bannon from prison in his latest federal criminal case, but just as Trump is poised to get rid of his own federal cases if he returns to the White House, he could upend Bannon’s by pardoning him again.

The suspicious person, later identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was first flagged to local police officers by rallygoers on their way into the event. The attendees reported they saw Crooks pacing and behaving strangely near the magnetometers, four officials told NBC News.” * Expect a robust congressional investigation: “Members of Congress from both parties announced plans Monday to investigate how a shooter was able to get within striking distance of former President Donald Trump, demanding answers from the authorities responsible for protecting the Republican nominee for president.” * In Illinois: “Two failures of the Nashville Reservoir dam in Illinois amidst intense flooding Tuesday have led officials to urge residents in nearly 300 homes to evacuate.” * At the border: “Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico plunged 29% in June, the lowest month of Joe Biden’s presidency, according to figures released Monday that provide another window on the impact of a new rule to temporarily suspend asylum.” * Housing policy: “President Biden will unveil a new proposal in Nevada on Tuesday to cap rental costs nationwide, according to three people familiar with the matter. ... Biden’s plan — which would need to be approved by Congress — calls for stripping a tax benefit from landlords who increase their tenants’ rent more than 5 percent per year, the people said. The measure would only apply to landlords who own more than 50 units, which represents roughly half of all rental properties, the people said.” * Apparently, some folks have a real problem with trans people: “SpaceX CEO and X owner Elon Musk said Tuesday he will move the headquarters of both companies from California to Texas. Musk vowed the moves in response to Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) signing a new law on Tuesday that bars school districts in California from requiring parents to be notified of a child’s gender identification change.” * The effects of the Supreme Court’s poor judgment: “Federal prosecutors have begun moving to drop charges accusing Jan. 6 defendants of obstructing Congress’s confirmation of the 2020 presidential election results, offering new plea deals after the Supreme Court last month restricted the government’s use of that count, according to court filings. Some beneficiaries include members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys who are not accused of other felony offenses, but whose leaders were convicted of conspiring to use force to oppose the peaceful transfer of presidential power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.” See you tomorrow."
Marjorie Taylor Greene's RNC speech kicked off an extremist-friendly convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 1:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/marjorie-taylor-greene-rnc-speech-trump-rcna162176,"A lawmaker who mocked a school shooting victim, appeared to endorse political executions, and insisted she would have ""won"" if she had planned the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A lieutenant governor who claimed “some folks need killing” in an unhinged church rant.  An activist who said she’d like to ""lynch"" an election worker.  A podcaster who has platformed white nationalists and has criticized the Civil Rights Act.  Day 1 of the Republican National Convention on Monday put MAGA extremists in the spotlight. Anyone who believed conservative claims about this being an event focused on “unity” after the recent Trump rally shooting have been duped. Having Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene kick things off was a clear signal that this wasn’t going to be a kumbaya moment. And true to form, the Georgia Republican delivered a speech filled with falsities and far-right rhetoric, including anti-trans bigotry and anti-immigrant xenophobia falsely claiming immigrants have taken American-born workers' jobs.   Greene was followed by North Carolina Lt. Gov. and gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson, who’s well known for his racist, misogynistic and anti-LGBTQ diatribes and who recently earned even more backlash after being recorded telling North Carolina churchgoers that “some folks need killing” during a Christian nationalist rant. Robinson, who’s established a reputation for extremist rhetoric, delivered a speech at the RNC on Monday that focused mostly on the economy and fawning over Trump. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk tried a similar tactic. Kirk, whose organization has helped link far-right extremists to the Republican National Committee and Trump campaign, was a speaker as well. He's presented himself as the GOP’s youth whisperer and used his speech to sell young people on the idea that Trump would be better for their wallets than the Biden administration. Kirk claimed “Democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations” before falsely claiming young people were “richer than ever before” under Trump and that, as president, Trump “will do it again.”  Though they didn't make the speakers list, far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and election-denying pillow-pusher Mike Lindell were given a prominent spot at the convention to host Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast. (Bannon has to miss the RNC this year because he's in prison.) And one of the lesser-known extremists given a platform was Arizona delegate Shelby Busch, who cast her state's delegate votes for Trump on Monday night at the convention. Busch was the subject of a recent ReidOut Blog after she was recorded saying she’d lynch Maricopa County’s Republican recorder, Stephen Richer, if he were in the same room with her. Needless to say, this RNC isn’t shaping up to be the unifying event Republicans have tried to convince voters and the media it would be. Predictably, it’s just a hotbed of MAGA extremism. "
"In the GOP veepstakes, Trump again sidelines men of color",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-vice-president-republican-convention-2024-rcna159159,"It's ""always the bridesmaid, never the bride"" for some aspiring Republican lawmakers. Former President Donald Trump on Monday selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, forming one of the most extreme — and as my colleague Steve Benen noted, most inexperienced — tickets in modern American history. But let's consider some of the people Trump didn’t pick, in particular the Black and the Latino men who happily mortgaged their dignity and laundered Trump’s racism to remain in consideration as potential VP picks, only to be passed over in favor of a rich, white Yale Law School graduate with significantly less political experience than they have. I’m talking about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, who’ve been reduced effectively to token minorities through the process of Trump’s running mate selection.  Rubio, of course, had an acrimonious relationship with Trump during the GOP presidential primary in 2016 — one that got so petty that he resorted to mocking Trump’s, uh, hand size. Arguably, that was the moment that Rubio's political career peaked. “Little Marco,” as Trump once called him, has since joined the ranks of the former president’s unwavering supporters, recently defending Trump’s comments about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the United States as “nothing to do with race” during a Spanish-language interview.   Despite being passed over Monday, Rubio wasted no time in declaring his loyalty to the MAGA cause. Scott and Donalds didn’t fare any better. Donalds, who some pundits had suggested could have appealed to Black voters, was willing to distort history for the former president with his claim at a pro-Trump event that Black families were more ""together"" during the Jim Crow era than in the years that followed. (He later told MSNBC's Joy Reid that “I never said that it was better for Black people in Jim Crow.”) His ahistorical nonsense wasn't enough to earn a spot on the ticket, but Donalds nonetheless threw his support behind Trump-Vance on the opening night of the RNC.  Scott, for his part, was criticized for the moment when he embraced Trump in the middle of a speech to tell him how much he loved him. And you can read here about the misguided podcast that Scott launched with other Black Republicans earlier this year in an attempt to sway Black voters in Trump’s favor (despite not mentioning Trump in the first five episodes).  Like Rubio and Donalds, Scott got little to nothing in return for that effort but still stuck to the party's script, assuring the mostly white crowd of Republican convention attendees that “America is not a racist country.” One wonders if the three lawmakers have learned their roles in Trump’s Republican Party. Perhaps they can hang their hopes on cabinet positions in a possible future Trump administration. But for the time being, it seems clear Trump doesn’t want them as the face of his movement."
I served with Republicans for decades. Trump and JD Vance’s GOP is unrecognizable.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 1:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vance-rnc-republicans-maga-rcna162165,"This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC's special coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention on July 15. Donald Trump’s choice to tap Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate signals the ex-president isn’t trying to soften any edges ahead of November’s election.  When news of Vance’s place on the Republican ticket was announced Tuesday, I would wager that the only person more excited than the Ohio senator himself was Russian President Vladimir Putin. I’m sure they dropped balloons from the sky wherever Putin was. Vance has strongly opposed sending more aid to Ukraine and even said it was in America’s best interest for the country to cede some of its territory to the Russians. Trump and Vance’s approach to foreign policy has made the Republican Party I knew during my time in the Senate almost unrecognizable. The Republicans I knew were all about making sure America was a beacon to democracies around the world. They would never want us to stand by and do nothing while a desperate thug rolls into another country and tries to change its borders by force.  But it’s not just Vance’s foreign policy positions that should worry Americans; his views on domestic issues are just as terrifying. There’s now a candidate for vice president of the United States who told women to stay in violent marriages and suggested that an abusive household is somehow better for children than divorce. That’s not just bad advice but also bad politics. That kind of messaging won’t help Republicans get more votes in the suburbs of Philadelphia, or the suburbs of Milwaukee.  Instead of trying to soften the edges of the already extreme MAGA agenda, Trump picked someone who sharpens it – a flame thrower, a bombastic guy who will go out there and say whatever the ex-president would like him to. Trump picked Vance because, unlike his former vice president, Mike Pence, the Ohio senator has said he’d happily violate the Constitution to put Trump in power.  Vance says all the things Trump wants him to say, and says them with passion. The former president believes Vance will be loyal to him no matter what. Trump will never have a Pence problem with Vance and that’s why he got picked … even if Trump doesn’t like his facial hair."

That’s who I’m voting for, but I don’t have ill will towards Biden,” she said. “He didn’t do anything bad to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did.” NBC News reported Tuesday that Trump has reached out and spoken with a member of the Comperatore family. Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief, was 50. Two other men, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were critically injured in the assassination attempt but are now in stable condition. On Sunday, Trump wrote in part on Truth Social: “Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.” Helen Comperatore told the New York Post that her husband died while shielding his family and that his last words were “Get down!” Corey Comperatore died “protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired,” Biden said at a White House news conference Sunday. “And he lost his life. God love him.” On Tuesday, House lawmakers introduced a bipartisan resolution to honor Corey Comperatore and denounce political violence."
Why the leaked phone call between Trump and RFK Jr. matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 12:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/leaked-phone-call-trump-rfk-jr-matters-rcna162181,"When reports emerged that Donald Trump had spoken to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., it was only natural to wonder what the two conspiracy theorists had to say to one another. As it turns out, the public received an unexpected peek behind the curtain. NBC News reported: The candidate’s son took down the clip he posted to social media, but not before it was captured and republished. Part of what makes the video notable was the apparent suggestion that Trump and Kennedy are, or at least should be, on the same page politically. “I would love you to do something,” the Republican could be heard saying. “And I think it’ll be so good for you and so big for you. And we’re going to win.” Kennedy apparently agreed, replying, “Yeah.” This did not sound like a conversation between two rival candidates, competing for the same office. Rather, it came across as a nice, cooperative chat — which probably won’t help the chatter about Kennedy deliberately playing the role of spoiler candidate. Also notable was Trump’s anti-vaccine rhetoric. “When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby,” the Republican said. “And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times. And then you hear that it doesn’t have an impact, right? But you and I talked about that a long time ago.” In apparent reference to vaccines, Trump went on tell Kennedy, whose known for his anti-vaccine rhetoric, “I agree with you man, something’s wrong with that whole system.” The best-case scenario is that Trump knew what he was saying was nonsense, but he made the comments anyway in the hopes of currying favor with someone whose endorsement he was seeking. From a public-health perspective, the worst-case scenario is that Trump actually believes what he said — echoing similar earlier comments — and his prospective second-term administration would govern with such beliefs in mind. Postscript: The fact that Kennedy had Trump on speaker has led to speculation that the independent candidate wanted their conversation to be recorded. That's possible, though it's also worth noting that Kennedy has said he's afraid to keep cellphones by his head."

Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was found guilty on all 16 counts on Tuesday in his criminal corruption trial of bribery, acting as a foreign agent and other charges. The jury deliberated for 12.5 hours over three days. Menendez is due to be sentenced Oct. 29 and has vowed to appeal. Federal prosecutors alleged the senator took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for using his political influence to enrich businessmen and benefit Egypt and Qatar. Prosecutors said the bribes included cash and gold, among other things. Following the verdict, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top Democrats called on Menendez to resign. Menendez was tried alongside two businessmen charged in the alleged scheme, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who were found guilty on Tuesday as well. Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged but wasn't part of this trial; she was diagnosed with cancer and her trial is indefinitely delayed.

Why the Menendez guilty verdict matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bob-menendez-guilty-verdict-doj-trump-rcna162148,"So much for the claim that the Justice Department is using criminal prosecution as a political weapon. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in New Jersey obtained a conviction against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez on 16 counts including bribery, fraud, extortion and obstruction of justice. The vigorous prosecution of a Democrat in a closely divided U.S. Senate demonstrated clearly that DOJ does not use political affiliation as a factor in making charging decisions. In addition to the Menendez case, federal prosecutors recently filed criminal charges against another Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar, of Texas. Cuellar and his wife were charged in May with bribery and money laundering for an alleged scheme to accept $600,000 from an Azerbaijani oil and gas company and a Mexican bank in exchange for using his office to influence policy in their favor. (Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing.) These cases should help refute the baseless claims by former President Donald Trump and his allies that the Department of Justice under the Biden administration is using prosecution as a political tool. After his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan, Trump posted on social media that it was “naïve” to believe that “Crooked Joe Biden was not involved in my Show Trial. HOW STUPID! Not only is he involved, he is virtually leading it, and all of the other Trials as well.” Trump advised the public to “take a look at the DOJ/White House Thugs involved, and everything else. Biden is incompetent, and feels that Weaponization is the only way he can win.” But it’s important to remember that those claims have no basis in fact. Special counsel Jack Smith was appointed in both of Trump’s federal cases precisely to provide a measure of independence from the president. (Trump was separately charged with interfering in the 2020 presidential election and unlawfully retaining national defense information. On Monday, the classified documents case was dismissed by Judge Aileen Cannon, but Smith has vowed to appeal.) And state prosecutors, like New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, are members of separate sovereigns, beholden in no way to a U.S. president. And yet, during a recent interview, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was on the vice presidential short list, echoed this same false narrative. “I’m uncomfortable with the fact now that we have a president who targets political opponents. That’s what’s happened under Joe Biden,” Rubio said. “You look at what their efforts and what they’ve done in the courts to persecute and prosecute Donald Trump,” he said. “They tried to bankrupt him. They’ve tried to silence him. They’ve tried to jail him. They’ve gone after his allies every single day. Some of these are ridiculous charges.” One of the great casualties of the Trump era has been public confidence in law enforcement. Accusations that DOJ has been “weaponized” to go after public officials based on political motives undermines the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. And false claims that are repeated, no matter how ludicrous, can gain traction among some members of the public.    As a former federal prosecutor, I know that DOJ attorneys are nonpartisan professionals who scrupulously avoid politics. DOJ’s policies are contained in an online handbook known as the Justice Manual. Among its foundational policies are the “Principles of Federal Prosecution,“ which state: “In determining whether to commence or recommend prosecution or take other action against a person, the attorney for the government may not be influenced by the person’s... political association, activities, or beliefs.” These rules are enforced by supervisors, the Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility and the disciplinary authorities of the states where prosecutors are licensed as members of the bar. Prosecutors who violate these rules are subject to suspension, termination or disbarment. Further checks on prosecutorial abuse exist in the form of grand juries and trial juries, trial judges and appellate judges. Attacking the credibility of democratic institutions is a tactic authoritarians have used throughout history. If people lack confidence in the press, in the civil service, in career prosecutors, or in the courts, then efforts to hold corrupt officials accountable is weakened. Republicans have worked to undermine all of these groups. But for now, the Menendez case provides just one more concrete example of DOJ prosecuting cases appropriately — that is, meting out justice based on facts, not political agendas."
The Democratic debate over Biden’s electoral future comes roaring back,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 10:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democratic-debate-bidens-electoral-future-comes-roaring-back-rcna162136,"As of late last week, the debate in Democratic circles about President Joe Biden’s electoral future remained robust. The list of party officials calling on the incumbent to forgo his re-election plans continued to grow, and uncertainty reigned. And then a gunman tried to assassinate Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, at which point the Democratic conversation came to a sudden halt. It’s not that any of the relevant players had changed their mind, it was simply a situation in which officials were so horrified by the shooting that they informally agreed to temporarily put the discussion aside. The conversation appears to have made a comeback. The New York Times reported: According to the Times’ report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, Schiff — an influential voice in Democratic politics — told supporters privately, “I think if [Biden] is our nominee, I think we lose. And we may very, very well lose the Senate and lose our chance to take back the House.” The California Democrat, it’s worth emphasizing for context, is not among the congressional Democrats who’ve publicly called on the president to stand down. There are a variety of other related data points circulating in Democratic circles on Tuesday morning: * Biden sat down with NBC News’ Lester Holt and hit some rough spots. * Separate polls from the Times and Virginia Commonwealth University found Virginia becoming an increasingly competitive 2024 battleground. This is a state Biden won by nearly double digits four years ago, and which Republicans didn’t even try to pursue, but which now appears to be a potential battleground. * This follows a related Times report from late last week that said, “Down-ballot Democrats, local elected officials and party strategists say Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Virginia — all of which Mr. Biden won comfortably in 2020 — could be in play in November after his miserable debate performance last month.” * In hypothetical general election match-ups against Donald Trump, the latest Times polling found Vice President Kamala Harris faring a little better than Biden in Pennsylvania and Virginia. * The latest round of polling from YouGov found Trump leading Biden in literally every swing state, despite the same surveys showing Democratic Senate candidates faring well. It led Matt Yglesias, among others, to argue, “I think a non-Biden candidate would have a good chance of converging toward the polling strength of Senate Democrats, while Biden risks pulling senators down to his level.” * The YouGov polling also found that 70% of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — the three battleground states Team Biden has emphasized most — believe the incumbent is too old to be president. It might be tempting to think Democrats still have a month to figure out what to do: The Democratic National Convention kicks off on August 19, which is five weeks away. But that’s not quite right: Democratic officials are actually moving forward with plans to formally nominate Biden by way of a virtual process by the end of this month — as in, over the next two weeks. This approach was set in motion by Republican lawmakers in Ohio playing an annoying ballot-access game, and while state policymakers ultimately reversed course, making the Democratic virtual gathering unnecessary, the DNC appears ready to implement the plan anyway. All of which is to say, Democrats hoping to see a change at the top of their ticket will need to speak now or forever hold their peace."

He told an interviewer that he had set aside the “humdinger” of a speech he planned to give at the Republican  National Convention on Thursday in favor of a new one, focused on unity. “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,” he said.  This call for unity would certainly be a first for the former president, and he might not be lying — at least about that one speech. But should we really believe that we will see a new Trump, committed to a more responsible approach to campaigning, ready to turn his back on the kind of violent, often hateful rhetoric that has characterized his entire tenure in politics? President Joe Biden doesn’t seem to think so. That came through loud and clear in an interview Monday with NBC’s Lester Holt. Even after an Oval Office address in which Biden responded to the attempt on Trump’s life by saying “the political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down. And we all have a responsibility to do that,” the president apparently decided that he would not let Trump off the hook for the way he has made politics so much meaner and angrier over the past eight years.  It was actually rather refreshing. Not because we need to hear candidates criticizing each other more — but because it’s the truth, and even something as disturbing as an assassination attempt shouldn’t make us forget what we’ve seen with our own eyes for so long.  Biden had plenty of material to work with. He began by reiterating, as he often has, that it was Trump’s statement that there were “very fine people on both sides” at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that made him decide to make his third run for the presidency.  To the criticism he got for saying on a private donor call last week (before the shooting) that the campaign should move past the issue of his age and “put Trump in the bull's-eye,” Biden did not hold back. (Notably, after the shooting, Biden explained that he was expressing that “there was very little focus on Trump’s agenda,” and also said it was “a mistake” to have used that word.) “I’m not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one. I’m not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I’m not the guy who said he won’t accept the outcome of this election automatically. You can’t only love your country when you win.” He criticized Trump for saying there will be a “bloodbath” if he loses, and for promising to pardon those convicted of participating in the violent insurrection that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. In short, the message was: If you’re concerned about rhetoric that encourages political violence, the Republican nominee is the one you should talk to. Biden also said something unusual for a Democrat, which I couldn’t help but notice, especially as someone who recently co-wrote a book titled “White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy.” While Democrats are usually at pains to lavish praise on the fine people of the heartland, Biden noted a certain atmosphere often held in the places where Trump gets some of his most fervent support. “I’ve never seen a circumstance where you ride through certain rural areas of the country,” he said, and one can see “signs saying ‘F Biden’ and a little kid standing there putting up his middle finger. That’s the kind of stuff that’s just inflammatory, and a kind of viciousness.” This doesn’t happen only in rural areas, of course, and there are liberals in those places, too. But Biden was absolutely right to point out that Trump has sent a clear message to those who feel, often with good reason, that our changing society and economy has left them and their communities behind. Trump has told them to nurture their resentments, give voice to their anger, and stop being civil to the people they despise. He has told them to hate immigrants and urbanites and Democrats, with all the venom they can muster. And too many of them have responded with a kind of joyful rage, liberated at last to let out their worst selves. That’s why rhetoric is important; not only because it might incite a lone disturbed individual to attempt an assassination but because of what it communicates to everyone else. Trump’s rhetoric until now has been saturated with violence, from his lurid tales of supposed “migrant crime,"" to his gleeful jokes about Nancy Pelosi’s husband almost being murdered by a hammer-wielding assailant, to his suggestions that shoplifters should be shot on sight and that former advisers who have criticized him are guilty of treason, the punishment for which is death.  More than any other political figure in America, Trump instructs his cultish followers not only what to believe but how to think and how to act toward their fellow citizens. Making American politics more cruel and nasty than it had been in decades is an undeniable part of Trump’s legacy.  As the Secret Service began moving him off that stage in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump told them to stop; he turned to the crowd, held up his fist, and mouthed these words: “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Perhaps in the days since, he has had time to reflect and decide that his entire approach to politics has been too harsh and antagonistic. Perhaps in his convention speech he will unveil a kinder, gentler Trump, one committed to national reconciliation and good will even toward those who don’t support him — and not just for one night, but from that day forward.  President Biden doesn’t seem to think so, and it’s hard to disagree given everything we’ve seen for the last eight years. When Trump came into the convention hall Monday night, the crowd responded with a chant that echoed what he said in Pennsylvania: “Fight! Fight! Fight!” No matter what he says in his acceptance speech, they know exactly who he is, and so do we."
It sure isn’t comforting that the person who owns X seems to be going all in for Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 9:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-trump-endorsement-x-owner-rcna161860,"Minutes after a Pennsylvania man attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Saturday, the owner of X, Elon Musk, posted on the platform, “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.” The post included a 12-second video of Trump moments after the shooting, surrounded by Secret Service agents, blood smeared across his face and mouthing the word “fight” with his fist in the air. The post was reposted more than 400,000 times.  Reports also indicate Musk is positioning himself to potentially become a colossal GOP donor. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Musk has said he plans to ""commit around $45 million a month"" to a new political action committee backing Trump. Musk’s official endorsement of Trump and his reported interest in becoming a funder underscore his rightward trajectory and evolution into an overtly partisan backer of the GOP. That he chose to make his endorsement with that specific imagery of Trump — bloodied but defiant in a moment of chaos — also implied a kind of interest in Trump’s political project that extends beyond a narrow business calculation. And Musk’s clear favoritism raises questions about whether he could try to use his ownership of the platform X to influence the 2024 elections to tilt the race toward the GOP. Historically, Musk’s ideological views have been all over the map and defied neat explanation. He’s described himself as a moderate and a registered independent; he has expressed libertarian talking points; and he has even called himself a “socialist.” By his own account, he has skewed toward the Democratic presidential candidate in recent cycles — Musk has said that in the last three elections, he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Since the 2000s, he has mostly followed a standard businessman playbook of donating cash to both parties to hedge his bets.    But in the last few years, he has become both more vocal about his political views and swung to the right. His donations have shifted toward the GOP, and in 2022 he said he voted for a Republican candidate for the first time (former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores of Texas, a QAnon-promoting MAGA Republican). After purchasing Twitter, which he has since renamed X, his posts on the platform have become clearly identifiable as sympathetic to right-wing nationalist ideas, including the racist “great replacement theory."" Musk’s showy endorsement of Trump further crystallizes his swing to the MAGA right and suggests his views are less idiosyncratic than they used to be. Musk also has material reasons to favor Trump. As the richest man in the world and a tech investor who complains about taxes, he’d find the tax and regulatory environment more favorable under Trump than under Biden. As someone who owns big companies and is hostile to organized labor, he has reason to oppose Biden, whose National Labor Relations Board appointments have been good for labor power. And given how his companies SpaceX and Tesla have benefited from government contracts and subsidies, it’s possible that he sees a close relationship with the nakedly transactional Trump as a potentially lucrative investment. Musk and Trump have reportedly discussed whether Musk might take on an advisory role to Trump should he re-enter the White House.   The intensity of Musk’s interest in Trump, in turn, raises questions of whether he’d try (or even has tried)  to use his platform to sway the election toward Trump. Social media platforms can play a game-changing role in the political news ecosystem surrounding elections. Platforms such as X, Facebook and Instagram are constantly making decisions about what their algorithms should and shouldn’t amplify, and those decisions are underpinned by value judgments about what kind of information is valuable. All functional platforms, for example, design algorithms to detect and suppress spam and posts that violate company policies on abusive behavior. But algorithms also play a meaningful role in the kinds of content people can see, and this is a realm in which company policy could conceivably be rigged either explicitly or implicitly to favor a candidate or party.  X’s “For you” home page, its recommendations for accounts to follow and its “Explore tab” could theoretically be tweaked to nudge users toward content that skews in a specific ideological direction. While hyperpartisan users are not going to change their minds in the face of content that contradicts their political preferences, the majority of X users are not political junkies, and they could be influenced in subtle ways. Less politically engaged users could be affected, for example, by trends in posts that highlight content critical of Biden’s age or are positive about Trump’s economic policies. (It's also plausible that political journalists' views of what is salient in the race could be subtly shaped by what's in their feeds.) Additionally, given the history of Musk enacting account suspensions and reinstatements in a manner that appears to be related to his political views or interests, it’s conceivable that influential accounts could get suspended or shadow-banned because of their political orientations. And Musk has used flawed and manipulable strategies for dealing with disinformation. Given past meddling by foreign governments and social media operations designed to systematically confuse the public about things as basic as when to vote, Musk at the helm of a social media platform at this moment is worrisome. Will Musk use X as a political weapon in favor of Trump in subtle or overt ways? It’s impossible to know. What we do know is that he increasingly views himself as a right-wing activist and that he has the power do these things. It’s a reminder of how dangerous it is that we have no regulation of social media companies and how acutely vulnerable our civil society is to being hijacked by billionaires who want to reshape the world to their liking."

Jack Smith to appeal Cannon's dismissal of classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 8:59 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/jack-smith-appeal-aileen-cannon-classified-documents-rcna162082,"UPDATE (July 17, 2024, 3:53 p.m. ET): Special counsel Jack Smith has filed a formal notice that the federal government is appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Special counsel Jack Smith will appeal U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump. That’s unsurprising in the face of Cannon’s outlier ruling in this serious prosecution. But the fact of the appeal — and the special counsel’s statement announcing it — are notable nonetheless. As to the former, the government theoretically had other options, such as refiling the charges in Washington, D.C. Or it could've refiled in Florida through the regular U.S. attorney’s office, which wouldn’t have the appointments clause issue that Cannon found with Attorney General Merrick Garland’s authority to appoint Smith, who isn’t a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney. But in addition to separate legal issues with bringing the case in Washington (which may explain why Smith filed the case in Florida in the first place), going through the regular U.S. attorney in Florida wouldn’t eliminate having to deal with Cannon. Whether she can be removed from the case is a separate issue that could (but won’t necessarily) be addressed with this appeal. Here’s what the special counsel’s office said Monday: The first part of the statement highlights how out of step Cannon’s ruling is, going against the conclusion of other courts that have addressed the appointment issue. The second part is noteworthy in highlighting that the Justice Department authorized the appeal. In her ruling Monday, Cannon took issue with what she characterized as the department's lack of oversight of Smith, so the special counsel’s statement reinforces the point that he can’t just do whatever he wants. Of course, neither of those points guarantee that Smith’s appeal will succeed, especially with the wild card that this Supreme Court has become, demonstrated most recently by the immunity ruling earlier this month. Underscoring that unpredictability, Cannon cited Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence from that case, in which he questioned the legality of Smith’s appointment, which wasn’t even an issue in the immunity appeal. No other justice joined Thomas’ concurrence, but we shouldn't assume from that that Thomas is the only one who would endorse Cannon’s ruling if the case gets to the justices. But Smith’s launching the appeal puts the case on a course to prove Cannon’s ruling the outlier decision that it currently is or to make it the law of the land, courtesy of the Roberts Court.  "
Why Russia has reason to be pleased with Vance on Trump’s ticket,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 8:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/russia-reason-pleased-vance-trumps-ticket-rcna162111,"The United States’ European allies were already feeling intense anxiety about the 2024 presidential election, fearing the prospect of having to work with Donald Trump again. On Monday, those fears reached new heights after the former president announced his new running mate. A senior EU official, for example, told Politico that the selection of Sen. JD Vance is “a disaster for Ukraine.” Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger added, in reference to the GOP senator joining his party's ticket, “They are celebrating that choice both in Milwaukee tonight and in Moscow.” To appreciate why, consider this recent column from The Washington Post’s Max Boot, which was published before Trump selected the Ohioan. Vance isn’t the only opponent of U.S. support for Ukraine in his party — the Republican National Convention featured other such critics on the stage Monday night — but he’s arguably the most forceful voice in the GOP’s Senate delegation for abandoning our Ukrainian allies, as evidenced by his opposition to Congress’ bipartisan security aid package that passed in February. An NBC News report added that the senator “has carved out a niche” on the issue, arguing that Ukrainian officials could help end the war by simply giving Russia parts of their country. Vance has also “dismissed concerns that Vladimir Putin would continue his territorial march through Europe if he takes Ukraine.” As recently as April, Vance wrote a New York Times op-ed that argued that a Russian victory is inevitable — a line popular with the Kremlin — so the United States should adjust its policy accordingly. Around the same time, the Senate Republican sat down with CNN’s Jake Tapper and argued that the United States should encourage Ukraine to “take a defensive posture,” instead of launching counteroffensives against their Russian invaders. It fell to the host to remind his guest, “The counteroffensive is within Ukraine, though. They’re not seeking land from Russia.” There’s already evidence to suggest Vladimir Putin’s government has launched a “whole of government” effort to help boost Trump’s candidacy in the 2024 elections. With Vance joining the Republican ticket, it’s likely Moscow will be even more enthusiastic about helping influence the outcome of the race. But there’s also a bigger picture to consider. In recent years, the Republican Party has struggled to settle on a new foreign policy vision, with one intraparty contingent sticking to a traditional GOP vision in which the United States remains a dominant voice in world affairs and takes an unyielding stance in support of democracy, while a Trumpified faction seeks a retreat while expressing sympathies for authoritarian regimes. With Trump and Vance at the top of the GOP ticket, the latter group appears ready to leave the former group behind."
Mitch McConnell gets hostile reception at the RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 8:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mitch-mcconnell-booed-rnc-trump-criticism-rcna162088,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was booed by the crowd while casting Kentucky's delegate votes Monday, the first day of the Republican National Convention. “Madam chairman, the commonwealth of Kentucky proudly casts 46 votes for the next president, Donald J. Trump,” McConnell said while being drowned out by boos and a smattering of cheers. The Kentucky Republican, who had an uneasy but mutually beneficial relationship with Trump when he was in the White House, has not been a particularly popular figure in the GOP since he acknowledged that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. Although McConnell voted to acquit Trump in his impeachment trial, he excoriated the former president over the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, calling him “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.” Trump has criticized McConnell repeatedly and hurled racist attacks against his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. In February, Trump said he did not know if he could work with McConnell if he was re-elected as president this year. Yet, McConnell had been inching toward reconciliation in recent months, as Trump swept the Republican primary races and most prominent figures in the GOP fell in line. McConnell eventually did so himself, endorsing Trump for president in March. The two men also appeared to set aside their differences at a meeting on Capitol Hill last month after years of not speaking to each other. Still, it's clear from the reception McConnell received Monday that many Republicans have not forgiven — or forgotten — his refusal to cave to Trump immediately after the 2020 election. Once a commanding force in the Senate, McConnell’s influence over the Senate GOP has waned in recent years as Trump’s has grown. Earlier this year, Trump worked to undermine a bipartisan border bill that McConnell had championed. McConnell himself ended up voting against it. Weeks later, the 82-year-old senator announced that he would step down as minority leader in November."
Republican convention tries to rewrite recent history on economy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 7:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-convention-2024-trump-rewrite-history-economy-rcna162102,"Every night of the Republican National Convention will have its own specific theme, and last night the was focus on “Making America Wealthy Again.” Before even hearing the party’s pitch, the label is at odds with the status quo: The United States has the strongest economy on the planet and is currently “the envy of the world.” Nevertheless, that’s not what attendees and viewers heard from Republican convention speakers. “Under President Trump,” Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas declared, “we had the greatest economy in our lifetime.” Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama went further, insisting, “Under President Trump, we had the strongest economy in history. That’s right.” Except, there’s nothing “right” about the claim at all. A Washington Post fact-check piece explained: The Post’s piece actually understates matters. The economy didn’t do as well as it did under Barack Obama, either. Even if we exclude 2020, when the pandemic created a sharp and sudden recession, the story that Republicans prefer to tell about Trump’s economic record is at odds with the facts. The Post published a memorable analysis on this as 2019 neared its end. It’s not what Republicans wanted to hear, but comparing the economy under Obama and Trump at the same points in their presidencies, the Post found that the economy grew faster under Obama, hiring grew faster under Obama, the S&P 500 grew faster under Obama, the unemployment rate shrunk faster under Obama, and the national debt grew slower under Obama. The analysis concluded, “[I]f we are linking economic numbers to presidential performance, Trump’s insistence that his abilities are unparalleled are rendered somewhat suspect in that he ranks second out of the last two presidents on a lot of these indicators.” Remember, all of this was true before the pandemic took a severe toll on the economy. Trump, of course, also ranks behind President Joe Biden, who has a stronger record than his GOP predecessor on job growth, unemployment and economic growth. In other words, at the opening night of the Republican convention, the party was eager to rewrite recent history — something Republicans do with unnerving frequency, as I write about in my soon-to-be-released second book — but the facts are stubborn."
Trump and Vance create a Republican ticket rooted in inexperience,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-vance-create-republican-ticket-rooted-inexperience-rcna162081,"Donald Trump’s 2016 candidacy was unusual in a great many ways, but there was one part of his resume that stood out as extraordinary. Up until January 2017, literally every president in American history had at least some experience in public office, military service, or both. Trump was unique: Before his inauguration, the Republican had never served the public in any capacity. Nevertheless, 46% of the American electorate elevated the former television personality to the nation’s highest and most powerful office. Soon after, the political world confronted a set of circumstances without precedent, at least in the United States: The head of the executive branch in the world’s preeminent superpower didn’t know the basics of how government worked. He sought the presidency without bothering to learn about his own country’s political structures and then arrived in the Oval Office with a child-like understanding of civic affairs. We know this, not just because of Trump’s many failures, but because people close to him have said so on the record. “I’m telling you, he didn’t know anything about government,” former House Speaker Paul Ryan told Politico’s Tim Alberta in 2019. “I wanted to scold him all the time.” Five years later, Trump found himself in the market for a new running mate. The former president chose a young man whose political career is measured in months, not years. Fox News’ Brit Hume told viewers on Monday: The details are striking. While most modern running mates have extensive experience in elected office, Vance’s political career began literally last year. The Ohio senator is the least experienced vice presidential nominee for either party in nearly nine decades. (In 1936, newspaper publisher Frank Knox, who had no background in elected office, joined Alf Landon’s Republican ticket. They soon after lost 46 out of 48 states.) Vance was recently asked about his greatest accomplishment on Capitol Hill, and he pointed to funding in an infrastructure bill he voted against. For Trump, none of this seems to matter. Indeed, if he were principally concerned about qualifications for national office, he wouldn’t have run in the first place. For the Republican Party, the pairing of the least experienced president and the least experienced running mate of the modern era also doesn’t much matter, largely because the contemporary GOP is a post-policy party, indifferent toward governing and policymaking. Looking ahead, the question is whether mainstream American voters are still similarly indifferent."
‘Clear and present danger’: Republican convention abandons ‘unity’ push,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/clear-present-danger-republican-convention-abandons-unity-push-rcna162068,"On Sunday afternoon, the day after being targeted by an assassination attempt, Donald Trump used his social media platform to promote a simple message. “UNITE AMERICA!” the former president wrote. Those who saw this and hoped that the terrifying events in Pennsylvania on Saturday might force a shift in the political climate quickly learned otherwise. On Monday afternoon, Trump published an angry and conspiratorial message that sounded an awful lot like the sort of content the Republican published before the shooting. Soon after, the former president announced his running mate: Sen. JD Vance, a relentlessly partisan lawmaker who, just two days earlier, blamed President Joe Biden and his campaign team for the gunman who targeted Trump. Then the Republican National Convention got underway. As a Washington Post report summarized: Part of the problem with the opening night of the Republican gathering in Milwaukee was the speaker’s list: It included North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, an extremist who recently declared, in reference to his perceived political enemies, “Some folks need killing! It’s time for somebody to say it. It’s not a matter of vengeance. It’s not a matter of being mean or spiteful. It’s a matter of necessity!” Attendees also heard from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a secession proponent who, as recently as this past weekend, said Democrats are “pedophiles” and “flat out evil.” And then, of course, there was the senior senator from the great state of Wisconsin. HuffPost noted: So much for “UNITE AMERICA!” In fairness, it’s worth emphasizing that Johnson — whom The New York Times once described as “the Republican Party’s foremost amplifier of conspiracy theories and disinformation” — told PBS’ Amna Nawaz after his remarks that the teleprompter featured a previous version of his remarks. The GOP senator claimed he intended to deliver a more unifying message, but there was some kind of mix-up. Whether that’s true or not is anyone’s guess, but the bottom line remains the same: The Republican emphasis on “unity” was nice while it lasted, but it didn’t last long."
What history tells us about Trump's attempted assassination,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-presidents-history-rcna161798,"Picture this: A former Republican president is attempting a comeback into politics. Despite leaving office four years ago, he’s busy trying to convince the American people that his successor has been a disappointment. During an event on the campaign trail, a shot rings out as a would-be assassin attempts to end his life. On Saturday, that scene played out for the second time in American history. Former President Theodore Roosevelt survived that 1912 shot, fired as he attempted to mount a strong third-party challenge to return to the White House. So too did former President Donald Trump when a single gunman fired at him during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. It’s a dire reminder that in a country where political violence is never too far from the forefront of the nation’s consciousness, and guns remain widely available, those campaigning for the highest office in the land have long been considered prime targets. While Trump’s wound was reportedly superficial, a few inches to the left would have likely been deadly. The latter was also true for Roosevelt, who was shot in the chest by his assailant. It was only thanks to the items in his jacket pocket — the 50 pages of his prepared remarks, folded once, and his steel eyeglass case — that the bullet was slowed. Though Trump was rushed offstage, Roosevelt concluded that the bullet had not pierced anything important. He then continued to deliver an off-the-cuff speech for close to an hour, only being taken for medical treatment afterward. Roosevelt himself first ascended to the presidency because of an assassin’s bullet. He was vice president when President William McKinley was shot by an anarchist in 1901 while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The resulting wound turned gangrenous thanks to poor handling from doctors, leaving Roosevelt the youngest president in history. Decades later, Teddy’s distant cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt was the target of another would-be assassin. A month before he was sworn in as president in 1933, a man fired six shots at the car carrying the president-elect; Roosevelt was unscathed, but five other people were hit, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who would later die from his wounds. Despite the attempt on Teddy Roosevelt’s life, Secret Service protection was only extended to former presidents in 1965. That level of security was only extended to “major presidential candidates” in 1968 when Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., was assassinated while campaigning for the presidency. (His son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was assigned Secret Service protection for his long shot independent presidential campaign on Monday.) But the Secret Service agents assigned to protect Alabama Gov. George Wallace when he campaigned for the Democratic nomination in 1972 weren’t enough to prevent an attempted assassination that left Wallace paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. We still don’t know the motives of the shooter who fired at Trump. The motives of other assassins or would-be assassins of presidential candidates are a mixed bag. For some, like Kennedy’s assassin Sirhan Sirhan, there has been a distinct political target, in his case Kennedy’s support for Israel. Others, like the man who shot Wallace, literally did it for the fame, or infamy, involved in trying to kill a famous figure. John Schrank, the person who tried to kill Theodore Roosevelt, did so because he claimed McKinley’s ghost told him that Roosevelt had murdered McKinley and ordered Schrank to avenge his death. We also can’t easily use the past to judge what effect this incident will have on the election. Tony Diver, The Telegraph’s U.S. editor, looked to the shooting of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 as a touchstone. Reagan had only been in office for less than a year when John Hinckley Jr. shot him in a delusional attempt to win the attention of actor Jodie Foster. “If history tells us anything, the events of Saturday will only increase his support,” Diver wrote. “In the months after Mr Reagan was shot, the newly-elected Republican president saw a poll boost of eight points.” While that may have been the last credible assassination attempt on a president, there are a lot of differences here that make me skeptical about the bounce Trump might see. For one, no matter what has happened to him, there’s always been a ceiling for him in the polls and a floor from his die-hard supporters. In addition, the “rally around the flag” effect that often occurs after an attempt on a sitting president’s life is less frequently seen when the target is a candidate for the office, even one who has held the job before. Both Roosevelt and Wallace lost their presidential races. In the end, there are only two main things that unite all the attempts on presidential candidates’ lives. The first, and most within our grasp to change, is access to guns in this country. The other, though, is harder to address. Every assassination undertaken or attempted, whether for personal glory or ideology, can rightly be seen as an attack on a symbol. For what else is a candidate for the presidency but a symbol of what the country might next be? It is the reaction to the attack on that symbol that they seek, be it praise and attention, or to spark a revolution. It’s not yet clear what reaction the man who fired at Trump wanted when he pulled the trigger — but I fear it won’t be long before we find out what tinderbox he hit as well."
Judge Cannon’s latest ruling proves the judiciary has become MAGAfied,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 16, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-cannon-classified-documents-ruling-supreme-court-rcna162010,"On Monday, in an opinion that was shocking both for its reasoning and its timing, Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Mar-a-Lago classified documents prosecution against former President Donald Trump. She declared that Jack Smith’s appointment as special counsel is unlawful under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. Even given Cannon’s clear bias and reckless handling of the case from the outset, this development is jaw-dropping. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s anything-goes majority opinion on presidential immunity, we are witnessing the “MAGAfication” of the judiciary, joining Donald Trump in the march toward lawlessness. It should be met with repudiation by voters come November. Fittingly, Cannon has bookended her handling of this matter with the worst decisions we have seen a district court judge make in our collective half-century-plus of legal practice. In both instances, she bent over backward to help Trump avoid accountability.  Back in 2022, before Trump was indicted, Cannon attempted to interfere with the government’s ongoing investigation by appointing a special master to review documents seized from Mar-a-Lago under a search warrant. That move was completely baseless — and the conservative 11th Circuit swiftly ordered an end to her unprecedented intervention into a criminal investigation.  Now Cannon has again deviated from the law to dismiss the case entirely. Embracing a theory that has never been adopted by any court, Cannon found that Smith’s appointment was not authorized by Congress and so violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. She went on to hold that the appropriation of funds to the special counsel was similarly inappropriate.  That interpretation ignores both Supreme Court precedent and the plain text of the statutes that authorize the appointment of the special counsel. In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the Watergate special prosecutor’s subpoena of President Richard Nixon’s Oval Office tapes. In reaching that conclusion, the court explained that Congress had “the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist [the attorney general] in the discharge of his duties,” including the special prosecutor, through precisely the same statutes that authorize Smith’s appointment. Every other court that has ruled on the issue in the 50 years since then has agreed. Just five years ago, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals cited the Nixon case in unanimously upholding the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. But Cannon discarded that unbroken line of precedent. Instead, she concluded that a statute that says “the Attorney General may appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States” does not authorize the attorney general to appoint a special counsel to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States. This is not a conservative, textualist legal decision grounded in a careful reading of the statute. It is shameless judicial activism with no other basis than to immunize Trump from accountability. So what does Smith do now? Already, the special counsel’s office has announced he will promptly appeal Cannon’s ruling to the 11th Circuit. That court has reversed Cannon before when she dramatically departed from precedent, and another prompt reversal is warranted here. But regardless, the appeal will most likely end up at the Supreme Court.  Smith can also go one step further and seek Cannon’s removal from the case entirely. That rarely happens, and the Justice Department seldom reaches for such an extraordinary intervention. But we think the extraordinary circumstances of this case warrant it.  Under 11th Circuit precedent, “[r]eassignment is appropriate where the trial judge has engaged in conduct that gives rise to the appearance of impropriety or a lack of impartiality in the mind of a reasonable member of the public.” Even when the trial court judge has not shown “actual bias,” as the 11th Circuit termed it, the judge can still be removed from a case when “the original judge would have difficulty putting his previous views and findings aside” or if “reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of justice.”  As we have previously argued, Cannon’s handling of the case betrayed bias sufficient to support removal even before Monday’s decision. After this ruling, Smith should seek a reassignment in the interests of justice. All of this could happen fairly quickly. The 11th Circuit acted briskly when Cannon overstepped last time, and we could see action within a matter of weeks. That suggests that this could all come to a head during the election season — as if we needed one more destabilizing turn of events on this political roller coaster. Looming over all of this, though, is the devastation the conservative members of the Supreme Court have unleashed. The high court has now shifted the Overton window of lawless judging with its recent immunity ruling. The conservative justices set the bad example that Cannon has now followed. What might the Supreme Court do if the government’s appeal of Cannon’s disastrous opinion reaches its steps? Even now, it is hard to believe that a majority of the court would embrace Cannon’s unprincipled, atextualist conclusion. But at least one justice would. In the court’s immunity decision, Justice Clarence Thomas issued a concurring opinion — joined by no other justice — questioning the constitutionality of the special counsel position. The issue was not before the court, and none of the parties had even briefed it. Yet, in an all-too-predictable act of judicial brazenness, Thomas opined anyway.  Cannon cited Thomas’ solo concurrence as if it were law while disregarding the Supreme Court’s long-standing precedent as if it were purely optional. It is hard to imagine a clearer encapsulation of MAGA judicial philosophy: The law as they find it is irrelevant; all that matters is what Trump’s hand-picked justices decide they want the law to be. Maybe that would be a bridge too far, even for this court. The court’s precedent and the statute’s text are crystal clear. So it is possible that the Supreme Court will slap Cannon’s ruling down — as it has done with other rogue conservative district court judges this term who far exceeded their parameters. But the Supreme Court has become unmoored. Beyond defying the text and spirit of the Constitution in their immunity ruling, it has also thrown out the foundational legal principle of stare decisis, in which courts adhere to precedent. It has overruled long-settled law on everything from the role of administrative agencies to abortion. We must view Cannon’s latest entry in the continuing partisan politicization of our courts together with all of the destabilizing events of the past four years. That starts with the attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, the tragedy of Jan. 6 and Trump and his allies’ authoritarian threats, which we catalog in our American Autocracy Threat Tracker. And it includes the violence targeting political figures including Trump, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, We are now facing the most serious internal challenge to the American experiment since the Jim Crow era, or perhaps the Civil War. (That crisis is the subject of a major cross-partisan summit that we are hosting next week at NYU.) Cannon’s decision and its naked unlawfulness need to be located in that context. The court’s immunity ruling was a form of election interference, slow-rolling the case to make a trial in 2024 impossible. But the content and the timing of Cannon’s decision here are perhaps even more blatant. Dropping this opinion on the morning the Republican convention begins is a political gift to the man who nominated her and an unmistakable signal of her bias. Whatever this is, it is not judging as we have known it. "
How JD Vance passed Trump’s running mate litmus test,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:38 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 4:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-test-rcna161985,"Donald Trump named Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate after Vance spent two years echoing the former president's baseless claims about the 2020 election. Vance was the most vocal election denier among Trump's small circle of finalists, having claimed without evidence since his 2022 run for the Senate that the election was stolen. Republicans who have raised concerns about the 2020 election range from those who say that they did not like how certain voting rules were changed because of the pandemic to those who make baseless allegations that the election was stolen. Vance has made arguments along the entire spectrum: Looking ahead to November, it's worth noting that Vance also echoed something that Trump has said when asked if he would accept the election results in the past. ""If it's a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results,"" Vance told CNN's Dana Bash in May. ""And again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president."" Vance was more diplomatic when asked if he would accept a loss in his own Senate race, however, stating that he had confidence in Ohio's elections. “I expect to win,” he said at a Fox News town hall just days before the 2022 election. “But, of course, if things don’t go the way that I expect, I’ll support the guy who wins and I’ll try to be as supportive as I possibly can.” Election denial is also a major reason the position of Trump's running mate was open in the first place. After then-Vice President Mike Pence refused Trump's request to object to electors on Jan. 6, 2021, the two had a falling out, and the angry mob that descended on the Capitol threatened to ""hang Mike Pence."" Congress has since updated the Electoral Count Act to clarify that the vice president's role in the proceedings is strictly ceremonial. But Vance has also made clear that he might be willing to cross a line that Pence wouldn't, and that may have helped him get the job."
This isn't the end for Trump's classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/special-counsel-trump-documents-jack-smith-dismissed-rcna161978,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 15 episode of ""José Díaz-Balart Reports."" The constitutionality of the special counsel position is an issue that has been litigated for many years, but no court has ever done what U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon did Monday. With her decision to dismiss the federal classified documents case against Donald Trump and rule special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment unlawful, Cannon has found herself on a legal island. Federal courts in the District of Columbia have clearly established case law on this issue, so Cannon’s decision in Florida should not have any immediate ramifications for Smith’s federal election interference case in D.C. But Monday’s decision isn’t exactly the end of the Florida case either. The Justice Department has already authorized the special counsel to appeal the order, and I expect that appeal to be heard. However, that route will take some time: a briefing schedule, oral argument and an eventual decision from an appellate court could be months away. There is another, faster option on the table. Technically the Department of Justice could dismiss their case in the Southern District of Florida — although Judge Cannon has already done that for them — and refile elsewhere, like the District of Columbia. Venue, the place where a crime occurs, is an elastic concept. Many crimes occur in multiple places. I think there is a good faith argument that the classified documents case could have also been filed in the District of Columbia, where the crime is alleged to have begun, but that theory might invite a separate set of challenges.  All that said, I caution the Department of Justice to take into consideration the optics here. It's a bad look for the DOJ to judge-shop. That puts the department in a bad light. Typically, in litigation you are stuck with the judge you get — sometimes that’s a good draw, and other times it’s a bad draw. In my experience as a federal prosecutor, it’s mostly been good draws but, when you do get a bad draw, the only option is to carry on and do your job. As we wait for Jack Smith's next move, one thing seems likely: what lies ahead is a long, hard slog for the Department of Justice."
Kremlin echoes some Trump allies on assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-assassination-attempt-conspiracy-theories-kremlin-putin-rcna161902,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s allies in the Kremlin have already begun pushing propaganda about the shooting this weekend at a Donald Trump rally.  A top Kremlin official argued without evidence that an assassination attempt that killed a spectator and injured two others was the fault of President Joe Biden and his allies. For now, there’s little information on the gunman's motivations, and the FBI has said that it has not yet determined his underlying ideology or motive. Nonetheless, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “the atmosphere that has been created by this administration during the political struggle, the atmosphere around the candidate Trump, prompted what America is facing today,"" according to the Russian state media outlet TASS. Business Insider reported on Peskov’s extended comments, which echoed claims made by some Republican lawmakers, including Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, who also alleged, without evidence, that anti-Trump rhetoric was to blame for the shooting. Peskov said, according to Business Insider: Still, Peskov added that Moscow does not believe the assassination attempt ""was organized by the current authorities."" Back here in reality, of course, the blame for Trump's various court cases, convictions and condemnation rests entirely on his own behavior. Still, some Trump allies have used the shooting as an opportunity to push back on his critics. And the Kremlin is moving in lockstep with them."
Judge Aileen Cannon cleaned up her own mess by making a new one,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 2:46 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-jack-smith-rcna161887,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has much more free time on her hands now. Last week, her calendar was packed with hearings and pending motions in former President Donald Trump’s federal classified documents case. But on Monday she issued a sweeping ruling dismissing the case and finding that special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed in the process. The 93-page ruling puts an end — for now — to what had once been seen as the strongest case against Trump. It also cleans up — again, for now — the mess that Cannon had made for herself in her halting, hesitant and ultimately horrific handling of the case. But in issuing this ruling, Cannon has created an even larger problem for Smith and the judges who will have to contend with her reasoning in future appeals. That process is sure to be lengthy, because the scope of Cannon’s ruling would essentially negate both federal cases against Trump in their entirety. Cannon’s decision to grant a motion to dismiss was a surprise, one of many she has pulled out over the 13 months since she was assigned the case. The hearing at which the motion was argued before her last month was viewed as odd from the moment it was announced, though it was another in a long line of delays that Cannon had already caused by giving undue credulity to whatever claims were tossed her way. The resulting backlog of motions requiring judgment had meant that even before Monday, no trial date had been set, even though proceedings were initially scheduled to begin in May. Last month’s hearing was particularly strange, however, because Cannon allowed arguments from outside parties beyond Trump’s lawyers and Smith’s prosecutors. The pro-Trump argument boiled down to an attack on special prosecutors broadly, albeit targeting Smith specifically. It claimed that the Department of Justice’s special counsel regulations, under which Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith, violated the Constitution. The pro-Trump lawyers argued that the independence vested in Smith’s position made him a “principal officer,” thus requiring Senate confirmation under the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. They further argued that Smith’s office was improperly drawing on Justice Department appropriations without Congress’ specifically authorizing that spending, violating the Appropriations Clause. In fairness, the special counsel regulations have always a bit awkward. They were drafted to replace Congress’ independent counsel statute, which was passed post-Watergate but allowed to expire in 1999. By then both parties had agreed that, despite the Supreme Court’s upholding the law authorizing the independent counsel in 1988, the post was too unwieldy to be functional. Politicians sought a replacement that still allowed for autonomy without becoming an unaccountable fourth branch of government. The Justice Department lawyers who authored the rules drew on various statutes to grant the attorney general the power to appoint a special counsel who “shall be selected from outside the United States Government” for cases in which a typical U.S. attorney would “present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances.” The resulting regulations have been invoked in both Democratic and Republican administrations with little to indicate that they might be unconstitutional. A court challenge against special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, named by then-President George W. Bush to investigate the Valerie Plame leak, that made similar Appointment Clause arguments was rejected by a district court judge in 2006. Special counsel Robert Mueller, named to oversee the Russia investigation during the Trump administration, was also given a green light in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit deemed his appointment was likewise constitutional. Cannon dismissed those prior rulings in her decision, along with Smith’s arguments that his role is as an “inferior officer” who is accountable to the attorney general. Instead, she sided with a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas in the Supreme Court’s decision that granted Trump broad immunity in the federal case relating to his alleged 2020 election interference. (She also ruled against Smith on the Appropriations Clause challenge, but since the Appointments Clause decision was enough to dismiss the case did not go as in-depth in her analysis.) Canon’s ruling also cuts off the chance that a newly named special counsel, one who is already a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney, could simply pick up where Smith left off. Instead, under her ruling Smith’s investigation would now be invalidated, as he was never legally authorized to conduct it. And while the ruling doesn’t directly affect the election interference case in Washington, as it is not binding on the judge overseeing it, it provides a new method to stall those proceedings even further once they’re finally resumed. Given that courts have seen no issue with special counsel appointments in the past, it’s uncertain whether a more experienced judge would have ruled the same way as Cannon. Her short time on the bench has been a major reason for the delays in the case, as her meticulous approach has led to packing her schedule with motions many jurists would dismiss as dilatory or rule on swiftly without a hearing. The New York Times even reported last month that several more experienced judges in Cannon’s district suggested that she hand off the case when it was initially assigned to her at random. She declined, despite her lack of trial experience, leading us to Monday’s dismissal. It’s unclear whether this ruling will stand up in the face of scrutiny at the appellate level. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a decision of hers early in Smith’s investigation with an unusual degree of scorn for her legal reasoning. There’s still a chance that her decision is reversed, but it’s likely she’d remain on the case. This would place her right back in the same spot as before, with a lengthy list of motions to consider before a trial date could be set and a jury could be impaneled. At the same time, it is frustratingly fitting that this would be the way that Cannon finally answers the calls from observers to act swiftly. In fact, it feels almost petty that she would grab at this off-ramp when it was presented to her after stubbornly refusing to admit that she’s in over her head. Rather than act decisively on issues that would clearly fail under scrutiny, she has instead in one fell swoop taken the most promising chance presented to her to wash her hands of the matter altogether."

Black voter advocacy group denounces efforts to push Biden off the ticket,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 1:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/black-voters-matter-biden-drop-out-democrats-rcna161953,"A top voting rights group has issued a scathing rebuke of Democrats who’ve been pressuring President Joe Biden to end his 2024 campaign after a poor debate performance. And it packs a punch. Black Voters Matter is one of the pre-eminent Black voter advocacy and mobilization groups in the country. In the statement, the group’s leaders accused liberal elites of leading the effort to oust Biden and said that doing so would undermine the democratic process by overruling Black primary voters, many of whom have dedicated their time and energy to re-electing the Biden-Harris administration. The statement, written by Black Voters Matter co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright, along with the group’s national legal director, April England-Albright, says the Biden-Harris administration has delivered on promises to invest in Black communities, implement police accountability, fund historically Black colleges and universities, and more. But they wrote that “the recent nervous cry for Biden to step aside” is being “led largely by white congresspeople, pundits, and donors” and add that it threatens to “mute and overlook the voices of Black Voters.” The sentiment reflects a palpable irritation I’ve detected from Black folks lately — journalists and otherwise — as they’ve watched some in the media push for Biden to drop out or cite polls that they believe indicate he should, when that hasn’t seemed to match what many Democrats, especially Black Democrats, say when asked face-to-face. Ditching the Biden-Harris ticket could negatively “impact Black turnout for decades to come while deepening the widespread belief that the Democratic Party takes our voters for granted,” Black Voters Matter argues. The statement speaks to frustrations that the calls to replace Biden have generally been made without articulating realistic plans for how voter mobilization groups could re-educate voters about whatever fantasy ticket these Democrats want instead. Admittedly, it’s a thought that’s come to mind as I’ve read and heard about what I feel are far-fetched scenarios for a change atop the ticket. Because despite what George Clooney or James Carville might want, for example, I don’t think they’re going to be knocking on doors to turn out the vote. The statement addresses this: The group’s leaders make clear they’re not denouncing people who voice principled policy disagreements with the Biden administration. They write: The statement ends with a call to “[b]uckle up, do the work, have some courage and stay the course to create the society and the world we all need and deserve.” You should really read the statement in full. I think the Blacklash toward those who have been driving the “Biden drop out” campaign is an underreported story these days. At minimum, it seems to have saved the Biden-Harris campaign from a feeding frenzy."

How Cannon ditched the Nixon case to dismiss Trump's documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 1:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/cannon-nixon-trump-case-dismissed-rcna161936,"In 1974, the Supreme Court seemingly approved a special prosecutor’s authority in then-President Richard Nixon’s case over the Watergate tapes subpoena. But in dismissing the classified documents case against Donald Trump on Monday, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon rejected language from that Supreme Court ruling to find that Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel against the former president.  How could she have done so? Putting aside for a moment that she may be reversed on appeal, the answer lies in something called dicta, meaning language in an opinion that isn’t necessary to the ruling. Cannon deemed the language at issue from the Nixon case to be that sort of statement that isn’t binding precedent.    Here’s the relevant passage from United States v. Nixon in 1974 that she excerpted in her ruling dismissing Trump’s indictment:  Cannon emphasized that ""the focal point of the parties’ dispute"" regarding Smith's appointment is the line: ""It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties. 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, 510, 515, 533."" She noted the defense argued that the language from Nixon about the attorney general’s authority “is non-binding dictum and thus should not control the Court’s statutory analysis,” while Smith said that it was necessary to the case’s holding and is therefore binding on lower courts. Rejecting Smith’s approach, Cannon wrote that the attorney general’s authority in the Nixon case “was not raised, briefed, argued, or disputed before the Nixon Court” and that the Supreme Court at most assumed that the attorney general had authority without expressly ruling on it. Therefore, the Trump appointee wrote, “Nixon’s passing remarks on that point are not binding precedent.” Cannon further said that she disagreed with rulings from the D.C. federal appeals court that approvingly cited Nixon, including a 2019 ruling against a challenge to special counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment. Cannon sits in a different federal circuit (the 11th, which reversed her during previous Trump-related litigation), so she isn’t bound by D.C. Circuit precedent. Notably, Cannon cited Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurrence from the immunity ruling in Trump’s favor earlier this month, where Thomas said that the Nixon case only “gave passing reference to the cited statutes” and “provided no analysis of those provisions’ text.” No other justices joined Thomas’ concurrence, but the appointment issue wasn’t directly before the justices in the immunity case, so we don't know how they would rule if the issue were argued before them. Thomas had joined Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion bestowing broad criminal immunity but wrote separately to raise the appointment issue. Ultimately, the Supreme Court may have to weigh in on what its own precedent means. Of course, if the appointment issue gets to the high court, the question isn’t only what a majority of the court thinks Nixon meant, but, perhaps more importantly, what a majority of the court wants to do in Trump's case today. The immunity ruling reminds us that, especially in cases involving presidential power, we’ll never know for sure what the court will do until it rules.

Donald Trump taps Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his 2024 running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 12:33 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-taps-ohio-sen-jd-vance-2024-running-mate-rcna161965,"The “race to the bottom” in Republican politics in recent months has been difficult to watch. One GOP official after another, desperate to impress Donald Trump and ingratiate themselves to the former president’s team, went to cringeworthy lengths in the hopes of improving their odds of becoming the former president’s new running mate. One candidate, however, was especially brazen in abandoning any sense of shame or self-respect. In February, for example, Sen. JD Vance publicly suggested that presidents should be willing to disregard Supreme Court rulings they deem “illegitimate,” adding that he would’ve rejected the 2020 election results on Jan. 6 if he’d been vice president at the time. Soon after, the Ohio Republican said, in reference to the Trump-inspired attack on the Capitol, “I’m truly skeptical that Mike Pence’s life was ever in danger.” In a separate interview around the same time, Vance also said that he planned to accept the 2024 election results, but only if they met the Ohio Republican’s undefined standards. The senator then tried to defend Trump’s Jan. 6 efforts in a way that was widely panned as “ridiculous.” Remarking on the intraparty competition last month, The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank wrote: “To date, Vance has arguably demeaned himself the most. ... If sycophancy is the measure, Vance is clearly the leading contestant.” The party’s presumptive presidential nominee apparently came to the same conclusion. My MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim reported: There’s no great mystery as to how Vance excelled as a vice presidential contender: The Ohioan is a partisan attack dog with deep ties to deep pockets. Indeed, the senator’s career included a stint in the venture capital sector, and it’s likely that Trump is eager to exploit those ties to boost his fundraising. As the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance might also be positioned to help the Republican ticket target voters in key Midwestern battleground states. There are plenty of downsides for Vance — after just a year and a half in elected office, he has no accomplishments to speak of, and he’s the least experienced vice presidential nominee for either party in nearly nine decades — but those aren’t the kind of concerns that bother the former president. What Trump does care about is sycophantic support, and on that front, Vance is a recent convert. As a Washington Post report noted last week, during Trump’s 2016 candidacy, Vance called himself “a Never Trump guy” and said he didn’t vote for him in 2016. The same year, Vance wrote, “Mr. Trump is unfit for our nation’s highest office.” The Post’s article added: In 2016, Vance also wrote a piece for The Atlantic, which argued, “Trump is cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it.” The future senator added at the time, “What Trump offers is an easy escape from the pain. To every complex problem, he promises a simple solution. ... He never offers details for how these plans will work, because he can’t. Trump’s promises are the needle in America’s collective vein.” We’ll never know for sure whether Vance underwent an ideological metamorphosis for the sake of political convenience, or because of a sincere conversion to MAGAism. Either way, one of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics from eight years ago is now his 2024 running mate."
Trump picks political newcomer JD Vance as running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 12:09 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 12:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-pick-rcna159005,"Donald Trump has picked Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential running mate, a decision that would potentially elevate a novice lawmaker to the position of the second-most powerful person in the United States. Trump announced his decision in a Truth Social post on Monday, the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. ""As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,"" Trump wrote. ""Congratulations to Senator J.D. Vance, his wife, Usha, who also graduated from Yale Law School, and their three beautiful children. MAGA2024!"" Out of the reported front-runners for the ticket, Vance, 39, has the least experience in elected office. Before he was sworn into the Senate in January 2023, the military veteran and law school graduate worked as an author and a venture capitalist. Vance sharply criticized Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election, privately comparing him to Adolf Hitler and publicly describing him as ""noxious"" and ""reprehensible."" But Vance's 180 on the former president during his Senate campaign — and his friendship with Trump's oldest son — eventually earned him a spot in Trump's good graces. Vance openly jockeyed to be Trump's running mate. He made a slate of media appearances as a Trump surrogate, he fervently attacked witnesses in the former president's New York hush money trial, and he acted as a sort of conduit between his Silicon Valley connections and Trump. Vance said in an interview in late June that he would be disappointed if he wasn't picked to join Trump's ticket. Vance is known as one of the most MAGA-aligned Republicans in the Senate. Like the presumptive GOP nominee, he has championed an extreme brand of conservatism. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Daily last month: Although the FBI has not yet determined the shooter’s ideology, Vance immediately blamed President Joe Biden for the attempted assassination of Trump at a campaign rally on Saturday, claiming that the president's campaign rhetoric accusing Trump of being ""an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs"" led to the attack.

Monday's interview with NBC News' Lester Holt is Joe Biden’s chance to flip the script,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 11:12 AM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 11:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-interview-nbc-news-lester-holt-rcna161944,"The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump will no doubt be the subject of the first question NBC News’ Lester Holt asks President Joe Biden during a previously scheduled interview that will air Monday evening. However, that doesn’t mean the focus will be taken off the ongoing feud within the Democratic Party and whether Biden should be its nominee against Trump. The calls for Biden to step aside have quieted over the last couple of days, but they will return. It’s been more than two weeks since the president’s horrible debate performance against Trump; it’s time for him to flip the script, and Monday’s interview with Holt is the perfect time and place for him to do it. Since that debate, Biden has been working to assure the country that he is up to the job. Yet, his biggest obstacle appears to be a small but growing group of Democrats who are pressuring him to bow out of the race. Some have explicitly called for him to step aside. Then there are those such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who are chumming the waters with snide comments like, “I want him to do whatever he decides to do.” While it took far too long, Biden finally addressed the American public by doing a one-on-one interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Since then, the president has been on the campaign trail and at long last, on Thursday, he had his first solo news conference of 2024. Each step of the way, Biden has managed to marginally calm fears about his fitness and his ability to win re-election. He has done this by being conciliatory and has shown a willingness to address these issues, going as far as to say, “I think it’s important that I allay fears by letting them see me out there.” The next step is for Biden to demonstrate that he is in charge and call for an end to the brewing rebellion once and for all. While Biden carried the right tone during the ABC interview, he must mix it up in the NBC interview. If Biden wants to be re-elected, then he needs to project strength, show he is in command and, most of all, be bold. Here’s what the president should be thinking about: Although Biden’s perceived frailty may connote weakness, he should use this interview to show power. If fueled with the right words, his softer voice will roar with strength. While typically Biden would use this moment for a pre-convention attack on Trump, he should now use it to express the need for unity. As he said in his address to the nation Sunday night, “While we might disagree, we are not enemies … we are fellow Americans. And we must stand together.”"
"In the shooting’s wake, Trump’s shift in tone fades quickly",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shootings-wake-trumps-shift-tone-fades-quickly-rcna161939,"Axios reported Monday morning that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Donald Trump in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added: “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America, when the Republican convention opens Monday in Milwaukee.” A few hours later, the former president stepped all over this reporting, publishing this missive to his social media platform: For now, let’s not spend a lot of time pointing out every individual error of fact and judgment in the Republican’s missive. Fair-minded observers already know, for example, that the indictment in the classified documents case wasn’t “illegal” and that Jan. 6 wasn’t a “hoax.” What stood out as notable in this 123-word missive was how predictably Trumpy it was. The idea that the Republican would be “toning down his Trumpiness” in the wake of Saturday’s shooting in Pennsylvania is belied by the fact that his missive was effectively identical to everything he’s been saying for months. The former president pushed baseless conspiracy theories, targeted writer E. Jean Carroll in ways his defense counsel would probably advise against, peddled a familiar-but-nonsensical claim about his alleged election interference efforts in Georgia, and so on. What’s the tonal difference between Trump’s message this morning and the GOP candidate’s standard rhetoric from recent months? There is no tonal difference. Around this time yesterday, Trump published an item that read, simply, “UNITE AMERICA!” In light of Monday’s missive, it’s hardly unreasonable to wonder whether he defines “unity” as everyone agreeing with his conspiratorial vision and his desire to avoid accountability for wrongdoing."

Authorities said the man killed in the assassination attempt on Trump was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore of Sarver, Pennsylvania. At a news conference Sunday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Comperatore dived on his family to protect them and had “died a hero.” The Democratic governor called Comperatore an avid Trump follower who had been excited to be at the rally. “Corey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. And most especially, Corey loved his family,” Shapiro said. President Joe Biden also praised Comperatore on Sunday. “He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired,” Biden said at a White House news conference. “And he lost his life. God love him.” Two other rallygoers from Pennsylvania were reported to have been critically injured in the shooting: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. They were both listed in stable condition as of Sunday. Shapiro ordered that the American and Pennsylvania flags be flown at half-staff. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates."
"Biden, Warnock thread a needle, contextualize political violence",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 9:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-warnock-thread-needle-contextualize-political-violence-rcna161930,"The morning after the attempted assassination targeting Donald Trump, Sen. Raphael Warnock did what the Georgia Democrat does just about every Sunday: He delivered a sermon from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Not surprisingly, Warnock condemned the shooting, prayed for the former president’s well-being and said how thankful he was that Trump wasn’t seriously hurt. But Warnock also took some time to widen the aperture. As a Washington Post report noted, Warnock said the man who tried to kill Trump “was no patriot — and neither were the people who attacked our Capitol and assaulted police officers and tried to stop the nonviolent transfer of political power on Jan. 6.” The senator added, “They are cut from the same cloth. We must cry foul, we must call out the hypocrisy of anybody who would try to condone one and condemn the other.” These comments came to mind hours later, as President Joe Biden delivered an Oval Office address that touched on a very similar message. Like Warnock, the Democratic president condemned the attempt on his rival’s life, and like the senator, Biden also took care to contextualize the violence. From the transcript: Biden moments later, “There is no place in America for this kind of violence or for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.” This is a tricky needle to thread. On the one hand, Biden and his allies have been categorical in denouncing the assassination attempt. Democratic officials have steered clear of finger-pointing and conspiracy theories, recognizing the seriousness of the shooting and the importance of condemning what happened in no uncertain terms. On the other hand, the incumbent president and his allies also want to remind the public that a responsible part of any conversation about political violence is Trump’s own record. As recently as a few months ago, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee sat down with Time magazine and was asked about the possibility of post-election violence. Trump replied, “If we don’t win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election.” This wasn’t an isolated incident. Even Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, explained in 2016 that Trump had “a consistent pattern of inciting violence.” In the years that followed, during and after his term, Trump repeatedly offered evidence to bolster the thesis. When an attacker targeted Pelosi’s home, Trump went after the House speaker emerita and peddled ridiculous conspiracy theories. When extremists plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Trump launched an offensive against the Democratic governor and described the plot as “fake.” (Juries disagreed.) Trump wasn't just responsible for Jan. 6 violence, he’s basing part of his campaign on championing the interests of rioters. Biden and Warnock took care to connect the dots. The point isn’t to downplay the indefensible attempt on Trump’s life; the point is to argue that political violence is always wrong, even when Trump suggests otherwise. It’s a relevant detail as the public conversation continues."
Judge Aileen Cannon dismisses Trump classified documents case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 7:12 AM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 9:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/aileen-cannon-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-case-rcna161879,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Donald Trump on Monday. The Trump appointee wrote that special counsel Jack Smith's appointment ""violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."" The ruling followed a hearing on the subject in which Trump and his supporters pressed that argument. In the Supreme Court immunity ruling earlier this month, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion raising questions about the lawfulness of Smith's appointment, which Cannon cited in her ruling dismissing the case against the former president. The appointments clause states: Citing that provision, Cannon concluded that Attorney General Merrick Garland didn’t have the authority to appoint Smith, who isn’t a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney. The bottom line of her lengthy opinion is that:   Cannon separately found another constitutional violation regarding Smith’s funding, under the Constitution’s appropriations clause, which the defense also raised in the hearing. Smith can appeal the dismissal and the Supreme Court may ultimately determine the lawfulness of Smith's appointment. No other justices joined Thomas' opinion but Smith's appointment wasn't at issue in the immunity case, so it's unclear how many other justices may agree with Thomas. Trump was charged last year with unlawfully retaining national defense information and obstruction. He pleaded not guilty. He was charged alongside two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who also pleaded not guilty. The case's dismissal applies to them as well. Smith brought the federal charges in the Southern District of Florida, where Cannon sits. She was randomly assigned to the criminal case, as is customary. But her assignment was notable because she had ruled for Trump during previous litigation following the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. Cannon was reversed during that litigation by the federal appeals court that could also review her dismissal of the indictment if Smith appeals. Monday’s dismissal is an escalation of Cannon’s unusual handling of the case that had largely favored Trump to this point, raising questions about both her lack of experience and her disposition toward the former president who appointed her. Cannon had been handling motions slowly and there wasn’t an active trial date when she dismissed the case. So it already wasn’t likely to be tried before the election and, if Trump wins the election, he’s poised to get rid of both of his federal criminal cases himself. The question now, if Trump loses the election, is whether it will ever go forward, and whether Smith will seek to convince the appeals court to remove Cannon from the case in connection with any appeal he takes. But even if Cannon’s dismissal is reversed on appeal, that doesn’t mean that an appeals court would necessarily kick her off the case. So there’s a scenario in which Smith could get the dismissal reversed on appeal but the case would then go back to Cannon, where she would still need to rule on many other pretrial issues before any trial could go forward.

Republicans press Dems to stop calling Trump a threat to democracy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 8:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-press-dems-stop-calling-trump-threat-democracy-rcna161894,"After the assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump, many of his Republican allies didn’t just blame Democrats for the gunman, they also pointed to a very specific line of criticism. As a HuffPost report summarized: Johnson had plenty of company. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise added that Democrats have been “fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America.” Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina claimed that the shooting in Pennsylvania was “aided and abetted by the radical Left and corporate media incessantly calling Trump a threat to democracy, fascists, or worse.” Around the same time, former Attorney General Bill Barr said on Fox News: “The Democrats have to stop their grossly irresponsible talk about Trump being an existential threat to democracy. He is not.” There’s no shortage of relevant angles to this, but as the public discussion continues to unfold, let’s keep a few details in mind. First, at least at this point in the investigation, there is no evidence to suggest that the nature of the Democratic criticisms led to the attempt on the former president’s life. Second, if Republicans are convinced that this specific line of argument is beyond the pale, they might want to take it up with their presumptive presidential nominee. It was literally last week when Trump described the Biden administration as a “fascist government,” as his campaign operation issued a fundraising appeal asserting as fact that President Joe Biden is “a threat to democracy.” Two weeks earlier, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND EXISTENCE OF OUR COUNTRY ITSELF!!!” The hysterical missive dovetailed with months of rhetoric in which Trump has told voters the United States would likely cease to exist if he loses. As best as I can tell, not one of the Republicans demanding that Democrats abandon their talking point took issue with Trump’s rhetoric. Third, at least some of the GOP voices insisting that Democrats stop characterizing Trump as a threat to democracy appear to know better. In Barr’s case, for example, Trump pressed him to prosecute his political rivals before Election Day 2020, then pressed him to help overturn the results. The Republican lawyer also recently reflected on instances in which Trump, during his White House tenure, would sometimes “lose his temper” and talk about killing people who upset him. It is, in other words, odd to hear Barr claim that it’s wrong to see Trump as an opponent of democracy. Fourth, the former president’s allies are effectively demanding that their rivals stop repeating a claim that remains rooted in fact. As we’ve discussed, this is a candidate who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. All of which leads us to the apparent motivation for the GOP pushback: Republicans want to convince Democrats to stop repeating a politically potent truth ahead of the 2024 elections. That seems unlikely to happen."
"Judge Cannon sides with Trump, dismisses classified docs case",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 7:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-cannon-sides-trump-dismisses-classified-docs-case-rcna161882,"When Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices sided with Donald Trump in the immunity case two weeks ago, Justice Clarence Thomas took it upon himself to add a highly provocative concurring opinion. Special counsel Jack Smith’s office, the far-right jurist argued, is of dubious constitutional legitimacy. As NBC News reported late last week, the appointed prosecutor urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon not to take Thomas’ concurring opinion into consideration in the classified documents case. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained on Monday morning, the controversial Trump-appointed Florida judge did it anyway. As Trump confronts dozens of felony counts across multiple jurisdictions, the classified documents case stands out for a reason: It’s the toughest to defend. Last summer, even a Senate Republican was willing to concede that the case looked like a “slam dunk” for prosecutors. And yet, as things currently stand, the case is no more, despite the mountain of incriminating evidence. It’s important to emphasize that Cannon didn’t dismiss the case on the merits; this was done on procedural grounds. In other words, the judge didn’t say Trump is innocent; she said Smith’s appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional and therefore the prosecutor didn’t have the authority to file the case in the first place. By any fair measure, these developments aren’t just surprising, they’re also bizarre. As a New York Times report explained, “The ruling by Judge Cannon ... flew in the face of previous court decisions reaching back to the Watergate era that upheld the legality of the ways in which independent prosecutors have been named.” Noah Rosenblum, a professor at New York University’s School of Law, said he had been skeptical of the idea that Cannon was undermining the rule of law to protect Trump but added that his perspective has changed. “This is bonkers,” Rosenblum wrote online in response to the judge’s dismissal of the case. “She is just making things up.” Making matters even more dramatic is the recent pattern of events. A recent New York Times report noted: “Judge Cannon has exhibited hostility to prosecutors, handled pretrial motions slowly and indefinitely postponed the trial, declining to set a date for it to begin even though both the prosecution and the defense had told her they could be ready to start this summer.” She has also, incidentally, repeatedly given observers reason to question her competence, lent credence to questions that legal experts consider absurd, refused to assign pretrial motions to a more experienced magistrate judge for reasons that are difficult to defend, and justified procedural delays by pointing to logjams that she created. I’m reminded anew of an infamous quote attributed to Roy Cohn: “Don’t tell me what the law is, tell me who the judge is.” The special counsel’s office seems likely to appeal to the 11th Circuit, which has already reversed Cannon before in this case. University of Michigan law professor Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and an MSNBC legal analyst, wrote online Monday morning that Cannon’s latest move might actually be good for Smith, since the prosecutor can use these developments to ask the appeals court for the case “to be reassigned to a new judge.” Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Clarence Thomas gives Aileen Cannon more ammunition against Jack Smith,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 12:20 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 7:18 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/clarence-thomas-aileen-cannon-trump-jack-smith-rcna161172,"UPDATE (July 15, 2024, 10:18 a.m. ET): Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday dismissed the Justice Department's classified documents case against Donald Trump. While the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling is a gift to Donald Trump, it raises open questions like exactly which parts of the federal election interference case are immune from prosecution. But one thing is clear: Justice Clarence Thomas is questioning the validity of special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment in the first place. “I write separately to highlight another way in which this prosecution may violate our constitutional structure,” Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in the immunity case, Trump v. United States. “In this case, the Attorney General purported to appoint a private citizen as Special Counsel to prosecute a former President on behalf of the United States,” Thomas continued, adding that he’s “not sure that any office for the Special Counsel has been ‘established by Law,’ as the Constitution requires.” Even if the special counsel has a valid office, Thomas wrote, “questions remain as to whether the Attorney General filled that office in compliance with the Appointments Clause.” If the appointments clause sounds familiar, that may be because it was the basis for the unusual hearing recently held by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Trump’s other federal criminal case — the classified documents prosecution in Florida. One of the reasons that the hearing was unusual is that the legality of Smith’s appointment didn’t seem to be a close question. Now we know that at least one Supreme Court justice thinks it’s a question that may benefit Trump. Thomas had raised the issue during the oral argument in April as well. Trump’s lawyers seized on Thomas’ concurrence in a filing to Cannon after the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, writing that Thomas’ view “adds force” to their pending appointments clause motion, on which Cannon is yet to rule. To be sure, no other justice joined Thomas’ concurrence. But Smith’s appointment wasn’t the issue in the immunity case, so we don’t know how a majority of the court would rule if the issue were squarely presented. In the meantime, Thomas’ concurrence, in addition to the immunity ruling itself, presents Cannon with an additional opportunity to further complicate Trump’s prosecution.

Republican National Convention kicks off after Trump rally shooting,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 6:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republican-national-convention-2024-trump-shooting-rcna161855,"The Republican National Convention is set to kick off Monday in Milwaukee amid apprehension over the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump this weekend. Long a formality, the four-day convention will be a subject of intense interest this year and has already been changed in light of the shooting at the Trump campaign rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday that injured the presumptive GOP nominee and left one attendee dead and two injured. Trump told the New York Post on Sunday that he is rewriting what was set to be ""an extremely tough speech"" about ""the corrupt, horrible administration"" of President Joe Biden in favor of a speech aimed at unifying the country. The schedule for Monday remains the same, however, with speakers who will argue that Trump's plans for broad tariffs and lower taxes will kickstart the economy. The official theme of the day is ""Make America Wealthy Again."" Trump is also expected to announce his running mate sometime this week, possibly as early as today. The shortlist of contenders reportedly includes Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Sen. JD Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. The pick will receive extra scrutiny due to the unsuccessful attempt on Trump's life. In an interview with ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show"" in mid-May, Trump said that the pick would be ""somebody that can ideally help you get the votes"" but that they also needed to be able to step in as commander in chief. ""You need somebody that can be good just in case — that horrible 'just in case,'"" he said. Trump is set to be formally nominated by the Republican delegates on Thursday, the last day of the convention. He is expected to deliver a speech that evening. In a statement Monday, U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle noted that the shooting had raised questions about security at the Republican convention and said that the agency had already ""implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday"" to provide additional protection. ""I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,"" she said. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
"After shooting, will guns still be allowed near the Republican convention?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 6:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shooting-will-guns-still-allowed-republican-convention-rcna161857,"Not surprisingly, those hoping to bring firearms into the Republican National Convention will be disappointed: Guns are strictly prohibited inside the Milwaukee venue. But what about the area outside the arena? The inner perimeter will have similar gun restrictions, though as my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted last month, “Open and concealed carry will be permitted up to within a few blocks of the event space, per Wisconsin state law.” In the wake of the attempted assassination targeting Donald Trump on Saturday, Wisconsin’s governor believes it’s time to change that policy. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: In theory, the Democratic governor’s request seems entirely sensible. In practice, it’s unlikely to go anywhere. As the local report added, “The power to ban firearms in the security ‘footprint’ outside the credentials-only ‘hard’ security zone seems to rest with the state, not the Secret Service, the RNC or the City of Milwaukee.” A New York Times report noted that some local officials tried to change the policy months ago — long before a gunman targeted the former president — pushing a city ordinance that would’ve banned firearms near the convention site. It failed. As the Times’ article noted, “The city is prevented from regulating firearms beyond state law, officials said.” What we’re left with is a situation in which the Secret Service doesn’t have the authority to expand the existing security footprint. The governor can’t do it, either. Neither can Republican National Committee organizers. Even local officials can’t act, despite wanting to. Under Wisconsin’s current state law, local communities can’t approve gun policies that go further than state law — and since state law allows open and concealed carry, Milwaukee’s hands are tied. Ideally, the Republicans’ gerrymandered majority in the state legislature could’ve taken steps along these lines, but there wasn't any such appetite among GOP lawmakers. That said, it’d be an overstatement to suggest that the area outside the venue will have zero restrictions. The Journal Sentinel reported in May: “Those looking to cross into the area immediately outside the Republican National Convention perimeter will likely have to leave behind non-plastic containers, tennis balls and other typically innocuous items. What won’t be prohibited: Guns.” Alderman Robert Bauman told the newspaper at the time, “I find that totally absurd. Literally, you can’t have tennis balls, but you can have an AR-15 assault rifle.”"
GOP lawmaker: Shooting means Trump ‘just won’ the election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 5:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-lawmaker-shooting-means-trump-just-won-2024-election-rcna161849,"The day after the assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, Sen. John Fetterman told CNN: “It’s shocking and it’s a dark day for our nation. ... I’m just so glad Donald Trump is going to be OK.” The Pennsylvania Democrat added, “This isn’t an opportunity for politics or strategy or how this is going to play out.” The senator’s comments seemed more than fair under the terrible circumstances, but it appears at least one House Republican couldn’t quite help himself. Politico reported: The Wisconsin congressman might very well be right. Trump was well positioned before his recent debate with President Joe Biden, and his odds of success improved after the incumbent’s poor performance. What’s more, the Republican National Convention is poised to get underway in Milwaukee, and it’s quite common for candidates to get a bump after accepting their party’s nomination. The combination of factors — Trump’s existing lead, the convention, public sympathy in the wake of the shooting, et al. — makes it very easy to believe that he will soon be in an even stronger electoral position in the near future. But recent history suggests some caution is in order. For one thing, there have been plenty of moments, especially in the Trump era, in which the conventional wisdom was shaped by “this changes everything” commentary, only to discover that the developments did very little to change public attitudes. To be sure, an attempted assassination might be a qualitatively different kind of incident — or it might not. Time will tell, and those making assumptions should probably approach the question with a bit more humility. There’s also some precedent to draw upon. The attempt on Trump’s life deserves to be condemned in the strongest possible terms, but it’s not the first time something like this has happened in the United States. In 1975, for example, would-be assassins targeted President Gerald Ford more than once, and he nevertheless lost his re-election bid a year later. Six years later, President Ronald Reagan was nearly killed, and while he saw a brief bump in the polls, it did not last. Perhaps most notably, in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt was mounting a comeback bid when he was shot in the chest before delivering a speech in Milwaukee. (The former president went ahead and delivered the speech before going to the hospital.) A month later, Roosevelt nevertheless fell far short in the multi-candidate race, winning just six states. The point is, we’ll be hearing plenty of predictions about the electoral impact of Saturday’s shooting, but they should be taken with a grain of salt."
Republicans scramble to point fingers after assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-vance-point-fingers-biden-assassination-attempt-rcna161841,"UPDATE (July 15, 2024, 3:33 p.m. ET): Former President Donald Trump on Monday announced Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate in the 2024 race. The morning after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump’s life, House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared on the “TODAY” show and echoed a familiar sentiment. Those in the political sphere, the Louisiana Republican said, need to “turn the rhetoric down.” Some in his party had already done so. Others had not. “Joe Biden sent the orders,” Rep. Mike Collins of Georgia wrote online. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida added, “They tried to impeach him. They are trying to imprison him. Now, they have tried to assassinate him.” Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania — who attended Saturday’s rally — initially described the assassination attempt as an “attack from the left,” though he later deleted the message. But it was an argument from a GOP vice presidential contender that stood out as especially notable. NBC News reported: “Today is not just some isolated incident,” Vance wrote. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” It’s worth emphasizing for context that the missive was published at 8:20 p.m. ET — barely two hours after the assassination attempt. In other words, as much of the country was still learning about the heinous act, Vance’s instinct was to blame his domestic political foes. Amid talk of “unity” and bipartisan condemnations of the shooting, the GOP senator wasted little time in blaming Biden and his campaign. Part of the problem with Vance’s assessment is that it’s rooted in a claim that’s plainly untrue: At no point has the incumbent Democratic president or anyone on his campaign team argued that Trump “must be stopped at all costs.” The list of contemporary American politicians who’ve dipped their toes in the waters of political violence is painfully long, but Biden’s name isn’t on it. But just as important was the fact that Vance, in the immediate aftermath of an attempted assassination, took on the role of partisan attack dog. David Axelrod, a veteran of Barack Obama’s team, argued online a day later, “If @JDVance1 is on the short list for VP, this Tweet, sent an hour after the assassination attempt in PA, ought to disqualify him in the eyes of the Trump campaign.” Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., was thinking along the same lines, writing that Vance’s rhetoric “should absolutely disqualify” him from vice presidential consideration. The public won’t have to wait too much longer to find out whether the former president agrees: The Republican National Convention begins Monday in Milwaukee, and Trump’s announcement about his new running mate is imminent. Watch this space."
"Trump safe after Pennsylvania rally shooting; gunman and a spectator dead, officials say",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:58 PM PDT / Updated July 15, 2024, 4:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-rally-injury-sounds-secret-service-rushed-off-stage-rcna161738,"Former President Donald Trump said a bullet grazed his ear in a shooting at his campaign rally in western Pennsylvania, where one rally attendee was killed and two other spectators were injured on Saturday. The shooter is dead and the scene has been contained, officials said. Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, is ""fine"" and received treatment at a local medical facility, according to his campaign. The FBI has identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. In a call with reporters on Sunday, an FBI official said the agency had not yet identified Crooks' underlying ideology or motive. The FBI is characterizing the shooting as an assassination attempt and is investigating it as domestic terrorism, the official said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro identified the deceased spectator as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, the former chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company, which is located roughly 15 miles southeast of where the shooting occurred. “Corey was a girl dad,"" Shapiro said at a press conference Sunday afternoon. ""Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community.” Comperatore's family described him as a hero who died protecting his family at the rally, Shapiro said. The two other spectators injured in the shooting are 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to state police. Both men are listed in stable condition. Shots rang out around 6 p.m. while Trump was speaking on stage Saturday at his rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, located roughly 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. Trump appeared to briefly cover his ear before ducking onto the ground with Secret Service agents. Screams were heard from the crowd as the “pop” sounds rang out. Secret Service agents then rushed Trump off the stage and into a car as he pumped his fist in the air. His ear appeared to be bleeding and there seemed to be blood strewn across his face. The suspected shooter had fired multiple shots at the stage “from an elevated position outside of the rally venue,” Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. Secret Service agents “neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,” Guglielmi said. Law enforcement officials found multiple suspicious canisters or containers in the suspect’s vehicle in the aftermath of the shooting, NBC News reported, citing two officials. It's unclear whether they were functional as incendiary or explosive devices. In a Truth Social post published about three hours after the shooting, Trump said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."" ""I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,"" he said. ""Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.” Trump posted to Truth Social again early Sunday morning, saying in part: ""In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win."" The shooter used a semiautomatic rifle, based on what was found at the scene, three senior U.S. law enforcement officials told NBC News. The FBI said Sunday that it believes Crooks' father purchased the weapon, but the agency is still investigating how the shooter obtained it. State records show Crooks was a registered Republican. Federal Election Commission donor data reportedly listed a Thomas Crooks of Pittsburgh as having donated $15 to Act Blue, a political action committee that backs Democrats, in 2021, according to NBC News. It was not clear if that was the same Crooks identified by authorities. As law enforcement officials investigate the possible motivation behind the attack, details about the shooter's life are beginning to emerge. A former classmate of the shooter told NBC News that Crooks was ""bullied almost every day"" in high school. ""He would sit alone at lunch. I mean he was just an outcast,"" the classmate said, adding: ""It's honestly kind of sad."" Crooks' family is cooperating with investigators, a senior law enforcement official directly briefed on the matter told NBC News. Biden forcefully condemned the assassination attempt and called for national unity during a primetime address Sunday from the White House's Oval Office. “I want to speak to you tonight about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics,” Biden said. “We must stand together.” He continued: “The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a would-be assassin. ... Let’s remember here in America our unity is the most elusive of our goals. Nothing is more important for us now than standing together. We can do this.” Biden quickly decried the violence in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Saturday, calling it “sick"" and calling on all Americans to condemn it. Biden and Trump spoke late Saturday night, the White House said. A White House official described the call as “good, short and respectful,"" reported NBC News. Biden said in a statement earlier Saturday that he was grateful to hear Trump is “safe and doing well.” Vice President Kamala Harris also said she was relieved that Trump was not seriously injured. “We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting,” she said in a statement. A doctor at the rally who identified himself as Joseph told NBC News that he witnessed a man getting shot in the back of the head and falling to the bottom of the bleachers. The man appeared to have been instantly killed, he said, adding that a woman nearby also appeared to have been shot in the arm. Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, said in a statement that Pennsylvania State Police are working with local and federal law enforcement. “Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable,” the Democratic governor said. “It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States.” Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said his office is “in contact with those coordinating security planning” for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which begins on Monday. In a joint statement hours after the shooting unfolded, Trump and the Republican National Committee said the convention would proceed. Violent threats against public officials in the U.S. have been on the rise. Many Democratic and Republican officials similarly issued statements condemning political violence as news about the incident spread. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on X that he is “horrified” by the incident and relieved that Trump is safe. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he is “praying for President Trump.” Several Republican lawmakers explicitly blamed Biden and Democrats for the shooting in statements on social media before law enforcement officials had publicly identified the shooter and his motivation."
Transcript: Coming home,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/transcript-coming-home-rcna161829,"Transcript Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra Episode 5: Coming Home  The U.S. government’s search for American fascist Francis Yockey picks up steam as Yockey secretly returns home to America and joins forces with the growing pro-Nazi American ultra right. With investigators continually one step behind, Yockey suddenly turns up alongside one of the country’s most powerful political figures who is ascending toward the height of his powers. (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Anthony Mostrom: Well, in my twenties, I happened to walk into a used bookshop up in Van Nuys, California, where I was living.  Rachel Maddow: That’s journalist Anthony Mostrom.  Mostrom: It might have been the unusual book jacket design, but it just grabbed my eye. I had no idea what it was.  Maddow: That book that he spotted that day, it had a sort of a magenta-colored cover. It was thick as a phone book. And it was just strange enough looking that he decided, you know, what the heck. He stuck it under his arm, brought it up to the counter. Mostrom: I bought it. You know, it’s -- it was a used book for like five bucks or whatever, took it home. And, you know, after that, I didn’t really think much more about it. It was just sort of, I put it on -- in my home library. And it was just another one of my extremist books on my shelf, right? Maddow: Across the country, right around the same time, a historian named John Jackson was having a similar experience. John Jackson: I found a copy in the early 90s in a used bookstore. And so I went up to the counter and put it down. And, the -- the bookseller kind of looks at the book and kind of looks at me, a big, bald white man, (LAUGHTER) and kind of says something like: “Oh, that’s a controversial book.” (LAUGHTER) And I quick -- “I’m a historian! This is -- interested. I’m not a Nazi. Please don’t — please don’t think that.” Maddow: This book that both John Jackson and Anthony Mostrom are describing here, this book they both happened upon in used bookshops, it’s a book called “Imperium.” And the content of that book is why a bookshop owner might shoot a sideways glance at somebody who was picking it up. Mostrom: It’s very much an antisemitic book. It’s very much a hate book. Maddow: “Imperium” was published in the late 1940s, but only barely. Its initial print run was maybe a couple hundred copies. And the author of the book, that was kind of hard to figure out. The book was published under a pseudonym. Mostrom: Ulick Varange. Ulick is a given Irish name and Varange refers to a nomadic tribe of Vikings who some historians say were the first to settle Russia. Maddow: Ulick, or “Yoo-lick,” Varange was listed as the author. But that was a false name. “Imperium” had to be released under a false name because the real author of the book, when he wrote this thing, he was on the run. Ulick Varange was the pseudonym of the American fascist Francis Parker Yockey. By the late 1940s, by the time he wrote this book, Yockey had been wanted for questioning about his relationship with a Nazi saboteur who was executed in the United States during World War II.  Reporter: They brought with them a great store of explosives with which to blow up factories and demoralize civilian life. Maddow: He had been linked to the German American Bund and to the Silver Shirts, the leadership of which had been charged with sedition during World War II. Yockey himself had gone AWOL from the U.S. Army. He’d been thrown out of the U.S. Army, which listed him as a Nazi sympathizer. And, after all that, astonishingly, he had been given a job as a U.S. government lawyer at the Nazi war crimes trials in Germany.  Reporter: Twenty-two Nazi war criminals went on trial at two minutes after 10 this morning. Maddow: Once there, he became a mole inside the prosecutions, using his position to surreptitiously help the Nazi defendants he was sent there to prosecute. Army counterintelligence files from the time say Yockey also was trying to recruit German Army officers, Nazi veterans, into an underground movement that would rise up against the Allied occupying forces in Germany. But when U.S. intelligence officials decided they wanted to go question him, he was gone. Mostrom: He’s being tracked by U.S. intelligence, yet he’s able somehow to fly out of Germany without any -- you know, no one stopping him. Maddow: Francis Yockey somehow slipped out of Germany ahead of the counterintelligence agents who were looking for him. He left behind his wife and his two young daughters.  Jackson: What do they call it in the spy shows? He goes to ground. Mostrom: Yockey is always slipping in and out, using false passports, false names, and just jumping from continent to continent. Maddow: Where Yockey first surfaces is way off the beaten path. Mostrom: He secured a room at a small inn on the Irish coast to write what would eventually become a 600-page book which was called “Imperium.” Maddow: Francis Yockey holed himself up inside that little cottage for months working on that book that you can still stumble across in a used book shop. You can get odd glances from the shop owner if you dare pick it up. You might also find one of the many newer editions and reprints of this book, or the French edition, or the Spanish edition, or the one in German. Mostrom: For a lot of people on the far right worldwide nowadays, the bible is “Imperium,” replacing “Mein Kampf.” Maddow: The book that Francis Yockey churned out inside that cottage on the Irish coast is a sprawling, unrelenting, 600-page long, super boring fascist battle cry. It’s basically an argument for the creation of a global fascist empire to finish what Hitler started. The book is actually dedicated to Hitler. Yockey calls him the hero of the Second World War. The book calls Jewish people culture distorters. It rants about the supposedly poisoned bloodstream and lost vitality of the West. It’s all the fault of the Jews and it’s the fault of democracy. Jackson: It is the duty of the West to rule the world, and that can only be accomplished through strong leadership, democracy is a sham, and the Jews are the great enemy and need to be dealt with. Maddow: Democracy is a sham and America is a lost cause. According to Yockey, America’s global influence was really just another way for the Jews to secretly control the world.  In “Imperium” and also in his later writings, what set Yockey’s Nazi claptrap apart from other more garden-variety Nazi claptrap is that while he was harshly critical of the U.S., Yockey said he admired Russia instead, not for its communism, but for its antisemitism, for the Stalinist show trials and purges and pogroms and murders of Jews.  He thought Russia had a pure and somehow primitive culture that was preferable to America’s modern, terrible multiracial democracy. And so, in Francis Yockey’s “Imperium,” Europe would finish the genocide of the Jews, and would have a fascist empire in cahoots with Russia against the Great Satan, which was the United States.  Down with NATO, up with Russia. That is what Francis Yockey cooked up while on the run from American authorities. Mostrom: The Yockey lore is that he wrote the book in six months, all 600 pages, without any notes, no books, no references. Jackson: They always talk about, oh, Yockey was such a genius that he sat in this little cottage in Ireland, just didn’t have any books to refer to, and just came -- and just knew all this stuff and wrote it up, you know, which is not the way you write a scholarly book, right? (LAUGHTER) Yeah, well, it’s easy. It’s easy. You don’t need a library of stuff if you’re just making it up. Maddow: Yockey’s manifesto would have decades of influence on the American right. It was also nonsense. It was just made up.  And it was also the American starting point for one of the most dangerous lies in human history. For people like Yockey, who wanted to revive Nazism who wanted to keep the fascist dream alive after World War II, explaining the monstrous body count from the Nazis’ time in power was a real challenge.  There were basically two paths you could choose. The first path, the most direct path, was to argue that the Holocaust was good, that it was somehow justified, that the Nazis had a right to do it.  That defense was tried at the war crimes trials. Prosecutor: During the first nine months of Ohlendorf’s year in command, this force destroyed more than 90,000 human beings, killed at an average rate of 340 per day. Maddow: The trial of this one particular Nazi commander is famous still to this day.  Mostrom: An S.S. commander named Otto Ohlendorf was responsible for the killing of about 90,000 Ukrainians during World War II. Maddow: This remains a notorious case even decades later, not only because of the huge number of victims attributed to this one Nazi S.S. commander, but also because of the defense that was mounted for him at trial.  His defense was that it wasn’t a crime to kill tens of thousands of civilians, it wasn’t even a bad thing, because the victims were Jews. S.S. death squads needed to kill every Jewish man, woman and child they could find because even Jewish babies were going to still grow up to be Jews, and Jews were inherently communists, and communism was an existential threat to Germany.  So, those civilian massacres, the defense argued, those massacres of tens of thousands of people, those were necessary, they were justified. This wasn’t just a defense of this one accused Nazi war criminal. This was an argument for Nazism, for the Holocaust, for what they did. American prosecutors at that trial, when they realized that was the defense they were up against, they were just shocked by it. Prosecutor: Some of these defendants still believe that what they did was not murder because the victims were Jews. No system of domestic or international penal law could possibly survive under which the determination of guilt for murder is governed by the political or religious creed or racial origin of the victim. Maddow: The lawyer who mounted that defense in that case, the ubiquitous Nazi defense lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer, he got help in preparing that defense. Mostrom: Yockey would surreptitiously send exculpatory documents to Ohlendorf’s defense lawyer behind the scenes. Maddow: American fascist Francis Yockey had used his position at the American war crimes trials in Germany to steal material to help in the notorious Ohlendorf defense. So, Yockey tried that path. He tried claiming the Nazis were right to do what they did. But he also tried the other path, the more insidious path, which was to deny that any of it happened.  Yockey wrote in “Imperium” that gas chambers -- quote -- “did not exist” and that thousands of people who had supposedly been killed weren’t killed at all, because they -- quote -- “published accounts of their experiences in these camps.”  Yockey’s book “Imperium” is considered by some scholars to be the first written instance, the earliest example of Holocaust denial by an American. Yockey was writing this just after World War II had ended, while the world was still absorbing the scale of the Nazis’ atrocities, the images of the concentration camps and the gas chambers.  This isn’t even history at that point. It’s current events.  There are myriad living survivors who escaped the horrors themselves, thousands of Allied troops who liberated the camps, who saw it all with their own eyes. Yockey himself had just come from the Nuremberg trials, which dealt with vast, vast quantities of evidence. Prosecutor: Deliberate, premeditated murder, murder on a gigantic scale, murder committed for the worst of all possible motives. Maddow: But Yockey would write that none of it had happened, that it was all a hoax.  And then he was on the move again. U.S. authorities tracked him to Italy, where he spoke at fascist meetings. They tracked him to England, where he gave speeches and did organizing for the British fascists led by Sir Oswald Mosley, who had been imprisoned during the war. Yockey helped form something called the European Liberation Front. Mostrom: Yockey wrote that the European Liberation Front was calling for the expulsion of all Jews and other parasitic aliens from the soil of Europe. Maddow: Advocating for expelling all Jewish people from Europe, writing America’s “Mein Kampf,” sowing the first American seeds of Holocaust denial, that’s what Francis Yockey was working on.  But Yockey would not just be a problem we created and then unleashed on the world, a rogue American fascist who we exported. He was about to become our problem, too, because he was about to come home to the America that he hated. He had friends here who wanted him to get to work here. And he did in what would turn out to be surprisingly high places. This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.”  Steven Ross: Democracy, he argued, is no good. His goal was to seize the American government  Sen. Joseph McCarthy: I’m completely dissatisfied with this whole investigation. Any man who can add two and two must be dissatisfied. Ross: He attracts all kinds of far-right people to his group  Sen. Herman Welker: One of the greatest living foes of communist slavery, that man is Joe McCarthy!  ******************************** Maddow: Episode 5: Coming Home. It was a big ad in The L.A. Times for a multi-day convention that was going to be held in downtown Los Angeles. Four days at the Embassy Auditorium. And there was a huge photo of the headline speaker for the event. It took up almost half the ad.  In the unlikely event that readers didn’t recognize his very famous face, there was his name right across the top in big letters: Gerald L.K. Smith. Gerald L.K. Smith: Preserve America as a Christian nation. Ross: Gerald L.K. Smith was a religious leader, a self-proclaimed religious leader who in many ways took over the mantle of antisemitism from Father Coughlin. Maddow: That’s historian and author Steven Ross. Before World War II, Gerald L.K. Smith headed up something called the America First Party. During the war, he ran for president on the America First Party platform, which included the sterilization and expulsion of all Jewish people from the United States. Gerald L.K. Smith: There is a highly-organized campaign to substitute Jewish tradition for Christian tradition. Maddow: After the war was over, Gerald L.K. Smith shifted from his America First Party to a new organization. He called it the Christian Nationalist Crusade. Ross: He attracts all kinds of people, all kinds of far-right people to his group. Their enemies are Jews and communists who are trying to take over America, and we loyal Christians are going to stop this effort to pervert our country. Maddow: It’s Los Angeles in the summer of 1950, and Gerald L.K. Smith is gearing up to treat his followers to four whole days of that. Mostrom: Some of the speakers included one of Smith’s loyal lieutenants. She spoke against what she called mongrelization of the white race in the United States. And this seems to have been the main theme of the conference, actually. Maddow: Journalist Anthony Mostrom again. Mostrom: It’s kind of hard to believe for us now, especially a native Angeleno like myself, to think that this was a well-attended convention of very far right-wing political speakers, but there they were. Maddow: There they were, packed into the Embassy Auditorium. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: Thousands of people. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: There was one speaker at the Embassy Auditorium for that event who was a surprise to the crowd. He hadn’t been listed on the program, but Gerald L.K. Smith got up himself and told the crowd who he was, and that he would be speaking.  He was a young man with an unusual name. He introduced him as Ulick Varange. It was Francis Yockey.  Mostrom: Yockey was the only one, to my knowledge, who was not mentioned in the programs at all, probably because of his outlaw status at this point. Maddow: Francis Yockey had come home, back to the United States. He was wanted by U.S. authorities, wanted for questioning. But, somehow, he slipped back into the country undetected. And once he was here, he linked up with the remnants of the America First movement. He started speaking at these Gerald L.K. Smith rallies across the country, in the Midwest, in Oklahoma, in California. FBI files record that these events featured calls to lock up President Harry Truman, lock him up for treason. One speaker claimed that he had inside information that one of Truman’s top White House advisers had been forced to change his name because he was secretly a pedophile. One speaker yelled to the crowd that the real Communist Party in this country is the Democratic Party. And then Francis Yockey, with a speech that would take the bark off a tree. Mostrom: The substance of Yockey’s oration was that the Nuremberg trials, which he had attended and which he worked as part of, that the Nuremberg trials were a sham and that thousands of what he called white Christian Germans had been convicted without trial, and that the Jews control the world today. Maddow: According to accounts from the time, Francis Yockey was the only speaker in Los Angeles to receive a full-on standing ovation from the crowd. Mostrom: Yockey would later boast to a friend that he delivered what he called a tremendous speech to this convention’s 3,000 attendees. Maddow: That is not a typical way to hide from the feds when you’re wanted for questioning. But there he is, after years on the run, back home, basking in the applause, somehow staying one step ahead of investigators.  Mostrom: J. Edgar Hoover was -- was being apprised of Yockey’s movements. There are thousands of documents that Hoover himself signed off on, telling various FBI offices across the country where there might have been a sighting of Yockey.  Maddow: While FBI files and newspaper archives trace the trail of Yockey’s 1950 speaking tour with Gerald L.K. Smith, the man whose speeches were the real hot ticket in American politics just then was a senator. Welker: One of the greatest living foes of communist slavery, that man is Joe McCarthy. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: In early 1950, Senator Joe McCarthy had delivered the speech that would make him a household name, his “I hold in my hand the list of known communists” speech. That speech was only a few months after his crusade to try to make the Malmedy massacre trial a scandal. Multiple reviews of the Malmedy case and a comprehensive, monthslong Senate investigation disproved the kinds of wild claims he was making. The Senate investigation even found that where those lies came from was from unrepentant Nazis who were trying to come back to power in Germany. But those conclusions, the actual truth of the matter, never got much traction in the press. The false allegations got headlines, the truth not so much.  “The New York Times” put on its front page the -- quote -- “storm of charges” about outright brutality by U.S. soldiers.  But then the determination that that storm of charges had been made up, and made up by Nazis, and made up specifically to hurt the United States, well, that didn’t make the front page, nor did the much more explosive story lurking there in plain sight, which was that senators like Joe McCarthy had uncritically stovepiped a false and dangerous Nazi propaganda operation right into the United States Senate and, well, right onto the front pages of “The New York Times.”  Reporter: The senators are probing reports that the Germans were beaten and starved to get confessions from them. Maddow: McCarthy’s lurid and outrageous lies had been comprehensively disproven. They’d even been exposed as a Nazi propaganda plot. But McCarthy never paid for that, because he was learning in real time that shocking lies will always get more and better press than the calm, rational debunking of those lies.  And if you are a talented and ambitious demagogue, that’s the kind of lesson you don’t forget. That’s more than a lesson. That’s a game plan. Reporter: Hearings on Senator McCarthy’s charges of communism in the State Department developed into a committee wrangle to find out whether McCarthy had in his files the name of the high official who allegedly covered up commies. Maddow: McCarthy’s shocking, confrontational claims about all the supposed communists he knew about in the government, those claims got a ton of press, just as his claims about Malmedy had got a ton of press. And, just like Malmedy, those claims would soon be the subject of a full-blown Senate investigation. Reporter: You believe, as of the moment, there are communists in the State Department?  McCarthy: Communists or worse. Reporter: Or what? McCarthy: Communists or worse. Reporter: Want to name a few? Maddow: When the Senate started its investigation into McCarthy’s claims about communists in the government, he did what he had done in the Malmedy case. He basically hijacked the investigation and turned it into a spectacle. Sen. Millard Tydings: Have you in your possession any memorandum, any affidavit, any paper, any photostat, or other material which would tell us who this individual is, not where you got it, not how you got it, not who gave it to you, but have you the material? McCarthy: All of the affidavits... Tydings: Oh. McCarthy: ... all of the photostats...  Tydings: Why don’t you say you haven’t got it or you have got it? McCarthy: All the affidavits, all the photostats are easily accessible to you. You can get them without any trouble at all. They’re all in those files. Maddow: Senator Millard Tydings led this investigation, and he and McCarthy wrangled for months. The investigation looked into all of McCarthy’s claims exhaustively. And, just like with the Malmedy case, this investigation also concluded that McCarthy basically didn’t know what he was talking about. But it wasn’t just that he was wrong. It was worse than that.  Tydings said that what McCarthy was pushing was not just false. It was pernicious. It was confusing and dividing the American public. Like the Malmedy investigation, though, this official debunking of his false claims, the spotlighting of what damage those false claims were doing, it didn’t make much of a splash.  What did make a splash had been McCarthy’s initial shocking charges, and also his new charge when the investigation was over, when McCarthy said it had all been rigged. McCarthy: I’m completely dissatisfied with this whole investigation. Any man who can add two and two must be dissatisfied. We’ve had the most fantastic exhibition I have ever seen put on by a Senate committee.  Maddow: To McCarthy’s growing legion of fans, this rejection of him by the Senate was a call to arms. There was a cover-up. The whole Senate was in on it. The whole government was in on it. Joe was the only one they could trust. And so, naturally, McCarthy’s next step was to set out to destroy the man who had dared to oppose him. He started implying that this longtime conservative Senator Millard Tydings was maybe himself a communist. He said Tydings was -- quote -- “suspiciously kind to traitors.”  Then it got worse. Tydings was up for reelection that year. McCarthy and his staff produced a fake photo that made it look like Tydings was secretly meeting with a leading communist. They distributed that fake photo all across Tydings’s home state. And after holding that seat for 24 years, Millard Tydings lost. He was defeated for reelection, because that’s what you got when you crossed Joe McCarthy. McCarthy: Little Millard is with us no longer.  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Maddow: “Little Millard is with us no longer.” This was his playbook. The insistent, dangerous lying, the no-holds-barred revenge on anyone who confronted him, also the belittling of his opponents, the name-calling.  And then there were the journalists who seemed to make McCarthy the most viscerally upset. Drew Pearson: This is Drew Pearson. I’ll be back in a minute with a prediction on Senator McCarthy and the latest inside news from Washington. Maddow: Columnist Drew Pearson had done as much as any national reporter to criticize Joe McCarthy. McCarthy’s attacks on Pearson included violence.  In 1950, at the Sulgrave Club in Washington, D.C., McCarthy physically attacked Pearson. He tried to beat him up. He kneed him in the groin. He hit him in the head. He had to be pulled off of him. The American Veterans Committee called for McCarthy to be impeached from the Senate for that. But Pearson wasn’t the only one. When columnist Joe Alsop criticized McCarthy, McCarthy started calling him not Alsop, but “Al-Slop.” McCarthy: I don’t care how high-pitched becomes the screaming and squealing of the left-wing element of press and radio. I don’t care what the -- what the Drew Pearsons, and the Mark Childs, and the “Al-Slops” and the Time magazines, I don’t -- I don’t care what they have to say. I don’t care how much they scream and squeal.  As long as I am in the Senate, and I hope that’s for some time yet, as long as I am in the Senate, this task is not going to become a dainty task. And if anyone wants to come in and remove them in some dainty fashion, they are welcome to it. But in the absence of that, if lumberjack tactics are the only kind of tactics that that crowd understands, then take my word for it, those are the kind of tactics we are going to use on them.  Maddow: With each of these public battles, up to and including the name-calling and the violence, McCarthy, of course, turned off Americans who were repulsed by that kind of politics, by that kind of man. But not everyone disapproved. Gerald L.K. Smith: The two greatest symbols in this civilization are the cross and the flag. Maddow: Senator McCarthy was not only building an increasingly large, increasingly fervent mainstream public following, he was also becoming a hero, sort of a North Star, to figures on the edge, like Gerald L.K. Smith. Smith: Fight mongrelization and all attempts being made to force the intermixture of the Black and white races. Maddow: In 1950, not long after his Francis Yockey, anti-mongrelization, anti-Nuremberg speaking tour, Gerald L.K. Smith actually did work with Joseph McCarthy in the U.S. Senate. Anchor: Anna Rosenberg presented a detailed account of the new defense setup to a Senate committee. Maddow: Anna Rosenberg was one of the most accomplished women to have ever served in American national security. Among other things, she devised the national manpower plan for America’s wartime military buildup for World War II.  When the U.S. government created a new award at the end of the war, the Medal of Freedom, the first American ever given that award was Anna Rosenberg for her wartime service. But then, after the war, Anna Rosenberg had the misfortune of getting nominated to a top Defense Department job just as Joe McCarthy was reaching the height of his powers. David Austin Walsh: She was nominated to a position in the Defense Department.  Maddow: That’s author and historian David Austin Walsh.  Anna Rosenberg’s Pentagon nomination at first sailed right through the Senate Armed Services Committee. But then there was a hitch in the process. Walsh: McCarthy went after her. Maddow: McCarthy teamed up with Gerald L.K. Smith to try to make the Anna Rosenberg nomination into another national scandal. He met with one of Smith’s top aides who was becoming well-known in his own right as a Holocaust denier. He said his stated mission in meeting with McCarthy was to -- quote -- “keep the Zionist Jew Anna Rosenberg” from becoming -- quote -- “dictator” of the Pentagon.  McCarthy and his allies turned on the spigots of conservative media against her, and they persuaded the Senate to reopen Rosenberg’s confirmation hearings, whereupon McCarthy produced a bombshell witness who swore that he had personally met Anna Rosenberg at a communist meeting in New York.  But it wasn’t true. None of it was true. McCarthy’s star witness had never met Anna Rosenberg, not at a communist meeting, not anywhere. Rosenberg told the Armed Services Committee -- quote -- “I would like to lay my hands on that man. It is inhuman what he has done to me in the past few days.”  Her outrage was shared by at least one of the senators on that committee: Lester Hunt of Wyoming. He told reporters: “I just hope that no Hollywood producer ever gets hold of the complete transcript of this thing. If it were put into a movie, it would do more than anything so far to discredit Congress.”  Senator Lester Hunt had seen Joe McCarthy’s tactics up close during the Malmedy hearings, and now here it was again. Senator Hunt’s personal files show him writing to a colleague about McCarthy’s attacks on Anna Rosenberg, saying: “That’s all it’s summed up to be. She happens to be Jewish.”  Hunt’s files also reveal stacks of vile letters he got from the public, letters smearing Anna Rosenberg, accusing her of disloyalty and worse, none of it true. These smears were being spread by known antisemitic agitators like Gerald L.K. Smith, and also now by Lester Hunt’s own Senate colleague, Joe McCarthy. Walsh: McCarthy was happy to go along with it. He would take information wherever he could find it. And if it meant working with far-right people with a specific agenda, then he would do that. Maddow: And once you start down that kind of a road, it can get real dark real fast. That’s next. ******************************** Maddow: It used to be called East River Drive because it ran up the edge of Manhattan right alongside the East River. But, in 1945, after the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, they renamed it in his honor. It would now be FDR Drive, which must have seriously annoyed Yorkville. Ross: Yorkville had been the heart of Nazi America before World War II. Maddow: That’s historian and professor Steven Ross. Ross: If you were a Jew living in the Yorkville area, you had to be very afraid for yourself. You had to be very afraid of what you would wear that was openly Jewish, whether it’s a yarmulke or whether it was a Star of David. Maddow: In Yorkville, right at the end of World War II, a new American pro-Nazi group opened its headquarters on the East Side of Manhattan right near the newly christened FDR Drive.  They were funded in large part by a wealthy German-American who had been interned during World War II as a Nazi supporter. After the war ended, he funded Nazi groups in Europe and in Latin America and also in Manhattan, in Yorkville, the home of the new National Renaissance Party. Ross: The very name National Renaissance Party was inspired by Hitler’s last political testament. Before his suicide, he wrote that he hoped for a radiant renaissance of Nazism throughout the world inspired by what he had done in Germany. Maddow: A radiant renaissance of Nazism.  Ross: James Madole, who was head of the National Renaissance Party, was trying to mobilize New Yorkers and a nation to understand the Jewish, Black threat to white superiority, white Anglo-Saxon superiority. And therefore, he was holding regular demonstrations on 88th Street and First Avenue in New York, the heart of Yorkville. Maddow: The idea behind the National Renaissance Party was not subtle. This was not a soft sell they were making. Ross: He told a crowd in Yorkville -- and I’ll quote him -- “I will plant the swastika in Washington.” And he promised the crowd -- quote -- “What Hitler accomplished in Europe, the National Renaissance Party shall yet accomplish in America.” Maddow: The National Renaissance Party’s stock-in-trade was to be as visible and as provocative as possible.  Ross: They would dress in Nazi uniforms. They would give the Nazi salute. They would actually engage from time to time in open violence with Jewish war veterans. When Madole would deny the Holocaust ever occurred, they would often try to break through the police barriers and attack him. Sometimes, the Nazis won. Sometimes, the Jewish war veterans won. But the Nazis always claimed victory. Maddow: Street violence was sort of the calling card of the National Renaissance Party. That’s what they wanted to be known for, for their physical menace on the streets.  But they were aiming at more than just hurting people physically. They were trying both to terrorize and to galvanize. They were trying to set something off. Ross: Democracy, he argued, is no good. He would create a fascist government in America that would educate the entire country into sort of we would now call white supremacy.  There would be a rebellion that Christians, loyal Christians, would join in, understanding that Jews and Blacks were perverting their nation, and they would create a new country, a new renaissance that would create an America that would realize Hitler’s dreams for the world. Only, it would start in the U.S. rather than Germany. Maddow: The National Renaissance Party was small, but they were growing.  Ross: He had chapters in Atlanta. He had chapters in Louisville. He was trying to open chapters in every city in America.  And many of those chapters were accumulating arms. His goal was to seize the American government, either preferably through an election and, if not through an election, through amassing so many troops that they would take over the American government.  Maddow: It was still happening.  During World War II, the leaders of American pro-fascist and pro-Nazi groups that had done stuff like this, they’d all been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in what was called the Great Sedition Trial. Now, after the war, the most famous of all the Great Sedition Trial defendants... Reporter: George Sylvester Viereck, the man who has been prominent for several years as a Nazi propagandist --  Maddow: ... he was working as an early adviser to the National Renaissance Party. George Sylvester Viereck had been indicted in the Great Sedition Trial. But in addition to that sedition indictment, he had also been indicted and tried and convicted and imprisoned as a Nazi agent for coordinating a multimillion-dollar German propaganda operation that covertly targeted the American public. When he had been a highly paid, highly-placed agent for the Hitler government, Viereck’s secret weapon had been his close ties with America First members of Congress, like Senator Ernest Lundeen of Minnesota, for whom Viereck wrote speeches, like Congressman Hamilton Fish of New York, whose office Viereck used as a clearinghouse for literally tons, millions of pieces of German government propaganda. But in the post-war era, for groups like the National Renaissance Party, Hamilton Fish, Ernest Lundeen, politicians like that were the old class, the previous generation. Who could these guys hope to work with now?  Here’s Steven Ross with producer Mike Yarvitz. Mike Yarvitz: Were there any particular elected politicians that they liked, that they were kind of drawn to, that the National Renaissance Party saw as singing a similar tune as them?  Ross: Saint Joe. Joseph McCarthy was the one politician that James Madole and many of the others rallied around, that they thought he was the only one speaking the truth. Maddow: Saint Joe, Joseph McCarthy, that’s who the National Renaissance Party believed was their guy. Ross: Madole found Joe McCarthy the only American politician really worth listening to and supporting. He spoke their language. He never tried to dissociate from far right groups that supported him. And they considered him as, they would say at meetings, Saint Joe, and he was a true American patriot. Maddow: They took the name for their group from Hitler’s last testament. They had designs on a fascist government in America, and they were quite open about that.  Their stock-in-trade, what they were known for, was beating up Jewish people in the streets. They were working with a notorious convicted Nazi agent. And they believed there was one politician out there who was truly speaking for them. Ross: When Madole would start his meetings by heiling Hitler and then heiling McCarthy, word of that got back to McCarthy. He never said boo. He wasn’t going to stop any group that supported him, even if they were heiling Hitler. Maddow: Now, you can’t control who likes you. And while they were heiling him along with Hitler, it’s not like Senator McCarthy was heiling the National Renaissance Party right back. But it wasn’t a total mystery why they liked him. And it wasn’t only because of his public image. In the early 1950s, Senator McCarthy tapped an employee at the Library of Congress to help him as a researcher. That researcher -- his name was Eustace Mullins -- was also a member of the National Renaissance Party. He would occasionally refer to himself as “Fuhrer Mullins.”  There was also the speech.  In 1952, Senator Joseph McCarthy was invited and he quickly accepted an invitation to speak at an event that was billed as an “American-German Friendship Rally.”  The event, naturally, was in Yorkville. The chairman of the rally was from the National Renaissance Party. The list of scheduled speakers included a who’s who of early Holocaust deniers and antisemitic and pro-Nazi authors and also sitting Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy then enlisted someone to write a speech for him for that event, a man who, by this point, needs no introduction: Mostrom: There’s no doubt that Francis Parker Yockey met Senator Joe McCarthy. Maddow: Francis Parker Yockey, that’s who McCarthy brought on board.  Here’s journalist Anthony Mostrom: Mostrom: Yockey was staying in Washington, D.C., and he met McCarthy through a lawyer friend. Maddow: Francis Yockey at this point is on the run from American authorities. He had been a mole inside the war crimes trials in Germany to help the Nazis there. He had founded a group pledging to cleanse the soil of Europe of all Jews.  He had pioneered American Holocaust denial. He had published his 600-page fascist manifesto that was considered to be America’s “Mein Kampf.” It advocated for the creation of a fascist empire and the destruction of the United States of America. So, obviously, in a career like that, the next step is U.S. Senate speechwriter? But that is who McCarthy enlisted to write this speech for him, this speech for Yorkville.  Mostrom: Yockey landed what you might call an unusual job. And that job was writing the speech for Senator Joe McCarthy at a German-American Friendship meeting in Yorkville, New York. Maddow: Yockey wrote to a friend about it at the time. He explained that a lawyer for one of The Chicago Tribune’s chain of conservative newspapers had made the arrangements.  Through that lawyer, an appointment had been -- quote -- “arranged for me with Senator McCarthy for Saturday night.” Yockey said -- quote -- “He wanted me to write a speech for him based on a whole batch, a huge corpus of material, to have it ready by Monday.”  Even Yockey himself couldn’t quite seem to believe it. He said -- quote -- “There are still several things to settle with him” -- quote -- “but it looks as though I have a job.”  And, apparently, he did. And one of the ways we know he did is because the FBI was on to it too. The FBI became aware of the speech. And in FBI records from the time, they take great pains trying to give Senator McCarthy the benefit of the doubt, to say that, based on some passages of the speech, it looked like maybe the senator himself wrote it, although maybe it was this guy Yockey. They really couldn’t be certain.  The FBI reports say that Yockey’s -- quote -- “location at the present time is unknown.” But given what they were learning about this relationship between a powerful U.S. senator and this Nazi guy who they were searching for, given all the information they then had, the FBI memo says that agents -- quote -- “may desire to contact Senator McCarthy” to learn more.  Yeah, maybe.  Mostrom: If any anti-McCarthy journalist had learned about this connection, I think Joe McCarthy’s career would have been severely damaged right then and there. But the fact is, no one found out. Maddow: Senator Joe McCarthy, by this point in 1952, was ascending to the heights of American politics. He was building a major popular following. He had the conservative press cheering his every move.  He was running roughshod over his political enemies, both in the Democratic Party and also his own party. He had pushed a Nazi propaganda hoax to the American people about Jews in the U.S. Army in the Malmedy case supposedly torturing Nazi soldiers. He was also pushing for individual convicted Nazis both here and overseas to be freed from prison.  After helping win parole for American fascist William Pelley, McCarthy also helped Senator William Langer campaign for clemency for Martin Sandberger, a Nazi S.S. commander who had been convicted and sentenced at Nuremberg. In Congress, McCarthy worked with some of the most fire-breathing antisemites and Holocaust deniers to make false accusations against a prominent Jewish U.S. government official. And now McCarthy was hiring an influential American fascist to speechwrite for him.  The speech was about how America had been too tough on Germany in the war. It was to be delivered by McCarthy at an event chaired by a National Renaissance Party guy, which is literally a group that dresses up like Storm Troopers. The speech Yockey wrote for McCarthy -- you can read it in the FBI files -- it ends with a rallying cry that -- quote -- “We shall sweep America clear of its inner enemies.” Senator Joseph McCarthy never did deliver that speech in Yorkville that Francis Yockey wrote for him. And that is because the press, a handful of journalists, got wind of McCarthy’s involvement in that rally and they started exposing who McCarthy was preparing to share the stage with. The journalists reported that one of the announced speakers had been linked to street violence there in Yorkville. Another of the speakers was becoming renowned as a Holocaust denier. Another speaker had been calling for the execution, the hanging of Dwight Eisenhower. Another was quoted saying: “Here in America, we hate the Jews and the Negroes.”  After that reporting, Senator McCarthy’s office discovered that, actually, he had a scheduling conflict he hadn’t noticed before. His name was already printed on the posters for the Yorkville event, but they sent late word that Senator McCarthy could no longer make it. Mostrom: There was such an outcry that the roster of speakers was stuffed with pro-Nazis that canny Joe McCarthy decided to bail out. Maddow: In the end, Senator Joe McCarthy narrowly avoided reading the words that had been written for him by the fugitive godfather of American Holocaust denial. And, ironically, he probably had the press to thank for that. But while McCarthy’s political star was rising at the same time as his radicalism, while the circle around him was getting weirder and wilder and more and more reckless, so were his tactics, so was his war with the press, and so was his war with his fellow senators. Pearson: That Senator McCarthy will have no more luck bulldozing his fellow senators than he had in silencing me. What he doesn’t like from his fellow senators now is anyone who opposes him or exposes him.  McDaniel: His bullying and his dishonesty and his brazen willingness to ruin the lives of people who got in his way was something that Lester Hunt had never encountered, probably could not have imagined, until his encounter with McCarthy. Maddow: McCarthy’s bullying, his total dislocation from the truth, his increasingly impassioned followers, who trusted no one but him, his willingness to introduce threats and violence into American politics, things like that tend to eventually reach the point of no return. McDaniel: He made the decision, this -- this would be the last day of his life. Maddow: That is next time on “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” “Ultra” is a production of MSNBC.

The Secret Service failed Saturday. America deserves to know why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/-trump-rally-shooting-assassination-attempt-secret-service-rcna161768,"“Zero Fail.” That’s how the U.S. Secret Service describes its mission. Yet, you’d be hard-pressed to find a Secret Service agent who would claim that Saturday’s assassination attempt on presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump was anything other than a failure. But for an inch or so, the iconic agency almost lost a protectee to an assassin’s bullet. One spectator was killed and two others were injured. The nation needs answers to several questions, and the investigation to find out those answers has already begun — even as the Secret Service prepares to secure the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week. Here are three hypothetical scenarios that most likely explain Saturday’s failure and should help guide investigators as they figure out what went wrong and led to Trump’s nearly losing his life: 1. The Secret Service left the rooftop and building from which the would-be assassin fired out of its rally security plan. 2. The Secret Service delegated responsibility to local or state law enforcement to secure that building and they failed to adequately secure it. 3. There was confusion over which agencies had which assignments. No matter what happened, though, the buck stops at the Secret Service. Though it can’t be ruled out, it’s highly unlikely that the Secret Service left the rooftop of the building the shooter used out of its security plan. That’s because the estimated distance between that rooftop and Trump’s podium was about 150 yards, well within the accuracy range of the type of rifle reportedly used by the shooter. Further, the building’s roof provided an elevated location and therefore a tactical advantage for an attacker. The relatively short distance from the building to the podium and its elevation mean the Secret Service should have evaluated it as a risk. The building and rooftop may have been assessed by the Secret Service but determined to be a lower risk for some reason, designated as outside the event’s perimeter and/or delegated for coverage to local or state police. If security for the building was outsourced to other departments, then the failure of those departments to prevent the shooter from entering the building and ascending to the roof proved to be fatal. However, even if we find that a local or state department didn’t carry out an assignment, in such a scenario, it still would have been the Secret Service that delegated that responsibility. There may have been a critical error in communicating who was responsible for the building and how that responsibility was to be executed. The Secret Service would have to own such a decision. Of course, there may have been a case of mixed assignment of responsibilities. We know that at least one Secret Service sniper had a line of sight to the rooftop used by the shooter. As soon as shots rang out, Secret Service personnel “neutralized” the shooter, Anthony Guglielmi, the agency’s chief spokesperson said. Theoretically, the Secret Service could have decided it would be responsible for covering the rooftop, while the local police would be assigned to prevent anyone from reaching the rooftop. Reporting from The Associated Press adds credence to the possibility that local police were responsible for at least the entrances of the building.  According to officials who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity given the ongoing investigation, an officer reportedly climbed to the roof, encountered the shooter and retreated, and the would-be assassin quickly took a shot at the former president. Mixed responsibilities for the same threat location can result in a lack of clarity. It makes for a kind of “too many cooks spoil the broth” scenario. Further, The Wall Street Journal has reported, and the FBI has confirmed, that suspicious devices were found in the shooter’s vehicle, rendered safe by FBI bomb technicians and transported to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. Was the use of bomb dogs in the parking area of the rally considered? If so, who was responsible for doing that? To use bomb-sniffing dogs or not to use bomb-sniffing dogs would have been a Secret Service decision. There have already been multiple calls for inquiries into which, if any, of these scenarios might have played out to cause Saturday’s tragic events. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but its focus will not be on the security failure. Rather, inquiries into the Secret Service’s inability to live up to its “Zero Fail” mission will be led by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general and, according to President Joe Biden, “independent” investigators. The answers will come. They better come quickly. If the failure on Saturday was even partly because of limited resources of the Secret Service, at a time when a significant proportion of its personnel are in Milwaukee for the RNC, then we need to figure out if the Service is stretched so thin that it can’t simultaneously address multiple major events without a risky overreliance on local police. The Secret Service protects our president and former presidents, their families, candidates and their families and many others. Importantly, that also means it helps preserve the security of America’s brand and reputation. We need to help it get whatever it needs in order to get it right."
"From Oval Office, Biden forcefully condemns political violence, attempted Trump assassination",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 14, 2024, 5:04 PM PDT / Updated July 14, 2024, 6:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-trump-rally-shooting-oval-office-address-rcna161816,"In remarks delivered from the White House's Oval Office, President Joe Biden on Sunday forcefully condemned political violence and called for national unity following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump a night earlier. ""I want to speak to you tonight about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics,"" Biden said. ""We must stand together."" The shooting ""calls on all of us to take a step back, take stock of where we are, how we go forward from here,"" he added. Biden's historic remarks come roughly 26 hours after a shooter, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire at a Trump campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement officials are investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump, who said a bullet ""pierced"" part of his right ear during the attack. Rally attendee Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the attack and two other spectators — 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver — were injured. Both men were listed in stable condition. As Politico reported Sunday, Biden has delivered just two other speeches from behind the Resolute Desk: In June 2023, ""to mark the passage of legislation averting a federal default, and in October, to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East."" In the address, Biden reminded Americans that political differences should be resolved ""at the ballot box ... not with bullets."" ""The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a would-be assassin,"" he continued, adding: ""Here in America we need to get out of our silos. ... Let’s remember here in America our unity is the most elusive of our goals. Nothing is more important for us now than standing together. We can do this."" The address came the night before the Republican National Convention officially nominating Trump was set to begin in Milwaukee, a political reality that Biden acknowledged, saying that both sides will be offering a vision for the country in the upcoming week. Biden said the country faces ""deeply felt, strong disagreements"" about its future in this election, arguing that ""the choice we make in this election is going to shape the future of America and the world for decades to come."" Although he did not make the comparison directly, Biden used language similar to what he's used in other speeches in which he argued that Trump and his allies do not respect American democracy. He said he would continue to advocate for ""an America not of extremism and fury but of decency and grace."" ""I will continue to speak out strongly for our democracy, to stand up for our Constitution and the rule of law, to call for action at the ballot box, no violence on our streets,"" he said. ""That’s how democracy should work."" In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, some prominent Trump allies blamed Biden's rhetoric on the campaign trail, claiming it inspired the attack. Law enforcement officials have not identified the shooter's motive. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Republican Sen. JD Vance, one of four finalists on Trump's vice presidential shortlist, wrote on X. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Biden spoke at the White House earlier Sunday, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Merrick Garland. In that address, Biden again condemned the shooting and said he had a “short but good conversation” with Trump on Saturday night. “Jill and I are keeping him and his family in our prayers,"" the president had said."

But now a group of conservative nerds has already pre-emptively declared that the 2024 election results will be illegitimate. Despite being one myself, I use the term “nerds” here in the pejorative. It’s the only proper way to describe the people who gathered at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, to “war game” the upcoming election. The so-called simulation they ran wasn’t designed to help understand weak points in our election infrastructure, however, but to lay a foundation to justify tossing out any results that don’t put Trump back in the White House. “As things stand right now, there’s a zero percent chance of a free and fair election,” Mike Howell, the executive director of Heritage’s Oversight Project, told The Washington Post. “I’m formally accusing the Biden administration of creating the conditions that most reasonable policymakers and officials cannot in good conscience certify an election.” That’s a bold statement to make, and it isn’t even credibly backed up by the group’s own findings, especially given the biases baked into its exercise. I’ll pause here to say that I’m not an expert in this field. There are many legitimate war game designers out there, several of whom I’ve had the pleasure of interacting with, including Rex Brynen, a political science professor at McGill University, and Ellie Bartels, who works at RAND. But I did participate in my share of Model United Nations conferences between high school and the years after undergrad (if anybody is checking my nerd bona fides). The Heritage initiative, called the “2024 Transition Integrity Project,” is a pale imitation of a simulation of the same name conducted by a bipartisan group of experts ahead of the 2020 election. The latter was based on what’s called a “Matrix Game” design, where groups representing different stakeholders are given a starting point, declare what they would do in response, then make arguments for why such an action would or wouldn’t work. Success is determined through the strength of those supporting arguments and dice rolls (to introduce an element of chance, like in a Dungeons & Dragons session). The 2024 version, by contrast, involved a much looser system, where “players” reacted to a series of “real world” updates crafted by the team running the project, who then incorporated those reactions into their plot. Having read through summaries of both versions, the Heritage version had way too many stakeholders, leading it to sound more like a zany Model U.N. exploit instead of a sober look at what could happen this fall. Beyond the Biden administration and the Republican National Committee, it featured conservative participants representing China, Mexican drug cartels and “Black Lives Matter/Antifa/Pro-Hamas” groups. As the Post noted with a straight face in its coverage, the simulation at one point has pro-Hamas terrorists kidnapping Barbra Streisand as an event that could affect the election’s outcome. Now, I’m not saying that Babs being taken hostage wouldn’t be a crisis of monumental proportions — but I am saying it’s hard to see what useful election insights can be gleaned from that gratuitous plot point. Moreover, Heritage’s 2024 simulation begins with an assumption — Democrats cheated by gaming the system in 2020 — then works backward from there. This leads its administrators to write in their report that they came to a similar conclusion as the 2020 TIP’s work: “The incumbent is always the greatest threat to a peaceful and effective transfer of power,” the conservative game-runners wrote. This is noted without irony or any mention whatsoever of Trump’s own well-documented attempts to prevent just that after the 2020 election. During one of the two 2024 sessions, this premise culminated in the Biden administration proxies pulling a bizarro-world scenario as one of their last major actions: Rather than admit a narrow defeat, “[Attorney General] Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice arrested Donald Trump on November 7 at Mar-a-Lago, charging him with mishandling classified documents and with insurrection due to the events of January 6, 2021.” Specifically, the Garland stand-in opted to arrest Trump and charge him with treason, a stunt that feels about as far outside of Garland’s M.O. as you can get. Heritage’s coup-hungry cosplay also stands in stark contrast to the 2020 version, in which both sides of the simulation attempted to swing the narrative after an inconclusive Election Day result. But unlike Team Trump, which the facilitators wrote “was consistently more ruthless [and] more willing to ignore existing democratic norms,” the group representing Team Biden in the 2020 exercises “generally felt constrained by a commitment to norms and a desire to tamp down violence and reduce instability.” Much like Trump himself, the 2024 TIP’s biggest blind spot — and its biggest tell — is that everyone involved couldn’t help but believe both sides to be equally willing to shatter norms to remain in power. In doing so, the starting assumption became one in which Biden pulls a Democrat-coded version of the power grab that Trump attempted after losing in 2020. That warped logic is then used to justify whatever attempts to delegitimize a potential Biden win that Trump and the RNC’s “Election Integrity Project” cook up. That effort is already underway, as Republicans gear up to challenge a Trump loss in court in a more organized version of the 2020 legal efforts. It’s entirely likely that the Heritage-backed report will be included as evidence in some of the briefs that are eventually filed. It’s incumbent on any court that receives such a lawsuit to understand that rather than a serious academic work, the Heritage Foundation has produced a very self-aggrandizing piece of unhinged fan fiction."
America was already on edge. Then shots rang out at Trump's campaign rally.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 7:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/-trump-shooting-pennsylvania-rally-rcna161753,"Long before Saturday evening’s shooting at a rally for former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, America was already on edge. Maybe it’s because November’s election will be the first since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Maybe it’s because there’s been so much uncertainty about whether the two presumptive nominees would be on the ballot on Election Day — whether Trump’s indictments and convictions would render him ineligible and whether Biden would be replaced by another Democrat. November’s election feels more consequential than any one presidential election should ever be. Polarization is off the charts. Supreme Court rulings seem unmoored from precedent — and the Constitution. And polls show that a shockingly high percentage of Americans think violence against one’s political adversaries is justified. It was in that context Saturday afternoon that we saw Trump reach for his right ear and then duck behind the lectern. And we saw the Secret Service surround him and rush him off the stage. Trump said in a social media post that his upper ear was ""pierced"" by a bullet. The shooter and one spectator are dead. Two other spectators are wounded, according to the Secret Service. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the shooting. Biden, speaking from Delaware, said there was “no place in America for this kind of violence.” “It’s sick. It’s sick. It’s one of the reasons we have to unite this country,” Biden said. “We cannot condone this.” The shooter’s identity and motivations remain unknown. But we do know that Americans have had a serious knot in our stomachs for months now, if not for years, about the direction our country is going.   Such dread is likely to only grow stronger the closer we get to November. Whatever facts emerge, we can count on a significant number of Americans discounting them. Some will discount them because they can’t conceive of something happening the way the evidence suggests that it happened. Others will discount them because they see an opportunity to exploit the event for political gain. In a social media post after Saturday’s event, Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., claimed that “Joe Biden sent the orders.” Subsequently — contradicting his previous post — Collins declared that “the Republican District Attorney in Butler County, PA, should immediately file charges against Joseph R. Biden for inciting an assassination.” Such statements couldn’t have been more irresponsible or more dangerous. Again, a shocking number of Americans talk of civil wars and revolutions and claim that there is a righteousness to political violence. We don’t need lawmakers responding to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump by suggesting the leader of the opposing party is to blame. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana was one of several Republicans on Saturday who blamed Democrats for telling the public what’s at stake during the upcoming election. He tweeted, “For weeks Democrat leaders have been fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America. Clearly we’ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop.” Let’s hope he tells his colleague from Georgia that. Scalise was my representative in Congress for years when he was shot in 2017 while practicing for that year’s congressional baseball game. I opposed (and continue to oppose) just about everything Scalise says. But I was mortified that someone who disagreed with his politics lay in wait for him and tried to murder him. This may be nostalgia taking over, but there seems to have been an understanding six years ago that we need to eschew incendiary language in such moments and use cooler, more unifying rhetoric. But it seems naive now to even wish for such calls. Beyond the hugely significant fact that someone may have tried to assassinate a political candidate, one of the reasons that Saturday’s shooting is so worrisome is that it seems almost guaranteed to lead to an even more dangerous political climate. And the climate already feels unsurvivable."
"President Biden, political leaders condemn violence after shooting at Trump rally",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 6:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-rally-shooting-political-leaders-condemn-call-for-unity-and-peac-rcna161743,"After the shooting at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, leaders from across the political spectrum were quick to issue statements condemning the act of violence, expressing gratitude to the Secret Service and wishing the former president a speedy recovery. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he had been briefed and was “grateful to hear” that Trump is “safe and doing well.” The Biden campaign said in a statement that it was working to suspend its political ads. At a news conference shortly afterward, the president said: Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the attack “outrageous and tragic.” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., posted: “Pray for President Trump. And for justice,” a sentiment that was similar to one expressed by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Sen. JD Vance, an Ohio Republican who is among the final four candidates to be Trump’s running mate, was quick to point the finger at Democrats, writing: “Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must bre stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Without waiting for further information about the incident, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., concluded that it must be liberals’ fault: “This isn’t some unfortunate incident. This was an assassination attempt by a madman inspired by the rhetoric of the radical left.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., likewise put the blame on Democrats, saying, “The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they’ve demonized him [Trump] and his supporters.” A fellow Georgia Republican, Rep. Mike Collins, went even further, suggesting without evidence that the president was somehow criminally responsible: “The Republican District Attorney in Butler County, PA, should immediately file charges against Joseph R. Biden for inciting an assassination.” Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News, in reference to Biden’s speech Friday night in Detroit, that “after last night’s speech by Biden, I have zero ability to control myself right now.” Gingrich said that Biden “spent 15 minutes describing Trump in language that can only be called incitement. ... If you’re a good, loyal active nutcase, you just heard the president of the United States tell you what you’re about to do is acceptable.” Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was defiant, posting a photo of his father being escorted off the stage with his fist in the air. He wrote that his father will “never stop fighting to Save America.” Democrats across the board were quick to denounce political violence, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama. The foundations of former Presidents Ronald Reagan — the target of an assassination attempt in 1981 — and Jimmy Carter cautioned against a rush to judgment and called for civility. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, herself a victim of political violence, wrote on X: “Political violence is terrifying. I know. I’m holding former president Trump, and all those affected by today’s indefensible act of violence in my heart. Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable—never.” A number of House Democrats who have been vocal in their opposition to Trump also issued statements repudiating political violence, including Reps. Ted Lieu and Adam Schiff of California, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Congressional Republican leaders, at least, were measured in their responses. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell thanked the Secret Service and said that “violence has no place in our politics.” House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed that sentiment: “This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned.” Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced on X that he intends to hold a hearing with the director of the Secret Service."
Bernie Sanders says Biden is ‘the strongest candidate’ against Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 2:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/bernie-sanders-biden-new-york-times-op-ed-rcna161726,"Sen. Bernie Sanders reiterated his support for President Joe Biden to remain at the top of the Democratic ticket on Saturday, writing in a New York Times op-ed that Biden is “the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.” Although he and Biden have had strong disagreements on issues like Israel’s war on Hamas and the relative success of the Affordable Care Act, Sanders wrote that the president has a “record of real accomplishment,” as well as a vision that stands in stark contrast to that of Trump. The Vermont independent (who caucuses with Democrats) also railed against the media’s recent scrutiny of Biden’s every move and lamented that “too many Democrats have joined that circular firing squad.” He wrote: Sanders’ position is in line with the left-leaning “squad” members in the House, most of whom have issued public statements in support of the president. More than a dozen congressional Democrats have publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the race after his weak debate performance. Biden, meanwhile, has continued to insist that he will not step aside. Sanders still maintains a reputation as a progressive champion, and his support for Biden is likely to carry some weight among voters on the left. But an 82-year-old senator asking voters to accept an 81-year-old nominee who is, as he put it, “not an ideal candidate” is not exactly a resounding vote of confidence. Sanders is himself running for re-election this year to what would be his fourth six-year term."
Here’s who’s speaking at the Republican National Convention this year,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 1:25 PM PDT / Updated July 13, 2024, 2:33 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republican-national-convention-2024-speakers-rcna161721,"UPDATE (July 13, 2024, 5:34 p.m. ET): NBC News reports that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has, in fact, been invited to speak at the Republican National Convention next week. Citing two unnamed sources, NBC News says that details have yet to be finalized. The RNC, the Trump campaign and Haley's camp did not immediately return NBC's request for comment. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have released a list of headliners and keynote speakers for next week’s convention in Milwaukee, where Donald Trump is set to accept the party’s nomination for president once again. The list names dozens of lawmakers and GOP candidates for office, including the four people reported to be at the top of Trump’s short list for vice president: Sens. Marco Rubio, JD Vance and Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. (Trump has described the vetting process for his running mate as a “highly sophisticated version of ‘The Apprentice.’”) Also slated to speak are some of Trump’s fiercest supporters in Congress, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Elise Stefanik. Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, who is currently serving a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena, is also on the bill; The Associated Press reports he’s scheduled for release on July 17, which “would give him just enough time to board a plane and make it to Milwaukee before the convention wraps Thursday.” Among the nonpoliticians on the list are social media pundit Tucker Carlson, country singer Lee Greenwood, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, and model and TV personality Amber Rose. Notably absent is former South Carolina governor and presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who was not invited, unlike other 2024 competitors Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump’s two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, will also be speaking at the convention. The presumptive GOP nominee’s wife, Melania Trump, is not on the list, though she will reportedly attend the convention. Ivanka Trump also is not scheduled to headline any programs at the event, but her spokesperson told Vanity Fair that she’ll attend. Both women spoke at the 2016 and 2020 conventions. Here’s the full list of speakers as they were listed in an email from the Trump campaign:"
"Robert Kennedy Jr. texts apology to woman who accused him of sexual assault, claims he doesn’t remember",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 12:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-kennedy-apology-sexual-assault-text-rfk-jr-rcna161708,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose bid for president as an independent candidate has brought to light disturbing allegations from his past, tried to apologize last week to a woman who accused him of sexual assault, insisting that he had no memory of the alleged encounter. The woman, Eliza Cooney, told Vanity Fair earlier this month that Kennedy had groped her or behaved inappropriately with her on several occasions when she worked as a babysitter for his children in 1998. (MSNBC has not independently verified the allegations, and Kennedy did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment.) Kennedy, who was in his 40s at the time of the alleged incidents, declined to respond specifically to the accusations in an interview with the podcast “Breaking Points” on the day the accusations were revealed, but said that he had a “rambunctious youth.” “I’m not going to comment on the details of any of them,” he said when asked about Cooney’s allegations, “but it’s — you know, I am who I am.” However, NBC News reported that Kennedy reached out to Cooney two days after the Vanity Fair article was published, and when Cooney didn’t respond, he texted her: “I have no memory of this incident, but I apologize sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable.” His campaign did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Kennedy also texted Cooney that he wanted to apologize to her in person, according to The Washington Post, which was the first to report on the text messages. Cooney told the Post that Kennedy’s texts were “disingenuous and arrogant,” and she questioned his suggestion to meet in person. “Meet ‘face to face?’ What woman wants to do that?” she said. Although Kennedy has previously alluded to having “so many skeletons in my closet,” recent reporting on allegations against him are not likely to improve things for his flailing presidential campaign. In May, The New York Times reported that Kennedy had said in a 2012 deposition that part of his brain had been eaten by a worm. The Vanity Fair report also included a suggestion that Kennedy may have eaten dog meat; he told “Breaking Points” that the barbecued carcass in the photo was actually a goat. This week, when asked by The Boston Globe if more women could come forward with allegations similar to Cooney’s, Kennedy said, “I don’t know. We’ll see what happens.”"
How Alec Baldwin’s ‘Rust’ manslaughter trial came to such an abrupt end,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 10:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alec-baldwin-rust-trial-dismissed-manslaughter-rcna161700,"Actor Alec Baldwin sobbed and embraced his defense lawyers after the judge in his “Rust” involuntary manslaughter trial dismissed the case on Friday evening, finding that prosecutors had suppressed evidence. “The state’s willful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,” 1st Judicial District Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said. “If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith as to show signs of scorching prejudice.” If convicted, Baldwin could have faced up to 18 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter after a revolver he was rehearsing with on the “Rust” movie set fired a live round and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. Baldwin has said that he didn’t pull the trigger, telling ABC News that “I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them. Never.” The armorer on the set, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and in April was sentenced to 18 months; her lawyer told NBC News later on Friday that they intend to file a motion next week to have her case dismissed. In Baldwin’s case, the evidence in question was ammunition that a witness had turned over to the state earlier this year. Investigators did not enter the ammunition into the case file, nor did prosecutors reveal it to the defense; its existence came to light on Thursday when Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office crime scene technician Marissa Poppell was being cross-examined on the stand. Baldwin’s lawyers then filed a motion to dismiss the case, accusing the state of hiding the evidence to prevent them from determining for themselves the ammunition’s relevance to the case. In an extraordinary turn of events just three days into the trial, special prosecutor Kari T. Morrissey took the stand on Friday, telling the judge that she had only seen a photo of the undisclosed ammunition and didn’t think it matched the rounds on the film set. Yet when the judge inspected the evidence herself — donning latex gloves to examine the rounds and asking a technician to identify each one — at least one of the bullets was found to be similar. Morrissey disputed that the state had hidden the evidence from the defense, saying she did not believe the ammunition had “evidentiary value” in the case. She also revealed that another special prosecutor appointed in the case had resigned earlier that day. In her decision to toss the case, Sommer excoriated the prosecutors. “There is no way for the court to right this wrong,” she added. The case was dismissed with prejudice, which means the state cannot bring charges against Baldwin again in Hutchins’ death."
Why AOC's case for impeaching Thomas and Alito is strong,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aoc-supreme-court-impeachment-clarence-thomas-samuel-alito-rcna161380,"The Supreme Court’s most recent term was, to be blunt, a nightmare. The few minor victories, often on narrow grounds or issues of standing, were deeply outweighed by the massive blows to democracy and good governance. These attacks were made even more galling by the continued participation of Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, the far-right flank of a deeply conservative bench, who are each mired in what should be disqualifying ethics scandals. Senate Democrats, despite holding a majority, have largely shown little interest in holding the two rogue justices accountable. It was a relief then when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced a pair of resolutions in the House on Wednesday calling for their impeachment and removal. Though the articles against Thomas and Alito will not pass in this Congress, they show that the charges against Thomas and Alito are strong and should stand as a rallying point for Democratic candidates this fall. Both resolutions focus on two main points: the personal enrichment of the justices without their disclosure; and their refusal to recuse themselves from cases despite clear conflicts of interest. The first of the three articles against Thomas cites the over $1.5 million in goods, cash equivalents and services from billionaire benefactor Harlan Crow that he failed to disclose over the years despite federal reporting requirements. The second and third are centered on the pro-insurrection activities of his wife, Ginni Thomas, and his subsequent involvement in the Jan. 6-related cases that reached the Supreme Court. It’s a testament to the sweep of Thomas’ blatant conflicts of interest that the two articles against Alito seem mild in comparison. For his part, he is accused of violating his oath of office by sitting in judgment of the Jan. 6-related cases at the same time that he allowed an upside-down flag to be flown outside his home, an apparent show of bias in favor of attempts to overthrow the 2020 election. Alito is also similarly accused of failing to disclose gifts from billionaire businessman Paul Singer and then voting in favor of a ruling that produced a substantial profit for Singer. “Corruption, without consequence, infects all it touches,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her floor speech introducing the articles, which have 18 co-sponsors. “And that is why this body, Congress, has a constitutional and moral obligation to hold these justices accountable, to maintain the integrity of our courts, and to uphold the standards of the judiciary and our institutions.” Unlike the House GOP’s stunt impeachment of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas earlier this year, the articles filed on Wednesday are on much more solid constitutional grounds. Mayorkas was impeached for the supposed crime of enacting the president’s immigration policies. Unsurprisingly, he was acquitted in the Senate (though even if he had been removed, his successor almost certainly would enact the exact same policies). In contrast, it is not policy differences with Alito and Thomas that are sparking Democrats’ desire to remove them, though there are many. Note that there aren’t similar calls for impeaching Justices Neil Gorsuch, who sides most often with Alito and Thomas, or Chief Justice John Roberts, who led the way on gutting the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and granting former President Donald Trump sweeping criminal immunity this term. Instead, it is Thomas and Alito’s actions that call into question their ability to issue rulings free from bias, financial gain or malice. Specifically, in her speech Ocasio-Cortez accused the justices of violating the the Constitution’s “Good Behavior” clause. Article III, Section 1 states that federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, “shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” Broadly speaking, this means that there is no specific term that justices are limited to, nor can they simply be replaced because a new administration is in the White House or control of Congress has flipped. But many (though not all) legal scholars believe that the phrasing implies a higher standard for judges than other federal officers who are subject to impeachment. None of the articles filed against Thomas and Alito explicitly make this case in the text. Instead, they both frame the charges as violating the more traditional impeachment standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” as laid out in Article II, Section 4. While neither set of articles outright accuses the justices of being bribed, one of two specific crimes delineated in Article II, both call out the justices’ refusal to disclose those financial ties and recuse themselves from related cases. This does little to weaken the Democrats’ arguments, as each article cites relevant criminal laws that Thomas and Alito have allegedly violated. It is important to be realistic about the prospects for these articles. There is no chance that they will be voted on, let alone pass. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has staunchly defended Thomas and Alito’s documented improprieties. But Ocasio-Cortez is right to place in the record that at least some legislators take issue with the behavior on display and have determined it is unbefitting members of the nation’s highest court. Further, given the importance of the decisions that these two justices, or their successors should their seats become vacant, will be called upon to make in the coming years, it is incumbent on Democrats to highlight Thomas and Alito’s mockery of an impartial judiciary. Impeachment is a political act, meant to punish political crimes against the country, committed by those empowered with the public’s trust. It is fitting then that their removal for breaking that trust should be front and center in the political campaigns of those who would want to see trust in the court’s decisions restored."
Trump's lawyers are taking full advantage of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lawyers-judge-merchan-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-rcna161477,"Last month’s landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, Trump v. United States, holding that former presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for official acts, has gifted former President Donald Trump with yet another legal delay tactic. And sure enough, on Thursday, the day Trump was supposed to be sentenced for his Manhattan business fraud felonies, lawyers formerly asked a state court judge to vacate the former president’s historic hush money conviction.   This motion was not a surprise. New York Criminal Procedure Law 330.30 allows a defendant to request that the trial judge set aside the guilty verdict at “any time after rendition of a verdict of guilty and before sentence.” The grounds for doing so are limited, but within hours of the Supreme Court decision, Trump’s lawyers told Judge Juan Merchan in a letter that Trump’s conviction should be set aside.   The Supreme Court’s decision at first blush appears not to be relevant to the New York case. After all, the efforts to cover-up allegations of infidelity ahead of the 2016 election occurred when Trump was a candidate and not yet in the White House. However, Trump’s lawyers are arguing that evidence was shown during his trial that included White House “official acts."" This evidence, Trump's legal team says, “should never have been put before the jury.”    Merchan, with the consent of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, rescheduled Trump’s July 11 sentencing to Sept. 18. At that point, he will decide whether the Supreme Court decision requires the 34 guilty counts to be set aside. That decision held that presidents have absolute immunity for official acts that relate to their core constitutional authority, presumptive immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial acts. Determining which acts fit into which category remains untested territory. But not for long.   Trump’s lawyers previewed their motion in their letter to Merchan. In the letter, Todd Blanche and team argue that during trial and summations jurors heard testimony and saw documents that placed “highly prejudicial emphasis” on evidence that should be considered “official acts.” They argue this evidence includes Trump’s social media posts and public statements while in office; witness testimony regarding events in the Oval Office (most likely that of former communications director Hope Hicks and executive assistant Madeleine Westerhout); toll records reflecting calls Trump made while president; and an ethics financial disclosure form he filed in 2018.  Merchan will need to parse through these various actions and determine which, if any, should be entitled to absolute or presumptive immunity. Arguably, I could see a case for why Hicks' and Westerhout's testimony could be covered by official acts immunity. But the Supreme Court's guidance on how courts should make the distinction between official and unofficial does not provide Merchan with broad discretion. The Supreme Court directs that in distinguishing between official and unofficial conduct “courts may not inquire into the President’s motives,” nor can they “deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.” And in a footnote of his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts advises that the “prosecutor may not admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.”    In New York, jury trial convictions are rarely reversed by appellate courts. When a reversal occurs on prejudicial evidence grounds, the appellate court has found that the improperly admitted evidence was so highly prejudicial it denied the defendant a fair trial. So it's possible Merchan and the New York appellate courts may find that the admission of official acts evidence during trial was prejudicial, but not so highly prejudicial that it denied Trump a fair trial, especially in light of the overwhelming mountain of evidence of guilt.    It is unclear, however, whether the U.S. Supreme Court would agree that the conviction should survive.   Roberts in the majority opinion accused the dissenters of striking a “tone of chilling doom” about the decision. Chilling or not, it’s clear the decision will have major ramifications beyond the New York case — and for years to come. "

Because while both Obama and Clinton are widely respected elder statesmen, there are several reasons why they can’t just put an end to the re-election drama surrounding President Joe Biden and tell the party who should be the nominee in August. For one thing, the Democratic Party — including party insiders — do not like being told what to do (most of the time). Hillary Clinton didn’t win the nomination in 2008 even though she had the strong endorsement of her husband. And the progressive wing of the party didn’t love it when Obama came close to endorsing Clinton during the primary process in 2016. A clear and unified statement could certainly tamp down some of the speculation about whether the party should take a different route for the nominee — and that uncertainty is one of the biggest challenges right now. But while both men are generational talents as politicians, even Obama has been out of the electoral game for 12 years. County, district and state maps as well as voter outreach strategies have changed a lot since then. Obama and Clinton swooping in to tell everyone what to do could backfire in other ways as well. As imperfect (to put it mildly) as this moment is in the Democratic Party, it’s important that any debate within the party is conducted fairly and legitimately. I don’t know what is going to happen, and with every day that passes it feels more likely Biden will hold on. But once a final decision is made, Democrats will need all the party unity they can muster. And that means Obama and Clinton are smart to wait until the question is settled to weigh in. That’s the moment when they can maximize their collective impact. This may happen next week, or the week after, or maybe at the convention. But once it does happen, the focus can return back to Donald Trump and the true threat America is still facing. Clinton and Obama remain two of the most popular politicians in the Democratic Party, and their voices will be needed on the campaign trail. With everything else going on this week, you may have missed key members of the Senate Judiciary Committee — and one very well-known House member — getting a bit spicier when it comes to holding two of the most ethically dubious members of the Supreme Court accountable. On Tuesday, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Ron Wyden, D.-Ore., urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate the alleged ethics violations of Justice Clarence Thomas. In their letter to Garland, Whitehouse and Wyden cited a “willful pattern of disregard for ethics laws” by Thomas, suggesting that his conduct surpasses that of other government officials previously investigated by the Department of Justice for similar issues. This escalation didn’t come out of nowhere. Thomas’ concurring opinion in Trump v. United States questioned the legality of Jack Smith’s special counsel appointment. While there is no evidence proving Thomas wrote this opinion with the knowledge that he could someday become the subject of a special counsel investigation himself, it’s hard not to see the opinion as “convenient” — to say the least. At the same time, in the House of Representatives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filed articles of impeachment against both Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito. While the articles are not going to advance in the Republican-controlled House, Ocasio-Cortez’s move marks one of the boldest efforts yet from Democrats to push for accountability — at least in the court of public opinion. Those of you following my personal Instagram already know I have been counting down the days to the Paris Olympics. One of the athletes in this year’s Games I am absolutely floored by is USA swimming star Katie Grimes. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Grimes was the youngest member of Team USA at just 15 years old and finished fourth in the women’s 800-meter freestyle. She secured her ticket to Paris with a third-place finish in the 10K open-water swim at the 2023 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka. Despite similarities between Grimes and fellow swim star Katie Ledecky, who qualified for her first Olympics at 15, the two athletes are friends, not rivals. In fact, Ledecky is incredibly supportive of her fellow swimmer. The duo has even earned the nickname “Katie squared.” What show are you bingeing right now? A little late to the party on this one, but I’m catching up on “This Is Us.” I’m also getting ready to binge the Olympics and cheer on America’s athletes as they go for gold in Paris! What’s the last book you read? “La Nueva California” by David Hayes-Bautista. It’s a fascinating perspective on the history of Latinos in California — and a glimpse at the future of the United States. What time do you wake up on the weekends? 6 a.m. I have three kids! How do you take your coffee? Usually with light cream. Sometimes I treat myself with half a packet of sugar."
Democrats’ infighting over Biden becomes fuel for right-wing conspiracy theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 3:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/democrats-biden-drop-out-conspiracy-theories-republicans-rcna161527,"The tumult within the Democratic Party over President Joe Biden’s fitness for office and ability to win in November has become rich fodder for right-wing conspiracy theories. One running theory, as The New York Times reported Friday, is that Biden’s poor debate performance was somehow the result of a sly maneuver by Democratic Party elites to push him off the ticket: The theory aligns with an unfounded claim that has long circulated among the right and has even been promoted by some prominent Republican lawmakers — that the party has secretly wanted to replace Biden on the top of the ticket with another Democrat, such as former first lady Michelle Obama. It’s not unlikely that that conspiracy theory is rooted in Biden’s pronounced aging — after all, he already was the oldest person to be elected president in the U.S. But there’s no evidence whatsoever that Democrats have been working behind the scenes to push him out; the fact that the party is in such disarray right now should speak to that. The party’s woes have nothing to do with an imaginary plot to toss him off the ticket and everything to do with the reality of his age. The theory also is directly contradicted by another conspiracy theory: that Democrats and the media have been conspiring to shield the public from the truth about Biden’s health. Furthermore, with Vice President Kamala Harris viewed as a potential replacement should Biden step aside, years-old conspiracy theories about her are making a comeback. It’s no surprise that such absurd ideas are so rife among the right: Republicans have long embraced conspiracy theories. And their standard-bearer, who launched his political career with a racist lie about then-President Barack Obama, remains one of the fiercest peddlers of the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. But as we’ve seen, these conspiracy theories are often in conflict with one another — and they make even less sense when taken together."

But people briefed on the talks say it will be days until it is clear whether a breakthrough has been achieved because of difficulties in communication between Hamas officials in Qatar and the group’s leaders in Gaza.” * Giuliani’s troubles keep getting worse: “A judge has dismissed Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy case, nearly seven months after the disgraced lawyer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ... The dismissal of Giuliani’s case does not absolve him of his debts, and his creditors can now go after his assets to try to recover some of the money they’re owed. It also means that Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the Georgia election workers whom he defamed after the 2020 election and whom he was ordered to pay nearly $150 million, can begin to collect on that sum.” * In New Jersey: “A jury began deliberating Friday afternoon in Sen. Bob Menendez’s bribery trial following four days of closing arguments in which prosecutors accused the New Jersey Democrat of ‘corruption on a massive scale,’ delivering favors for businessmen who showered him and his wife with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold.” * Gun policy: “A federal judge in Kansas has refused to block the nationwide enforcement of a Biden administration rule requiring firearms dealers to do background checks of buyers at gun shows, leaving Texas as the only state so far where a legal challenge has succeeded.” * Speaking of firearms, I suspect ammunition vending machines aren’t common in most other advanced nations: “A Texas-based company has started making vending machines for gun ammunition, arguing that this is the safest way to sell it. The company, American Rounds, has already had six of those machines installed at grocery stores in Texas, Alabama and Oklahoma. Two more are set to be installed by the end of the month in Texas and Colorado, said Grant Magers, the chief executive of American Rounds.” * All is not well in Texas: “For more than a year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has owed the state over $11,000 in fines for filing late campaign finance reports. Now, his office is charged with collecting the money. The situation presents a clear conflict of interest for enforcement of the state’s campaign finance laws, said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a government watchdog group.” * The latest on Klobuchar’s health: “U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Friday that she remains cancer-free following her bout with breast cancer in 2021, but doctors recently removed a small calcification and that she’ll get radiation treatment as a precaution. The Minnesota Democrat, who chairs the powerful Rules Committee, was successfully treated for early-stage breast cancer three years ago.” Have a safe weekend."
Texas’ power grid wasn’t made for the rapid succession of storms it sees now,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 2:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-beryl-power-outages-houston-tracker-maps-rcna161474,"When Hurricane Beryl tore through Houston this week, it knocked out power to about 2.26 million power customers. Beryl, which struck the Texas coast as a Category 1 hurricane Monday morning, was the third major storm to strike the nation’s fourth largest city in less than two months. To our knowledge, that’s unprecedented and is a reminder that climate change can rear its ugly head by intensifying storms in unforgiving ways. On May 16 and 17, a derecho with straight-line winds of 100 mph hit Houston with little notice. It blew out thousands of windows in downtown skyscrapers, killed eight people and toppled transmission towers, cutting off power to almost 1 million customers. Before May ended, a destructive storm knocked out the power for 325,000 customers (By our calculations, that's about 875,000 people.) Though power was restored quickly in both cases, two powerful storms in quick succession left the system battered and weakened. Add in the fact that it’s been a relatively wet year. The soft soil makes it easier for trees and poles to fall over when the wind blows. Oftentimes repair crews will make temporary fixes to quickly restore power with plans for permanent repairs to follow. In this case, it is unlikely that all repairs from the previous two storms were complete. Then Beryl struck. It’s always dramatic, dangerous and damaging when a hurricane strikes a major city. Houston is no stranger to hurricanes. But they don’t usually strike this powerfully this early in the season, and never before has a hurricane struck so quickly on the heels of two other significant storms. The aftermath is a crisis. Losing power briefly is inconvenient, uncomfortable and disruptive to the economy. But going without power for multiple days during a heat wave can be downright deadly. The total toll in lives and dollars is huge.  It’s clear now: The weather has changed, but the power grid has not. So, what can innovators, markets, utilities, cities, states and the federal government do to prepare for and recover from storms? The first thing we need to realize is that for the most part we designed and built our grid decades ago, when the weather was milder. This quick succession of three major storms followed by a heat wave is unprecedented but could be a preview of the future. The stakes are high, and there are solutions at hand we can implement. So what steps can we take to better our chances for the next storm? The first step after a crisis is acceptance. We need to understand that storms like these can happen and are going to happen more often. The Gulf of Mexico is getting warmer with climate change, and warmer oceans are more fuel for hurricanes. Hurricane Beryl set multiple records, including as the only Atlantic Category 4 storm to form in June and the strongest July hurricane we’ve ever seen. We need better communications with those affected by storms. In our modern world, we have come to expect prompt and near constant lines of communication, especially in times like these. Utility outage maps were down even before the storm hit, leaving people to rely on the Whataburger store app to know which parts of the city had power. Though people only use outage tracker maps in rare instances, when they need them, they really need them to be robust. We need to spend the effort to better model the impacts of storms on the electricity sector. Utilities in the paths of storms should be modeling thousands of future hurricanes and their impacts on the electricity sector. Finding where these storms have common areas of damage overlap and focusing grid hardening efforts in those areas could reduce the impacts for when those storms eventually do hit. The vast majority of the time, customers lose power because of damage to the distribution system, the small wires and poles that take power the last mile to your home or business. These parts of our infrastructure are the most visible and sometimes are left more vulnerable by our own well-meaning actions, such as pushing back against tree trimming efforts by local utilities. While it is often more expensive up front, we need to consider putting more of our electricity infrastructure underground and installing stronger poles, such as those made of concrete, steel or composites, in critical areas where older, fragile wooden poles are waiting to fail. Even with our best efforts, we will not be able to guarantee that the system will be invulnerable against anything thrown at it by nature or humans. We should be looking into strategically deploying energy storage, solar and microgrids (smaller electricity systems that can provide local power when the big grid is down) to particularly risky or important areas. Though much of the electricity system was still down after Beryl, the sun was back up the next day, and the same sun that is making the conditions unbearable could be used to make electricity where it is needed, as long as that infrastructure to store and use it were also hardened to the storm. Building more efficient homes means they will stay at a more comfortable and safe temperature for longer after the power goes out. And we need to make sure that there are plenty of places where those without power can access safe community cooling centers. For instance: schools with solar panels that can host those without power and provide a safe and healthy place for families to wait for the power to be restored. In the end, we have to decide resilience is worth the investment. Regulators and rate payers often balk when rates go up to invest in a better system. So, we usually don’t spend the money and we stick with a fragile system that can fail. However, it would be cheaper and more equitable to pay for a better system that stands up more robustly against powerful weather. It feels more expensive up front, but it saves money in the spared lives and in the outages and damages that are avoided. Saving money up front feels prudent, but it’s costly when the system fails to withstand the storm. Ultimately, intensifying weather is a threat to the power system and modern society, but we have solutions. We should implement them."
Project 2025’s plan to criminalize porn has a sinister subplot,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 1:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-porn-ban-lgbtq-transgender-rcna161562,"Amid the 920 pages' worth of conservative ideas in the Project 2025 plans for a second Donald Trump administration, one stands out for its sheer improbability: criminalizing pornography. Just five pages into the foreword by the president of the far-right Heritage Foundation think tank, the proposal stakes out an uncompromising position that porn should be banned, porn producers and distributors should be sent to prison, and tech companies that circulate it should be shut down. It's true that politics makes strange bedfellows, but we're talking about anti-porn crusaders teaming up with Trump, who has literally had his share of strange bedfellows. To recap: Trump has said, unconvincingly, that he does not know the people behind Project 2025 and does not support all of its proposals. But on this subject, he has previously endorsed a similar idea, signing a pledge from the group Enough is Enough in 2016 to crack down on porn and potentially appoint a presidential commission to look at the ""harmful public health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture."" (He did neither.) As with other sections of Project 2025, one of your first thoughts when reading it is: Who wants this? The polling is mixed, at best. Gallup’s annual social survey has found that only 38% of Americans think that pornography is “morally acceptable,” down slightly from a high of 43% in 2018 but still higher than the low of 30% in 2011. That puts it somewhere between the number who think “sex between teenagers” and “cloning animals” is morally acceptable. (The question specifically states that this is regardless of whether you think it should be legal.) Digging into the crosstabs is instructive, though. The groups that are most accepting include people aged 18 to 35, college graduates and liberals, while the least accepting were people over 55, people who didn’t finish college and conservatives. In other words, banning porn would be popular with Trump's voter base, and unpopular with everyone else. But the Project 2025 proposal is even more sweeping than the one Trump endorsed in his first campaign, indicating that its anti-porn language may be covering for a broader crusade against LGBTQ rights. It's worth reading in full: That's a lot to unpack. Under this proposal, Stormy Daniels might be the one at the defendant's table next time, and Trump's new friend Elon Musk might see X shuttered for being too XXX. But the giveaway here is in the two examples provided at the beginning ""transgender ideology"" and ""sexualization of children."" That echoes similar rhetoric being used by groups such as Moms for Liberty to oppose everything from drag queen reading hours to LGBTQ books in school libraries, but the rest of the paragraph takes it to another level. After all, ""transgender ideology"" is a broad enough term to not just cover specific books that some parents might find objectionable, but the very idea that people can be transgender. Other sections of Project 2025 make this clear, calling for barring transgender Americans from serving in the military, reversing anti-discrimination rules that bar employers from firing workers for being LGBTQ and issuing regulations that declare that gender reassignment surgery is ""dangerous"" and should not be covered by health insurance. But while recent clashes around LGBTQ rights have revolved around removing books from the shelves or even, in one case, barring children from a public library entirely, the broad wording in the Project 2025 proposal could be read as a call for forcing teachers and librarians to register as sex offenders for merely stocking books that acknowledge that transgender people exist. That could even end up including classics such as Ovid's ""Metamorphoses,"" Virginia Woolf's ""Orlando"" or Armistead Maupin's ""Tales of the City."" Unlike other, more detailed proposals in Project 2025, it's unclear exactly how this would be put into place. As the foreword glancingly acknowledges, the Supreme Court has held since 1973 that obscenity laws only apply to works without any ""serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value"" — although the current conservative majority has been known to overturn decisions from that far back. A number of states have passed laws requiring age verification to access adult content online, though the proposal doesn't mention that approach. Perhaps, as with Trump's 2016 pledge, the vague proposal to ban porn may go nowhere in a second term. But the anti-LGBTQ proposals that it portends almost surely will."
Controversial judges block Biden protections for LGBTQ+ students,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 1:16 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/controversial-judges-block-biden-protections-lgbtq-students-rcna161641,"When conservative opponents of the Biden administration’s protections for LGBTQ+ students decided to go to court, they knew exactly which jurisdictions to file their cases. Reuters reported: The injunctions don’t come as much of a surprise, and they represent the first step of a legal process that will continue to unfold. But it’s worth noting which specific judges blocked the White House’s policy. One of the jurists was U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who, as regular readers know, is a Trump-appointed judge in Texas. He’s also earned a reputation as one of the most controversial members of the federal bench. It was, for example, Kacsmaryk who took it upon himself to suspend the FDA’s approval of mifepristone last year, relying in large part on highly dubious studies — which have since been retracted. (The ruling was ultimately overturned for procedural reasons.) When a federal judge blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a new rule in Texas that would require firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows, that was Kacsmaryk, too. When a conservative group wanted to challenge energy efficiency standards, they figured it’d be a good idea to file the case in Kacsmaryk’s district. When a conservative group wanted to challenge the administration’s protections for LGBTQ+ students, they did the same thing. The right’s assumptions are well grounded, as we were reminded again today. The other judge was U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, whose name might also sound familiar. The week before Christmas in 2018, for example, O’Connor agreed to strike down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, root and branch. Even many conservatives and ACA critics agreed that the ruling was indefensible, and reactions tended to include words and phrases such as “pretty bananas,” “embarrassingly bad,” and “absurd.” The New York Times noted soon after that Republicans had a habit of bringing their cases to this specific district court because of their confidence that O’Connor would give them everything they wanted: “He ruled for Texas in 2015 when it challenged an Obama administration measure extending family leave benefits to married same-sex couples. ... He also ruled for Texas in 2016, blocking the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines expanding restroom access for transgender students.” In 2022, the same judge, nominated by George W. Bush, also undermined the Navy’s vaccine requirements, ignoring generations’ worth of precedent. A year later, O’Connor took steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act again. The tactic goes by different names. I’ve seen it referred to as “forum shopping,” “judge shopping,” “venue shopping,” and “court shopping,” but the phrases all mean the same thing: Instead of simply taking one’s chances in the judiciary, many litigants effectively try to hand-pick ideologically aligned jurists, filing their cases in specific districts in the hopes of guaranteeing success before the process even begins in earnest. In Trump’s hush-money case, his GOP allies were invested in the idea that prosecutors engaged in court shopping, pursuing an indictment in a court where a conviction was more likely. That never made any sense: Trump’s crimes were committed in the district in which he was charged. If Republicans are looking for some actual examples of court shopping, I’d refer them to Kacsmaryk’s and O’Connor’s docket. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Judge dismisses Rudy Giuliani's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 12:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-dismissed-chapter-11-rcna161580,"A judge has dismissed Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case, nearly seven months after the disgraced lawyer filed for Chapter 11 protection. In a decision on Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane cited a list of factors to support the dismissal, including that remaining in Chapter 11 would “erode much, if not all, of the value of the estate” due to Giuliani’s lack of cooperation, which he noted is unlikely to change if a trustee were appointed. Lane also cited Giuliani’s outstanding lawsuits with most of the creditors, writing that those cases are “better resolved outside the bankruptcy forum.” The dismissal of Giuliani's case does not absolve him of his debts, and his creditors can now go after his assets to try to recover some of the money they're owed. It also means that Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the Georgia election workers whom he defamed after the 2020 election and whom he was ordered to pay nearly $150 million, can begin to collect on that sum. Proceedings can also resume in other lawsuits that have been on hold since Giuliani declared bankruptcy, including defamation suits by two voting machine companies and a sexual harassment claim from a former employee (a representative for Giuliani said it was a ""consensual relationship""). The former lawyer for Donald Trump is also barred from filing for bankruptcy again in the next 12 months to provide his creditors with time to enforce their judgments or pursue lawsuits. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December after the judgment in Freeman and Moss’ defamation case was handed down, and bankruptcy protection prevented them from immediately collecting the money. (Giuliani’s appeal in that case can move forward now that his bankruptcy proceedings have ended.) But his bankruptcy case did not go smoothly. Giuliani’s creditors accused him of using bankruptcy to avoid paying the money he owes and expressed deep frustration at what they characterized as attempts to obfuscate his assets. Giuliani also filed reports to the court about his spending and earnings that The New York Times described as ""incomplete and confusing."" At a hearing on Wednesday, Giuliani erupted at the accusations of fraud, calling them “highly defamatory.” His lawyer Gary Fischoff told the judge that his client “would not commit any bankruptcy fraud.” In his decision, Lane criticized Giuliani’s conduct in the case, which he said hindered the bankruptcy process. “The record in this case reflects Mr. Giuliani’s continued failure to meet his reporting obligations and provide the financial transparency required of a debtor in possession,” he wrote. In a contentious hearing earlier this week, Lane had indicated that he was inclined to dismiss the case. Giuliani’s creditors had been seeking the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee to control his assets, but Moss and Freeman — the only creditors who have a judgment in their civil lawsuits against Giuliani — split from the group and asked the case to be thrown out. And although Giuliani initially requested that his case be converted to Chapter 7 so that his assets could be liquidated, his lawyers earlier this week agreed with Freeman and Moss to dismiss the case."
U.S. intel officials: Russia wants to boost Trump in 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 11:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-intelligence-officials-russia-wants-boost-trump-2024-election-rcna161613,"Shortly before the presidential debate two weeks ago, NBC News reported on a network of pro-Kremlin social media accounts that were “attempting to spread false narratives.” Not surprisingly, those narratives were intended to help Donald Trump. This was not an isolated incident. The Wall Street Journal reported this week: A senior official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters, “We haven’t observed a shift in Russia’s preferences for the presidential race from past elections.” That seemed like a polite way of effectively saying, “Moscow wanted Trump in power before, and Moscow wants Trump in power now.” What’s more, Russia’s interest in the outcomes of our election is especially acute right now because of the United States’ support for Ukraine. Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy of the German Marshall Fund, who tracks foreign disinformation efforts, told NBC News earlier this year, “Not that they didn’t have an incentive to interfere in the last two presidential elections. But I would say that the incentive to interfere is heightened right now.” But as Moscow’s efforts come into focus, it’s worth appreciating the familiarity of the circumstances. In 2016, Russia targeted U.S. elections. There used to be a bipartisan consensus on this obvious and uncontested fact. In 2018, Russia targeted U.S. elections. Though Trump, for reasons that have never been explained, rejected his own country’s intelligence on the matter, the United States’ top national security officials made it categorically clear that Russia took deliberate steps to interfere in the midterm cycle. In 2020, Russia targeted U.S. elections. In fact, intelligence officials told Congress about the evidence showing that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign for the express purpose of trying to secure a second term for Trump. In 2022, Russia targeted U.S. elections. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported last year, “The Russian government and its proxies attempted to denigrate the Democratic Party and undermine voter confidence ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.” And in 2024, Russia is once against targeting U.S. elections. The pattern isn’t exactly subtle. But as Rachel has explained on the show, one of the most important differences between the Kremlin’s latest efforts and the Putin regime’s earlier intelligence operations is that many Republican officials no longer bother with the pretense that Russian intervention is a problem.

Voter apathy this election cycle is another privilege Black Americans do not have,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 11:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joyce-beatty-black-voter-turn-out-biden-rcna161584,"UPDATE (July 23, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET): This column has been updated to include Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nevada and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus who was on the panel at the Essence festival that addressed the need to vote. To many Americans, our democracy is a given; yet, for African Americans, it is a lifesaving gift demanding our unwavering defense. This gift promises not only prosperity but shields us with the strength of pluralism. In the crucible of the past three years, the visionary leadership of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris has steered us through the darkest days of the worst pandemic since the 1920s. Their administration unveiled a monumental infrastructure bill that has not only rebuilt our roads and bridges but also our communities. The administration's persistent commitment to prosperity for all Americans has created 2.6 million jobs for African Americans, unlocked historic educational opportunities through the expansion of Pell Grants, increased access to housing, and broadened health care for Black communities by increasing Black enrollment in the Affordable Care Act by 49%. These are not just policy achievements; they are critical lifelines, and now we fear that we may lose the immense progress we have made. It would be a death blow. At the Essence Festival of Culture this month, even the sweltering heat and humidity of New Orleans paled in comparison to the deep anxiety brewing over the future of our nation’s democracy. We have watched the erosion of the sacred right to vote, once safeguarded by the Voting Rights Act, and now witness our political systems — created to protect us — seemingly turn against us. This betrayal menaces our dreams of security, equality and prosperity. With the Supreme Court appearing to sanction abuses of power, our hearts sink. We fear our democracy is dangerously close to collapsing under the weight of countless challenges to its institutions and norms. Should our democracy falter, Black Americans know that we would be the first to suffer the impact. That’s why my Democratic colleagues Rep. Maxine Waters of California, Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana and Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, rallied with me at Essence fest, the country’s largest showcase of African American music and culture, to urge attendees to vigorously defend democracy. We reminded everyone of the stark choice before us: advance with Joe Biden or decline with Donald Trump. We must not retreat from our sacred duty to vote. Indifference is a luxury we cannot afford. While some dismiss concerns about our democracy’s stability, their detachment echoes the complacency of those who, during the civil rights era, ignored the urgent cries for equality. Fully enjoying their rights, they boldly proclaimed to those who didn’t: “Wait, your time will come.” They have not had to march in the streets against bigotry to receive the rights they were promised at their nation’s birth. They’ve never had to vote as though their freedom depended on it. They are silent about the erosion of rights because they don’t belong to a group at risk. But we are a member of the endangered group. We do not have the privilege of apathy. The fight for freedom has always been and is once again at our doorstep and we cannot afford apathy when oppression knocks on our door. As a morally bankrupt Donald Trump, who’s been convicted of 34 felony counts, runs for the presidency again, our nation is at risk of backsliding beyond where we’ve been before. Despite his claim to have been the best president for Black Americans since Abraham Lincoln, Trump has sanctioned white supremacy, directed his harmful rhetoric at communities of color and threatened to cut federal education funding. He is driven not by a vision for prosperity, but by retribution against his political rivals. In contrast, President Biden and Vice President Harris are propelling our country forward, envisioning a future where jobs flourish, health care is accessible and reproductive rights are protected. They celebrate our diversity. The choice is clear and binary: Biden vs. Trump. We don’t have the luxury of voting for a third party or not voting at all. Given the strong turnout expected from Trump’s supporters, every other voter must support the best alternative for protecting our democracy: the Biden-Harris ticket of the Democratic Party. Vice President Harris, addressing the Essence festival, declared the upcoming November election the most consequential of our lifetime. She’s right. Turning away from democracy now would mean abandoning the freedoms we have so fiercely fought to secure. We cannot succumb to disillusionment or a ""nothing will change"" mentality while so many continue to fight for their rights at risk. The stakes are too high, and our resolve must be equally high. We must still venture to hope. We must look toward that bright picture in New Orleans, where prideful music and empowered voices rang through the air and see the work that has brought our community this far. The sacrifices of the past have led us here, and an equally passionate mobilization today will ensure that their work was not in vain. Our determination today will shape the destiny of future generations. We must vote like our lives depend on it because they do. "
Melania Trump to make rare public appearance at the Republican National Convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 9:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna161552,"After months of being conspicuously absent from the campaign trail, Melania Trump is scheduled to attend the Republican National Convention next week. A source familiar with the convention's plans told NBC News that the former first lady will be at the four-day event in Milwaukee, where Donald Trump will officially accept his party's nomination. It's not yet clear if she will join the lineup of speakers at the convention or how she might formally participate in the event's programs. One of the more inscrutable figures in her husband’s orbit, Melania Trump shares his disdain of the media and has kept a low profile in this election. The presumptive nominee told NBC News’ “Meet The Press” in September that his wife would be on the campaign trail with him “pretty soon.” But to date, she has only made two official public appearances for his campaign: joining him when he announced his re-election bid in November 2022 and voting for him in the Florida primaries in March this year. She has also attended several private fundraisers, as well as a dinner at Mar-a-Lago for Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán in March. The former first lady has otherwise not attended any of Trump's rallies or public events, and she did not accompany him to court during his hush money trial. There will be heightened focus on Melania Trump if she does address the convention this year. In 2016, her RNC speech was found to have plagiarized parts of Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. She also spoke at the convention in 2020, though much of that speech focused on her experience as first lady."
"Fearing a ‘shadow government,’ Comer issues new anti-Biden subpoenas",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 9:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shadow-government-comer-biden-subpoenas-2024-election-rcna161575,"In the wake of the presidential debate two weeks ago, congressional Republicans eyed a variety of steps to capitalize on President Joe Biden’s poor showing. Some, for example, pushed the White House Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and end the Democratic incumbent’s term. Others raised the prospect of a new House select committee that would focus entirely on Biden’s fitness for office. But it was House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer who, in the wake of his embarrassing impeachment crusade, seemed especially excited to go after his white whale in a new way. This past weekend, for example, the Kentucky Republican requested that Biden’s physician appear before lawmakers for a transcribed interview about the president’s health. A few days later, as Axios reported, Comer turned his sights on a different group of people close to Biden. Specifically, Comer this week issued subpoenas to Anthony Bernal, a top aide to first lady Jill Biden, as well as deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and senior adviser Ashley Williams. And why, pray tell, did the Oversight Committee chair subpoena these three relatively unknown officials in particular? As it happens, Comer appeared on Newsmax and explained his perspective. “Our research indicates that these are the three people that have been pulling the strings for quite some time in the White House,” the beleaguered congressman said. These are the three people that have been trying to cover up the fact that Joe Biden hasn’t been mentally or physically able to perform the job of president ... These three people, their names keep popping up as the gatekeepers, in addition to Hunter Biden.” Comer added, “Have these three no-name employees — have they been operating a shadow government? Have they been privy to classified information? Do they have national security clearance? Have they been ordering the Cabinet secretaries to do various job duties?” I suppose the obvious joke here is that if this trio of “no-name employees” have been secretly running the federal branch of the world’s pre-eminent superpower, then Bernal, Tomasini and Williams have been doing a terrific job. But the truth is that Comer’s latest conspiratorial gambit isn’t a joking matter, and Oversight Committee subpoenas shouldn’t target White House officials just because its hapless chairman is looking for a new toy after his impeachment effort failed spectacularly. Indeed, if the Kentucky Republican has any evidence of these staffers “operating a shadow government,” he’s kept it to himself, making his subpoenas sound an awful lot like a fishing expedition. Nevertheless, if Biden stays in the 2024 race, we can expect more of this in the coming weeks and months. Comer reportedly asked the aides to respond to his subpoenas by July 17, and he wants them to participate in closed-door interviews later this month. Watch this space."

Read: Hakeem Jeffries' letter to colleagues about his meeting with Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 8:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jeffries-biden-meeting-house-democrat-leader-document-pdf-rcna161546,"House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a letter to his colleagues on Friday that he met with President Joe Biden to discuss his caucus members' ""conclusions about the path forward"" amid the president's embattled re-election campaign. The New York Democrat said he met with Biden in person on Thursday evening and ""directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions"" shared by his caucus. The conversation took place as Biden faces pressure from some prominent Democrats, including more than a dozen members of the House, to drop out of the 2024 race. Those urging him to withdraw have cited concerns about his weak debate performance last month and his chances of beating Donald Trump in November. In his letter, Jeffries doesn’t indicate whether he urged Biden to drop out or encouraged him to stay in the race, or how his message was received by the president. Instead, he notes toward the end of his letter that House Democrats ""will continue to work in the best interests of everyday Americans."" Read Jeffries' letter below:"
U.S. foils alleged Russian assassination plot as Trump eyes new intel limits,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 8:13 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-foils-alleged-russian-assassinate-plot-trump-eyes-new-intel-limits-rcna161547,"Those interested in national security and international intelligence were confronted by two important headlines yesterday, which were connected in ways that might not be immediately obvious. The first came by way of NBC News, which noted that U.S. and German authorities uncovered and thwarted an alleged Russian plot to assassinate the CEO of a major German arms manufacturer. That last sentence was of particular interest. Intelligence officials in the United States uncovered the alleged Russia plot, informed our NATO allies in Berlin, and German officials were able to intervene. It’s the sort of critically important cooperation that strengthens our relationships abroad and saves lives. All of which leads us to the second report of interest. Politico reported that foreign officials have been informed that Donald Trump is “considering a reduction in intelligence sharing with members of NATO.” So, a few things. First, the fact that these two reports ran on the same day was rather extraordinary. On the one hand, the world was confronted with fresh evidence of the importance of the U.S. sharing intelligence with our NATO allies; while on the other hand, the world was simultaneously confronted with news that Trump intends to curtail sharing intelligence with our NATO allies. It’s difficult to say how many American voters will consider such an issue when weighing their presidential election choices, but it’s the sort of news that raises the stakes even higher. Second, the idea that the Republican and his team would deliberately take steps to reduce intelligence sharing with U.S. allies is dangerously bonkers. Indeed, the Politico report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that many countries depend on the U.S. “for the type of information that has helped Ukraine fend off Russia.” The article added, “The curtailment of intel could have dire security consequences, especially for Ukraine as it tries to repel the Russian invasion.” Former CIA Director John Brennan summarized matters this way: “Intelligence sharing among NATO members and with Ukraine has been absolutely essential to counter Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine as well as to uncover and thwart other destabilizing Russian activities in Europe and beyond. A cutoff or significant scaling back of U.S. intelligence sharing with NATO allies and partners would have an immediate, profound, and potentially long lasting adverse impact on Western security interests.” In other words, Team Trump’s intentions are the sort of plan that Vladimir Putin would love, but U.S. allies would hate. Finally, if the former Republican president is serious about “a reduction in intelligence sharing,” maybe he can start by blurting out fewer classified secrets?"
"GOP’s Grothman slams ‘angry feminist movement,’ seeks return to 1960s",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 7:27 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-grothman-slams-angry-feminist-movement-seeks-return-1960s-rcna161534,"Rep. Glenn Grothman has earned a reputation as a politician who speaks his mind — though he probably shouldn’t. It was a few years ago, for example, when the Wisconsin Republican argued that the District of Columbia doesn’t deserve statehood because it doesn’t have any local mining. That came on the heels of Grothman explaining his opposition to equal-pay legislation by saying, “You could argue that money is more important for men.” Around the same time, he reportedly criticized sex-ed classes because, as Grothman put it, some gay teachers “would like it if more kids became homosexuals.” Last year, the GOP congressman expressed concern that by diversifying the courts, President Joe Biden might be “actively discriminating against white heterosexual men.” Soon after, Grothman lamented the lack of “white guys” among the White House’s judicial nominees. Unfortunately, he’s still at it. The Daily Beast reported: Even by contemporary Republican standards, Grothman’s remarks, delivered on the House floor from what appeared to be prepared notes, were striking. The Wisconsin lawmaker initially claimed that Lyndon Johnson’s agenda “took the purpose out of the man’s life, because now you have a basket of goodies for the mom.” Grothman added, “They’ve taken away the purpose of the man to be part of a family. And if we want to get America back to, say, 1960, where this was almost unheard of, we have to fundamentally change these programs.” After criticizing a variety of social-insurance programs — including day care and pre-school — and denouncing “the angry feminist movement,” the Republican concluded, “So I hope the press corps picks up on this, and I hope Republican and Democrat [sic] leadership put together some sort of plan for January, in which we work our way back to where America was in the 1960s.” In 2020, it’s worth noting for context, Axios published a report ranking Donald Trump’s top loyalists on Capitol Hill. Grothman claimed the top spot at #1. I mention this because the former president is defined in large part by his retrospective perspective. Trump isn’t forward thinking; he boasts about his desire to go backwards, to a time when he thinks America was “great.” And while the presumptive GOP presidential nominee tends to be vague about just how far back he wants to roll back the clock, his congressional sycophant was more explicit: Grothman doesn’t just want to go back four years, to Trump’s term; he wants to go back six decades, to a time when people who looked and thought like him enjoyed a more exalted status over everyone else. The Republican congressman keeps running for re-election, even after he broke his term-limits pledge, and his Wisconsin constituents keep sending him back to Capitol Hill. In fact, in the 2022 midterm elections cycle, he won 95% of the vote — because literally no local Democrat was willing to run against him."
Many fake electors welcomed as delegates at Republican convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-fake-electors-election-delegates-republican-convention-rcna161524,"After Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020, Republicans in several states created forged election materials, pretending to be “duly elected and qualified electors,” and sent the documents to, among others, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Archivist, as if the fake materials were legitimate. They were not. These Republicans came to be known as their party’s “fake electors.” The larger criminal scandal surrounding their scheme has racked up indictment totals unseen since Watergate and Iran-Contra. With this in mind, it’s tempting to think that GOP officials would feel a degree of embarrassment about the entire controversy. Indeed, common sense might suggest that the recent indictments against fake electors would make these Republicans politically radioactive. Apparently, it’s not quite working out that way. We learned in May, for example, that several fake electors in Nevada were elected to serve as delegates to the Republican National Convention, even after they were criminally charged. “Clearly, lessons learned,” The Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston said sarcastically in response to the news. A month earlier, state prosecutors in Arizona indicted 18 Republicans as part of the party’s fake elector scheme, resulting in allegations of conspiracy, fraud and forgery. Some of them will be convention delegates, too. After the state GOP made the decision, The Arizona Republic’s Laurie Roberts summarized in a column: “The Arizona Republican Party on Saturday sent a flat out, full-throated, flabbergasting message to the voters of this great state. We be crazy, they proclaimed.” Nevertheless, those delegates apparently have some company. CNN reported this week: According to CNN’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the delegates will represent key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin. It’s worth emphasizing that not all of the fake electors who’ll serve as convention delegates are currently under criminal indictment — but some are, and the party doesn’t seem to care. Indeed, CNN’s report added, “Their role underscores how Trump has effectively woven election denialism into the GOP’s platform.” The same piece quoted former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger as saying, “Election denialism is like the price of entry now. ... These people that were in the fake elector scheme, or got a mug shot, they’re now the heroes of the movement, and they’ve taken over the party.” As the indictments piled up, it seemed implausible that GOP officials would extend rewards to those who were caught serving as fake electors. And yet, here we are."
Great economic news overshadowed by debate over Biden’s fate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/great-economic-news-overshadowed-debate-bidens-fate-rcna161515,"Those keeping a close eye on U.S. economic data had reason to celebrate yesterday morning. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ new report on the Consumer Price Index showed that price increases slowed sharply last month — including the first month-to-month decline in more than four years. The news not only offered fresh evidence that the United States has succeeded in getting inflation under control, it also opened the door to the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in September, giving Americans a boost ahead of November’s election. Not surprisingly, the White House was eager to tout the good news. President Joe Biden issued a statement that read in part: That quote at the end of the paragraph was in reference to a New York Times report, published this week, that read, “America’s so-called ‘left behind’ counties — the once-great manufacturing centers and other distressed places that struggled mightily at the start of this century — have staged a remarkable comeback. In the last three years, they added jobs and new businesses at their fastest pace since Bill Clinton was president.” This is not the only encouraging news on the economic front. The job market remains strong; wages are up; and the stock market continues to reach new heights. What’s more, there’s an international context to consider. The World Bank last month not only noted that the Biden-era economy is the world’s strongest, it also concluded that the global economy is in better shape in large part because of the United States’ recovery. “Globally, overall things are better today than they were just four or five months ago,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. “A big part of this has to do with the resilience of the U.S. economy.” Gill’s report further credited “U.S. dynamism” with helping to stabilize economies abroad. A Washington Post report added, “The United States is the only advanced economy growing significantly faster than the bank anticipated at the start of the year.” Around the same time, The Atlantic's Rogé Karma described the U.S. economy as “the envy of the world.” Four years ago, Donald Trump told supporters that Democratic policies would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” Everything he said and predicted was wrong — and the former president hasn’t even tried to explain why his predictions were so hilariously misplaced. And yet, a newly released ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll found Trump with a double-digit lead over Biden on whom voters trust more on the economy. There’s a larger conversation about why such public attitudes persist, but there’s also a more immediate problem for the White House and the Democratic Party. As a Semafor report noted this week, “If not for the brutal aftermath of Joe Biden’s debate debacle, Democrats might have spent the last couple of weeks celebrating some reassuring economic news.” Instead, it appears that the great news on the economy has been overshadowed by the debate over Biden’s 2024 fate to such an extent that much of country hasn’t heard about it at all. Making matters worse, it’s easy to imagine how the economic news will be incorporated into the intraparty fracas. One side of the Democratic divide will likely point to the great economic news and say, “See? Biden is a highly successful president who obviously deserves a second term! With results like these, it’d be absurd to push him off the Democratic ballot!” At that point, the other side of the Democratic divide will likely point to the identical data and say, “See? Despite being a highly successful president, Biden has a 37% approval rating, and the great economy hasn’t prevented him from falling behind a twice-impeached criminal! The sooner Biden passes the torch, the sooner Democrats can shift the public conversation!” When will this back-and-forth debate resolve? Your guess is as good as mine."
Biden's terrible polls are only strengthening his critics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-2024-polls-drop-out-rcna161348,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 3:00 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. Things are looking grim for Joe Biden. The president has been trailing former President Donald Trump in the polls since last year, but he’s experiencing what appears to be a daunting new deficit after his atrocious performance at the first presidential debate. The outlook is so rough that some Democrats are openly warning that Biden’s unpopularity could even affect down-ballot races for Democrats, dampening their ability to either win the House or hold on to the Senate. The threat of such catastrophic results in November will likely increase pressure from within the party for Biden to step aside for another Democrat. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Tuesday he believed Trump was on track “to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.” Bennet’s willingness to make such a statement is bad news for Biden’s efforts to mollify the increasing number of dissenting Democratic lawmakers who are expressing concern about or outright objecting to his candidacy. He had chosen to debate Trump months earlier than such debates are normally held to catch up to Trump in the polls. That plan backfired spectacularly. Biden is now worse off than before the debate, and he faces a growing mutiny from lawmakers who fear not just his loss but also their own. Polling averages aggregated by FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics show Trump surged and Biden dipped significantly in national polls after the June 27 debate. The averages put Biden a few points behind Trump, which is not by any means insurmountable. But Biden should be trouncing Trump, a corrupt aspiring autocrat, one of the most unpopular people to ever run for presidential office and a man recently convicted of 34 felony counts and found liable for sexual abuse. Around this time in their 2020 match-up, Biden was beating Trump by almost 10 points. It’s also important to remember that in 2016 and 2020 Trump outperformed the polls. That he’s consistently leading Biden this election cycle is alarming. Pollsters at the Cook Political report changed the status of three battleground states from toss-ups to “lean Republican” after the debate. And according to the combined data of the New York Times/Sienna College polls, Biden is seeing an extraordinary dip — Trump now has not just his biggest lead over Biden in this election cycle, but his largest lead over a Democrat since his 2016 White House bid. New York Times chief political correspondent and poll guru Nate Cohn told The New Yorker in a recent interview, “There are no precedents in recent memory for Presidents to have approval ratings like Biden’s who then go on to win re-election.”  Bennett isn’t the only Democratic lawmaker to suggest that Biden’s popularity could drag down senators and representatives in their races, especially in purple states. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who’s running for the Senate, expressed confidence Sunday in Democratic House and Senate candidates for now, noting that “they are running well ahead of the president,” but he expressed a note of caution that “you can only run so far ahead of the president.” Schiff also said the race between Biden and Trump “should not be even close, and the reason it is close is the president’s age.” University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said that in the battleground state of Georgia, Biden’s unpopularity “could be a problem” for Democratic challengers looking to flip districts. Biden is in a bind because there’s little he can do to turn the narrative around. Pollsters continue to find that his key vulnerability is the long-held perception that he’s too old for the job — and some surveys even find that voters find it more concerning than Trump’s criminal charges. Biden can do a lot to try to connect more with voters, but he can’t become younger, and, thus, he can’t do anything about his most glaring vulnerability. Democrats are correct to worry that Biden’s weak standing in polls bodes poorly for not only his re-election prospects, but also for their prospects in elections across his entire party. That could be what pushes some lawmakers who are on the fence about to press him to step aside."
The Republican Party platform has an audience of one,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republican-party-platform-trump-project-2025-rcna161259,"In a matter of days, former President Donald Trump’s anti-democracy agenda will most likely be met with thunderous applause as he officially accepts the Republican nomination for president at the party’s national convention.  The picture of a lawless America mired in poverty and perversion that Trump will paint isn’t backed up by reality, but it is set to be backed up by the official Republican Party platform. On Monday, the Republican platform committee advanced a draft of the so-called principles that will guide the Republican Party for the next four years. But this platform isn’t a road map to prosperity for the American people. It doesn’t offer a framework for unity in a fractured country. Instead, it is a manifesto for one man: Trump. The 16-page document is written to appeal to his sensibilities — emotionally, rhetorically and even grammatically (the erratic capitalization reads like one of his unhinged social media rants). And because it’s tailor-made for the convicted figurehead of this once-great party, it’s riddled with lies and belligerence designed to divide us further. Some tenets reflect the heartlessness Trump has ushered in. For instance, the platform promises to “CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY” — a policy that Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts also backed in his recent interview with ""The Weekend"" about Project 2025. Let’s put the logistics of deporting millions of people — many of whom have built lives and started families in this country — and kneecapping the economy aside for a moment. Let’s focus instead on the morality of breaking those families up, of devaluing human lives to the point of boasting about it. The position flies in the face of President Ronald Reagan’s more measured stance. After noting that “our strength comes from our own immigrant heritage and our capacity to welcome those from other lands,” Reagan said: Reagan later signed substantial immigration reform into law with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That bill banned the hiring of undocumented immigrants while still ensuring a pathway to lawful permanent residence and eventual citizenship for some 2.7 million undocumented immigrants who entered the country before 1982. That’s a far cry from today’s Republican Party, which paints an apocalyptic picture of a so-called invasion at the southern border while tanking solutions to the issue at Trump’s direction. The platform is also riddled with these kinds of contradictions.  The document highlights the importance of free speech multiple times throughout its pages, pledging to “ban the Federal Government from colluding with anyone to censor Lawful Speech.” In the same document, it vows “to keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America.”  Exactly how do you do that? I fervently disagree with communism, Marxism and socialism, but like the views that animate this MAGA platform, they aren't unlawful, and, as long as their expression doesn’t put people in physical danger, I believe that even views I disagree with shouldn’t be regulated by the government.  If the government can begin sanctioning everyday people for their political views alone, it sets a dangerous precedent. The platform acknowledges this with the pledge to “hold accountable those who have misused the power of Government to unjustly prosecute their Political Opponents.” Then, there’s a tapestry of issues that the Republican Party under Trump has proven ineffective at addressing. “Republicans will reassert greater Federal Control over Washington, DC to restore Law and Order in our Capital City, and ensure Federal Buildings and Monuments are well-maintained.” The irony is palpable. On Jan. 6, 2021, a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the U.S. Capitol, where they shattered windows, ransacked offices and trashed the emblem of American democracy. Federal authorities estimate that Trump’s foot soldiers wreaked $2.73 million in damage. Now, Republicans claiming to support law and order have largely backed Trump’s promise to pardon the rioters who desecrated a building paid for by U.S. taxpayers while also threatening to undermine the self-governance of our capital city.  Then there's the platform's vow to “END INFLATION,"" a problem already under control. Just this Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that year-over-year inflation rose only 3% last month — a sharper decrease than expected, continuing a steady reduction from a peak of 9% two years prior. Or maybe Trump means the inflation that he will kick off with his other campaign pledges, as economists have warned that the drastic increases in tariffs he has endorsed would decimate that progress and worsen inflation. The current Republican platform is incoherent, hate-filled and ham-fisted, but that should come as no surprise. It was made in the image of the man who will accept the party’s nomination in just a few days. A famous speech in ""Macbeth"" compares life to “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing,” as the Scottish king’s empire implodes. The platform of this once-great party has “sound and fury” in spades and is being told by no shortage of idiots, but unfortunately, it doesn’t signify “nothing.” It signifies what will guide the MAGA party if it is given the chance to write laws that govern your life.

He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution, the rule of law and the American people,” wrote the Times’ editorial board, which is separate from its newsroom. “Instead of a cogent vision for the country’s future, Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests, satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him. “He is, quite simply, unfit to lead.” Published Thursday morning, four days before the start of the Republican National Convention, the opinion piece also criticizes the GOP and its endorsement of Trump: The board pointed to the extraordinary fracturing within the Democratic Party right now over President Joe Biden’s re-election bid and lamented Republicans’ failure to have such a debate among their ranks “about the manifest moral and temperamental unfitness of their standard-bearer.” The editorial also called on voters to “pay attention to what he did as president and allow yourself to truly inhabit what he has promised to do if returned to office.” The screed against Trump isn’t likely to sway any of his hard-core fans, but it might carry weight in what is shaping up to be a close, high-stakes election. The Times is often accused by the right and the left of being biased against their side, but it’s generally seen as a liberal-leaning newspaper, whether that’s true or not. And the paper can influence the public conversation, as evidenced by the assumed impact of its near-obsessive coverage of Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016."
Meet the MAGA influencer turned Project 2025 adviser who could staff the White House,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-henchman-project2025-rcna161428,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 10 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes."" Donald Trump really wants you to believe he has nothing to do with Project 2025, the 900-page wish list of far-right proposals ready to go should he win the presidency in November. He even went so far as to claim, “I have no idea who is behind it.” Well, someone who is behind Project 2025 is John McEntee. He was frequently seen in photos with Trump holding the former president's bag. McEntee used to be Trump's bodyman — basically a personal assistant — during the early years of his administration ... and it didn’t end well. In 2018, McEntee was abruptly forced out of his post and escorted off the White House grounds amid an investigation by the Secret Service for serious financial crimes. According to The Wall Street Journal, McEntee was a habitual gambler, betting tens of thousands of dollars at a time, and was deemed a security risk as a result. The chief of staff at the time, John Kelly, effectively had him tossed off the White House premises. We should note, McEntee was never charged with a crime. Despite it all, McEntee remained loyal to Trump. The former college football player and Fox News production assistant was such a strong believer in Trump’s message that, back in 2015, he repeatedly cold-emailed the Trump campaign, begging for a job. The campaign eventually brought him on as a volunteer and then as a paid staffer. McEntee was so committed to the cause he worked out of a space in Trump Tower with just three walls and an unfinished floor. His loyalty to the boss paid off. After Trump fired Kelly he brought McEntee back, this time as the director of the Presidential Personnel Office — the guy who decided who got to work for the president. In that role, McEntee worked to purge staffers deemed insufficiently loyal, all while ensuring only the most rabid Trump toadies got jobs in the White House. He was also deeply involved in Trump’s attempted coup, including efforts to pressure Mike Pence to reject the results of the 2020 election. Journalist Jon Karl called him “The Man Who Made Jan. 6th Possible."" After the coup failed, McEntee spun his notoriety into a career as something of a conservative influencer: selling a MAGA dating app and posting deranged videos on social media. Including one in which he bragged about giving homeless people fake money. McEntee later claimed the video was a joke. That sounds like a pretty gross and weird joke to me. So why are we talking about John McEntee? Well, he's now a senior adviser to Project 2025, specifically, its “Presidential Personnel Database."" It's Project 2025's plan to staff the White House if Trump wins in November. That means the grifting, gambling Jan. 6 henchman — who was too much of a security issue for the Trump administration — is going to be the guy vetting resumes the second time around. Is that someone you want in charge of the most important personnel office in the country?      "
"Trump set for another playdate with Hungary's authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-viktor-orban-hungary-russia-rcna161443,"Donald Trump on Thursday is scheduled to have another authoritarian playdate with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The meeting, juxtaposed to the NATO summit President Joe Biden has been hosting this week, highlights the stark contrast between a campaign that’s chosen to align itself with dictatorial foreign leaders and an administration that’s aligned with democratic ones. By the week’s end, Biden will have delivered a forceful speech and held various meetings in support of maintaining America’s alliances and the democratic values they uphold. Trump, on the other hand, will have admitted he barely knew what NATO was before he became president and will have met with one of the group’s most unreliable members in Orban.  Trump and his followers have openly celebrated Orban’s illiberal ways over the last few years, with right-wing activists going so far as to host a Conservative Political Action Conference event in Hungary in 2022. In March of this year, Trump claimed “there’s nobody that’s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orban,” going on to call him “fantastic” and boasting about his authoritarian style. “He’s a noncontroversial figure because he says, ‘This is the way it’s going to be,’ and that’s the end of it. Right?” Trump gushed. “He’s the boss.” Orban, for the record, has condemned “mixed race” nations, has cracked down on press freedoms, has said his vision for Hungary is “illiberal democracy,” and has overseen the rigging of Hungary’s political system to favor his political party over others. In many ways, he has done to his country what Trump and his allies aspire to accomplish in the United States. Which apparently includes turning Hungary into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proxy. Orban has turned Hungary into a dubious — if not deliberately destructive — NATO partner through his efforts to distance his country from the group and his coziness with Putin. Just last week, Orban met with Putin privately to discuss Ukraine and emerged from the meeting parroting Putin’s talking points.  Trump, of course, said in February that he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that don’t pay into the group what he thinks they should — a theme he has returned to repeatedly (as my colleague Steve Benen wrote in 2020, Trump “still doesn’t fully understand the basics of the alliance’s finances”). And after their meeting earlier this year, Orban said that Trump told him that if he’s elected president, he won’t give “a penny” to Ukraine, essentially allowing Russia to continue its deadly power grab. Thursday’s meeting between the two men is likely to touch on Orban's unilateral machinations to engineer a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine. But the meeting itself is a revealing signal of how a Trump administration is likely to alienate America’s allies, with potentially disastrous results — in contrast to a Biden administration that would continue to maintain those bonds."

‘It was torture’: Texas mom recounts being denied abortion for doomed pregnancy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/health-mindset/-was-torture-texas-mom-recounts-denied-abortion-doomed-pregnancy-rcna161450,"When Samantha Casiano of East Texas found out she was pregnant with her fifth child, she was ecstatic. But at a 20-week ultrasound, she received shocking news. Her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a rare and fatal condition that prevents the skull and brain from fully forming. This was in December 2022, after the Texas Heartbeat Act, or Senate Bill 8, was enacted. The law bans abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which usually occurs after about six weeks of pregnancy. It was passed nearly nine months before the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion. “I was told that it meant that my daughter was incompatible with life. And I wouldn’t be adding another little human to our family. It was really hard to hear that. It felt like it was a dream -- a really, really bad dream, Casiano, 30, recounted. Casiano said she was told by her doctor that the baby “would die, either before I give birth, or as soon as I do give birth.” Because of Texas’ strict abortion laws, Casiano had few options. The state bans abortions in almost all cases, with the exceptions of “life threatening” conditions to the mother. Casiano said she was unable to travel outside of the state for an abortion due to financial and logistical constraints. So, she was forced to go to term with her baby. “Just imagine yourself waking up every morning, knowing that your daughter was going to die. You can feel her kick and move, but she’s going to die. So you have to plan her funeral while she’s inside of you,” said Casiano. “And that’s probably the hardest thing any mother has to go through…It was traumatizing and hard.. Just thinking about it now is just me makes my stomach hurt. And I was forced to go through it. It was torture.”  Four hours after giving birth, Casiano’s daughter, Halo Hope, passed away. “She gasped for air for four hours … She changed colors right in front of me.” Casiano recalled. “And at a certain point, I couldn’t mentally and emotionally [cope]. I feel like mentally I had to close off in order to keep sane.” Casiano wants the world to hear her story, especially as a new study is shedding light on the effects abortion bans have had on infant mortality.  According to a report published in JAMA Pediatrics, infant mortality increased 12.9 percent from 2021 to 2022 in Texas after the state enacted a near-total abortion ban. A total of 2,240 infants in Texas died in 2022, compared to 1,985 the year prior.  Of those deaths, a disproportionate amount involved congenital abnormalities. Dr. Alison Gemmill, a lead author on the report, said the findings suggest that infant deaths due to congenital abnormalities in Texas were a direct effect of the ban during the 2021-2022 time period. “We saw a 23 percent increase in those deaths in Texas, but a 3 percent decrease in the rest of the U.S.” Fatal fetal abnormalities can be detected through a fetal anatomy scan, like in Casiano’s case, but are usually not detected until about 20 weeks into the pregnancy — well after Texas’ six week abortion ban limit.  Casiano was one of the 20 pregnant women denied abortions in Texas, along with two obstetrician-gynecologists who sued the state of Texas. Represented by the Center of Reproductive Rights, they argued the state’s medical exceptions to its abortion ban were not clear enough for doctors to interpret. The case, which asked for more clear medical guidelines to its states abortion ban, was ultimately rejected by the Texas Supreme Court in May.    Becky Uranga, an OB-GYN in Idaho, said abortion healthcare is a critical part of working with mothers who are carrying babies with congenital abnormalities. “We want to make sure we identify those [abnormalities] early — talk about options and choices and make sure we have the appropriate care (specific pediatric specialists) available. These pregnancies are often at much higher risk for preterm rupture of membranes, bleeding issues or preterm deliveries.”  In Idaho, where Uranga practices, there is a near-total ban on abortion. Just last month, The Supreme Court last ruled an exception exists when the life of the mother is at risk.   Casiano said one of the biggest heartaches of her experience was knowing her daughter had to suffer through her last breaths. Grieving her death, she shared, started the day Halo was diagnosed with the fatal condition, “I should have been able to release my daughter that day. I just wasn’t able to. I was restricted from doing that,” she said.  Now Casiano visits Halo’s grave every year on her baby’s birthday, which she has mixed emotions about. “When I buried her, it was a bittersweet moment…releasing her into heaven. But I’m mad that it took this long to get there. She shouldn’t have had to wait that long.”  Daniela Pierre-Bravo is a journalist, author, and founder of Acceso Community — a mentorship program for professional women.

The Supreme Court has pulled off a judicial coup. Here’s how to fight back.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 2:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cori-bush-reform-supreme-court-watch-democracy-die-rcna161409,"Last week, the Supreme Court’s far-right majority went home for the summer, but only after a stark reminder that they do not serve the people of this country — they serve Donald Trump and MAGA extremism. They serve wealthy corporations exploiting our communities. They serve whichever right-wing billionaire gives them the most gifts. This term, the same extremist justices who overturned the constitutional right to abortion and ended affirmative action doubled down on the court’s legacy of protecting the interests of wealth and white supremacy. These unelected justices have pulled off a judicial coup on behalf of fascists and billionaires. They have enabled Trump to evade accountability. They have opened the door for the MAGA cult to destroy our rights through Project 2025. They have greenlit the criminalization of homelessness. They have left millions of people in states like Missouri vulnerable to bans on emergency abortions and other attacks on reproductive rights. And they have provided a road map for wealthy corporations to harm our planet and our communities by handcuffing the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and countless other agencies from regulating them. The Republican-appointed justices are fighting a war on behalf of far-right extremists against the people of this country, and they are just getting started. Congress has a choice to make: reform the court or bear witness to the death of democracy and the destruction of the communities it should protect. Court reform is often discussed in abstract terms, but the reality is that for communities like St. Louis, it is a matter of life or death. This court has determined that my constituents cannot access abortion care. That they deserve weaker labor protections. That it’s fine if they drink polluted water and breathe polluted air, are subject to voter suppression, are more likely to be unhoused, and are subject to the whims of fascist presidents who seek immunity and absolute impunity. Court reform is personal for me — not just as a member of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, but as a survivor of gun violence, as someone who has had an abortion, as the daughter of a former union meat cutter, and as a congresswoman representing a community that has been systematically denied the right to vote. And it should be personal to everyone who cares about our democracy and our freedoms. The gavel’s fall should signify justice served, not lives destroyed. Our lives and our communities are worse off because of this unchecked, extremist Supreme Court. The time for reform is now. Congress must remove lawless justices through impeachment — that’s why this week my colleagues and I introduced articles of impeachment against Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito over their multiple ethical conflicts and failures to disclose. Congress must also pass legislation that imposes a binding code of ethics for every justice. We must expand the Court to 13 seats by passing the Judiciary Act, which I proudly co-lead. Congress must enact term limits for the justices. Finally, we must strip the Supreme Court of its power to invalidate federal laws that protect our fundamental rights. We cannot let the Supreme Court continue to sign death warrants for our communities. The longer we wait, the more vulnerable to fascism we become. I ask my colleagues in Congress: In this perilous moment, will we reform the court or will we watch democracy die?"
Biden and his allies need to make a decision — fast.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-divided-biden-trump-democracy-rcna161343,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 11 episode of ""Morning Joe."" In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus issued a condemnation of judgmental religious leaders: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."" In 1858, with the specter of a civil war rising in the United States over the issue of slavery, Abraham Lincoln accepted the Illinois Republican nomination for Senate, quoting Jesus and remarking in a now well-known speech, “A house divided against itself cannot stand."" Lincoln told his fellow Republicans, ""I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."" He then encouraged his party to stand together as they had done in the past, ""Two years ago, the Republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external circumstance against us."" Lincoln’s words to Republicans in 1858 are all too relevant to Democrats today, as we approach a pivotal weekend for the future of our democracy. There's a rupture running deep throughout the Democratic Party: a split tearing at its very foundation. It's a divide that will only serve to elect a man who has repeatedly promised to be a dictator. President Joe Biden is on one side of this Democratic divide. In 2020, the president and his supporters saved American democracy by defeating Donald Trump, a malignant force promising to undermine the Constitution, make common cause with America’s enemies, and refuse to accept any democratic election result that declared him defeated. Against the grim backdrop of his predecessor, Biden passed more bipartisan legislation and created more jobs than any president this generation. He also led America out of Covid more successfully than any other country on the planet, and has overseen the strongest dollar in a half-century. America’s economy is now the envy of the world. Period. Under Biden, our military and alliances are stronger relative to the rest of the world than at any time since World War II. This is not a matter of debate, unless you get your news from hucksters on TikTok or a cable news channel allergic to the truth. Despite what Trumpists say, America is great, strong and respected across the world. Biden is showing as much by hosting a NATO summit this week — under his leadership, the alliance has become the strongest in the world’s history. On the other side of the divide, many of the most powerful Democratic politicians, thought leaders and donors say privately — and soon may say publicly — that Biden can't win in November. That's become an almost universal sentiment among dozens of Democrats over the last 36 hours. They say the polls are collapsing, fundraising is drying up and any chance of saving the Senate and House from Trump's rule is vanishing before their eyes. Those are the two sides to this Democratic divide both with compelling arguments. But the window for saving American democracy is closing. Biden is dug in: he has the votes and the delegates. In the president's eyes, it's his rightful nomination. Also dug in are those who revere Biden but cherish democracy even more, and for them this is a zero-sum game. That's why the handful of Democrats that Biden greatly respects — Nancy Pelosi, Ted Kauffman, Jim Clyburn, Chris Dodd, John Kerry, Ron Klain, and his family — Jill, Val and Hunter Biden — need to come together this weekend and talk about the consequences of this campaign and this candidacy on our country’s future. Democrats must come to a decision and unite against the immediate threat before America’s 240-year constitutional republic: Donald Trump. Lincoln finished that 1858 speech by telling his fellow party members that against the ""strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the battle through, under the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and pampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now? Now, when that same enemy is wavering, dissevered and belligerent? This result is not doubtful. We shall not fail if we stand firm. We shall not fail.” So said Lincoln then. So says a watchful and worried nation now."
Jim Jordan’s latest hearing was a frightening look at American authoritarianism,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 1:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jim-jordan-weaponization-business-advertisers-rcna161425,"At a hearing Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan gave American businesses yet another preview of the authoritarian rule they can expect to run rampant if Donald Trump is elected president. Ever since Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives, the Ohio Republican has used his leadership position to press private businesses to bend to conservatives’ will. Under the guise of opposing government weaponization against conservatives, Jordan has weaponized his role as Judiciary chair to lean on social media companies to try to prevent them from stopping the spread of hate speech and disinformation online — efforts that Jordan and his allies revealingly paint as anti-Republican attacks. And as an extension of that crusade, they’ve targeted corporations that they dubiously claim have avoided advertising with conservatives. It’s all part of the conservative movement’s assault on free enterprise, which continued Wednesday when Jordan invited corporate advertisers to testify and then harangued them. In this clip, for example, Jordan suggests that the advertisers have nefariously avoided advertising on far-right commentator Ben Shapiro’s platform … as Shapiro sits right next to them. The executives, including Unilever USA President Herrish Patel and GroupM global CEO Christian Juhl, pushed back on Jordan’s claims and denied they make advertising decisions based on political views. But the real issue is that this hearing occurred at all. It had the feel of a kleptocracy — a government of people who use their powers to pry resources from citizens and hand those resources to well-connected elites. All this had me thinking about comments made by historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat on Wednesday’s episode of “The ReidOut.” Ben-Ghiat explained to Joy that authoritarian governments like the one Trump hopes to establish are known for their kleptocracy, which often takes the form of attacks on private businesses. You can watch the full segment here. It really puts Jordan’s authoritarian spectacle in context, and serves as a warning about the independence that Americans — and the businesses they run — stand to lose if Trump and his allies win in November."
Hackers join the fight to inform the public about Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 12:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/project-2025-hackers-heritage-foundation-rcna161400,"It looks like hacktivists have joined the fight to shine a light on Project 2025, the far-right blueprint for reshaping the government to achieve ultraconservative goals if Donald Trump is elected president in November.  Google searches for “Project 2025” have skyrocketed in recent weeks, likely due in part to celebrities, including Taraji P. Henson at the BET Awards last month, drawing attention to the extremist plan. A group of hackers has joined the effort to pull back the curtain on Project 2025. On Tuesday, the cybersecurity news outlet CyberScoop reported that a collective comprised of self-described “gay furry hackers"" that calls itself SiegedSec gained access to Heritage Foundation data. Specifically, the collective said it gained access to a website hosting content produced by members of the Heritage Foundation, the organization that assembled Project 2025 with the help of several members of Trump’s former administration.  Per CyberScoop: A SiegedSec spokesperson who goes by “vio” told CyberScoop that the data the group accessed includes “full names, email addresses, passwords, and usernames” of people associated with Heritage. But a Heritage spokesperson denied that the organization was “hacked,” telling CyberScoop that “an organized group stumbled upon a two-year-old archive of The Daily Signal website that was available on a public-facing website owned by a contractor.” Nonetheless, Heritage folks don’t sound happy about this data dump. The Daily Dot shared excerpts of angry text messages sent from Mike Howell — a former Trump administration official and the executive director of the Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project — to vio. Howell confirmed the authenticity of the texts to The Daily Dot via X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. No one likes to be targeted by hackers — so Howell’s apparent discomfort with the situation is understandable. But it's unsurprising that openly promoting an authoritarian agenda could draw the ire of many people, including so-called ""gay furry hackers."""
"The GOP's latest anti-Garland gambit fails, despite Trump’s push",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 11:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-latest-anti-garland-gambit-fails-trumps-push-rcna161421,"Congressional Republicans haven’t given up on their crusade against Attorney General Merrick Garland, but as NBC News reported Thursday afternoon, their efforts aren’t going especially well. The final tally was 210-204. The measure would’ve passed, but four House Republicans — Reps. David Joyce of Ohio, Mike Turner of Ohio, Tom McClintock of California, and John Duarte of California — balked and voted with the Democratic minority. For those who might benefit from a refresher, let’s recap how we arrived at this point. Several months ago, former special counsel Robert Hur wrapped up his investigation into President Joe Biden inadvertently taking some classified documents after his vice presidential tenure ended. Not surprisingly, the prosecutor decided not to indict the incumbent president. Soon after, Hur released a report, which included a transcript of an interview that Biden volunteered to participate in. (Donald Trump, in contrast, refused to be interviewed by either special counsel Robert Mueller or special counsel Jack Smith.) In theory, that ended the story. In practice, however, there was one additional element that Republicans decided to pursue: the audio recording of the incumbent president’s Q&A with investigators. Republicans admitted that they were just looking for a campaign cudgel, but that didn't deter the effort. When the White House asserted executive privilege, and the Justice Department told Congress it wouldn’t get the recording, House GOP members voted to hold Garland in contempt. And then things got a little weird. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida recently announced a plan to go after the attorney general with an “inherent contempt” measure that would, for all intents and purposes, empower the House’s sergeant-at-arms to arrest Garland. When that failed to gain traction, Luna turned to Plan B — a second “inherent contempt” measure that would subject the A.G. to $10,000-a-day fines until the Justice Department provided lawmakers with the interview tapes. On Wednesday, this effort received a hearty endorsement from Trump. Roughly 24 hours later, the measure fell short in the House anyway. What’s next? One can only guess, though it seems inevitable that the GOP majority will continue to explore new ways to go after the attorney general. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The SAVE Act saves nobody — but would make it harder to vote,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 11:07 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-republicans-save-act-mike-johnson-trump-rcna160741,"The House passed a bill Wednesday that Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., claims will counter a major scourge that threatens the sanctity of federal elections. Republicans argue that the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act — which passed 221-198 — is necessary to defend against noncitizens voting in the fall, potentially swinging the results of federal elections. In reality, the SAVE Act is a solution to an all-but-nonexistent problem, but if enacted would make it harder for American citizens to exercise their right to vote. As with much of the House Republican agenda, this bill owes its existence Donald Trump. Johnson joined the former president at Mar-a-Lago in April to talk about “election integrity,” the sanitized term that the GOP has adopted to launder Trump’s 2020 election conspiracy theories. Since that day, the speaker has made the subtext of the bill’s intentions into text, falsely claiming on X that Democrats oppose the resulting bill because “they want illegals to vote in our elections.” Unsurprisingly, this is false. Republicans will point to a few cities like New York and Washington that allow noncitizens to vote. But that permission only applies to legal residents participating in local elections, not state or federal contests. Given how rare it is that noncitizens even attempt to register to vote, let alone manage to cast a ballot, the bill is an Anti-Tiger Rock at best, falsely taking credit for solving a problem that doesn’t actually exist. And like most snake oil, it’s much more likely that this bill will leave the patient sicker than if this supposed palliative had never been offered. In practice, the SAVE Act, drafted by archconservative Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, overhauls the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. That act mandates that states allow residents to register to vote when applying for a driver’s license or other official ID card. In states like New York, that requires applicants to affirm that they’re a U.S. citizen as part of the process, signing an affidavit that makes clear that lying on the form is a crime. Under the SAVE Act, those states would now be forced to require applicants to provide documentary proof that they are a citizen, including a passport or birth certificate, at the time they fill out the form. This requirement would add a hurdle that many Americans born in the continental U.S. would not be able to easily clear. A survey that the Brennan Center for Justice and other democracy groups conducted last year found that “more than 9 percent of American citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, don’t have proof of citizenship readily available. … And at least 3.8 million don’t have these documents at all, often because they were lost, destroyed, or stolen.” Imagine that you’ve moved across state lines and need to register to vote in your new district. The odds that you may wait to change your registration — or never change it at all — would likely increase as more burdens are placed on the process, much as forcing people who qualify for federal aid to jump through hoops prevents them from accessing it. And forget about celebrities like Taylor Swift driving nearly as many people to register online at Vote.org if new registrants have to find and upload their documents as part of the process. Furthermore, the bill’s language is as dangerously imprecise in some areas as it is draconian in others. There is nothing that makes clear whether a state would have to accept documents from someone whose name has legally changed due to marriage or gender transition. Voters would likewise be allowed to register only if they provide a birth certificate issued by “a state, unit of local government, or a Tribal government.” That requirement could be waived with a naturalization certificate, say, but would have to be paired with a “valid government-issued photo identification card issued by a Federal, State or Tribal government.” As Del. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan, D-Northern Marianas Islands, pointed out in the floor debate, the bill’s language manages to completely ignore the territories, disenfranchising his constituents even further. Tellingly, the rhetoric from Republicans as the bill was being debated on the House floor on Wednesday mostly focused on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. A common refrain throughout the day was that the SAVE Act is necessary because of the number of immigrants who have entered the country since Biden took office. The Washington Post’s Philip Bump rightly referred to this bill as the legislative version of the Great Replacement Theory, which claims that Democrats are trying to drown out white voters with an influx of migrants who will vote illegally. The good news is that this bill will not pass the Senate this term, let alone avoid a presidential veto. But five swing district Democrats crossed party lines to give it their approval, showing their concern that the GOP’s rhetoric might hit home with their voters. Moreover, given the threat of a full GOP takeover of Congress next year, we could see the return of the SAVE Act. If so, it would not be as a cheap stunt to raise the specter of an immigrant takeover, but as a newly printed law on the books, one that would further chip away at access to Americans’ most fundamental rights."
"Shelley Duvall, who starred in ‘The Shining,’ dies at 75",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 8:53 AM PDT / Updated July 11, 2024, 9:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/shelley-duvall-dead-the-shining-rcna161372,"Shelley Duvall, an award-winning actress who most famously starred in Stanley Kubrick's horror classic ""The Shining,"" has died, her partner Dan Gilroy said. She was 75. ""She’s gone after much suffering, which I guess is a good thing,"" Gilroy told NBC News, adding: ""I can’t tell you how much I miss her."" Duvall had been in hospice care for the last few months while dealing with complications from diabetes, he said. She died in her sleep early Thursday at their home in Blanco, Texas, he said. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news of Duvall's death. Known for her distinctive doe-eyed mannerisms and the unconventional characters she chose to portray, Duvall has said that she never set out to be an actor. She attributed her film career to director Robert Altman, who cast her in her first role in his dark comedy, ""Brewster McCloud,"" in 1970. She went on to act in several other Altman films, including the Western ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" and ""Nashville,"" a musical comedy. She had several prominent leading roles in the 1980s, starring as Olive Oyl in the live-action ""Popeye"" movie opposite Robin Williams and in ""The Shining"" with co-star Jack Nicholson. Her role in ""The Shining"" was widely praised, although she later recounted how difficult it was to work under Kubrick's demanding process. Duvall won a Cannes best actress award in 1977 for her role in ""3 Women,"" a psychological horror film directed by Altman. In 2012, Duvall retreated from Hollywood for a break that would last 20 years. She was interviewed on an episode of ""Dr. Phil"" in 2016, appearing disheveled as she talked about her struggle with mental illness. The show was widely criticized at the time and accused of exploiting Duvall's struggle for viewers' entertainment. In a New York Times profile of the actress earlier this year, Gilroy said the ""Dr. Phil"" interview ""did nothing"" for Duvall. “It just put her on the map as an oddity,” he said. Duvall returned to acting with the 2023 indie horror film ""The Forest Hills."" It would also be her last movie."
Why it matters that a Nevada county refused to certify primary results,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 9:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/matters-nevada-county-refused-certify-primary-results-rcna161392,"Around this time two years ago, New Mexico held largely unremarkable primary elections, which went smoothly — for the most part. When it came time to certify the results of the primaries, Republican election officials in Otero County balked. They weren’t aware of any problems with the vote tallies or the local election equipment, but local GOP commissioners refused to certify the results anyway because of their conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated feelings about the voting process. Fortunately for everyone involved, it didn’t take too long to resolve the matter. New Mexico’s secretary of state, Democrat Maggie Toulouse Oliver, went to the state Supreme Court, asking the justices to order Otero County commissioners to certify the results. The justices agreed and directed local officials to do their job. This was not, however, an all’s-well-that-ends-well story. On the contrary, it raised uncomfortable questions about other Republican election officials elsewhere doing the same thing in the future. An Associated Press report described the mess in New Mexico as “a preview of the kind of chaos election experts fear is coming.” The article quoted Jennifer Morrell, a former election official in Colorado and Utah who now advises federal, state and local officials, saying, “We are in scary territory. If this can happen here, where next? It’s like a cancer, a virus. It’s metastasizing and growing.” That quote came to mind two years later reading this NBC News report out of Nevada. For those unfamiliar with Washoe County, this is Nevada’s second most populous county. It’s also considered a competitive area in one of the nation’s most closely watched swing states. What happens next isn’t altogether clear, but Nevada’s secretary of state and attorney general — both of whom are Democrats — said last night that local commissioners have failed to uphold state election laws. Just as we saw in New Mexico two years ago, USA Today reported that they’re reportedly preparing to ask the Nevada Supreme Court to require that officials in Washoe County meet their legal obligations. Chances are, this will work out, but an Associated Press report added, “The rejection of the recounts and questions over how to handle it raised concerns about what could happen in November if a local commission refused to certify the presidential election results.” Watch this space."
Arkansas group vows to fight ‘ridiculous’ rejection of abortion rights ballot initiative,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 9:05 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arkansas-abortion-rights-ballot-initiative-reject-rcna161330,"Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston on Wednesday rejected an effort to put an abortion rights amendment proposal on the November ballot, citing incomplete paperwork. Thurston, a Republican, told the group that collected signatures for the petition that it did not submit statements that showed it informed paid canvassers about the rules for gathering signatures and that it did not identify those paid canvassers by name. The group, Arkansans for Limited Government, announced on Friday that it had collected more than 101,000 signatures from registered voters to put the proposal on the ballot. The amendment to the state constitution would protect abortion access up to 18 weeks after fertilization and would extend that protection in cases of rape, incest and instances of a fatal fetal anomaly. But Thurston told the group that because of those paperwork omissions, some of the signatures submitted are ineligible, leaving the petition 3,322 signatures short of the required 90,704. Arkansans for Limited Government assailed the secretary of state in a statement late Wednesday. The group said it had worked with his office “during every step of the process” to make sure its organizers were adhering to the rules: “Asserting now that we didn’t provide required documentation regarding paid canvassers is absurd and demonstrably, undeniably incorrect,” the group said. Republican lawmakers in Arkansas cheered the secretary’s rejection of the proposal. In a post on X, Gov. Sarah Sanders mocked abortion rights advocates, writing, “Today the far left pro-abortion crowd in Arkansas showed they are both immoral and incompetent.” Securing abortion rights in the state constitution through a ballot measure has been a winning approach in Michigan, California and Ohio. Voters in several other states are also poised to vote on an amendment proposal in November. But replicating that success in Arkansas — a deep-red state with a near-total abortion ban, where zero abortions were reportedly performed last year — would be an uphill climb. Arkansans for Limited Government said it will keep pushing for the proposal. “We will fight this ridiculous disqualification attempt with everything we have,” the group said. “We will not back down.”"
Intellectual humility leads us to Kamala Harris as the least risky bet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 9:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-president-biden-2024-rcna161098,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 3:00 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. Questions about whether President Joe Biden could drop his candidacy for the White House have inspired a kind of fantasy football mindset among political junkies. Hop online or tune in to any water cooler conversation among Democrats who think Biden should step aside and you’ll hear people excitedly catalogue their favorite potential replacement tickets, listing the strengths and statistics behind the governors, senators, former first lady or Hollywood star who they believe should be drafted to lead Team Blue to victory.  These debates are fun, but they are indeed fantasies. People who think they know exactly how a candidate who holds statewide, local or no office would fare in a general election are dreaming. American presidential races are political contests unlike any other. Politicians can look good on paper in a specific milieu, but it’s impossible to predict how they will register with the general electorate. Or how they’ll endure oppo research and vicious negative messaging unlike anything they’ve faced before in their lives, backed by the best-financed agents of reactionary power in the world.  The Democratic Party is at a juncture where every possible path is extremely risky. The moment demands humility and agnosticism; the goal is not to identify an obvious winner, which is impossible, but to manage risk. If Biden steps aside, Vice President Kamala Harris is most likely the least risky option. The argument that Harris is less risky might strike some as counterintuitive. Her vice presidency has been marked by strikingly low favorability ratings. Biden assigned her a politically sensitive policy portfolio that led her to, for example, take positions on immigration that brought her under fire from both the left and the right. And reports indicating that Harris felt frustrated and sidelined by Biden’s team mar the narrative of a natural passing of the torch. But taking a cautious position on what we can know suggests Harris has fewer unknown variables in her potential candidacy. She has been in the national limelight for years and thus has extremely wide name recognition, far superior to commonly floated alternatives. She has endured MAGA attacks for years and can clearly handle the pressure. While a presidential bid would most likely inspire new right-wing efforts to find skeletons in her closet, odds are that most of what could’ve been used against her would’ve been used in 2020 to torpedo the Biden-Harris ticket. Harris is also unequivocally qualified for the position with her background as an attorney general, senator and, of course, vice president. And at about 20 years younger than both Biden and Trump, she would instantly be able to shed Biden’s greatest political liability and shift the energy of the party. The strongest counter to Harris is tied to her consistent unfavorability during Biden’s tenure. But that argument doesn’t take you particularly far when polling indicates that the most commonly floated names to replace Biden, such as Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, do not perform more strongly than Harris in head-to-head matchups with Trump. Is it possible that over time these candidates would ultimately outperform these polls, once they were better known? Yes. But it’s also possible that they would do worse the more voters came to know them. Remember how countless pundits, reporters and Republicans thought Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would be a formidable Trump slayer, only for him to become a national laughingstock, mocked for his awkwardness and apparent attempts to enhance his height? Any gut instincts about the nebulous and hyper-subjective X factor of so-called electability are mere guesses.  What we do know is Harris is far more battle-tested than any alternative. We also know that Harris would be the strongest candidate to quell objections among Democrats that they’ve been disenfranchised. If Biden stepped aside and proposed an open convention, then party insiders would select the nomination for a party that’s used to the direct democratic input of the primary system. That selection process could be divisive. And it could mean that on Election Day a lot of Democrats could end up asked to vote for a politician they’ve never heard of and never would’ve cast ballots for. By contrast, Harris’ vice presidency confers a unique kind of legitimacy compared to any other candidate. Millions elected her in 2020 as Biden’s designated successor, and she was also backed by most Democratic primary voters this year (even if the primaries were mostly a formality). And she would be carrying out exactly what vice presidents are most important for — stepping up to serve as president if the president is unable to serve. Last, one factor that’s almost certain is that the historic nature of a Harris candidacy would be likely to motivate women, Black voters and Black women in particular — indispensable constituencies for the Democrats — at exceptional levels. Former President Barack Obama drove record turnout among Black voters, and it seems likely that Harris could also tap into the special kind of energy that accompanies excitement for symbolic victories for marginalized communities. Most of the other names floated for president these days could not. National polls for the Democrats are dire these days, and I have no confidence that Biden, Harris or any of the most commonly named alternatives can pull off a win against Trump. But in a high-risk situation, it is prudent is to minimize unknown variables to reduce the likelihood of worst-case outcomes. Harris, a competent and qualified candidate who could claim democratic legitimacy and rejuvenate the party, offers us just that.   "
"Addition, Not Subtraction",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-addition-not-subtraction-rcna161378,"Senator Claire McCaskill is away this week, so former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri tapped another former co-host to join, veteran GOP strategist and creator of “The Circus”, Mark McKinnon. As President Biden hosts a NATO summit at the White House, all Beltway eyes are focused on whether he has staying power as the Democratic nominee. So, Jen and Mark zero in on how keenly lawmakers and pundits are tracking the shifting winds on that calculation. And NBC correspondent Vaughn Hillyard previews the Republican Convention set to begin Monday, and the many unknowns still hanging in the air—including who is speaking, how strongly they embrace Project 2025, and who Trump will choose as his running mate.   Note: Next week, we’ll be recording and releasing on Friday so we can break down the  Republican Convention as a whole. In the meantime, we’ll be sharing audio of MSNBC’s coverage in this feed for people to stay up to date during the convention next week.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello. Welcome to “How to Win 2024.” We’re taping this episode on Wednesday, July 10th. I’m Jennifer Palmieri and my usual partner in crime, Claire McCaskill, is away this week. So, I’m here with a very special co-host, Mark McKinnon. Yay. Also known as MKat. Hello, Kat. Mark McKinnon: Hello, JPalm. Jennifer Palmieri: Friends of Showtime’s “The Circus” might remember that Mark and I were co-hosts in a previous life. The show was Mark’s idea. He was a co-executive producer, co-host for all eight seasons, and veteran campaign pro. I mean, you’ve had the most interesting life of any friend I have, honestly, starting with a music career in Nashville. For real, people, I’m not making that up. And then a campaign consultant for Democrats, then moved to be a campaign consultant for George W. Bush as governor, helped get him elected president twice, and then the presidential campaign of John McCain, all along pushing this idea of we should have a very cool show that shows you what’s really going on in politics. Thank you, Kat. Mark McKinnon: Well, thank you. You made “The Circus” great, Jen. Jennifer Palmieri: No, it was fun. Mark McKinnon: It was a ton of fun. It really was. Jennifer Palmieri: So this week, Mark and I are going to talk Biden strategy, Trump’s veepstakes, and we’ll also preview the Republican convention set to kick off this Monday with NBC’s own Vaughn Hillyard. But first, continuing fallout for Biden. So this is where we’re like, okay, if we were in the room on the Biden campaign, what would we be doing? This is Wednesday morning. Let me tell you like my assessment and see where you are, Kat. So I felt like Sunday, the Biden campaign sort of turned a corner. Good appearance of the black church president had. Some members of Congress started coming out against him. They were all white members of Congress. Black members of Congress were having his back. The CBC comes out and says, you know, this is, of course, Sunday, Monday, they’re going to be for him. And, you know, he’s able to say sort of the elites in the party are against me, but I’m listening to voters and I’ve always had their back and they have mine. That worked for a while. But then I feel like the big thing today was, well, first of all, last night it was reported that Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado in a meeting of the Senate Democratic Caucus said that he did not think President Biden could win. It was also reported that Senator Sherrod Brown and Senator Jon Tester also said that. Michael Bennett went ahead and went on CNN last night to say, yes, I said that, and I’m not going to say one thing privately and one thing publicly. We’re not going to do what the Republicans do. We’re saying it out loud. I don’t think he can win. And then former Speaker Pelosi was on “Morning Show” this morning with a very tepid support for the president. (BEGIN AUDIO) Nancy Pelosi: It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. The, I think, overwhelming support of the caucus, it’s not for me to say, I’m not the head of the caucus anymore, but he’s beloved. He is respected and people want him to make that decision, not me. Jonathan Lemire: He has said he has made the decision. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run? Nancy Pelosi: I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that’s the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with. (END AUDIO) Jennifer Palmieri: She kept saying we want him to make his decision, even though we all know he’s already made a decision to stay in and kind of noted that the NATO summit was happening and sort of a takeaway is maybe, you know, I think if you’re a member of Congress, you’re trying to read the tea leaves here and thinking, okay, it sounds like Pelosi is saying everybody hold your fire until the summit is over, but there’s still some pretty serious concerns here. What’s your take? What do you think the Biden campaign should do? Mark McKinnon: Well, I agree with you. I think the Biden campaign did an artful job of trying to shore up, you know, what little support they had and really threaded the needle with the congressional black caucus and -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: -- with his schedule calling in the “Morning Joe,” all of that was, you know, pinpoint perfect exactly what they needed to do to shore up the dam. But -- Jennifer Palmieri: And like, just live for another day. I mean -- Mark McKinnon: Live for another day, exactly. I think that’s it. Jennifer Palmieri: We have both been in these situations. It’s just like get through that. Mark McKinnon: Get to tomorrow. The problem is tomorrow -- Jennifer Palmieri: Get to tomorrow. Mark McKinnon: -- tomorrow has not been any better. In fact, a lot worse, particularly, and especially because of Nancy Pelosi. I mean, you don’t have to be a deep student of the game to understand, first of all, how formidable she is and how nuanced. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: I mean, she is the Zen master and her statement that it’s up to the president to decide if he’s going to run. Well, what? I thought he said that. Jennifer Palmieri: Could he be more clear? Mark McKinnon: Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Could he be more clear? Mark McKinnon: She’s just giving him more runways. Like, okay, we’re good. We’re good here a little more time. And the problem is that, yeah, I mean, the whole elites and the media are after us is fine -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Mark McKinnon: -- but there’s more and more data coming in and it’s worse and worse and worse. Voters. Jennifer Palmieri: And this is the thing I want to pause for people. You know, we’ve been on a journey with our listeners in the last two weeks and this podcast is like, I’ve been very convinced by my former Republican friends, not my former friends, but my friends who are former Republicans, like Stuart Stevens. You’ve been in a different place. So we’ll talk about the place you’ve been in, but like Michael Steele, who were like, why would you not have the president’s back. Have his back. He’s your guy. It’s crazy to try to switch somebody out at this point. The only time people lose is when incumbents back out. This is crazy. I don’t see any use of like beating up on the president and doing harm to him while we were in this sort of like two weeks suspended animation period where you’re trying to figure out how’s he really doing -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- and how are the American people absorbing this. And you know, we’ve been saying, you got to wait two weeks for the American people to really sort of absorb what happened and reflect their sentiment and polls. And that’s why you see people like Michael Bennett going on television to say he can’t win now, where he wouldn’t have done that a week ago. That’s why I think Speaker Pelosi said what you said today is because it seems like maybe the bigger risk is keeping him, you know, there’s all sorts of risks and we can talk about them, about having a new person, but where you have an electoral map that looks like Trump winning in a landslide and it’s not, you know, a one-off. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, exactly right. I mean, the data is sort of incontrovertible now. I mean, you got a few days ago, Biden was sort of arguing with George Stephanopoulos, oh, you know, we’re within the margin of error. Well, not anymore. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, not anymore. Okay. So I think we’d have to switch this topic from if I were in the Biden campaign headquarters, what I would do as opposed to if I were in charge of the Democratic Party, not that there is such a person, like, what do you think should happen now, Kat? Mark McKinnon: I’m with James Carville, you know, he was the guy who -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh my God, the Democrats have talent ideas. Okay, explain the idea and then explain the idea. Mark McKinnon: Well, listen, I mean, broadly the idea is you have two options. You either have what appears to be a sure loss and perhaps a devastating one that takes out the House and the Senate, just takes everybody down. That’s one alternative. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Mark McKinnon: Or you have -- Jennifer Palmieri: You mean by keeping President Biden? Mark McKinnon: -- by keeping President Biden. Or you have what is certainly and admittedly a chaotic, unknown nomination of somebody, and we’re not sure exactly how it happens, but it can happen. I mean, you just make it happen. And there’s lots of different ideas about it. Carville has this kind of weird mini convention idea, and I’m not sure about that. But what I will tell you is that it would be dramatic, it’d be interesting, it’d be compelling, it’d be exciting. You know, Democrats would be all tuned in. I mean, the alternative is just this horrible, depressing slog. God, you know, imagine how great it would be for “The Circus” to be covering a Democratic open convention. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Mark McKinnon: And so, you know, I’m for anything other than sure death. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. The James Carville idea, what I think is not workable about it, his idea is that President Obama and President Clinton would select four sort of tickets that could be possible nominees, and then the two of them would host town halls as sort of a mini primary. Like, Obama and Clinton are not going to play that role. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: There’s just no scenario. Obama and Clinton are like, if people want to run -- Mark McKinnon: You’re going to piss off everybody but eight people, yeah. No, that’s not workable, but just the general principle of opening it up on four, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Right, right. Yeah, like, they’re like, if people want to run for president, they should do that. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: They don’t need President Obama, President Clinton to select them. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, he overcomplicated it. He put too many ingredients in the stew. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah. And I think one question people are wrestling with is, how did we get here? Like, how did the Democrats find themselves in this position? You wrote about this a few times, sort of, you know, raising the alarm about where you thought this was headed. You predicted, and you’re like, something’s going to happen that’s going to be a huge deal and shake up this race, and here we are. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: I think it’s worth saying, like, what do we think should have happened? Mark McKinnon: Well, I’ll just roll back the tape a little bit to just say, you know, I think, like, a lot of people, and certainly a lot of never Trump Republicans, I supported Biden in ‘20, and I think there is an inarguable case, there’s lots of data points to prove it, that Biden was likely the only Democrat that would have won in ‘20. Now, I think he may be the only Democrat that could lose to Trump. And the great tragedy of all this is that it not only, you know, will hurt the Democratic Party, hurt the country, it hurts Joe Biden and his legacy. He could have gone out a hero. And you know, Jennifer, there’s, and again, just, you know, there’s receipts for this about how he said pretty explicitly, I intend to be a one-term president. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Mark McKinnon: And there was nothing but upside for that for Biden. He had a lot of good stuff that he did, could have just gotten the gold watch, been great Uncle Joe presider over the convention, been the hero, and gone out with a great legacy. And he has risked all of that. And by the way, and this is an interesting point, you know, his sort of fundamental message was Trump’s all about me and I’m about you. Well, now because of all this, everybody say, well, I guess Joe Biden’s just about himself too. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. It is like, I don’t, I don’t love being in the situation of, you know, I try not to be too precious about this, right, because you can say, well, it doesn’t seem like the president is up to the job and we can’t be just like the Republicans. So we should push him to, to step back from being the nominee. That’s just a big gamble when there’s a lot on the line for this country, particularly, you know, obviously very worried about democracy, but there’s people in the country that’d be far more impacted than I would -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- by a Trump presidency. But I think we are at the point now where the bigger risk is looking like holding on to him. The other thing that, and John Stewart made this point on Monday, that four months is a lifetime. The other thing that I think people sort of come to terms with today is like, we’re all holding our breath now about the NATO press conference. How’s he going to do in the NATO press conference, which is on Thursday, and it’s like, okay, the polls are not good. We can’t be holding our breath every time he has to do an event and it’s still his decision and that’s still like, I’m not clear on how it would actually happen. But in my mind on, you know, Wednesday morning, it’s been like a 51-49 decision all along in my head about like, what’s the thing to do here with an integrity? What’s the responsible thing here to do? What’s the thing that honors President Biden, but protects the country? And it’s, you know, it’s feeling like that 51 is now on him leaving as opposed to saying. But now there’s a question about Vice President Harris. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: So piled on for four years and still her polling’s not so bad. Mark McKinnon: Well, she’s polling better than Biden. And I -- Jennifer Palmieri: Do you know what I mean, though? Like the coverage has been, you know, she’s covered intermittently. As you know, I’ve written two books about this. There’s way too much gender and race bias. Mark McKinnon: There’s just something about her. Jennifer Palmieri: There’s just something about her I don’t like. So, like a room to grow, very effective in making the argument against Trump. We saw that in the rally she did last night, very effective prosecutor versus a convicted felon. Talk about her as a nominee. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. I think in Trump world, you know, the smartest writers saying, be careful what you ask for. I think that her stock is really low and her value is really, really high. And what I mean by that is just, I think that she’s been subject to a lot of very critical press, a lot of it unfair, some of it fair, but the point is that people don’t really know her and she’s formidable. I mean, she’s the vice president of the United States. She didn’t get there by accident. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: And you know, you’ve been around her. I’ve been around her. When I’ve been around her, I’m like blown away by her. I think she’s really impressive. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: And a lot of the stuff is such inside the beltway. Management stuff, she’s not a good manager. Well, you know, some -- Jennifer Palmieri: That’s a female trope. People think women aren’t good managers. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, a hundred percent. So I think what’s going to happen is that, it’ll have a huge ballast effect when people actually kind of see her, if she were leading the ticket and go, oh my God, that she’s way better than I heard. You know, they’re going to be like, oh shit, this woman was, you know, and she’s a woman which helps the Democrats and she’s a former prosecutor. So if you like -- Jennifer Palmieri: I love you for thinking women help Democrats-- Mark McKinnon: -- if you just put on paper, like who would be great, just, you know, generically without a name, you say a black woman, a former prosecutor, a former vice president of the United States, that’d be perfect, right -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: -- to run against Trump. That’s exactly what you’d want. Jennifer Palmieri: It is. I mean, everybody else is like, you want the opposite of Trump. That is, you know, but it’s pretty good about the opposite of Trump. Mark McKinnon: Yes, hundred percent. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. So there’s two scenarios for how this can go down. One is the president steps aside and he, you know, endorses vice president. And I think, you know, sort of in that scenario, like we’re all just, we’re kind of guessing, but I’ll lay out two scenarios for people so that you can talk people through the relative merits of both. Maybe the president says, you know, and I endorse my vice president and she goes to Chicago. Presumably people don’t challenge her or situation, president is like I’m stepping aside and the party will decide in which case maybe people do challenge her. I don’t know. But what do you think? Mark McKinnon: I think the best outcome for him and for her is for him to say, listen, we’re Democrats. We compete. I love my vice president, but go out there and compete. And then I think she’ll win it. I mean, I just think the physics are such that -- Jennifer Palmieri: She would win. She would win big. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, she would. Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Go to Chicago, win it. Mark McKinnon: Then she’s stronger for having won it. Jennifer Palmieri: Then she’s starting off with a win. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. And it makes her stronger. So I think that’s the way to go. Jennifer Palmieri: A little palate cleanser. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, exactly. Jennifer Palmieri: I don’t mean to be irreverent. These are serious matters. Yeah. You know, we got a question from Bethany about, you know, some people, a fear of market convention, but whether that might give Democrat’s momentum. Mark McKinnon: I think it’d be one of the most interesting events historically ever. Can you imagine the audience -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: -- and people tuning in to see what would happen rather than, you know, slogging through the next few months with Joe Biden? It’d be electric and -- Jennifer Palmieri: Trust democracy, man. Right. Trust democracy. Mark McKinnon: We’d have to bring “The Circus” back. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my God. Yeah, man. Yeah we would, I’m for that. Amen. Mark McKinnon and I are going to take a quick break. When we’re back, NBC correspondent Vaughn Hillyard stops by to pre-game the GOP convention with us. Back with Mark and Vaughn in a minute. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. We’re less than a week away from the 2024 Republican convention, because that’s happening. And though Trump apparently thinks Milwaukee is a, quote, “horrible city,” the home of Brewers, brats and beer will play host this cycle. So what should we be watching for? What are the party’s expectations? And what has Trump been up to while everyone in the Democratic world has been obsessed with President Biden? To give us some pregame analysis, Vaughn Hillyard, yay, joins me and my excellent co-host this week, Mark McKinnon. Vaughn is an intrepid NBC News correspondent covering the Trump campaign. Welcome, Vaughn. Thanks so much for joining us. Vaughn Hillyard: Hi, guys. I appreciate you having me. This forum is a little different than being on the campaign trail, I’ll say with you guys. Mark McKinnon: You know, the thing about Vaughn, Jennifer, is I always, wherever I was on the campaign, if I’d see Vaughn, it just brightened my day. It’s like, all right, Vaughn’s here. Jennifer Palmieri: First of all, brightens your day. Second of all, you run to him and you say, Vaughn, what is actually happening here? Whether that was -- I mean, I did that so many times, whether that was CPAC in Maryland, Vaughn, what is happening? Mark McKinnon: Yeah. He’s the guy who’d actually done his homework, was working hard up at the crack of dawn. Vaughn Hillyard: I appreciate that. Jennifer Palmieri: Particularly Arizona. What is going on with the Maricopa County vote counting situation, Vaughn? It’s like that one -- Vaughn Hillyard: It seems like our meetings are always under dire circumstances. And the least we can do is smile at each other. Mark McKinnon: Always got a smile. Jennifer Palmieri: This is true, this is true. Mark McKinnon: That’s what we love about Vaughn. Jennifer Palmieri: So the GOP convention’s next week. So we want to talk about like how that is. I mean, I’ve heard nothing about it. Just nothing. I’ve heard that on Monday, they’re going to talk about the economy. Somewhere along the way, I came across that. Vaughn Hillyard: We’re still waiting for the speakers. We don’t know who’s speaking yet. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. You know, it’s been sort of eight years since there was a normal-ish Republican convention. But last time I went to it, I think McKinnon did too in D.C. It was at the Department of Commerce, and it was just kind of like a rolling Trump variety show. And each day they would decide, oh, today we’re going to do this and that and bring this person up to the stage. Almost like a telethon back in the days from like the ‘80s. Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Can you preview it? What do we know? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. We know they have some themes that they’re going to strike on. The idea is Monday is going to be make America safe once again. They’re going to have these themes that they are going to have each day programmed around, and the speakers should accompany that. But it’s going to be a Milwaukee here. There’s a lot of question marks. This is a moment in which Donald Trump is reshaped the Republican Party in his image. There are some outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, Turning Point, others who helped craft that Project 2025 policy document -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- that now Donald Trump is suddenly trying to distance himself from. But this is all coming to a head because there are so many conservative right-wing groups that see the potential in four months’ time of a transition that they get to be a part of in a potential second Trump administration. So this Republican convention, it’s not even just about Donald Trump and about beating Joe Biden, but it’s about what could four years of Trump administration and Republican majorities in Congress accomplish. And that’s what I’m expecting a lot of that discourse to be about come next week. Mark McKinnon: I’ll tell you who’s not going to be there, Bruce Springsteen or Beyonce or any entertainer worth a nickel. I was the guy at the Republican conventions who got the worst job in the world, which was get entertainment for the Republican convention. And I’d make a thousand phone calls, you know, the list of people everybody wanted. They got turned down 999 times, except for Lee Greenwood, the Oak Ridge Boys, and Wayne Newton. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, man. Vaughn Hillyard: Kid Rock, too. Kid Rock, too, right? Mark McKinnon: Kid Rock, yes. Kid Rock was -- Jennifer Palmieri: And half of Journey. Not all of Journey, just half of Journey. That one guy is like, don’t associate me with these crazy people. Vaughn Hillyard: Well, a lot of people are going to be left off the list, and that includes those people can stand by Nikki Haley, because to our understanding, Nikki Haley did not even receive a convention invite. So there you go. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, so who is speaking? Do we know anything? Vaughn Hillyard: I mean, we’ll know whether he has a VP pick. We still don’t know that answer yet. And so I think that there are some who would obviously like jobs in the administration. We have watched the Republican Party coalesce around Donald Trump once again, because as we all know from having covered politics, been in politics, that the access to power is, that scent is strong. And the Republican Party of today is Donald Trump’s. And so you’ve got to cozy up and you’ve got to do your part if you want a job at an agency or a department. Mark McKinnon: Listen, I think the big thing here is the dogs that aren’t barking, right, on everything, on the convention, on Biden. I mean, they’re just strategically have this thing buttoned on 2025. I mean, it’s all like, let’s just hold our fire. Nobody talks out of turn. Nobody leaks. I mean, this is just such a different Trump operation than we’ve ever seen before, right? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. That’s absolutely right. I mean, look, there has been no campaign staff turnover. He launched this campaign back in November of 2022. And I’ve talked to a lot of people directly in the campaign, outside of the campaign. They say the reason it’s so effective this time around is that nobody is being kept away from Donald Trump. So, the top senior advisers, Susie Wiles, she is somebody who is running a tight ship for this Trump campaign in 2024. But if Stephen Miller wants to call up Donald Trump, if Steve Bannon, when he’s not in jail, wants to call up Donald Trump, anybody’s able to do that. We’re past iterations. They tried to be the gatekeepers. You can’t visit Donald Trump in the Oval Office, right? Stay away. Jennifer Palmieri: So Susie is like to smarts, she’s smart enough to realize, don’t even try to do that. And if you have, if you make a more open campaign, the backdoor folks, the folks that try to go through the backdoor, just open the front door, let them in. And it’s going to be more productive that way. Is that -- Vaughn Hillyard: That’s absolutely. We’ve talked about let Trump be Trump for so many years. This iteration 2024 is truly let Trump be Trump and that’s what you should expect from the White House in 2025 if he wins. Mark McKinnon: You know, the funny thing is you remember, like 2015, you know, as a former operative, I was watching a lot of people, you know, go around to the different campaigns and interview. And as you recall, there were 18 candidates. If you were interviewing and you were, you know, up and coming Republican operative, your 18th interview was Donald Trump, right? You got turned down 17 times first. Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Mark McKinnon: So that was the caliber back in 2016. It was broken toys, but it is a different show this time for sure. Vaughn Hillyard: Totally. I mean, Jason Miller is his top really communication senior advisor. And I remember Jason Miller had been working as the comms director for Ted Cruz. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, right. Vaughn Hillyard: And in that spring of 2016, Jason, you know, was referring to Donald Trump being a tornado and tweeting up a storm. And then two months later, that was the first time when he went and joined the campaign and made all of us turn our heads. It was like, oh, we see where the Republican party is going. And eight years later, Jason Miller is still at the forefront of this operation and has the deep trust of Donald Trump to this day. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: So, okay. We don’t really know who’s going to speak. Normally you would be like, oh, have the runner up speak. And then there’s a nice coming together of the party. But like, you know, obviously we’re well past that because this is Trump’s Republican party. I do want to get to Project 2025 because I think that one thing, even as the Democrats have been distracted by our own problems, that I think Project 2025 as the Republican blueprint for what Donald Trump will do in a second term is breaking through. I will like laud my former colleagues, the Center for American Progress. I was supposed to be there yesterday and I got sick, but they did a day long forum about what it would mean. There are good resources on their website. You know, the Republican party, the platform, Trump himself is trying to back away from Project 2025. I do think the Democrats, I mean, obviously there’s four months to go and a lot of work to do, but they’re doing a good job driving this message. It’s like, no, this is the agenda -- Mark McKinnon: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: -- but tell us what’s actually happening with Project 2025. What’s the right way to think about it? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans have really latched on to the idea of what Project 2025 is. On paper, Project 2025 is a 900-plus page roadmap of policies for departments and agencies that the Heritage Foundation, several close Donald Trump advisors and allies wrote in the lead up to, if there were to be a second Trump administration, they could turn over to the individuals that will fill out those personnel roles to ultimately execute on those policies. And then, you know, some of the policies written about including, right, making sure that it’s federally enforced, that no abortion medication can be sent through the mail. That’s one of the policies in there. And that is where Donald Trump understands that some of those policies were not popular among a majority of the American electorate. And so over the weekend, he put out, I don’t know anything about Project 2025. I don’t know who’s behind it. Let’s be very clear. That’s not true. He knows who is behind it. Russ Vogt, who was his former OMB director, is not only one of the authors of Project 2025, but was also one of the authors of literally the Republican Party platform that Donald Trump just signed on to as the proposed platform this very week. And so it’s really tough for him to disassociate with people like Ben Carson, who is another one of the authors of Project 2025. And this is coming at a time where, I’ll just tell you, I had an interview lined up with Paul Danz, who is a former personnel chief of staff in the Donald Trump White House, lined up for this Monday, and they called and canceled that interview after the social media post by Donald Trump saying he wanted nothing to do with Project 2025. So suddenly the conservative apparatus around Donald Trump is sort of in a holdup situation because Trump understands that some of the policies that are being proposed are not popular with the majority of the American public. Yet those who would fill out the personnel and fill out the administration are those individuals who are the ones writing these very policies. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, for both of you all, the interesting thing is that whereas maybe at a different time Trump could walk something back, like Project 2025, I think because we have seen the Supreme Court, you know, come out with the immunity decision, usually the best-case scenario for Trump, the worst-case scenario for democracy seems to follow any policy that Trump proposes and also what the Supreme Court rules. So I think the Democrats will have success in hanging this on them if we could ever get to making that argument. But for both of you all, what do you expect? I have noticed the former President Trump has sort of held off on really attacking Biden. And while Biden’s going through his thing, rally last night, how much do you expect to see of like bashing the vice president at this convention? This is for both of you. How much do you think it’s about bashing Biden? Is this where the gloves come off and they really start hitting Biden and not being up for the job? What do we expect in terms of how they define the opposition? Mark McKinnon: Listen, I think until literally it is impossible to switch out Biden, they’re going to be careful about just how much they attack Biden because their worst nightmare is that it gets switched out to anybody, including Kamala. I expect there to be sort of a general attack on the policies and what have you. But I think the full-throated kind of, you know, the debate clips and that sort of thing, if I’m around Trump, I’m saying, hold your fire, hold your fire, hold your fire because again, the smartest thing that I’ve seen them do in this whole campaign is don’t catch a falling knife. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: Just let it go because what we don’t want is, you know, the X factor. We know Biden, we know it is, we know we got, we know how to do this campaign. What we don’t want is the unknown. And Kamala’s, you know, somewhat known, but again, it’s an X factor. And, you know, look at the data right now with Biden and man, that’s exactly what we want. The main role is don’t screw that up. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Vaughn Hillyard: And Donald Trump, this is the matchup he wants because for eight years, he has tried to convey to the American public, this idea of strength versus weakness, right? It was Marco Rubio, eight years ago, who literally referred to him as third world, strong man rhetoric, who somebody who says, put your faith in me, I’ll make things better and -- Jennifer Palmieri: As if it was a bad thing. Vaughn Hillyard: -- as if that was a bad thing, right? Jennifer Palmieri: And now Rubio like runs around saying it in worship in his, part of it, yeah-- Vaughn Hillyard: He’s on the stage with him. And so for Donald Trump, I alone can fix it, right? Dictator on day one, greater use of the executive office. That is the type of idea of strength that Donald Trump wants to convey. And so the extent to which he can draw a contrast with somebody who he conveys as being weak, that is a matchup politically, characteristically that Donald Trump feels comfortable with. Jennifer Palmieri: So do you think that they’ll go after the vice president then? Because even if President Biden stays as the nominee, you know, she’s going to be a big factor, you know, as it’s already made a successor. Vaughn Hillyard: Absolutely. At the rally in Doral, Florida, he gave her a nickname and he began to go -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, and good for you for not repeating it. Vaughn Hillyard: He began to go on the attack -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- against her. And I think that this is the part where, right, he referred to her as insurance policy and trying to degrade her -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- in the public’s mind that the only reason Joe Biden picked her is because, right, he knew that they wouldn’t replace him with her, right. Which, of course, there’s just nothing to that. But this is the message that Donald Trump is going to try to convince the great share of the American population. Mark McKinnon: I expect a lot of that because what they want to do is say, don’t switch horses, because if you do, here’s what you’re going to get. Here’s what’s coming. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Yeah. But she is pretty formidable in making the argument against him. We saw that. Also, I can trust that whatever they do to critique the vice president, they will overshoot and manage to hurt themselves. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. You can count on that. Jennifer Palmieri: I think we can count on that. Okay, we’re going to take a quick break here. But Vaughn Hillyard, please stick with Mark McKinnon and me. When we’re back, we’re going to look at Trump’s veepstakes as his campaign says, he’ll be deciding on a running mate in short order. Also, he needs to because this person has to be nominated by the convention next week. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. While Claire is living her best life on a well-deserved vacation, although is she? Because she just texted me asking me if I could talk to catch her up on what was happening. So maybe she’s actually not living her best life. Anyway. Mark McKinnon: Step away from your iPhone, Claire. Jennifer Palmieri: But I’m thrilled to have my co-captain Mark McKinnon joining today and our guest, NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hillyard is also still with us. Okay, so Vaughn, Mark, let’s look at Trump’s veepstakes. We’re recording this on Wednesday morning. So if this happened already, you can go ahead and skip ahead to the part where we do listener questions. But tell us, you know, Vaughn, starting with you, who’s it down to? Anything you know about timing? Vaughn Hillyard: He could wait all the way to the convention at this point, right? I mean, let the Biden news cycle play out. And for him, try to draw attention to the Milwaukee Convention in a somewhat splashy way. Right now, this is not the VP shortlist that I thought that he was going to come down to, like the three finalists being fluttered about here. You’re talking about J.D. Vance, somebody who called him literally an idiot in 2016, who said he was reprehensible and suggested he would vote for Hillary Clinton before Donald Trump. He is now the Ohio senator, largely got into the Senate with Donald Trump’s endorsement. He is somebody who is on that shortlist here. You’ve got Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, who just one year ago told NBC’s Chuck Todd that he would never go into business with Donald Trump. He’s on the shortlist. And then you’ve got Marco Rubio, who we have gone over about their vicious relationship in 2016. Mark McKinnon: Small hands. Vaughn Hillyard: And, you know, I was told by somebody, don’t rule out somebody like Ben Carson, though, somebody from Michigan, somebody who is not going to be a threat that wouldn’t want to run for president again. You still have Elise Stefanik, the New York congresswoman, who has been perhaps his best and most ardent defender, somebody who is impeachment manager to defend him, somebody who clearly has aspirations herself. But, you know, I think the question here for Donald Trump is he threw Mike Pence off the cliff because ultimately, he wasn’t loyal to him on January 6 and certified the election results. And so each of these individuals, if you’re Donald Trump, there are reasons to still question. There is not a natural fit at this point for him as a VP, understanding what Donald Trump wants out of one. Jennifer Palmieri: Kat, what do you think about, like, who would be best for him? Mark McKinnon: Well, you know, I look at it completely politically, which, you know, I mean, you really as Karl Rove says, you should pick the person who would be the best vice president. But, you know, I would look at, you know, how do you add votes? And I think that’s a no brainer. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: Pick Nikki Haley. I mean, you had 20 percent of Republican voters staying at home or voting for Haley when she technically wasn’t even on the ticket. So to me, that’s just a place where you, you know, addition, not subtraction and -- Jennifer Palmieri: A little bit, maybe. But like that vote, don’t you think that vote was mostly just an anti-Trump vote, not like a pro-Nikki Haley vote? Mark McKinnon: Yes, and yes. But I think also it’s additive. Again, I think it’s a sign of the strategic smarts of the campaign this time around that it’s not a bunch of MAGA celebrities on the list. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: There would be no addition of a MAGA celebrity and -- Jennifer Palmieri: You mean like who’s a MAGA celebrity, like Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene? Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Yeah. Any of those, you know, any of those. Jennifer Palmieri: Kari Lake. Mark McKinnon: Yep. Yep. Exactly. I think that, again, of the list that’s there, the person I pick is Rubio. Because again, I’m looking at it politically. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, me, too. Mark McKinnon: How do you expand the tent? Well, you know, show that you’re more of a more diverse party. You know, I think it should either be a woman or a minority. That’s what I would do. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Right. Mark McKinnon: Again, it’s a very political consideration, but, you know, that’s what I would get paid to do is, you know, figure out how do you win the election. And to try to figure out how to win the election, not govern, then, you know, get somebody who’ll bring more votes. And of course, the Trump Republican Party has made huge inroads with Hispanics. So a Rubio pick, I think, would be a home run. Jennifer Palmieri: And Vaughn, like, are they going through the normal sort of vetting process or that’s just like not a thing with these people, right? So it could be, I think that’s when they’re like, oh, who’s on the list? And I was like, anyone’s on the list, right? He could just -- Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Eight years ago, I mean, Mike Pence went through the longtime formal process that Republican VP candidates have typically gone through, go through the law firm, turn over all relevant documents. Mike Pence, even there was a rally in Indianapolis the night before that Donald Trump ultimately offered him the running mate slot there. It was kind of a final tryout for Mike Pence to come and take the stage alongside him and really show his political chops in front of the crowd. And that’s why it was interesting last night. Rubio spoke before the event, like two hours before Trump took the stage, but Trump never actually invited him onto stage, which if we’re looking for echoes of the past time, we went through this, he did do that with Mike Pence and never afforded any more time to that stage to Marco Rubio. So I thought that was unique. Jennifer Palmieri: That is very interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: And if he chose Rubio, I don’t think Mark is wrong on political advantages. Marco Rubio, they’re both residents from Florida. And I have a hard time believing that Donald Trump would give up his residency in Florida. And so if Marco Rubio, because of the understanding that Florida electors -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- you can’t have the VP and president from the same state, suddenly you would be looking at Marco Rubio giving up his residency in Florida and therefore no longer being a senator, so. Mark McKinnon: But that’s an upside for Trump. That means they get a Senate pick. Vaughn Hillyard: There you go. He gets to pick somebody in his mold. Jennifer Palmieri: And do you think it matters, like say, if the vice president, do you think that she, like Kamala Harris, weighs in on this decision at all, right? Either the matchup of a debate with her and the running mate or the notion that she may be, the possibility of her being the nominee? Mark McKinnon: Well, again, if I’m if I’m one of the strategists around, I say pick a woman. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: You know, the one advantage that Democrats have is Harris and the abortion issue. Let’s take it off the table or let’s minimize it. Let’s neutralize it. Vaughn Hillyard: Trump said two weeks ago that he had made up in his mind who the VP pick was going to be, but was waiting to announce. But then here just this week, he has suggested that he is now waiting to see whether Biden stays on the ticket and ultimately that could play into his determination. So in Donald Trump’s own words, to provide credence to that. Jennifer Palmieri: And Vicky’s asking me about Katie Britt. Like what happened there? I mean, what I had heard was that President Trump, that he initially liked -- Vaughn Hillyard: Oh, listen, I’ve never seen anybody’s stock fall so fast. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, but then I was at an event and he brought her up. He’s like, Katie Britt, what about her? And people were like, yay, didn’t seem to focus group well with this crowd. Mark McKinnon: Well, I mean, she was a disaster in her State of the Union response. I think that’s when her stock fell. Again -- Jennifer Palmieri: I’m glad that that seems to be the collective view because -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah, she would have been great, right? I mean, horrible from your point of view. Jennifer Palmieri: Well, I know enough to know that in her normal life -- Mark McKinnon: She’s normal, right? Jennifer Palmieri: -- as I know her well. Yeah, she’s a normie, as Sarah Longwood would-- Mark McKinnon: She would have been a Mark McKinnon pick for sure. Yeah. You know, appeal to independent suburban housewives. Jennifer Palmieri: I’m glad you’re no longer on their team, Kinnon. A closing question to you both. There is such this media frenzy over Biden. What stories, narratives are being missed right now in the two weeks that we’ve been obsessed with how our president is doing? Vaughn Hillyard: I think it’s wild, but it’s policy. You know, Joe Biden keeps coming back to the message of, look what I’ve done. Look at the last three and a half years. Look at all the legislative achievements we’ve had. The economy has come back. You know, we had the largest job growth ever for an administration. Donald Trump is talking about his first administration and yet lost. And a lot of this is ultimately what policies would either administration enact in the second term because it’s been very much clouded over either’s ability to actually run Washington in an effective way. Number one for Biden over age and for two for Trump purely coming off of January 6 and his respect for our institutions. There are serious questions as to just the basic governance of what Washington could look like as opposed to what actual legislation and policies could best help the American people. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, I think that’s right. I think it’s a policy, you know, bounce back to policy where you have some real credibility. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: And the big disconnect for me has been, you know, the reality of the economy versus the perception of the economy. And I would just be banging that like a drum as hard as I could every single day. Jennifer Palmieri: The thing that struck me about the Stephanopoulos interview that I really have not heard commented on is he asked zero policy questions. Mark McKinnon: Oh, interesting. Jennifer Palmieri: Zero. Mark McKinnon: Interesting. Jennifer Palmieri: That’s not what I expected. I mean, I’m not criticizing him. I was like, oh, I thought the interview was to show if the president was up to the job. So, like, ask him about, you know, dealing with NATO, ask him about -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- what’s next with Gaza. I mean, I really, particularly with George, you know -- Mark McKinnon: That’s true. Jennifer Palmieri: -- I really thought that’s what we were getting and instead it was all -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah, exactly. And I heard somebody commenting on that this morning to say that somebody who knows Biden really well. And they just said, you know, the problem is that if it were just the question whether or not Biden could be president, he’d kill it. It’s just can he be a candidate for the office? That’s where the problem is. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. And it’s like, I mean, it’s a very tough situation to be in. Like, well, why aren’t you dropping out for 22 minutes as opposed to like seeing him parry questions that are actually about the job? Okay, anyway, switching gears to listener questions. So we love the notes and e-mails that you have been sending. It really helps to know what’s resonating with y’all as voters and questions. And, you know, it helps us to formulate how we’re putting the show together. So please keep them coming. And Vaughn has happily agreed to stick around with me and Mark. So this is interesting. This is from Mike in D.C. Kat; I’m going to -- let’s go to you. Is anybody in a position of authority within the party mentioning Governor Roy Cooper as a possible replacement for President Biden? He may be a little older than I’d like, 67. Oh, that’s tough. That’s tough, Kat. But he’s a whippersnapper compared to Trump. And he’s won again and again in a red state. He’d also bring North Carolina into play. What do you think about Roy Cooper? Mark McKinnon: I love him. I think he’s very much along the sort of Clinton model of, you know, a more sort of centrist Southern Democrat, which I think is great for the party. That’s why I think Beshear is talked about a lot in Kentucky. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: A younger Southern Democrat. But yes, I think Cooper is a big talent and, you know, won in a Southern state. And so those are precisely the sort of people that I’d look to, to expand the appeal of the Democratic Party. We talked about what Republicans need to do. Jennifer Palmieri: But as a running mate. I mean, this Mike was asking as the actual nominee. I don’t think any scenario where Roy Cooper becomes the nominee. You know, but like a running mate for Vice President Harris. Mark McKinnon: Harris, Cooper would be great. Yeah. Harris-Cooper. Harris-Beshear. Yes, a hundred percent. Yeah, balance the ticket with somebody from the South. You know, he’d be top three for me. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. So Bethany wrote, since the debate, Trump has not dominated headlines. Trump has used negative media to his advantage in the past. I think she means, right, like, you know, here’s no bad press for Donald Trump, right? He just embraces everything. Since Biden has a lot of negative media right now, is there any way to use this to his advantage? Similarly, could a drama at the Democratic Convention dominate the headlines and work in the Dems’ favor? I’m going to answer the first part of that question, because I think that the Biden campaign has done, I mean, look, they’re in a very difficult situation and I think the campaign has done just about everything they can to get the president in a good place to, you know, announce him to the president to prove that he can do this, right? But I think that one thing that they did a good job with was taking, you know, over the weekend, you saw this start to happen on Sunday when the president went to that black church and got a good response. And meanwhile, some white members of Congress and other elites, definitely like “New York Times” columnists, I saw that George Clooney just wrote a “Times” column saying that he should drop out. And it’s like, you know, Ari Emanuel, another, you know, Hollywood agent. So it’s like Hollywood, big donors, white members of Congress, not the Congressional Black Caucus calling on him to resign. And so then it’s like Joe Biden versus everybody. Joe Biden versus the elites. And that, I think for a while, I’m not sure that that sort of threat, you know, that this exists, but it did seem to give him a boost, at least in the short term, of a different kind of fight. Like, it’s me against everybody and I’m fighting for you and I’m not on the sides of the elites. And, you know, in his mind, he has never been on the side of elites his entire life. This has given him an opportunity to do that. Vaughn, what do you think? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. I think that this is one of those moments where, I think it was Bernie Sanders this week, who was on the front lines of saying the messaging for the party needs to get back to its roots, the working class. What are we fighting for? And that is with every passing day, this is already going to be a difficult enough race. But the party is distracted from convincing the American public that Donald Trump’s version of populism is not the right one for in terms of actual execution here. And, you know, Donald Trump in the meanwhile, right? Like, everybody kind of knows what to expect out of him at this point. And that’s where, like, the lies that he said on the debate really didn’t come as a shock to, I think, us or most Americans. But even in Doral, at his campaign rally in Florida this week, he, again, called for the release of the so-called hostages, January 6th attackers, saying they’re unfairly imprisoned. And I think that so much of that, which he repeats over and over, gets lost in all of this. And so I think he has sort of flooded the zone with bad headlines Donald Trump has over the years. It’s sometimes hard to disentangle them because he almost in so many ways embraces being convicted, embraces the fact that he wants to pardon January 6th attackers. And so it’s hard to wade through that messaging while also trying to have a forward-looking vision if you’re the Democratic Party. Jennifer Palmieri: But I do think that’s partly why Democratic members stopped calling on Biden to resign, largely, because I think what they understood, if they actually wanted him to not be the nominee, that they were fueling his fire by being a Washington insider, continuing to say that he should drop out. And I think that’s part of the reason why you largely saw people step back on Monday night, Tuesday, until Mikey Sherrill and Michael Bennet. And, Bethany, the Dem convention dominating the headlines covered that in the first segment, but that is a big thing on everybody’s minds right now. Thanks so much to Vaughn Hillyard, NBC News correspondent covering the Trump campaign. Look forward to seeing your coverage at next week’s convention. Vaughn Hillyard: I appreciate it, you guys.

Alabama Republican Party chair: Democracy ‘leads to socialism’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 8:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alabama-republican-party-chair-democracy-leads-socialism-rcna161355,"In recent years, the Republican Party has been credibly accused of becoming hostile toward democracy. The evidence to bolster the allegations has been overwhelming: From voter suppression measures to election denialism to rejecting the certification of vote tallies, the contemporary GOP has been unsubtle in suggesting that Americans may no longer resolve our differences at the ballot box. But there’s another dimension to this that’s even less opaque: Some Republicans have been explicit in their rejection of democracy. AL.com’s Kyle Whitmire, for example, took note of the latest rhetoric from John Wahl, the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, who shared some odd thoughts during an appearance on a local radio program last week. To be sure, that’s quite a conspiracy theory. Rascally journalists, we’re apparently supposed to believe, have secretly launched an effort to convince Americans that they live in a democracy — not just to deceive them, but to advance the cause of “socialism.” As best as I can tell, Wahl wasn’t kidding. But the Alabama Republican isn’t alone. A few months ago, GOP officials in the state of Washington assembled for an election-year convention and passed a resolution that read in part, “We encourage Republicans to substitute the words ‘republic’ and ‘republicanism’ where previously they have used the word ‘democracy.’” The same resolution added that Republicans in the state of Washington “oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature.” One delegate to the state GOP convention declared at the event, “We are devolving into a democracy. ... We do not want to be a democracy.” Such thinking has even popped up on Capitol Hill. About a month before Election Day 2020, for example, Sen. Mike Lee raised a few eyebrows by declaring via social media that the United States is “not a democracy.” The Utah Republican added soon after, “Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity [sic] are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.” Nearly a year later, Sen. Rand Paul made a related argument. “The idea of democracy and majority rule really is what goes against our history and what the country stands for,” the Kentucky Republican argued in June 2021, despite reality. One need not be a hysterical partisan to accuse the Republican Party of growing increasingly hostile toward democracy; one need only quote Republican officials."
Why did GOP’s Jim Banks dodge questions about armed rebellion?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 7:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-jim-banks-dodge-questions-armed-rebellion-rcna161342,"Up until fairly recently, the “Appeal to Heaven” flag was a relatively obscure symbol, at least in contemporary times, though as a New York Times report recently noted, it’s become “a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump, for a religious strand of the ‘Stop the Steal’ campaign and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.” Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick added, “That flag is not merely another January 6 signifier but also rooted in John Locke’s ‘appeal to heaven,’ meaning ‘a responsibility to rebel, even use violence, to overthrow unjust rule.’” With this in mind, it was rather unsettling when the public learned that the Appeal to Heaven flag, also known as the Pine Tree flag, was hoisted above Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s vacation home in New Jersey last year. This week, the same symbol became politically relevant anew, thanks to the latest reporting from NOTUS’s Haley Byrd Wilt. Let’s back up and review how we arrived at this point. Hours after a jury convicted Trump of 34 felonies, Banks published an image — without text or a caption — of the Appeal to Heaven flag to his social media platform. (As of this morning, it remains the Indiana Republican’s pinned tweet, suggesting he places special significance on the symbol.) This led NOTUS to note that some commenters were speculating the image meant that the GOP congressman “might view what was happening to Trump as dire enough to warrant some new kind of American revolution.” Banks has been given a variety of opportunities to reject the idea of armed rebellion. He’s chosen not to take advantage of those opportunities. “I’ll let you make your own conclusions,” he told NOTUS. The outlet also asked the Republican lawmaker whether he condemns any kind of violent insurrection. Instead of saying “yes” or “of course,” Banks said he condemns “the Democrats for what they’ve done to weaponize the federal government against their political enemies.” (There is literally no evidence of Democrats weaponizing the federal government against their political enemies. There is, however, overwhelming evidence of Trump trying to weaponize the federal government against his political enemies — which Banks has never publicly criticized.) Asked whether he believed his promotion of the Appeal to Heaven flag, on the night of Trump’s conviction, could be misconstrued, Banks added, “I’m not sure what there is to misconstrue.” It seems like it would’ve been quite easy for the Indiana Republican — who’s all but certain to be elected to the Senate in the fall — simply to express his opposition to armed rebellion. For reasons he has not yet explained, Banks apparently doesn’t want to deliver such a message."
Michael Cohen asks Supreme Court to take up appeal alleging Trump retaliation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 7:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/michael-cohen-supreme-court-trump-retaliation-rcna161107,"Michael Cohen wants the Supreme Court to take up his appeal seeking damages against Donald Trump and others for alleged retaliation during the former president’s administration. But while the petition from Trump’s former fixer serves to highlight the potential dangers of a revenge-packed second Trump term, he faces a tough road getting the justices to review his case. The appeal, filed Wednesday, stems from when Cohen was serving federal time for Trump-related crimes and he started writing a book that would be unfavorable to the then-president. He was released to home confinement in 2020 after the Covid pandemic broke out, but his lawyers say that when Cohen “did not agree immediately to waive his right to free speech, he was summarily sent back to prison and thrown into solitary confinement.” In addition to Trump, Cohen seeks damages against former Attorney General Bill Barr and other Trump-era officials. (Trump attorney Alina Habba has called the lawsuit frivolous.) His lawyers added in the petition that “the possibility that the federal government has the power to retaliate against critics with imprisonment, without any consequence for or check against the officials engaged in such retaliation, is a chilling prospect.” No doubt. But the problem Cohen faces is that the legal mechanism he invokes for his lawsuit is one that the Supreme Court has all but abandoned. In a 1971 case called Bivens, the court allowed a damages claim against federal officials for alleged Fourth Amendment violations. But the court has taken a stingy view since then, routinely rejecting so-called Bivens claims. In a 2022 decision, Justice Clarence Thomas’ majority opinion cited Bivens while noting: “Over the past 42 years, however, we have declined 11 times to imply a similar cause of action for other alleged constitutional violations.” Thomas wrote that the court will deny claims “in all but the most unusual circumstances.” Cohen’s petition attempts to convince the justices that his case presents such a circumstance. His lawyers wrote: Still, it’s difficult to imagine the court caring. The justices have discretion to grant or deny Cohen’s petition. It takes four justices to grant review. That would have seemed an unlikely prospect even before the Roberts Court bestowed Trump with broad immunity for criminal conduct while in office. But in the wake of that ruling reaffirming the court’s priorities, it’s clear that the prospect of accountability for powerful officials — presidents in particular — is not among those priorities."
"On Project 2025, Trump keeps inadvertently helping Democrats",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/project-2025-trump-keeps-inadvertently-helping-democrats-rcna161328,"Democratic officials recently settled on a specific goal: They would inform the public about Project 2025, a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by the Heritage Foundation with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. It posed a messaging challenge — many Americans don’t know what the Heritage Foundation is and are wholly unfamiliar with its lengthy governing blueprint — but Democrats decided to try anyway. Last week, Trump unexpectedly gave them a hand: The former president published an odd item to his social media platform claiming to “know nothing” about Project 2025. The Republican went on to claim he has “no idea who is behind it,” he disagrees with some of its provisions, and he has “nothing to do with” the initiative. As a strategic matter, this was incredibly unwise. For one thing, the GOP candidate’s statement let Democrats know that their efforts were having an effect. For another, Trump’s statement prompted a round of fact-checking, which left little doubt that his claims were absurd. But just as notably, Trump helped bring attention to the Project 2025 plan, which is what Democrats were hoping for. Shortly after midnight, he did it again. The former president published an online follow-up statement that read in part: For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that the Republicans’ 2024 platform has not, in reality, been “very well received.” Instead, there are two other angles of interest here. The first is that Trump’s efforts to distance himself from Project 2025 are difficult to take seriously. “I literally don’t have enough time to list every connection between Donald Trump and Project 2025,” MSNBC’s Ali Velshi told viewers over the weekend. “But I can absolutely confidently say that Donald Trump’s claim that he ‘knows nothing about Project 2025’ and has ‘no idea who is behind it’ is, how do we say it in Canada? Complete and utter B.S.” A CNN report published overnight went into striking detail: What's more, NBC News tracked down a 2022 speech in which Trump spoke at a Heritage Foundation event and said, ""This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” Remember, reports like these were instigated by a Trump missive that he didn’t need to publish. All of which brings us to the overarching point: The Republican made a tactical mistake by bringing national attention to Project 2025, elevating an issue that Democrats wanted people to know more about. Six days later, in his infinite wisdom, Trump unnecessarily did it again. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Republicans advance ‘Save Act,’ a solution in search of a problem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-advance-act-solution-search-problem-rcna161316,"Three months ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson made an obligatory pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to kiss Donald Trump’s ring and hold a joint press conference with the former president. It was not, however, a simple photo-op: The Republicans unveiled a proposal they appeared to be rather proud of. The GOP duo pitched legislation that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. The absurdity of watching two notorious election deniers pretend to be deeply concerned with the integrity of elections was a detail the political world was apparently supposed to overlook. Soon after, House Republicans followed through, introducing the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act” (or “Save Act”), and as Politico reported, the measure cleared the lower chamber late Wednesday afternoon. Republican support for the bill was unanimous. The vote was held the day after Trump published a ridiculous item to his social media platform, which read in part, “Republicans must pass the Save Act, or go home and cry yourself to sleep. Non citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians who are not being stopped by an equally dishonest Justice Department. ... The Justice Department is CORRUPT and won’t do a thing to help. They have no shame!” None of this was true. Nevertheless, GOP officials and their allies pretended that their legislation was of great significance. “This will be one of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take in their entire careers,” the House speaker declared on the floor ahead of the vote. It followed an online item from conspiratorial billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote, in reference to the Save Act, “Those who oppose this are traitors. All Caps: TRAITORS. What is the penalty for traitors again?” All of this is deeply bizarre, it’s worth understanding why. The principal problem with the legislation is that it’s a solution in search of a problem. To hear Republicans tell it, policymakers must prevent noncitizens from voting, which probably sounds reasonable. In fact, it’s so reasonable that the Save Act is redundant: There are literally zero locations in the United States where noncitizens can vote in federal and/or state elections. GOP lawmakers have also argued that legislation is needed to curtail the scourge of noncitizens who are already voting. Except, Republicans have gone searching for evidence of this problem and found effectively nothing. Johnson, while touting the Save Act in May, said Republicans “intuitively” know that “a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,” which was a hilarious way for the House speaker to effectively say, “We have no evidence to bolster our beliefs.” At this point, some on the right might argue that the Save Act is worthwhile anyway. Sure, noncitizens are already prohibited from voting in federal elections, and yes, evidence of noncitizens casting ballots is nearly impossible to find, but maybe there’s no harm in simply passing the legislation anyway? Just to be safe? Except, that’s wrong, too, because the legislation would add new and entirely unnecessary hurdles for Americans who want to participate in their own country’s elections — forcing them, for example, to produce documents such as a passport or birth certificate to register to vote. As House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries explained during the floor debate, “[T]his extreme MAGA Republican voter suppression bill is not designed to solve any problem on behalf of the American people. It is designed to jam people up and prevent Americans from voting.” For good measure, let’s also not overlook the ugly motivation behind the GOP leaders’ push. Johnson recently argued that an influx of immigrants is “one of their designs” that Democratic officials created “because they want to turn these people into voters.” That’s absurd for all sorts of reasons, including the years-long process in which some of these immigrants might be able to become citizens, but it served as a reminder that the Save Act is, as a Washington Post analysis summarized, “the ‘great replacement’ theory ... in legislation form.”"

Boeing’s extraordinary ‘sweetheart deal’ is a slap in face to the victims,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/boeing-plea-deal-737-max-crash-rcna160894,"Earlier this week, the Boeing Company pleaded guilty in federal court to defrauding federal regulators about its role in two fatal crashes, in 2018 and 2019, of 737 MAX aircraft in which 346 people were killed. Three years ago, Boeing agreed to enforce “compliance and ethics,” saying it would commit to prioritizing safety over profits. This plea deal and an accompanying $243 million fine came about because Boeing failed to do that. It’s an extraordinary turn of events for one of America’s largest companies, once the crown jewel of its aerospace industry. Frankly, the stipulated fine — less than 0.5% of Boeing’s 2023 revenue — and the company's acknowledgment of guilt are far from enough. The victims’ families have certainly made clear — often speaking through tears — that this plea agreement is a “sweetheart deal” and woefully insufficient for the lives lost due to Boeing’s irresponsibility. Given Boeing’s longstanding problems, a more significant fine — not to mention pursuing jail time for senior executives — was appropriate. Today, the company is still being investigated by an alphabet soup of federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company’s issues go far beyond two fatal crashes and encompass a systemic failure to enforce safety protocols during design and production, and repeated refusals to respond when in-house whistleblowers voiced their concerns. Boeing, to date, shows little sign of having learned any lessons. After a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 high over Portland in January (miraculously not killing anyone), 2024 has seen endless headlines chronicling shoddy workmanship, rampant outsourcing, frequent stonewalling and overall tone deafness from the company. What went wrong? Once, there were multiple major aircraft manufacturers competing against Boeing for airline contracts, both domestically and overseas. But over the years, nearly all exited airline manufacturing and competition dwindled. In 1993, the Clinton administration even called a post-Cold War “Last Supper” at the White House, forcing Boeing and other Pentagon suppliers to consolidate. Today, just three companies — Boeing, Airbus and Embraer — control nearly 98% of the global airline market. Boeing’s merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997 sowed the seeds of the former’s downfall. The engineers with decades of experience in Boeing’s executive ranks were replaced with MBAs with a fanatical focus on slashing costs. Boeing’s headquarters — embedded near Seattle since 1914 — was twice moved eastward recently, first to Chicago and then Virginia, in part to reduce commuting time for its army of Washington lobbyists. Unsurprisingly, the shift from building safe and reliable metal tubes that hurtle through the troposphere to prioritizing quarterly profits, stock buybacks, union busting and creating new forms of executive compensation wasn’t feasible in the long term. This mix of cost-cutting and a “shoot the messenger” approach to safety warnings from employees bred endless production delays, manufacturing defects and scandals. Even casual readers of the door plug saga have learned the name Spirit AeroSystems, a former Boeing subsidiary spun off in 2005 to build aircraft fuselages. The result was a shocking lack of support and oversight from Boeing itself for such a crucial portion of the manufacturing process. Boeing recently agreed to reacquire Spirit, but its outsourcing difficulties remain. Thousands of employees work for more than 50 outsourced contractors suppling 70% of Boeing’s design, engineering and manufacturing.  And it’s no coincidence that Boeing’s 787 is built in “right to work” South Carolina as an end run against unionized employees in Seattle. Recent congressional hearings with chilling whistleblower testimony have demonstrated Boeing senior management’s cluelessness about the quality of such work — and the retaliation against workers who speak out. You may be wondering at this point where the government was in all this. The aviation consolidation in the 1990s — among aircraft manufacturers and airlines alike — came at the worst time, because the Federal Aviation Administration has been notoriously understaffed and underfunded since the Reagan administration. The FAA’s fallback solution was to launch the office of Organization Designation Authorization, which allows industry employees (such as Boeing’s) to oversee and inspect work on its behalf. In other words, under ODA, Boeing employees are expected to tell their bosses to shut down assembly when there are problems, even though those same bosses again and again ignored those problems and even retaliated against employees who raised them. Boeing’s impact not only on aviation but on America itself cannot be overstated. The company had revenues of $77.8 billion in 2023 and directly employs 145,000 workers in more than 65 countries. It is among the United States’ largest exporters. Boeing remains one of the largest defense contractors; last year it ranked fifth among Pentagon suppliers. Whatever is in store next for this once-titan of the American industry, one conclusion is clear: self-policing is not enough. The victims of Boeing’s irresponsibility know it, lawmakers know it, and American passengers now anxious to step on a plane know it. It’s crucial that we fully resource the FAA's ability to provide thorough oversight and inspections. That means funding in-house FAA Safety Inspectors, sunsetting ODA and revamping ticket tax funding and FAA oversight procedures. But it’s also crucial that we once again insist on real punishments for wrongdoing. Only true accountability stands a chance of forcing Boeing to reject reckless ""financialization"" and return to making things that work. And even then, we’ll be talking about the Icarus-like fall of Boeing for decades to come."
Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy case could be dismissed entirely,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-case-dismiss-rcna161126,"Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy case could be thrown out entirely, after a judge said Wednesday that he is inclined to dismiss it. “I’m leaning toward dismissal, frankly, because I am concerned that the past is prologue,” said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane, who added that he will make a final ruling Friday. The judge’s remarks came at the end of a turbulent hearing as he weighed several proposals to deal with the case. Just hours before the hearing began, Giuliani’s lawyers asked that the case be dismissed. Giuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after he was ordered to pay nearly $150 million to two former Georgia election workers for spreading lies about them in the 2020 election. His bankruptcy proceedings prevented the election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, from immediately collecting the money. For months, Giuliani has submitted confusing and conflicting reports to the court about his spending and earnings. His creditors have accused him of providing false and misleading information about his assets, and they claim he is using bankruptcy to avoid paying up. “Since day one, Giuliani has regarded this case and the bankruptcy process as a joke,” his creditors wrote in a filing Monday, “hiding behind the façade of an elderly, doddering man who cannot even remember the address for his second multimillion dollar home and claims impending homelessness if he must sell that second multimillion dollar home.” Although a committee of Giuliani’s creditors initially called for a Chapter 11 trustee to be appointed to control his assets, Freeman and Moss split from the group and requested that the case be dismissed so that they can begin to collect their money. Giuliani, meanwhile, requested converting his bankruptcy case to Chapter 7 so that his assets could be liquidated. But in an eleventh-hour filing Wednesday, his lawyers agreed with Freeman and Moss’ proposal to dismiss the case entirely. An attorney representing the creditors committee urged the judge Wednesday not to dismiss the case, arguing that doing so would only benefit Freeman and Moss and leave the other creditors hanging. But an attorney for the Georgia women argued that their case took precedence and that appointing a monitor to control Giuliani’s finances would be a waste of time and money."
Rep. Ted Lieu urges media to dig deeper into Trump-Epstein ties,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/ted-lieu-trump-epstein-files-rcna161105,"California Rep. Ted Lieu wants to know why Donald Trump’s ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein aren’t getting more media coverage. At a news conference on Tuesday, Lieu brought up newly unsealed court documents that he suggested highlight Trump’s relationship with Epstein, the convicted sex offender. “We hear a lot from our constituents on different issues, but something I’ve heard that doesn’t seem to be getting covered are the Epstein files. These files were released. And, like, Donald Trump is sort of all over this,” Lieu said. “Y’all might want to look at that, because that’s highly disturbing. And again, it shows that Donald Trump is unfit for office.” Lieu also pointed to Trump’s felony conviction for falsifying business records and the finding of civil liability for sexual abuse as indicators he is unfit for the presidency. Lieu has taken some heat for overstating the contents of the Epstein documents in his remarks. The most recent document to be released came out earlier this month, a 176-page grand jury transcript that does not reference Trump. Previous document releases in January 2024 made passing references to Trump but didn’t implicate him in anything nefarious. (For the record, New York Magazine has a more thorough breakdown of what document releases have already revealed about Trump and Epstein’s ties.) Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said those releases “thoroughly debunked” any claims about Trumps ties to Epstein. Trump has always denied any wrongdoing. But the congressman has a point: For three consecutive presidential elections now, Trump hasn’t been pressed enough by reporters on the campaign trail about his relationship with Epstein. There is video of Trump partying with Epstein at Mar-a-Lago in 1992; Trump said in 2002 that Epstein was a “terrific guy” who “likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” Trump wished Epstein’s co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, well in her failed attempt to stay out of jail during her trial, and a court-ordered document released in 2021 revealed Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane between New York and Palm Beach seven times in the mid-’90s — despite Trump’s claims that he had never flown with Epstein. There’s also the 2016 lawsuit filed against Trump by a woman who claimed the former president raped her as a teenager at Epstein’s apartment. A Trump attorney at the time called the claim “frivolous” and “categorically untrue,” and the accuser dropped her lawsuit days before the 2016 election after her lawyer said she had received death threats. Trump himself has seemed ambivalent about what information about Epstein might ultimately be revealed. When asked on Fox News this year whether he’d work to unseal some of the Epstein documents if he’s elected president this fall, he seemed to have reservations. “I guess I would,” Trump said, “I think that less so because, you don’t know, you don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phony stuff in there, because it’s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would.”  All things considered, I agree with Lieu that Trump’s civil liability for sexual abuse and his criminal conviction in New York suggest his unfitness for office. Trump’s ties to Epstein seem deserving of further scrutiny, though, and that he’s been allowed to avoid addressing them is a media failure."
The real reason a Kamala Harris presidency is unfathomable to her critics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-dei-president-racist-sexist-comments-rcna161043,"The headline of a recent New York Post column deriding Vice President Kamala Harris says, “America may soon be subjected to the country’s first DEI president.” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, later used that same language, telling Fox Business that Democrats have “got to choose between a mentally incompetent president and a DEI vice president.” At a speech at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Florida on Tuesday night, former President Donald Trump said: “If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago. But they can’t, because she’s got to be their second choice.” Democrats suggesting an open convention or looking past Harris as they imagine who might run on the top of the Democratic ticket if Biden can’t are also (in a less offensive way) demeaning Harris’ political skills and competence. This disrespect for the vice president isn’t a surprise. Neither are the racist and sexist attacks that aren’t so much dog whistles as they are deafeningly loud barks. In 2020, Biden selected Sen. Harris of California as his running mate after their contentious debate exchanges and after her hopes of winning the presidential nomination then quickly faded. It seemed obvious that he was selecting Harris to appeal to the Democratic Party’s most reliable voting bloc: Black women. They are the voters who have supported and lifted up the party in races across the country. In his speech announcing Harris as his pick, he said, ""This morning, all across this nation little girls woke up — especially little Black and brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — but today, maybe they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way: as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents."" Biden made it a point to say that Harris would bring a level of energy to the ticket that he lacked. That’s what presidential candidates have routinely done. They choose as their running mates people who can appeal to or excite parts of the electorate that they don’t. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence because he had the white evangelical bona fides that the thrice-married former casino owner needed to appeal to religious conservatives. When a young, energetic Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, he chose Biden as his running mate because Biden had decades more experience in Washington and ties to the Democratic establishment and he could allay the concerns of those who worried that Obama was too inexperienced. In 2020, Biden — an old, white Washington insider — similarly chose the much younger Harris, who’s Black and Asian and had been in Washington only three years, to run by his side. Diversifying a ticket is good politics, but the New York Post column and Rep. Roy would have you believe that Biden’s decision to appeal to his party’s most loyal voters was something sinister.  Harris isn’t new to politics, nor is she unfamiliar with the insults hurled her way. As one of the more “objectively attractive” politicians, she has had to deal with insinuations that former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown “made” her career, that her degrees from Howard University and the University of California Hastings College of Law somehow left her insufficiently qualified to be California’s attorney general, a U.S. senator or vice president. Now we’re hearing talk that even though she has been vice president more than three years she’s unqualified to be president. Let’s be clear (as Obama likes to say), the idea of Harris, a child of two immigrants, at the top of the ticket makes some people downright apoplectic. As vice president, Harris has had big issues, including the border crisis, Covid, voting rights and civil rights, on her docket. I wrote years ago that such a large and diverse policy portfolio was a trap. Meaning if Harris didn’t solve the myriad of crises placed within her purview, and fast, then in conversations about her ascending to president, critics would try to shroud their racist and sexist beliefs under the guise of “policy concerns.” I was right and wrong. We are seeing critiques of Harris’ not “accomplishing” what was set out for her. But the racism and sexism toward Harris isn’t shrouded. It’s blatant. With Trump at the helm, Republicans have learned that parroting his racist and sexist language is a way to appeal to their base. As more Black women and women of color ascend in the electoral politics space, questions pertaining to their “qualifications” are ever present ... as are denigrating comments about their hair, their clothes, their weight and their speech patterns. Just think back to some of the egregiously offensive comments made about Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams during her runs for governor, including the 2018 robocall that began “This is the magical Negro Oprah Winfrey asking you to make my fellow Negress Stacey Abrams the governor of Georgia” and went on to refer to Abrams as a “poor man’s Aunt Jemima.” Think of the mischaracterization of Rep. Val Demings of Florida as an anti-cop radical after a nearly 30-year law enforcement career that included her serving as chief of the Orlando Police Department. North Carolina Chief Justice Cherie Beasley, who was running a Senate campaign, was maligned as being tolerant of child molesters. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, who rightly called out Rep. Roy’s description of Harris as a DEI pick, is considered too loud, as evidenced by her House colleagues’ telling her to “just calm down” when she is merely asking a question during her allotted time. As for Harris, in a New York Times story that included Democratic insiders’ downplaying her political skills and benefit to Biden, a member of her own staff complained that she was devoting too much time to caring for her hair. Little has changed since the days of Shirley Chisholm. We’ve never had a Black female governor, and Harris was only the second Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate in history. Voters have tended to like their Black female elected officials tucked neatly under the glass ceiling. We’ve had a woman of color this close to the most important office in the nation for nearly four years, but since last month’s debate between Biden and Trump, Harris as president has become a much more tangible possibility — or predicament, depending on your perspective. Knowing what we know about Fox News, Trump, the Republican Party and even members of the Democratic Party who are envious of Harris’ position, we must prepare ourselves for the even more racist and sexist barking we’re about to hear, directed not only at her but at the very idea that somebody who looks like her could ever be qualified to lead."
What Black women really think about calls for Kamala Harris to replace Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 2:55 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/black-women-voters-harris-biden-rcna161178,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 9 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" Black voters are extremely pragmatic. Most Black women in America are pragmatic, hence why they show up at the ballot box in the various ways they do. Last week, Melissa Murray and I traveled to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, the suburbs — yes, Black women live in the suburbs — to discuss the upcoming election. We talked about a range of things, including Vice President Kamala Harris. All the women I spoke to said they liked the vice president. One woman asked the group how they would feel if the party skipped over Harris should Joe Biden be replaced on the Democratic ticket. The group said they would be upset but also noted that in this next election, our democracy is on the line — a pragmatic and practical answer. What we’re witnessing in this ongoing debate over the vice president’s possible place at the top of the ticket is a fundamental misunderstanding, as my former boss Sen. Bernie Sanders would say, of two things. First, the process itself: It’s not politicians or party leaders that pick the president, it’s the people. And the people selected Biden. Now people can have qualms about the primary process and say they didn’t feel like it was open, but we can’t say that the primaries weren’t had and that ballots weren’t cast. Secondly, there’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the Democratic Party’s base voters and Black voters. I was at the Essence Festival this weekend talking to Black women and they brought up the issues of health care, abortion and the economy. Based on the conversations I had, the chief concern for Black women in this country is the economy, and they want a candidate who’s going to speak to that. However, there is a problem with outrage at even the suggestion that Harris’ name could appear at the top of the Democratic ticket. Some are questioning the audacity of the vice president, and the audacity of her supporters to believe she should be first in line to the presidency. Well, she is the vice president — literally there to be the president in case the commander in chief is unable to do the job, whether they are under anesthesia, whether the 25th Amendment is implemented, whether whatever. That’s what a vice president is for. The president selected her because he believed that in the event he could not carry out his duties, she could. But this is the reality of the moment we’re in, in discussions I've had with folks who are members of the Democratic Party and have pledged their support to Biden, I have not heard many Black women voters say that they are walking away from him. Right now, it’s still President Biden’s name at the top of the ticket — it’s the Biden-Harris ticket and Democrats should act as such."
"Nikki Haley bowed to Trump again, just for him to humiliate her",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 2:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/nikki-haley-delegates-trump-convention-rcna161203,"On Tuesday, Nikki Haley officially released the delegates she won during the Republican presidential nominating contests and encouraged them to vote for Donald Trump.  Alongside Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, Haley was staunch in her criticism of Trump throughout her campaign. But she faced a barrage of sexist smears and personal attacks on her family from Trump and his allies. And yet in the end, she did what Trump’s spokesperson Stephen Chung predicted she would: “kiss ass when she quits,” and endorsed his candidacy.  And that total capitulation didn’t even earn her an invite to the Republican National Convention. She won’t even be afforded the opportunity to witness Trump absorbing her political power in person.  The scenario reinforces my theory that Haley embodies a sort of dead end for Republican women — or perhaps it's a Trump-imposed glass ceiling. Back in February, The 19th published an article titled “What Nikki Haley’s run means to Republican women who don’t love Trump,” which makes the case that, to some conservative women, Haley personified a position within the MAGA movement that wasn't wholly devoted to Trump and his selfish ambitions. Which is why some conservative women were distraught by attacks on her from the right.  As Mel Leonor Barclay reported: Several other articles framed Haley’s presidential campaign as trailblazing or pioneering. And while I suspect some were glorifying what often looked like a desperate grasp at relevance or a half-hearted attempt to steer the Republican Party away from overt fascism, some voters may have bought into that framing: that Haley was attempting to model a way for women to exist within the MAGA movement while retaining a modicum of self-respect and self-determination. So I wonder what the women who were truly Trump-averse and Haley supporters are thinking today, now that Haley has fallen back into lockstep with the rest of the GOP. If someone blazes a trail right into a brick wall, is that inspirational? Or just a warning? Because the message to MAGA women seems clear following Haley’s debasement: Support the man in charge, or get out."

Biden’s comments came as Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is serving as acting governor while Greg Abbott is on an economic development trip in Asia.” * Speaking of the White House, these were compelling remarks: “With the eyes of the world on him, President Joe Biden delivered a forceful speech to open the NATO summit in Washington, aiming to reverse doubts about his fitness for the job domestically while boasting that his leadership revitalized the storied alliance and saved Ukraine.” * Speaking of NATO’s future: “Ukraine is on an ‘irreversible’ path to NATO membership, U.S. and European officials said Wednesday, advancing assurances from allies that it will be allowed to join the Western military coalition after its war with Russia ends.” * In Russia: “A court in Russia ordered the arrest of the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny during a hearing Tuesday that was conducted in absentia as part of a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on the opposition. Yulia Navalnaya, who lives abroad, would face arrest if and when she returns to Russia.” * A legislative effort worth watching: “A bipartisan group of senators announced a deal Wednesday on a congressional stock trading ban aimed at preventing members from profiting from insider knowledge. Sens.

How a second Trump term could destroy Medicare as we know it,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 1:34 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-trump-medicare-advantage-rcna160896,"As soon as Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for a second Trump administration, began to receive significant negative publicity earlier this month, the former and perhaps future president quickly denied all knowledge of it. “I know nothing about Project 2025,” he said on Truth Social, adding he believed that (unspecified) ideas in the proposal are “abysmal.” He’d certainly like us to believe that. But that statement shouldn’t be the end of the matter, and not simply because more than two dozen former Trump administration officials are involved in Project 2025. It’s because many of its planks read like a continuation of his first term. That includes the section on Medicare and other health care initiatives, which is not getting the attention it deserves. Project 2025 recommends making Medicare Advantage — the private insurance offering in Medicare — the default option for enrollment. Currently, there is no default option, though what’s called “Original Medicare” is presented first.  That may sound like a minor change, particularly if you’re not familiar with Medicare’s offerings. But this plan, should it come to fruition, will likely degrade not only Medicare, but health care for all Americans, no matter our age. Ever since he announced his first presidential run, Trump has promised to “save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.” That was a lie. Even before he became president, his own staff and supporters were saying it wasn’t true. While he was in office, each of Trump’s budgets called for Social Security and Medicare cuts. Trump himself encouraged enrollment in Medicare Advantage, while his Department of Health and Human Services, the agency responsible for the program, sent out promotional emails during one sign-up period with headlines like “Get more benefits for your money.” This statement is, again, a lie. Medicare Advantage costs the government billions of dollars more annually than the traditional offering, while delivering less in the way of necessary care. Giant health care insurers game the Medicare system, profiting at the expense of taxpayers and patients alike. The government pays insurers a minimum fee per enrollee based on each enrollee’s health — something done to discourage companies from cherry-picking the healthy. But insurance companies do their darndest to make their enrollees appear as sick as possible to the federal government, so they can collect more money for them. As a result, the government spends more than 20% more for people enrolled in Medicare Advantage than they do the traditional program. But all this upcoding doesn’t mean Medicare Advantage enrollees receive more in the way of care. In traditional Medicare, patients can see almost any doctor and few services need prior authorization. Neither is true under Medicare Advantage. Medical networks are narrow and limited, while everything from an MRI of the aching knee to chemotherapy for recommended cancer treatment -- not to mention doctor-recommended nursing home and rehab stays -- can be subject to insurance company second-guessing. While only a little more than 10% will appeal if they do not receive pre-authorization, if they do, four out of five will see the decision overturned.  Why, in 2024, does Medicare Advantage cover more seniors than the traditional offering? Trump, to be clear, is far from the only reason. Traditional Medicare can seem complicated, and most experts recommend its users also purchase Medigap insurance, which covers some of the out-of-pocket costs Medicare pushes to the user. That combo can be more expensive up front for seniors, many of whom are cash-strapped. Medicare Advantage plans seem simpler, and also frequently offer enticements like gym memberships and dental care. The downsides aren’t as obvious until the enrollee needs lifesaving medical care — when it can be cost-prohibitive to seniors to switch back to the traditional government program. Given that lifesaving care is hardly an uncommon need for the elderly, it’s little wonder the program has acquired the nasty nickname “Medicare Disadvantage.” You would think an outfit like the Heritage Foundation, which complains regularly about both the federal budget deficit and supposed restrictions on economic freedom, would want to do the exact opposite of a program that increases government spending and reduces Americans’ choices. But many conservatives have a way of going quiet about government spending when it fattens the bottom lines of big corporations. And Medicare Advantage is excellent at that. Insurers are so flush with profits that they’re using this excess federal money to create vertical monopolies, hoovering up everything from physician practices to pharmacy benefit managers and stymying competition by steering their customers to their own, not infrequently higher priced, offerings. The result is that the worse care and reduced choice of Medicare Advantage spills over to the rest of America. All of these issues could worsen if Medicare Advantage is made the default option. “Pushing people into Medicare Advantage is a recipe for further enriching corporate health insurers at the expense of older adults, destroying Medicare as we know it. It compounds health inequities. Vulnerable Americans are likely to lose access to their choice of doctors and face barriers to getting the care they need,” says Diane Archer, president of Just Care USA. This isn’t just impacting the millions of Americans on Medicare. It’s running up all our bills. If you are trying to save the government money while offering up better care for the money spent, pushing Medicare Advantage is the exact opposite of what the doctor ordered."
The 3 good ideas in the 920-page Project 2025 playbook,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-president-trump-second-term-good-ideas-rcna161099,"If you're still waiting for George R.R. Martin to finish the next sequel to ""A Game of Thrones,"" I have another suggestion for a work of fantasy that's just as long, complicated and brutal. It's called Project 2025 and, at 920 pages, it has more words than several of Martin's novels. It also has a similar approach to governance: The proposal rhapsodizes about leaders using unchecked power to pursue their enemies, including thousands of government workers who try to make sure your water is clean, your food is safe and your prosecutions are fair. But you have to hand it to the Heritage Foundation, the far-right think tank that dreamt up the plans for a second Donald Trump administration: Project 2025 certainly has a lot of ideas, even though most of them aren't very good. While reading through the proposal recently, I found a lot to criticize: granting the president vast new powers, politicizing federal agencies, reversing efforts to fight climate change, reducing legal immigration, making it dramatically harder to get an abortion, and on and on. Some of these ideas would leave Americans less free and more financially insecure; others are entirely unworkable. But within those hundreds of pages, a few reasonable suggestions snuck through. I came across a handful of smaller ideas that are worth considering, even if you disagree with their broader aims. Project 2025 calls for streamlining the regulatory requirements and licensing process for new nuclear power plants. To be clear, this is part of a section that also calls for making it easier to drill for oil and natural gas and even promoting the use of fossil fuels in developing countries while rolling back efforts to fight climate change. But more nuclear power could help the U.S. transition away from fossil fuels by replacing coal and helping fill the gap when wind and solar aren't available. Project 2025's authors may not want to fight climate change, but this idea would help do it anyway. On education, Project 2025 proposes consolidating various income-driven repayment plans for student loans. Surprisingly, the authors acknowledge that these plans, in which monthly payments are tied to your income level, are ""a superior approach"" compared to fixed monthly payments, which hit people with lower incomes harder. (In other sections, the authors are much less concerned about making the tax code progressive.) To be clear, their end goal is a repayment plan with tight limits and paltry benefits. But the idea of clearing up the current tangle of student loan repayment plans in favor of a single, straightforward program is commendable. In the chapter on the Treasury Department, the authors suggest creating a new universal savings account that would allow Americans to sock away up to $15,000 each year, making withdrawals on any gains tax-free. These accounts would be similar to Roth IRAs, allowing people to invest in various ways, but without the retirement-related withdrawal restrictions those have. Unfortunately, this is part of Project 2025's broader plan to cut taxes on the wealthy. But the idea of simple savings plans that anyone can use has helped increase savings rates in Canada and the United Kingdom, and it would be a smarter approach than the current mishmash of health savings accounts, IRAs and state-based college savings plans that end up being used mainly by wealthier Americans. Each of these ideas reflect the old conservative impulses to cut red tape, streamline government and give individuals more responsibility for their own futures. These arguments are trotted out so frequently on the right that they're easy to tune out, not least because they're often cited in bad faith by politicians who just want to shield big businesses from regulation or to cut benefits that help everyday Americans. But there's a reason why these kinds of arguments are successful: they make intuitive sense to many people. Among the many losses of our polarized era is that the two parties don't work together on big pieces of legislation as much anymore. That's unfortunate because both parties can have insights into how to craft effective policies that can get overlooked when only one party is involved. That also leads partisans to dismissively reject proposals that come from the other side. (Look no further than ""Obamacare,"" which was modeled after ideas championed by the Heritage Foundation and first implemented by a Republican governor, before becoming a conservative bogeyman.) But a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from — even if the source is Project 2025. And we should all be looking for ways to make government work better."
Trump’s promise to ‘take over’ Washington is a dictator’s dream,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 12:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-washington-dc-take-over-military-crime-rcna161177,"In Florida on Tuesday, Donald Trump doubled down on a dictatorial threat to “take over” the nation’s capital if he wins in November, suggesting he’d usurp power from local officials in Washington to run the city as he and his MAGA acolytes please. Trump, a convicted criminal himself, made the ominous vow at a rally in Doral while delivering an unhinged rant about purportedly rampant crime in Washington. He claimed that his administration will “take over the horribly run capital of our country,” which he said is a “nightmare of murder and crime” where you go to see tourist attractions but “end up getting shot, mugged, raped.” It’s funny how MAGA men like Trump portray themselves as tough guys, yet make simple excursions in cities sound like harrowing ordeals. In reality, the violent crime rate in D.C. has fallen dramatically since last year, when conservatives led a hysterical push to overturn criminal justice reforms in the city. And Washington’s overall crime has shown similar decreases in 2024. Nonetheless, this takeover threat from Trump matches one he made at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, where he said the feds should take control of D.C. and added that he “wouldn’t even call the mayor.” He has made similar threats toward other cities — and threatened to send in the military. The impression he has tried to spread is that these cities are incapable of governing themselves. And this fits a dubious trend of trying to install conservative rule by fiat: Republicans nationwide have tried — sometimes successfully — to strip power from liberal officials (often Black officials). As for Trump, his vows to use military-style crackdowns that resemble martial law are particularly disturbing in light of two things: the recent Supreme Court decision granting presidents immunity for things deemed “official acts,” and the conservative movement’s idolization of brutal dictators like El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele, who is known for deploying torture and arbitrary detention under the guise of fighting crime. If Trump wins and is empowered with the conservative justices’ newly contrived idea of presidential immunity, we could see similar scenes playing out in cities nationwide, all at his behest."
"George Clooney says Biden must withdraw from race, weeks after hosting star-studded fundraiser for him",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 11:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/george-clooney-biden-withdraw-election-rcna161174,"President Joe Biden appears to have lost another major supporter: Actor George Clooney, a longtime Democrat and prominent fundraiser for the party, has joined the chorus of calls for Biden to withdraw from the race. In an op-ed in The New York Times on Wednesday, Clooney echoed the remarks of the Democratic lawmakers who have urged Biden to step down from the ticket. Clooney praised the president and his character, but said that he was simply too old to run in an election with such high stakes. “I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. ... In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced,” Clooney wrote. ""But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.” Clooney wrote in dire terms about his belief in Biden's chances in the election: Clooney did not call for Vice President Kamala Harris to take over the top of the ticket as some lawmakers have. Instead, Democrats seen as potential successors — including Harris — should make the case for themselves, he suggested, “Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.” The actor’s op-ed comes amid serious disarray among congressional Democrats about Biden’s insistence on running in the election and how that could affect down-ballot races. It also comes just weeks after Clooney hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden’s campaign in Los Angeles, raising almost $30 million for the president’s re-election bid. (Biden had flown from Europe to Los Angeles for the event, and he said his intense travel schedule in the weeks leading up to the debate contributed to his exhaustion and poor performance.) Clooney is a Hollywood powerhouse in Democratic politics, raising significant amounts of money for liberal causes and Democratic candidates. He supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. He also supported Biden's 2020 campaign — and, until Wednesday, his 2024 campaign. Clooney himself had previously ruled out a career in politics. In 2021, when asked by the BBC if he would ever consider running for office, he said, “No, because I would actually like to have a nice life.”"
"AOC files impeachment articles targeting Justices Alito, Thomas",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 11:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/aoc-files-impeachment-articles-targeting-justices-alito-thomas-rcna161188,"In the wake of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in Trump v. U.S., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York issued a statement condemning the high court’s “corruption crisis beyond its control.” But the congresswoman — who’s sometimes known by her “AOC” initials — didn’t stop there. “Today’s ruling represents an assault on American democracy,” the New York Democrat added, referring to the immunity case. “It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture.” To that end, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to introduce articles of impeachment against Supreme Court justices after Congress’ Fourth of July break. Evidently, she meant it. NBC News reported this afternoon: AOC has already picked up some allies: Her impeachment resolutions are backed by eight original co-sponsors: Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Delia Ramirez of Illinois, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Jamaal Bowman of New York, and Jasmine Crockett of Texas. The move also comes against a backdrop of several related efforts on Capitol Hill. Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden, for example, have asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel as part of a potential criminal investigation into Thomas. Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, meanwhile responded to the Trump v. U.S. ruling by vowing to introduce a constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Court’s “harmful immunity decision and ensure that no president is above the law.” Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey added in a written statement that read in part, “We must take all available measures to reign in the increasingly unfettered power of this radical court, including ... expanding the number of justices.” Circling back to our recent coverage, I continue to think there are a couple of ways to assess efforts like these. The first is on the merits, and on that front, it’s easy to be sympathetic to the Democratic proposals. The Supreme Court’s radicalized Republican majority has taken indefensible steps in recent years, but to elevate the presidency above the law is a uniquely pernicious act. This, coupled with recent ethics scandals, put Democratic efforts on firm ground. The second, however, is more pragmatic. No sitting justice has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process, and the last time such a case even went to the Senate was 220 years ago. Given the Republican majority in the House, the earliest such a move could even be considered is next year, and if Democrats fall short of a majority, the idea would again be off the table. Relatedly, the Constitution has never been amended to reverse a misguided Supreme Court decision; and while Congress has expanded the Supreme Court before, it’s been 155 years, and the odds of such an effort clearing Capitol Hill anytime soon are extraordinarily remote. Or put another way, Democrats are taking the broader issues seriously, as they should, but those hoping to see their efforts amount to meaningful changes should probably lower their expectations. But if Congress can’t fix what Republican justices have broken, what is the remedy? There is “very little we can do except elect a Democrat [as president] who will appoint vacancies if Democrats hold [the] Senate,” Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee recently told Axios. In other words, those looking for a near-term recourse shouldn’t look to Congress, they should look to voters, who now have an added reason to choose wisely in the fall. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Democrats just gave Republicans a gift ahead of next week's RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 11:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/democrats-chaos-republicans-rnc-platform-rcna160977,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 9 episode of “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” Unlike the chaos that’s consuming the Democratic Party, Republicans are not divided over the competence of their standard-bearer. Republicans seem all-in on Donald Trump. Next week, at the Republican National Convention, the party will have formalized the elevation of a man convicted on 34 felony counts, a man found liable for sexual abuse, and a fraudster. That’s the nominee of the Republican Party — my party. I don’t support that individual, nor do I support the direction that this platform purportedly lays out, particularly on immigration. Republicans and Trump are also lying to the country about where the party stands on women’s rights. Despite what you may read Republicans aren’t backing off a national abortion ban. That’s still very much on the table. The best way I can sum up the party’s platform is this: it’s all a lie. That’s my expectation going into the RNC, and you’ll see it play out in full-color next week. What we should watch is how the American public takes this all in while Democrats engage in a circular firing squad pointed at President Biden. Democrats took what should have been no more than a weekend story on the debate and turned it into a full-throated existential crisis within their own party. It’s an interesting twist going into this convention. What should have been a week focused on the Republican Party’s lies and the threat posed by their nominee will now only play out as a backdrop to what’s happening with the Democrats. "
"Weighing Biden’s 2024 fate, the Dems’ pendulum keeps swinging",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 9:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/weighing-joe-biden-2024-fate-democrats-election-rcna161152,"At roughly this point 24 hours ago, the Democratic Party’s 2024 pendulum appeared to have swung in President Joe Biden’s favor. Axios published a report with a headline that read, “Biden rebels in Congress see their revolt crumbling.” The article quoted one unnamed House Democrat who said, “As someone who wanted the reckoning and is really disappointed that it’s over, trust me: It’s over.” It’s not that congressional Democrats met behind closed doors and came to the conclusion that Biden was the party’s best and strongest choice for the November ballot. Rather, the members felt stuck: They don’t think the president can win re-election, but they also don't think he’ll quit. The result was an awkward dilemma for Democratic lawmakers: Either take the pressure campaign to an aggressive new level and hope Biden reverses course, or grudgingly fall in line and accept the status quo. At this point yesterday, a variety of Democratic members appeared to embrace the latter option. The president’s position had strengthened, at least in his own party, in ways that seemed difficult to predict a couple of days earlier. But the funny thing about pendulums is that they keep swinging. NBC News reported this morning: During an MSNBC appearance, the speaker emerita said, in reference to Biden, “It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.” Asked in the same interview if she wants the president to move forward with his re-election plans, Pelosi added, “I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that’s — that’s the way it is.” The significance of the comments was obvious: Biden has told Democrats that the discussion about his electoral future is over, while Pelosi left little doubt that the conversation remains ongoing. If the headline yesterday was that the party was prepared to move on, the former House speaker’s on-air comments — delivered on a program the president is known to watch — suggested otherwise. The California Democrat isn’t alone. Despite the incumbent president’s declarations, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey announced late yesterday that she wants Biden to stand aside for the good of the country. Around the same, Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic Senate nominee in New Jersey, expressed “concerns” about Biden’s candidacy, adding that he’s open to discussions about a new party nominee. A few hours later, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado appeared on CNN and said in no uncertain terms that he does not believe Biden can win a second term. This morning, Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan, who represents a competitive swing district in New York, also publicly called on Biden to forgo his re-election plans. In case that weren’t quite enough, The New York Times published an op-ed from actor George Clooney, who last month co-hosted the largest fundraising event ever for any Democratic candidate, and who now believes the president should stand down. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,” Clooney wrote. “Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw.” The actor added, “We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” I won’t pretend to know what’s likely to happen, but it’s clear that the debate that Biden tried to shut down isn’t over, and uncertainty about the near future reigns."

Ron DeSantis, on the other hand, will reportedly receive a speaking slot at the Republicans’ convention next week. [Updated with a new link.] * Gov. J.B. Pritzker remains a prominent Biden supporter, but when the Illinois Democrat was asked if he’d consider a national campaign in the event the president were to step down, Pritzker replied, “What I can tell you is I’m not engaging in hypotheticals.” * Despite the tumult in Democratic politics, Biden and his re-election team continue to focus on Trump and Project 2025. “Project 2025 will destroy America,” the incumbent president said in a video shared via social media this morning. “Look it up.” * In his campaign rally last night in Miami, Trump spent far more time than usual going after Vice President Kamala Harris — whose name he repeatedly mispronounced. Given the broader circumstances, the shift did not go unnoticed. * And while the political world waits for news about Trump’s new running mate, the former president told the NBC affiliate in Miami yesterday that Republican Sen. Marco Rubio “certainly will“ have a role in his prospective administration, even if the Florida senator isn’t the vice president."
ABC's George Stephanopoulos says he regrets Biden comment to passerby,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 8:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/george-stephanopoulos-biden-interview-comment-regret-rcna161094,"ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, who interviewed Joe Biden last week in a pivotal moment in the president's political career, was recorded telling a passerby on the street that he doesn't think Biden can serve another term in office. A video of the interaction, which TMZ published Tuesday, shows a person surreptitiously recording Stephanopoulos on a street in New York City as he approaches the veteran journalist and asks if he thinks Biden should step down. Stephanopoulos' voice is muddled in the audio, but he seems to say: ""I don't think he can serve four more years."" The comment was a remarkable slipup from Stephanopoulos, who just days earlier had landed a high-stakes interview with Biden as the octogenarian president struggled to quiet internal party opposition to his nomination. The interview was widely seen as a make-or-break moment for Biden following his lousy debate performance, but it did little to stem concerns about the president's age and fitness for office. Stephanopoulos later confirmed the encounter. “Earlier today I responded to a passerby. I shouldn’t have,” he said in a statement from ABC News. The network distanced itself from Stephanopoulos’ comment, saying the anchor “expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.” Stephanopoulos, who began his journalism career in the late 1990s after serving as White House communications director under President Bill Clinton, drew praise for gently but steadily pressing Biden last week on his mental acuity and chances at re-election. Biden has adamantly refused to step down from the Democratic presidential ticket. In a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, he dismissed calls for him to withdraw, telling his colleagues: “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it’s time for it to end.”"
Trump keeps emphasizing Jan. 6 lies as part of his 2024 pitch,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 8:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-election-jan-6-lies-part-2024-pitch-rcna161116,"At the presidential debate two weeks ago, Donald Trump lied uncontrollably about a great many things, but the Republican’s rhetoric about the Jan. 6 attack stood out for its detachment from reality. The former president claimed, for example, that there were a “small” number of rioters, which wasn’t true. He said the insurrectionists attacking the U.S. Capitol in his name were “ushered in” by police, which also wasn’t true. The presumptive GOP also said he offered 10,000 National Guard troops to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which wasn’t true, before claiming that Pelosi said, “I take full responsibility for January 6,” which is something the California Democrat never said. In case that wasn’t quite enough, at the same event, Trump said some of the imprisoned rioters are “so innocent,” which (a) isn’t true; and (b) is contradicted by the fact that many of the convicts pleaded guilty during their prosecutions. A New York Times report noted soon after that for many of the former president’s critics, Trump’s “embrace of Jan. 6 and his refusal to agree to unqualified acceptance of a democratic election” were worse than President Joe Biden’s unnerving performance on the same stage. “It’s a concerted effort to try to de-weaponize Jan. 6,” former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who served on the Jan. 6 committee, told the Times. “It’s part of creating this utter confusion where the average person is, like, ‘I know what I saw on Jan. 6, but maybe I didn’t see what I saw.’” Two weeks later, Trump is still at it — as we were reminded overnight at the former president’s rally in Miami. Reading from his teleprompter, the GOP candidate told his followers: If you watch the clip, note that the creepy music was played at the campaign event; it was not added afterward to make the remarks sound more ridiculous. To the extent that reality still has any meaning, the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol was not made up of “people who love our country” engaged in “protest”; to call incarcerated felons “hostages” is an insult to both the justice system and actual hostages; and while the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that will affect some Jan. 6 cases, the idea that convicted rioters and insurrectionists “should be out soon” is just plainly wrong. Nevertheless, Trump has referenced the ruling to call for the release of all Jan. 6 criminals and suspects. In other words, when it comes to Jan. 6, the former president still has no idea what he's talking about. Stepping back, Trump hasn’t exactly been subtle in recent months with his focus on Jan. 6 rioters, offering them praise, support and vows of future pardons. A recent Associated Press report noted that the former president has positioned “the violent siege and its failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House.” This coincided with a related Semafor report on the degree to which the Republican has put Jan. 6 rioters “at the heart of his campaign.” That report was published in March. It’s worse now. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Immunity Fallout,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 7:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-immunity-fallout-rcna161114,"As last week’s historic Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity continues to be absorbed in the public sphere, the majority’s expansive view of what is considered exempt from prosecution comes into stark relief. Given their unique perspectives, veteran prosecutors Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord explore the knock-on effects the ruling will have on Donald Trump’s ongoing cases in Florida, New York and D.C.  Listeners can send questions to: ProsecutingTrumpQuestions@nbcuni.com  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, welcome back to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday, July 9th. I’m Andrew Weissman, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Morning, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So, this is going to be -- Mary McCord: I said this could be such a chipper attitude, and I don’t really feel all that chipper, so okay, so I’m faking it. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, well, this is like a great way to be like, okay, you should really listen to this because it’s going to be a downer. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: How’s that for a tease? You know, I actually think what we have planned for today, I think is kind of great because we’re going to take the immunity decision that was issued last week and we’re going to talk about what the ramifications are for three of the trials where it’s so far come up. Mary McCord: And probably some listeners are saying, what is the fallout? What is the relevance to these other cases? But we’ll talk about newly filed motions by Mr. Trump and his legal team in the Mar-a-Lago case, talk a little bit more about something we raised last Tuesday. It was just, you know, hot off the presses on Tuesday that the sentencing in the Manhattan case has been postponed to allow briefing on the effect of the immunity decision. And then, of course, there’s the obvious question. What impact does this have on the January 6th case? Because things are now going back to Judge Chutkan here in the D.C. District Court. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, why don’t we take that in the order that you just said, which is we’ll talk about Florida, then New York, then D.C. So I’m going to ask you a question which I know the answer to, but I just think it’s a good sort of, as they say in Washington, level set. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So we’re all on the same page, which is some people could be saying to themselves quite naturally, and frankly, all of us would have said it before this opinion came out, which is, I don’t understand. Well, if the Supreme Court is deciding a case involving presidential immunity for a person taking actions while they are president, how in God’s green earth, a phrase that I use all the time, which people know is a euphemism for keeping this a PG program. Mary McCord: Clean. Andrew Weissmann: So how is it in God’s green earth that the decision’s even relevant to a case that is by definition happening after the person is president? Because remember, this case is about two types of charges, illegal retention of documents post-presidency. It was not taking them from the White House illegally. It wasn’t stealing them from the White House. It was about illegal retention post-presidency and obstruction of justice post-presidency. How could a decision involving presidential immunity have any relevance to the Mar-a-Lago case? And frankly, before the decision came out, I think you and I, what’s the right phrase? Blew it. Because we thought, well, of course the decision won’t be relevant to that. And we also thought it wouldn’t really be relevant to New York. And we’ll talk about New York in a moment. But how is it that this decision from the Supreme Court is suddenly relevant and in fact does raise issues that Judge Cannon will have to deal with? Mary McCord: Well, I guess I would not assume it’s relevant. I say Donald Trump’s team is arguing that Judge Cannon should stay everything, meaning stop the presses, stop all of the motions hearings and motions due dates that includes the CIPA litigation, Classified Information Procedures Act. That includes briefing on other motions, designating experts. Mr. Trump’s team is saying stop everything and let us brief the impact of the immunity decision on this pending case, and I want to get into what they’re arguing about. But to your point about people asking how on God’s green earth could this be relevant, I would note that counts 1 through 32, right, which are about illegally retaining national defense information and failing to turn them over to the FBI and federal agents who sought them and were entitled to receive them, the date of each offense begins January 20th, 2021, which as of noon, Mr. Trump was no longer the president through the time period when that document was eventually obtained by the government. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: The obstruction counts, you know -- Andrew Weissmann: Way later. Yeah. Mary McCord: -- are way later, right. So there’s nothing charged that is even charged from the period of time that Mr. Trump was president. Andrew Weissmann: So what’s the argument? What language in the Supreme Court case are they relying on that makes this at least potentially relevant? And then I’m going to flag a couple of things, which I do think raise evidentiary issues. But why is this decision suddenly something that the defense can’t raise as a potential issue? Mary McCord: Yes. So, first of all, the motion for a stay has very, very little in the way of legal analysis or argument about how the presidential immunity decision actually applies here. That’s what they’re asking for supplemental briefing on. But just to go back to that decision, recall, this is where the Supreme Court said, look, when you are prosecuting a former president of the United States, he is not immune from prosecution from purely personal or what they call unofficial acts. He is absolutely immune for exercising core constitutional powers and they take an extremely expansive view of what those core constitutional powers are and that’s something we’ll come back to later in the episode because it actually has consequences, I think, beyond just criminal immunity from criminal prosecution. But, you know, classically, we think of those core powers as the powers that are in the Constitution, the power of a pardon, the power of a veto, the power of appointing ambassadors. The Supreme Court takes a broader view, at least according to the opinion of what are core powers. So there’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for the exercise of those core constitutional powers. And then there’s this middle area, which are actions within the outer perimeter of a president’s official acts. And those are things that are something that’s not part of his core responsibilities, but nevertheless relates to official acts. And that is something where the Supreme Court has said there is immunity for that and we’re not going to decide now whether it’s absolute or whether it’s presumptive. But we can let this case go back to Judge Chutkan for her decide, in the first instance, whether certain things in the indictment are official or unofficial. And even if official in that middle category where there’s not absolute immunity, decide whether the government can rebut this presumption by showing that a criminal prosecution would have no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch. Okay, so all that basic stuff still doesn’t answer your question. Andrew Weissmann: So that’s that sort of tripartite framework where there’s sort of official versus unofficial. And with the unofficial, there’s core, which is absolute, and other outer perimeter where it’s not clear. We’re clearly impersonal. Mary McCord: Post-presidential conduct. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. When you’re dealing with Mar-a-Lago, we are clearly in the different buckets. What I was hearing is we’re in the unofficial. And so what’s the answer? Mary McCord: Yes. So that the real zinger here, in fact, the place where Justice Barrett dissented from the majority is the majority -- Andrew Weissmann: So it became 5-4 -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- on this issue that we’re about to talk about, it’s not 6-3, it’s 5-4. Mary McCord: That’s right. With Justice Barrett joining the three dissenters. This is where the -- Andrew Weissmann: The men versus the women. Mary McCord: You’re right. The men versus the women. Okay, we’re going to come back to that another day. And this is where the majority, except for Justice Barrett, held that the government may not introduce evidence concerning official acts, even just as proof of the criminality of purely unofficial acts. So in other words, you got personal -- Andrew Weissmann: And why is that? Why? Mary McCord: Well, in their view -- Andrew Weissmann: What does the court say? Mary McCord: Yeah. This entire majority opinion is permeated from the beginning, including the expansive view of core constitutional powers through the concluding sentence with this notion that the president needs to be so protected in everything he ever does, anyone he ever talks to, so that he can be bold and fearless in taking action as the president without worrying about successor presidents prosecuting him. Now, they could have taken the opposite tactic, which is abiding by the law, particularly the criminal law, is an important thing for presidents to do. And they should be reined in from violating the criminal law by knowing that they’re not immune. They could have taken the opposite view, but their entire opinion is permeated with this notion of bold and fearless presidential action. And so in their opinion, it seems, although I would say that they’re vague on this, it would be far too disruptive to a president’s exercise of his executive powers if he was worried that his conversations with others within the White House and his actions would be probed, even if it’s just for use as evidence in a prosecution for unofficial or purely personal acts. It’s very much hamstringing a prosecution, even for personal acts, because it means, as Justice Barrett pointed out, bribery is a personal act. You could have the promise of an ambassadorship in return for money, and you would not be able, in the majority opinion, to delve into the conversations about that quid pro quo. You could put on evidence of the ambassadorship, public records, somebody got one, and some kind of evidence about the receipt of something by the president, if it were public, but you couldn’t dive into conversations that took place. And that’s really hamstringing the government. But even still, why does that matter for Mar-a-Lago? I know you’ve asked me this. I’ve not answered it. Basically, what they’re saying in one paragraph is, I mean, they don’t point out what those official acts would be, but they’re saying, you need to give us time to brief, Judge Cannon, how things that are being charged in this Mar-a-Lago indictment, all things after Mr. Trump was no longer president, still might be impacted by this ruling because of things that are relevant to when he was the president. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, essentially, the court created an evidentiary rule that says that, yes, you can prosecute for personal, what they call, as you said, Mary, unofficial acts. So you shoot somebody after you left the presidency or you illegally retain classified documents or national defense information and obstruct justice all post-presidency. That’s all unofficial. But they said you can’t use any evidence of official conduct to the extent that that would help you prove the case. So for instance, if the president had made comments in his official capacity to advisors saying this is what he intended to do -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- those admissions wouldn’t be able to be used if they were made in official conduct. So they essentially are doing something that I thought it was certainly ill-conceived. It was terribly articulated in terms of the justification. It’s like a paragraph that just says, oh, of course you can’t do this. And Justice Barrett, as you said, really takes them to task, but they essentially create a speech and debate clause provision for this. So in the speech and debate clause, the Constitution says that when you’re members of Congress and you’re debating and speaking about something on the floor of Congress, it’s actually been interpreted to be even broader than that. But that material, what you say, you can’t be charged with it and it can’t be used in any way. But what’s crazy to me is that the Constitution explicitly provides that. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So here’s the Supreme Court, the so-called originalist Supreme Court deciding, oh, we’re just going to create another speech and debate clause, but this time for the presidency, where it’s obvious that the framers knew how to create this kind of evidentiary rule in the speech and debate clause, and they didn’t do it with respect to the presidency. But that is the real issue for Judge Cannon. And the reason I think there is at least an evidentiary issue, I don’t think it should preclude the prosecution at all, but this decision, the five justices who say you can’t use evidence, is that if you look just at the indictment in this case, the indictment in the Mar-a-Lago case in a whole series, I counted them in six paragraphs of the indictment, there are references to statements that Donald Trump made not as a candidate pre-presidency, but while he was president. And so those materials seem pretty clear that there’s a very good argument that those are statements that the president made in his official capacity. And so I think that there will be arguments about that is no longer something that would be admissible. But that’s an evidentiary issue. That’s something down the road that, yes, they can make motions now to say they should be precluded or you should be able to strike certain parts of the indictment as surplusage or inadmissible. So I think that -- Mary McCord: I mean, what they say they want is they want the same kind of fact-bound hearing that Judge Chutkan is going to have to go through to sort of -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- separate official from unofficial. Andrew Weissmann: But I do think there are some things in the indictment, for instance, paragraph 20, if people want to sort of follow along, which relate to things that Donald Trump said or did while he was president that would help prove the case so that -- Mary McCord: Well, let’s just say what that is. That is kind of giving background about, I think, really trying to show that when president, Mr. Trump was well aware of -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- what classified information was, what national defense information was. That paragraph 20 says as part of his official duties as president, Trump received intelligence briefings from high-level U.S. government officials, including the director of the CIA, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, et cetera. He regularly received a collection of classified intelligence from the U.S. intelligence community, noted as the president’s daily brief., right? So to your point, this is really all background kind of context to show, again, his knowledge, right, of classified information -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- the importance that it be kept close hold. But that is important to proving up his knowledge that he was not authorized to have classified information or national defense information at Mar-a-Lago after he was no longer president. So that is where I think, you know, you’re right that there will be some things there that they’ll make arguments about. Andrew Weissmann: But, Mary, doesn’t it strike you, just taking that example of paragraph 20, it’s like an exhibit to how insane -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- the Supreme Court position is and why I thought it was very important for Justice Barrett to dissent on that point -- Mary McCord: Yes, absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: -- because to say that this is really, just makes no sense whatsoever. And how are you possibly infringing on the vigorous presidency by introducing evidence that he would know what is classified and the importance of classified information? I mean, that doesn’t interfere in any way. But they didn’t, you know, you would hope that they would have said it’s a balancing or that that there’d be more to this than simply the court saying, you know, the majority basically is like black and white. Mary McCord: But so actually, I will disagree with you on that, Andrew, because I think that it is basically public knowledge and public record. It is probably said by his own press person multiple times. The president receives a daily brief from his intelligence community. So I think that is admissible because what Justice Roberts said in that footnote is public records can come in. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I agree that there’s a way around it. I mean, in other words, if the information that just, you know, Mary, just so our listeners know, Justice Roberts has this footnote saying, well, of course, if something is public, then that could be used. So a way to deal with this, what I’ll call paragraph 20 problem, and that’s just an illustration, is if it turns out that that information has also been made public, then the government can try and use the Justice Roberts footnote about this being public. But if it hasn’t been, it’s really unclear that they’re going to be able to find something in the majority, which is so poorly reasoned, that’s going to allow this to come in. And of course, Judge Cannon is not going to be reading the Supreme Court decision in a way favorable to Jack Smith, to state the obvious. Mary McCord: Yeah. So, a couple of last points before we take a break and move on. Again, there’s very short motion for a stay and the judge is not even going to rule on it yet. She’s set a schedule for Jack Smith to respond and then there’d be a reply again just to try to decide whether to stay the case for then a more full supplemental briefing. So it’s like briefing to talk about briefing. But they’ve thrown a few other things out there with almost no explanation. One is that they say the presidential immunity questions implicate important presidential powers discussed in the Supreme Court case, such as foreign relations responsibilities, meeting foreign leaders, overseeing international diplomacy and intelligence gathering, matters related to terrorism, et cetera. How they’re going to connect that up exactly with Trump’s post-president conduct, I don’t know. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: The other thing they do, and I think we previewed this last week, is say, oh, and also regarding the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, Justice Thomas has written a concurrence where he calls very much into question the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith under the appointments clause of the Constitution and the court should take that into consideration in ruling on the outstanding motion to dismiss based on this appointments clause issue. So they’re throwing, you know, kind of like spaghetti at the wall here in this motion. And we’ll see what ends up getting fully briefed if the court grants the motion to stay. And she’s already sort of partially granted it. She’s stayed a bunch of immediate deadlines -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- but hasn’t granted a full stay. Andrew Weissmann: So just to be clear, Mary, what you’re saying is Donald Trump has said in light of this decision, there should be further briefing and the case should be stayed. And the court said, okay, I’m setting up a briefing schedule on the motion for a stay. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So we’re having briefing to decide whether it should be a stay. And in the interim, I’m staying a whole bunch of obligations that the defense has to do things. So she, in effect, has granted a partial stay. This is all a way of saying this case, we knew this before -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- the Supreme Court decision that it was never going to go to trial. But this basically was talk about sand in the gears. This is like a beach full of sand being dumped into the gears of the Mar-a-Lago case. And there’s no way this is going forward. And this is a perfect segue to talking about screwing up a case that we’re going to take a break, but we’ll come back and talk about the New York case because there you’d think, okay, we’re talking about unofficial acts, which is clearly not done as the president. And yet, Justice Alito, in my view, because he’s sort of articulated this view during the oral argument, has figured out a way to gum up this case as well, even though there was a unanimous jury verdict on this case. So let’s take a break and we’ll come back and talk about the pernicious nature of the, again, this evidentiary piece of the Supreme Court ruling. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, let’s shift north from Florida to Manhattan. Although I don’t know, I think it’s been just as hot in Manhattan as it has been in Florida for the last week. It certainly has been just as hot here in Washington, D.C. This seems to be like a full week worth of upper 90s and it’s absolutely horrible outside. But anyway, other horrible things happening. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, other hot things that are happening. Mary McCord: And I’m realizing we did talk last week because it had just happened about Mr. Trump’s request to postpone the sentencing, which otherwise would have been two days from today. It would have been this Thursday, to postpone that sentencing in order to brief what impact, if any, the Supreme Court decision has on the Manhattan case. And so I am looking back at Judge Merchan’s letter to counsel and realizing that tomorrow is the day for Mr. Trump’s team to actually file their more fulsome motion. So next week we’ll be able to talk in more detail about what they’re arguing. But I think we can guess about some of those arguments right now. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And then there’s two weeks for this state to respond. And then the judge has put the sentencing or next appearance, he said, for September 18th. And he says that’s for sentencing if necessary or other proceeding, meaning he may have a factual hearing. So we have to see what’s going to happen on the 18th. Mary McCord: Well, hang on. Don’t forget that he also said he will make a decision on the 6th, September 6th. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: Without it being in court -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- we’ll have to be in court. So we will know on the 6th -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- what will be happening on the 18th. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And I’ll talk for a moment about why I think the 18th is actually smart. I don’t know if it was intentional, but I know an effect of it, is that by putting it off to the 18th of September, I don’t know if this was intentional or not, but it does make it harder for Donald Trump to get back to the Supreme Court. If your view is that the Supreme Court has basically thrown out law here and is just looking to do whatever it can to hurt these prosecutions. By deciding this on the 18th of September, it makes it pretty hard, not impossible, but pretty hard because the normal rule, but see, this case doesn’t seem to follow any normal rules if you’re Donald Trump, but the Supreme Court is that you have to appeal things within the New York system and then go to the Supreme Court if they would even take the case. So by doing this on September 18th, it does sort of shorten that ability of Donald Trump to have that relief. Mary McCord: Although just to remind listeners, the Supreme Court doesn’t start sitting until the first Monday in October. So even if somehow this decision was being made this week and sped through the New York courts of appeals, the fastest that the Supreme Court would ever be able to take things still wouldn’t be until October. Andrew Weissmann: Presumably. Mary McCord: Yeah. They don’t have to do it that way -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- but it’s exceedingly rare that they don’t sit starting the first Monday in October. Andrew Weissmann: Well, right, as a group, but they do have -- Mary McCord: Motions. That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: They still do hear motions. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. For instance in death -- Mary McCord: Think about things like death penalty. We both -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So I think by the terms of the (ph) death penalty litigation, I’d done it on the defense side. And so the court’s always open for that. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Just like in Mar-a-Lago, people are probably thinking, how’s this relevant? It is clear that the charges here are unofficial. Paying money to a porn star or reimbursing the money to a porn star so that information doesn’t come out that would hurt your candidacy is just not going to be viewed as presidential activity. But just like Mar-a-Lago, the issue is whether any official acts of the president came into the case when they shouldn’t have. And whether there is sort of, one, this decision, whether it’s retroactive and whether it should apply to this case that that happened before the decision came out, that’s one issue. There’s an issue of waiver. But before we get to that, the question is, what is the argument for any official conduct that came into the case? And there are certain tweets that were offered. There are certain forms, a form that was filed by President Trump while he was president that came in. But I think all of that sort of embroidery. But the critical piece is that Hope Hicks, when she testified, she testified to lots and lots of information as a candidate. And that’s going to be very hard to argue that that is in any way covered. This was before Donald Trump ever became president. So that’s just not going to be a problem. But she did testify about conversations with Donald Trump in 2018 when the Stormy Daniels story surfaced publicly. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And she said, I had conversations and the conversations weren’t just with Michael Cohen, they were with Donald Trump. And she said -- Mary McCord: I can read it. Andrew Weissmann: -- that in 2000 -- Mary McCord: I have it up. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, I like it. Okay, because there are two key pieces. Mary McCord: Yeah. She said he, meaning Mr. Trump, wanted to know how it was playing and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story, a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment. And I think Mr. Trump’s opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. That was actually the very last testimony she gave in her direct — Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- examination, before cross-examination. Andrew Weissmann: And then she cried. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Before that piece, Mary, I don’t know if you have that up also. Donald Trump says to her, according to her testimony, that Michael Cohen made the payments to Stormy Daniels on his own without telling anyone. And she is asked, essentially, is that consistent with how you understood Michael Cohen would behave? And she says, no, he essentially is not a sort of I’m happy to do something out of the goodness of my heart. The import being that she didn’t believe Donald Trump when he said that Michael Cohen did this on his own. So those two pieces that Michael Cohen did it on his own and -- Mary McCord: Out of the kindness of his heart is what she said -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- that the Trump told her that he spoke to Michael. Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation and that, you know, Michael felt like it was his job to protect him and that’s what he was doing and he did it out of the kindness of his own heart. That was her testimony. Andrew Weissmann: Just to be clear, that sort of exculpatory testimony. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So it’s sort of hard for Donald Trump to complain about it. But the problem is that she then said words to the effect of I didn’t believe a word of it. I mean, she didn’t say it that way. Mary McCord: Yeah. I would say that would be out of character for Michael is what she said. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: He was not a charitable person or a selfless person. Andrew Weissmann: Right. So those two pieces, I think, will be the linchpin of what Donald Trump argues. And as we said, the other point is that, by the way, on that is that the state correctly, when they argued this to the jury in summation, pointed this out to the jury and said this was devastating evidence from Hope Hicks, who had no reason to fabricate this story. She was aligned with the and still very much aligned with the president. You can tell that it hurt her to give this testimony. So they will point to that as undermining the case. But as we said, there are lots of issues and we’ll see how this state responds to it. Mary McCord: It’s important. Listeners may still be thinking, how is that conversation an official act of the president, right? Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah. Mary McCord: And I think it’s important. You know, the test that the Supreme Court set forth to the extent they provided guidance and really didn’t provide a heck of a lot, isn’t if you do anything while you happen to be sitting in the Oval Office or during the four years that you are president, anything you do is official. It’s not that. And so it’s really got to be this looking, this inquiry and this is why they’re sending different things back to Judge Chutkan to evaluate from the January 6th case things that Mr. Trump did while he was president. Were those official or unofficial? So here the question isn’t, is it just official because he’s talking to his White House communications director? That’s not the answer to the question. That’s the starting point. Certainly, part of a president’s official conduct is to have a communications director for the White House. But the discussions here are purely about his reaction to a story breaking about purely personal activity while he’s president and his opinion that, hey, better that it broke now after I’m already the president than it broke before, you know, while I was a candidate, right, before the election. So I think there is certainly an argument that that discussion is purely personal. And it doesn’t matter that it happened to be that he was talking to his White House communications director. That’s at least a side of it. And this is where we’ll have to see. This is exactly why Mr. Trump’s attorneys want to brief this. I expect these will be issues that both sides are briefing and Judge Merchan will have to make a decision. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I think the other piece, which is that Cohen did this on his own, the argument’s going to be that the then president was speaking to his communications director. And even though it’s a lie, it’s a way of saying this is how he wants to spin this. This is how he wants to deal with it publicly. And this is where, again, the perniciousness of the majority opinion here is how expansively they view the official acts of a president, where they sort of go on and on about that. For instance, they say that a president can talk about sort of news of the day or things that he doesn’t have a role in that he wants to weigh in on. Mary McCord: He can use his bully pulpit. They explicitly refer to that. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So they have a very expansive view. And so you could imagine, let’s just take a hypothetical. Let’s assume there was a fake allegation of sexual misconduct that came up before the president was president. And the president talked to his communications director about how are we going to deal with this because it’s going to hurt me as president and I need to respond. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And I want to deny it. And so I want to say something about it. Even though what’s coming up is personal, it’s an allegation about something I did personally before I was president, but it’s going to be relevant to the voters to know whether I did this and what happened. So I need to have conversations in my official capacity with my official communications director. So all of that I think is going to allow a Justice Alito to sort of be looking at trying to look at everything through that lens of an expansive view. I think we’ve sort of narrowed and focused everybody on this podcast to the sort of critical information and sort of what the arguments are going to be on both sides. Mary McCord: Yeah. And I think the last thought before break is just, okay, so what? So suppose Judge Merchan says, yes, that’s official acts and it shouldn’t have come in. Where does that leave us? Then the assessment is, if this was err to have this admitted into evidence, is that err harmless and therefore the conviction can stand? Or was that err material to the verdict and there needs to be a new trial? And even constitutional errors can be harmless. And in fact, courts of appeals find errors to be harmless all the time. And even constitutional errors can be harmless under a standard if they’re harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. What we’re not going to get into today is there are also various arguments here about this not only being waived, but also not being objected to during trial, which would mean an easier standard, sort of, of harmlessness. But there are also arguments on the other side of that, like, well, how did they know because they didn’t have the presidential immunity decision yet with this expansive reading of official acts, so how could they have objected? There are various arguments on both sides, which we’ll have to probably discuss after we see the briefing, I think. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So one of the things that waiver is going to be a really big issue. And there was this very belated motion that Donald Trump made. If you remember, the trial was originally going to start in March and two weeks before the trial, Donald Trump made this belated motion where he raised a lot of these issues -- Mary McCord: He raised immunity. Andrew Weissmann: -- and he raised the immunity and sort of along the lines of sort of the Hope Hicks stuff, although not by name -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- saying, you know, conversations with White House staffers and he sort of raised this issue. And the court said -- Mary McCord: Too late. Andrew Weissmann: -- too late, and by the way, Mary, you and I have been in that situation, which is like, you know, there are deadlines -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and sometimes there’s a little leeway. But two weeks before the trial -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- when things had been briefed months and months beforehand. And so the judge had said this was too late. And so I think there’ll be a lot of stress on whether this is waived. And that would avoid if there is a strong argument for waiver, meaning you should have raised it earlier, then that sort of avoids this contretemps of the sort of what I’ll call the expansive Justice Alito view and whether there’s a way to read it in a more narrow way. So with that, should we now turn to after the break to Judge Chutkan where it raises both the issue that we’ve been talking about whether there is official conduct that would be used, but also this whole issue of what parts of the indictment are official versus unofficial. It raises not just the things that we’ve been talking about, but sort of the core issues going back to Mary, what you talked about, about Judge Chutkan has to decide what parts of the case can even proceed because they involve unofficial conduct, or whether it’s official conduct where there’s a sufficient rebuttal of the presumption of immunity. So there’s a lot before Judge Chutkan. We’ll turn to that in a moment. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: All right, welcome back. So we want to spend a little bit of time talking about what Judge Chutkan is supposed to do with this mess right now. And there is some guidance that the Supreme Court gave. There is a little bit of a roadmap of at least what is in front of her and what’s not. So thing one, remember, we talked about core constitutional powers, absolutely immune. This is where the Supreme Court itself said the President’s communications with his acting Attorney General and others in the Justice Department about investigating purported election fraud are within the conclusive and preclusive executive powers to investigate and prosecute crime. So therefore, those things he has absolute immunity for. As you remember, the indictment talks about that pressure on the acting Attorney General to put out statements publicly saying we’re investigating. That’s off limits. So, too, was his threatened removal of the acting Attorney General because, as the Supreme Court held, the power to remove executive officers is a presidential power. So that’s immune. So that’s something she actually doesn’t have to have a hearing about because that is absolute immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Can I just be triggered for one moment? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: That includes commencing investigations that are shams. Mary McCord: Yes. And that’s part of the fallout, right? That decision right there means basically a president can weaponize the Department of Justice and be immune from criminal prosecution for doing that. Andrew Weissmann: And by weaponize, it’s not, oh, you should prosecute enemies. It’s you can prosecute enemies with sham investigations. Mary McCord: Yes, that’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And that’s where the sham part is in the majority decision. They recognize the indictment here is about Jeffrey Clark proposing sham investigations. Mary McCord: Sham investigations. Andrew Weissmann: And they say that is absolutely immune. I cannot stress enough how dangerous that holding is. Mary McCord: Yes. And that’s one where, you know, the ramifications. And again, this would also apply not just to the DOJ, because if the idea is that, you know, as the president, you are the chief of the executive branch, that means you could see the same thing with directing the IRS to launch sham investigations, right? You could see directing any regulatory agency to engage in sham investigations. It all seems, based on this opinion, to be immune. Andrew Weissmann: Don’t get me started. Save it. Mary McCord: We’re going to go down Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: So anyway, I definitely digressed. Mary McCord: Yes. So that Judge Chutkan doesn’t have to assess that because they’ve made that decision with respect to that part of the indictment. So you remember the other part of the indictment talks about the pressure on Mike Pence, right? The pressure on Mike Pence, including up through the president’s comments, the former president’s comments on January 6th at the Ellipse, right? If Mike Pence has the courage to do what needs to be done, we will be okay. And that pressure was to either refuse to count the electoral ballots from the swing states at all or count the fraudulent slates of electors. And so what the court says there is that when the president and the vice president are both talking about official responsibilities with each other, that’s within the outer perimeter of official acts. The reason it’s not core constitutional is because when the vice president is acting in his role as the president of the Senate, not in his role as the vice president of the, you know, country and over the executive branch, that role as vice president of the Senate is a legislative role to open and count the electoral votes and that’s not something that is part of the president’s core constitutional powers. So they’re both doing official things. And so it’s within the outer perimeter of the official acts. So what the Supreme Court says is, therefore, it is entitled to at least presumptive immunity. So the job of Judge Chutkan on remand is to determine whether the government can make a showing that prosecution based on that pressure on Mike Pence poses no danger to the authority or functions of the executive branch after receiving briefing from the parties. So this -- Andrew Weissmann: By the way, that test that you just articulated, no danger, little esoteric note. There’s no balancing. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s just no danger. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And people might be thinking, where does that test come from? It comes from a case involving President Nixon. Mary McCord: Absent the word no. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And so that case involved balancing. It was involved the danger to the presidency and weighing that against the public interest. Mary McCord: The demonstrable need for evidence. Andrew Weissmann: Right. And it could come out the other way, such as in the Nixon case. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Here, they lop off -- Mary McCord: The other half of the balance. Andrew Weissmann: -- the other part, and they say not just the danger, but you have to show there’s no danger. Mary McCord: No danger. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, talk about there so clearly was a voice that wanted to say, you know what, we actually think there should just be absolute immunity. But instead, we’re going to say maybe that’s still on the table. But even if there’s just presumptive immunity, the test for overcoming that presumption, it’s a little like the Wizard of Oz saying, come back with the witch’s broomstick. Mary McCord: Yeah. Really hard to get. Andrew Weissmann: Where, you know, the idea was like, you’re never going to be able to do it. Mary McCord: But she did. Andrew Weissmann: That’s because it’s a movie. Mary McCord: It’s a movie. Okay. So then people are thinking, what about the other allegations in the indictment? So what the Supreme Court says about that is that the court will have to determine whether the acts that form the basis of the charges are official or unofficial without inquiring into the president’s motives behind those things. So for the category of communications with state officials, right, pressure on state legislators to send up different slates of electors, communications involving the fraudulent electors, the majority says this requires a fact specific assessment of the numerous alleged interactions with these various people to determine whether this is within the outer perimeter of the president’s official acts or not. The court does acknowledge that the president has no authority over what slates of electors the states will send up. That is committed by the Constitution to the states. They acknowledge that, but still, they say, yeah, presidents, though, they get to talk to state legislatures about things like election integrity and they get to talk, you know, with electors about things like that. So they’re leaving that open. Now, notably, this is another area where Justice Barrett in her partial concurrence, partial dissent says, I disagree. In my mind, that is not a hard case. The alleged participation in concocting the fraudulent elector scheme is personal and unofficial. And I would have said so, you know, as part of the majority. Again, that’s her concurrence. That does not have five votes behind it. But she at least is saying, I break from the majority, which is unwilling to answer the question here. They’re sending it back to Judge Chutkan. I would have answered the question. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So what’s so interesting here is, so again, with respect to the fake electors, it’s really 5-4, not 6-3. And she said, I would answer the question that fake electors and she says in this wonderful footnote, she says, sometimes it can be hard to separate official from unofficial. And she goes, and sometimes not. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Then she goes with respect to fake electors, not hard. He has no role. Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: She says there is no argument for it. My view of this is one of the reasons that I think that you don’t have in the majority a single example of what is definitively unofficial conduct in the indictment, is if they had managed to get a fifth vote. In other words, if it wasn’t 5-4, but had been 5-4 the other way -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- where somebody joined the Barrett view with respect to, let’s say, fake electors, that would have allowed Jack Smith to slim to win. In other words -- Mary McCord: He narrowed the indictment down to just that. Andrew Weissmann: He said, okay, there are five justices who say that’s unofficial conduct, fine. Mary McCord: That’s what I’ll do. Andrew Weissmann: I’m going to just go forward on fake electors. Let’s go. Mary McCord: Yep. Andrew Weissmann: But this way, by not having that definitive ruling, it means that Judge Chutkan, let’s say she agrees with Justice Barrett that fake electors is clearly not official conduct. She rules that way. But Donald Trump gets to take it back to the Supreme Court pre-trial. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Meaning that not only did they wait to issue this until the very last day of the term, but they basically, by not saying anything, giving an example of anything that is absolutely unofficial, they guaranteed that it would have to come back to them, meaning it would never go to trial. And by the way, you want to know why my cynical view is correct? Let me just give you one more example. One of my favorite parts of this decision is when Justice Roberts says, given the importance of this case, that’s why we expedited it. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: He says we expedited hearing this and he doesn’t address at all that they could have taken the case in December and that they could have decided the case even if they didn’t take it in December on the same sort of expedited time frame as the disqualification decision. I mean, it is such a whopper. That’s the technical legal term. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: That he would say that this was expedited and it’s so hard that to me -- Mary McCord: He actually goes on and on and on about how expedited the briefing was and how little factual development and, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Crazy. So that to me is such a great little example that tells you and illustrates for you what’s going on here, because like you can start with that and it’s a lens through which you can see the rest of the case. Mary McCord: Yeah, that’s true. Okay, last category that the Supreme Court talked about last category of charged conduct in the indictment relates to Trump’s tweets and the public address on January 6th and how that impacted the rioters and the attack on the Capitol. And there the Supreme Court says, again, we’re sending this back to Judge Chutkan to decide what’s official and unofficial, but does note the majority notes most communications are likely to fall within the outer perimeter of official acts because of the presidential power of the bully pulpit. But there may be context when the president speaks in an unofficial capacity, perhaps as a candidate or as a party leader. So that fact specific analysis is necessary. And Judge Chutkan, this is now your problem. And again, what they’re saying there, and this actually something that they kind of pulled from one of the civil cases against Mr. Trump brought by Capitol police officers and House members who were injured in some cases by the rioters. In that case, the D.C. Circuit talked about using some sort of a test to determine whether Trump’s comments were made as a candidate, which are purely personal, or as president, which could be official. So here that’s going back to Judge Chutkan to for that analysis. So she’s got a lot on her plate, but they did break things up into different categories. And now we will be seeing the setting, I think, of a briefing schedule coming up here and then hearings, some of which may involve evidence, because in some of these things, the Supreme Court said this is going to be fact specific. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So that raises my sort of like, it’s hard to say silver lining because it’s silver lining within this case, but they still have this horrendous Supreme Court decision out there in terms of the power of the presidency that is so untethered to how we view the role of the president in a democracy. But there is this ability for a factual hearing before the general election on the issues, Mary, that you outlined, whether it has to do with the conversations with the vice president and the rebuttal of that, or whether it’s on the other aspects of the sort of official versus unofficial components of the other aspects of the indictment. One question I have for you, Mary, is, and I’ll be interested in your view, is one of the things that the government could do because there’s so many parts of this decision that are poorly reasoned and also are sort of ambiguous, even things that we haven’t talked about yet, is the idea of going back to the Supreme Court and seek re-argument. Mary McCord: This is my theory that I floated over the weekend with you, that under Rule 44, they could ask the court to rehear the case and Jack Smith could try to make some of the points that, you know, so many commentators and legal experts and constitutional experts have been making about the scope of this ruling and how it calls into question not just criminal prosecutions but Congress’s authority to legislate in areas that are part of the president’s core executive functions, Congress’s ability to conduct oversight over things that this court would say are within the core constitutional functions of the president, because the rationale that the chief justice used was not limited to criminal prosecution. He was saying, in certain areas, the president’s functions are conclusive and preclusive, meaning precluding Congress from acting, precluding judges from examining. And so it would be a chance on the public record to really make the arguments about how expansive this is and how damaging it is and how well beyond the necessity for ruling in this case some of these comments were. And it would also, if he wanted to do it, could be a chance for Jack Smith to say, look, our position is in agreement with the dissenters. But, you know, we could live with Justice Barrett’s conclusion here. And we urge the court to, essentially, members of the court to agree with that conclusion, even if not with her entire opinion. Now, that’s kind of a wacky thing. But if you imagine what she said, as we’ve been discussing today, would allow Jack Smith to move forward. He could slim down his indictment. It would allow him to use evidence of official acts as proof of knowledge and intent and motive for unofficial acts. And it certainly is a lot better than where we’re at right now with this majority opinion. So even though the dissenters would have to give up something to join with that and someone would have to come over from the majority. And it’s hard for me to imagine who that would be, because the person I would have thought most likely is the chief justice himself. And he’s the one who wrote the opinion. So I don’t know. It’s a super, super long shot, but there is some value to my mind of actually having a filed government position on this opinion. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I mean, I don’t know that I would do it. I think it’s in part because I think it would lead to a continued stay of the district court case so you wouldn’t have any proceedings going forward. I think if it weren’t for that, I’m not sure I see a downside. I think there’s like, you know, maybe a 1 percent chance. But if you didn’t have that issue of whether you could have a hearing, my view would be sort of if you have a 1 percent chance, it’s better than a zero percent chance if you don’t move. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But there is this big downside. I did want to quickly address two related questions that we have from listeners. By the way, these questions are so great. Just, you know, beforehand, we were reading a bunch of questions talking about how wonderful they are. So thank you very much to the listeners. But one was about immunity and impeachment. And it was how does this immunity decision affect the ability to impeach a president for high crimes and misdemeanors if the president is immune? Another is really similar, which is about immunity and the Mar-a-Lago case where there is this issue of crime fraud. If you remember, the Beryl Howell in D.C. had said that the government could get information from lawyers because it was part of the crime fraud exception. How does this Supreme Court decision affect that? And I think there are a lot of answers to that. But one big picture is because the Supreme Court decision was framed in terms of immunity, it wasn’t saying that the conduct is legal. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It wasn’t saying that Congress didn’t have the power to criminalize things. So you can still have a high crime and misdemeanor. You can still have a crime fraud exception. This decision was about whether there would be immunity from a criminal prosecution. And obviously, an impeachment is not a criminal prosecution, nor is the court saying that this is not a crime. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s just saying the president could be immune in certain circumstances. The same thing for the crime fraud exception. It still is a crime. But those are great questions. By the way, I really feel like we should be getting CLE credit for everyone who’s listening. CLE is an acronym for Continuing Legal Education, which is an obligation that lawyers have to, even after they graduate from law school, to continue learning. And they have to get a certain number of credits every year to keep yourself current on the law. So I feel like we should be doing that for this podcast, even for all of the non-lawyers out there. Mary McCord: Good idea. Yeah, good idea. Andrew Weissmann: And I think we’ve managed to stay relatively calm, which is kind of amazing given the Supreme Court decision that we’re talking about, which, you know, is in my lifetime, one of the worst decisions I can possibly think of. And I don’t want to make this political, but it does mean that it’s really important that you have a president who understands the dangers of using all of those powers in the same way that you would take the pardon power, that you need a president who isn’t going to abuse that power. Mary McCord: Yeah. And, you know, that leads to one other listener question, which is kind of like, what are things that President Biden could now be doing in light of this opinion? But I am sorry, I am never going to advocate for a president to abuse his powers because he knows he’s likely to be immune from criminal prosecution. And I understand the inclination to say, okay, maybe he should weaponize things or he should do this or that. But I mean, then we have really abandoned, you know, the rule of law, in my opinion. And unfortunately, the Supreme Court’s decision does give a lot of leeway, a huge lot of leeway to somebody who comes into that office who does not believe in rule of law, who is corrupt and who wants to break the law with impunity, as the dissenters eloquently said in this case. So on that, now we’re back to a depressing note. We should probably wrap it up before it gets any worse. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So again, a pleasure to talk to you, Mary. There’s going to be a lot to talk about as we previewed with respect to filings that are going to be made in these various cases to see essentially how our predictions play out. Mary McCord: We’ll do this next week then. Andrew Weissmann: Thanks so much for listening. We want to continue to hear from you.

‘Congress at its worst’: Republicans can’t shake home appliance fixation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 6:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/congress-worst-republicans-cant-shake-home-appliance-fixation-rcna161096,"A few months ago, Axios reported that there was some growing “frustration” among House Republicans over their party’s focus on home appliance-related legislation, especially given that the Democratic-led Senate would ignore the GOP’s measures. Evidently, Republican leaders prefer to ignore the intraparty irritation. The Associated Press reported overnight: During the floor debate, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California called the effort “ridiculous,” adding, “It is Congress at its worst.” The congresswoman’s argument was both accurate and persuasive, and it was clear that Porter was frustrated that she even had to make the remarks. But making matters worse was the familiarity of the circumstances. Indeed, it was just a couple of months ago when House Republicans also approved the “Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act” (or “HOOHA”), which, if implemented, would make it more difficult to enact energy efficiency standards for washing machines, among other things. There’s no great mystery as to the broader political context: GOP members have a problem with energy efficiency standards, which used to enjoy relatively bipartisan support before the party’s approach to energy policy moved sharply to the right. A recent PunchBowl News report helped summarize matters: “These are all part of the Republican culture war clash over energy efficiency and climate change. It’s similar to the gas stove hysteria or Trump’s war on low-flush toilets and light bulbs.” GOP lawmakers know that these home appliance bills aren’t going anywhere in the Democratic-led Senate, but by all appearances, party leaders don’t much care. They want to be able to tell the far-right Republican base that they’re on Capitol Hill, fighting tooth and nail in support of pointless bills that combat energy conservation and efficiency standards. As a result, the “Refrigerator Freedom Act” and the “Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act” (these are the actual bill names, which I swear I didn’t make up) will no doubt make for delightful fundraising letters and several Fox News segments, even as real priorities in need of Republicans’ attention go overlooked. As for the rest of the party’s appliance-related agenda, votes on the “Liberty in Laundry Act” (H.R. 7673), the “Clothes Dryers Reliability Act"" (H.R. 7645), and the “Affordable Air Conditioning Act” (H.R. 7626) were supposed to receive votes weeks ago.

Joe Biden has no vision,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-age-2024-policy-rcna160505,"A few weeks ago I received a letter from President Joe Biden that distilled one of the key — and under-discussed — reasons that I believe he’s at serious risk of losing in November. To be clear, this was no personal missive. It was a fundraising pitch signed by Biden and sent out by his presidential campaign, presumably to people who might vote for Democrats in November. In this letter Biden laid out his case to voters for supporting his re-election bid. In paragraph after paragraph over the course of two pages, he sounded the alarms about former President Donald Trump. He warned of Trump’s campaign of revenge. He detailed the threats that Trump poses to democracy and the rights and social services that Americans currently enjoy. He called for help in debunking “MAGA lies.”  Biden’s case against Trump was sound. But something was missing: Joe Biden’s case for himself. He allocated just one sentence at the bottom of the first page to discussing his legislative accomplishments. As for his future aims, buried on the second page were three bullet points explaining a handful of things he planned to do if he wins a second term: ban assault weapons; cap insulin costs; and increase taxes on billionaires. The rest of the note returned to talking about the fight against Trump and the importance of mobilizing for November. Biden’s fundraising letter typifies a broader trend. His campaign relentlessly issues warnings about Trump — and there is much to warn about — but it’s thin on what he would do with his own time in office. His inaugural re-election campaign video opened with footage of Jan. 6 and focused overwhelmingly on the menace of Trumpism. His campaign’s leading social media account on X is laser focused on dunking on Trump or talking about how dangerous he is. A central theme of his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ public commentary is protecting abortion rights from further erosion under Trump. Even though Biden announced his re-election bid over a year ago, up until a few weeks ago, his campaign website didn’t even have a policy section (unlike Trump’s). The site’s headline argument was the need to support Biden “to keep Trump out of the Oval Office.” In recent weeks, Biden’s website has added an “issues” section, but it remains anemic. (More on that later.)  Again, preventing another Trump presidency is an essential part of the case for Biden’s re-election. But framing the case almost purely in those terms neglects an essential task of any political candidate: clearly communicating an agenda and building a mandate for that agenda. What should Americans expect — and get excited about — when casting their ballot for Biden other than “this guy is not Trump”?  Banking on dread of Trump isn’t working as an election strategy. The president has trailed Trump in national polls and in polls of swing states since last year, after Trump promised to be “dictator for a day,” after his Hitlerian rhetoric about immigrants and even after he was convicted of 34 felony counts. Polling indicates that for less politically engaged voters, who outnumber highly engaged voters and who lean toward Trump, economic concerns outweigh concerns about democracy.  Since the 2020 Democratic primaries, Biden’s central value proposition has been that he serves as the most practical bulwark against Trump and an American slide toward autocracy. But the president’s evidence for that premise has become far less clear since he has taken a huge hit in his approval ratings over the course of his tenure. And even before his disastrous debate performance, a majority of voters felt he was too old for the office. If Biden is not a reliable defender against Trump, then what exactly is it that will get voters to see the point of sticking with him? This is all the more frustrating because Biden has many accomplishments as president to be proud of and which should, theoretically, shape the public’s understanding of him. His first term was surprisingly productive given the narrowness of Democrats’ congressional majorities. His aggressive intervention in the economy with the American Rescue Plan was bold and successful, and he passed major bills securing, among other things, badly needed infrastructure, advanced manufacturing jobs at home, major clean energy investment, and lower prescription drug prices for seniors.  But voters have famously short memories. Polling shows that huge swaths of Americans are unaware of Biden’s signature policy achievements, and some even credit Trump for passing Biden’s infrastructure policy. A New York Times / Siena College poll taken earlier this year showed that more than twice as many voters think Trump’s policies helped them personally compared with Biden’s. Dispiriting as this may be, it means that Biden cannot rest on his laurels — he needs to set up more big swings and give people positive reasons to vote for him that speaks to their current concerns. While Biden’s execution of his agenda was remarkable, a lot of his motivation to take it on in the first place was due to circumstances that don’t exist anymore. Biden’s 2020 policy vision was beefed up by that year’s primaries, which generated Democrats’ most progressive policy debate in decades. Biden presented himself as among the most centrist of the candidates in the race, but after the primaries he adopted more progressive policies in a coordinated show of party unity with former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. This year the primaries were mostly a formality and Biden was not challenged to show policy ambition. Additionally, Biden took office during the pandemic, and his advisers counseled him to spend aggressively to avoid the mistakes of former President Barack Obama’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. He not only had a political imperative to go after big policies, but an economic one — neither of which he had coming into this campaign.  Biden will from time to time discuss policies he favors, but they generally take the form of vague and technocratic incrementalism, rather than a discernible and coherent vision. Americans can intuit that there are threats to their freedom beyond Trump, embedded in the way our political and economic systems operate. Given how badly inflation battered how ordinary Americans experienced and perceived the economy during his term, it is political malpractice not to propose headline-generating and coalition-building policies that will help Americans’ feel optimistic about the economy. What happened to Biden’s support for a public option, which has the potential to set in motion a revolution in reforming our barbaric and exorbitant health care system? Better yet, why not shoot straight for Medicare for All? What about aggressively lobbying for a higher minimum wage? What universal policy ideas does Biden have on issues like the cost of housing and higher education that can speak to the electorate’s desire for sweeping change? If Biden wants to do the right thing, excite progressives and show bold foreign policy vision, he should chart an independent course from Israel and stop subsidizing its brutal military operation in Gaza. What about tapping into widespread disenchantment with an increasingly radical Supreme Court by promising Supreme Court reform? Biden’s struggles in communicating clearly are only exacerbating his agenda problem. At the debate, Biden brought up a great policy — an enhanced child tax credit — multiple times. But he spoke in rushed, incomplete sentences and was often barely audible. He did not explain how it works in simple, clear and attractive language. He did not sell this idea as part of a package of exciting proposals tied to economic freedom, but instead jammed it into a rushed list of policies that are hard for nonpolicy wonks to follow as he scrambled to play defense against Trump. One can't help but feel that the Biden campaign is sleepwalking. Just as Biden is out of touch with voters’ widespread doubts about his ability to serve another term, he is also out of touch with how to renew their faith in him as someone who can deliver a better future. A future worth organizing for, funding and mobilizing to make into a reality. If Biden does not step aside — and he's adamant that he won't — then becoming assertive and ambitious on policy is maybe the only thing he can do to re-engage with a public that's dangerously cool on him. It may not be enough to save him. But Americans deserve a better campaign than, ""Hey, at least I'm not a fascist."""
The multiple tragedies of a Trump-nominated judge’s sexual misconduct,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joshua-kindred-trump-judge-sexual-misconduct-rcna160912,"In December 2019, after Joshua Kindred was nominated by then-President Donald Trump to a federal district court judgeship in Alaska, he fielded questions from senators tasked with assessing his fitness for the job. One of them — Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii — asked him a question she poses to all judicial nominees: ""Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors, or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?"" Kindred, a state prosecutor-turned-Department of Interior lawyer, answered, ""No."" Ultimately, he was confirmed by the full Senate in mid-February 2020 by a vote of 54-41. Yet Kindred, who is only in his 40s, has now resigned from the job he could have held for life. And, perhaps not coincidentally, his resignation came the same day a judicial council overseeing misconduct complaints for his court publicly released an order summarizing the evidence collected through its ""thorough investigation"" of a complaint against Kindred and reflecting its judgment that Kindred should voluntarily resign. Specifically, the order ""reprimanded and admonished"" him for ""creating a hostile work environment for his law clerks and ... having an inappropriately sexualized relationship with one of his law clerks both during her clerkship and after she became [a federal prosecutor]."" Kindred's two-sentence resignation letter, submitted to President Joe Biden on July 3, did not address the allegations. There's no proof Kindred lied when he told Hirono he had never sexually harassed or assaulted anyone. But even the limited evidence discussed in the order suggests he was no novice, especially in fostering a hostile work environment. In particular, ""nearly all"" of his current and former law clerks sat for interviews, despite their stated ""reluctance or discomfort at being involved in the investigation,"" according to the judicial council's report. And collectively, they revealed his pattern of highly sexualized workplace talk, including ""encouraging rating people based on 'fuckability,'"" or soliciting a clerk's romantic advice after a federal prosecutor had sent him nude photos of herself. His 628 pages of texts with his clerks were filled with similar vulgarities and seemingly more frequent; with one law clerk, he exchanged 278 pages of texts in just 11 months, ""only a small fraction of which had any relationship to her legitimate job duties."" Calling himself her ""biggest cheerleader,"" he predicted he would become an ""emotional wreck"" when her clerkship ended. But what reads like an unrequited, consuming crush over texts escalated into something more pernicious in real life: at least two incidents of sexual contact, each of which seemed unwelcome from the report's narrative. For example, before the more significant of the two episodes, the clerk told the investigators, ""I just remember thinking like there's nothing I can do about this, like this is about to happen."" That doesn't exactly sound consensual. Yet when Kindred was given the opportunity to argue his case before the judicial council, he reflected that his ""great sin"" was that he ""treated [his] law clerks as friends rather than employees."" The judicial council, on the other hand, framed his misconduct more starkly: ""Judge Kindred created an atmosphere in which he was inappropriately inserting himself into the personal lives of his law clerks, engaging in a sexualized relationship with one of his law clerks, and having sexually suggestive and explicit conversations with his law clerks."" Kindred has not publicly addressed the allegations. He did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. Some of his alleged conduct might have come to light sooner if Congress had passed legislation, like that proposed by Hirono in past years, that would protect federal judicial employees from retaliation and sex discrimination. Still, even that doesn't go far enough. Beyond his impact on the careers of courthouse employees, did Kindred's attitudes about gender, sex and sexuality, whether owned or implicit, impact how he ruled in the cases before him? A survey of his opinions suggests Kindred did not encounter any sexual harassment claim he deemed worthy of a trial, let alone a verdict. Among the plaintiffs whose claims he dismissed is an Alaska state trooper trainee who alleged a fellow recruit entered her dorm while she was sleeping and later commented to her about watching her and also entered the women's locker room while she was undressed — both alleged acts violate academy rules. Kindred threw out her claims because while ""inappropriate, these two instances of harassment were relatively isolated, not 'extremely serious,' and were investigated."" Another plaintiff, a National Park Service employee, alleged that her boss grabbed her by the arm, hugged her and rubbed her back without her permission — and also would ""stalk"" her as she walked to her office or as she waited for an office printer. Yet none of her allegations were sufficiently pervasive and severe to constitute a hostile work environment either, Kindred found. In the wake of Kindred's resignation, neither of them will ever achieve redress. Meanwhile, justice for federal litigants in Alaska may be delayed, as Kindred's resignation leaves the state with only one active federal district court judge. And until we find a more probing, less punitive way of vetting judicial nominees, we too are doomed to award federal judgeships to those who collect brass rings and political patrons, without sufficient attention to what matters most: character."
Don’t expect Ukraine to get any closer to NATO membership at this week's summit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nato-washington-summit-ukraine-rcna160890,"On the eve of NATO’s Washington summit, which runs Tuesday to Thursday and marks the alliance’s 75th anniversary, American foreign policy mavens identified with the realist school of thought signed an open letter warning against steps that would move Ukraine closer to NATO membership. First published in Politico and later in the U.K.’s Guardian, the letter makes a case against such steps on two grounds. The first is that it would increase the risks of war with Russia. Article V of the alliance’s April 4, 1949, founding treaty provides — albeit with some wiggle room — for the collective defense of member states that come under attack. Were Russia to attack a Ukraine allied with NATO, the U.S.-led military pact would be at war with Russia. The letter writers’ second argument against bringing Ukraine into NATO is that no important American national security interest warrants running this risk. The letter’s signatories might have spared themselves the effort of writing. Even though NATO membership is something President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government has pushed for and, according to a recent poll, 77% of Ukrainians desire, there’s no chance NATO will take concrete steps that solidify Ukraine’s prospects for membership. To understand why NATO won’t oblige Ukraine, we need to look back and look forward. At NATO’s 2008 summit in Budapest, Hungary, President George W. Bush goaded a divided NATO to agree in principle to admit Ukraine. Such is the influence of the U.S. within the alliance: Without America’s military might, Article V would be meaningless. But even though Bush prevailed, so, in a sense, did the countries leery about admitting Ukraine. The part of that summit’s closing statement that pertained to Ukraine was noncommittal. It averred that NATO looked forward to welcoming Ukraine into its ranks but made no promises and didn’t provide a timeline. Because of divisions in NATO, Kyiv was consigned to the alliance’s waiting room for 14 years, at which point Russia invaded. It didn’t even receive the Membership Action Plan promised in the Budapest statement. While the possibility of Ukraine’s membership increased tensions between Kyiv and Moscow, when Putin ordered his army to march on Kyiv in 2022, Ukraine was left naked. The disunity within NATO over Ukraine’s membership has become even deeper. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are avid supporters, but elsewhere the mood ranges from reluctance to the outright opposition evident in Hungary and Slovakia. Worse, the success of far-right parties in the latest elections to the European Parliament (23 of 32 NATO countries also belong to the European Union) and their stronger presence in countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and even Sweden bode ill for Ukraine’s chances. Now, one might point out that more NATO countries support Ukraine’s admission than oppose it. That would be a good point if decisions on enlarging NATO were reached by a majority vote. But that’s not how it works. According to Article 10 of the founding treaty, “The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty.” This formulation gives any member nation a veto. Ukraine’s problems don’t end there. The U.S. has been unwilling to throw its weight behind Ukraine. In a May 28 interview with Time, President Joe Biden highlighted Russia’s threat to Ukraine and Europe more generally. But he had this to say when queried about “the endgame” for Ukraine: “Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That’s what peace looks like. And it doesn’t mean ... they are part of NATO, it means we have a relationship with them like we do with other countries, where we supply weapons so they can defend themselves in the future. ... I am not prepared to support the NATOization of Ukraine.” In Kyiv’s corridors of power, the realities that block Ukraine’s entry into NATO are well understood, even as they evoke frustration and disappointment. Much of what will happen at the summit that started Tuesday is entirely predictable: NATO will tout its past successes, the democratic values that bind it, the doubling of its membership from 16 at the peak of the Cold War to its current 32, its members’ increased defense spending and its support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russia. What’s equally foreseeable is that NATO won’t take any decision that definitively brings Ukraine closer to membership. NATO’s statement could reportedly include strong new language that aligns with or explicitly echoes NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s statement in April declaring Ukraine’s path to membership “irreversible.” That would mean Ukraine could become a member at some future, unknown, date. If that happens, Kyiv is likely to be pleased about the language. It would mean that Russia can’t count on a political settlement to its war with Ukraine that depends on Ukraine being kept out of NATO. But even a statement signaling that Ukraine’s path to membership is irreversible still wouldn’t set aside the requirement for unanimity within NATO for admitting new members. That’s not present now, and when it will be remains uncertain."
"At least 186,000 deaths in Gaza could result from Israel-Hamas war, researchers estimate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 3:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/gaza-death-toll-lancet-israel-hamas-war-rcna160902,"More than 186,000 deaths in Gaza could result from the Israel-Hamas war, according to an analysis published by The Lancet medical journal. The analysis, which was published in The Lancet’s correspondence section, was not peer-reviewed, but it underscores the difficulty of accurately documenting the conflict’s death toll. The official Gaza toll since Oct. 7 is at least 38,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The researchers pointed to the number of eventual indirect deaths in recent conflicts, which ranged from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. “Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will continue to be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive, communicable, and non-communicable diseases,” they wrote. For their estimate, the researchers added four indirect deaths for each direct death reported so far in Gaza, concluding that “it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict.” Counting the death toll in Gaza is a monumental effort that has become increasingly difficult, with international human rights groups and news reports saying the official count is likely incomplete. Authorities have struggled to identify the bodies buried in mass graves, or body parts pulled from the rubble, while suffering from starvation and dehydration themselves. Israeli government agencies have previously accused the Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, of inflating the death toll. President Joe Biden similarly suggested at one point that those numbers are not to be believed. However, human rights groups, news organizations and even Israeli intelligence services have previously considered the health ministry’s numbers to be largely accurate. Israel’s assault on Gaza after Hamas’ attack has been catastrophic. United Nations experts say famine is spreading throughout Gaza, and they accuse Israel of carrying out a “targeted starvation campaign” against Palestinians. Much of Gaza’s infrastructure — schools, hospitals, housing, and water and electricity supplies — has been destroyed or damaged. The human toll of the war has been especially devastating. Most of the people killed in the past nine months have been women and children, according to the official numbers. The Associated Press recently documented 60 Palestinian families in which at least 25 people have been killed, with some of the deaths spanning four generations in one family."
Here’s why the debate over Joe Biden’s future is so important,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 3:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/latest/democrats-strategy-biden-beat-trump-2024-rcna160901,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 8 episode of “Inside with Jen Psaki.” President Joe Biden has come out fighting. It all started with his letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, vowing to stay in the race. Less than an hour later, the president was on the phone with our friends at “Morning Joe” doubling down on that promise. If this is a stare-down, and in many ways it is, Biden isn’t blinking.  As the president keeps a busy schedule, traveling to swing states and meeting with world leaders at the NATO summit, Donald Trump has been virtually out of sight since the debate. We’re seeing a defiant Biden and a virtually silent Trump. Even so, there are daily reminders of the threat the former president poses and the importance of defeating him. The thing is, there’s no universal agreement right now on who is the best person to do that. The clock is ticking, that’s just a fact. The Democratic National Convention is just a few weeks away and the election is in four months. On Monday, I spoke to two Democratic senators, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who have slightly different views on the right path forward. Fetterman has been arguably the president’s fiercest defender since the debate, joining Biden on his campaign swing through Pennsylvania. And then there’s Murphy, who’s been open about how Biden needs to do more to reassure the public. Two Democratic senators, both patriots who love their country and love the president, and who just happen to be answering the same question a little bit differently right now. And guess what? That’s OK. Disagreement is a sign of a healthy democracy. Disagreement is what Trump and the Republican Party want to get rid of in this country. While good faith actors in the Democratic Party openly discuss the best path forward, Republicans are blindly defending everything a man convicted of 34 felonies says and does. And that blind loyalty means everything is on the line in this election: women’s rights, the Supreme Court, the rule of law and, yes, democracy itself. The prospect of a criminally immune criminal in the most powerful office in the world is on the line. Fetterman knows that, and so does Murphy. Biden’s closest advisers know that, and, yes, the people calling on him to drop out of the race know that, too. We know winning has never been more important than it is this November. We know losing is not an option. It’s because the stakes are so high that there’s disagreement about how we get there. No one in the Democratic Party is disputing that Biden is an incredibly decent and empathetic human being. When I met with him for the first time about the White House press secretary job, his biggest focus was on whether I could play a role in returning civility and respect for the media to the briefing room. He didn’t want shouting matches or accusations. He wanted to restore dignity to the office. That’s who he is.  He is a person who asks about your kids and your family. A person who, when I was there two years ago, was so relentless that he would keep meetings going in the Oval Office for hours. He cares deeply about the country. He ran not for fame or fortune, and certainly not to keep himself out of jail but because he is a person who believes in public service and in making the lives of others better. He wants to help the guy from Scranton he talks to after church who feels left behind and forgotten. Representing those people is his calling, and that's what has always driven him to run for office. He was the uniter when the country needed it. He was the comforter-in-chief when people were mourning loved ones lost to Covid. It’s not just that he has defied the odds repeatedly in his career, including when he ran for president in 2020, landing in fourth place in Iowa and still coming back to win the nomination and defeat Trump. It’s not just that he forged ahead in pursuing bipartisan legislation at a time when most people said that was malarkey, as he might say; it's that he did it through hard work, relationship building and compromise — a part of governing that’s largely been lost in Washington. If you’re sitting there reading all of this and feel angry, I get it. If you feel frustrated, I get that, too. Biden is a good man who has been a great president and pushed forward an impressive agenda. That’s just a fact. But this discussion right now is not about that. It’s not about whether he defied the odds in 2020. He did. Or whether he defied the odds during his first term. He did. It’s not about whether he would stand up for democracy. He would. It’s whether he is the right person to defeat Donald Trump.  We don’t know at this moment exactly where voters stand on that question, and they are ultimately the only ones that matter. There are legitimate questions, and it isn’t only rich donors and coastal elites who are asking them. I worked for him, I respect him and I care about him deeply, but if I told you that every question being asked is unfair, I wouldn’t be respecting you. I’m not going to do that.  Yes, the president and his team came out fighting. He was defiant — a sign of vigor that is important in this moment, but that’s not his most effective message. This election will be won not by someone who simply name-calls Trump but by someone who can articulate clearly to the American public that Trump is not fighting for them. He is fighting for himself. Biden has done that effectively and can do it effectively. But the man I saw on that debate stage in Atlanta was not the person I worked for more than two years ago: a person who switched between spontaneous calls to members of Congress and to foreign leaders, who grilled policy people for more answers and harangued spokespeople for speaking in acronyms. That was not the person we all saw.  So maybe it was just one bad night, but the president will have to keep answering questions and convincing skeptics he’s up to the job. He has started that process, with interviews and campaign events, and there’s a big test coming up Thursday with a solo press conference after the NATO summit. Everything he does will be scrutinized. So while defiance is a start, defiance alone will not win back every supporter he needs, and neither will denial about the reality right now."

"Jim Inhofe, climate crisis-denying former senator, dies at 89",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 2:12 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jim-inhofe-dies-climate-crisis-snowball-rcna160991,"Former Sen. Jim Inhofe, who went to lengths as a lawmaker to deny that climate change is exacerbated by human activity, died this week at 89 following a stroke, his family said. Oklahoma's longest-serving senator, Inhofe was first elected to the Senate in 1994. He resigned in 2023, saying at the time that he wanted to spend more time with his wife. After he left office, however, he told the Tulsa World in an interview that he had stepped down because he had long Covid. Inhofe's views often reflected the extreme leanings of his party. He was intensely homophobic (in opposing same-sex marriage, he once boasted to the Senate that in the ""recorded history"" of his family ""we've never had a divorce or any kind of a homosexual relationship""), he was rabidly pro-gun (he once blamed mass shootings on ""permissive laws"" in sanctuary cities) and opposed abortion rights. But Inhofe was best known for his zealous denial of the climate crisis and that human activity was its primary driver. (The New York Times reported, ""Mining, oil, gas, coal and utility interests were generous contributors to Mr. Inhofe’s Senate campaigns."") Inhofe called climate change “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” In 2015, when he was chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, he infamously took a snowball onto the Senate floor during a snowstorm, ostensibly to demonstrate that global warming was not real. Staffers told Politico's E&E News in 2020 that the stunt was intended to highlight media hypocrisy. “Whenever it’s hot in the summer, everyone’s like ‘Oh, my gosh, climate change!’ But if it’s something that doesn’t play into the global warming element, like a snowstorm in February, people don’t say, ‘Oh, my gosh, it’s climate change,’” the staffer who wrote the speech told the outlet. The Oklahoma Republican was also a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, who shared his denial of climate science. Inhofe had an outsize influence on the Trump administration's environmental agenda, according to The Washington Post. Yet he broke with members of his own party in 2020, opting to certify Joe Biden's election win in a move that earned him backlash among some Republicans. Twice, however, Inhofe voted against impeaching Trump."

The answer lies at the intersection of party rules, party practices and voter expectations — and the conflicting goals of a party process. Most accounts of the modern presidential nomination process start in the late 1960s. The Democrats’ 1968 convention was a disaster, with protests inside and outside the gathering driven by party divisions over the Vietnam War and other policy issues, and growing discontent with the lack of grassroots input into nominations. After the tumult, the Democratic National Committee convened a commission to construct a new nominating process for the party. The result was largely the system we have now: States select delegates to the convention through primaries, caucuses or conventions, but these have to be open to all party members, with publicized dates and times. Though these reforms were intended to make the process more open and democratic, it’s a misconception that the goal was to write the party out. Instead, the delegates still choose the nominee at the convention. So who is a delegate and what do they do? There are two groups: “pledged” delegates (those selected in primaries and caucuses) and unpledged “superdelegates” (elected officials and party leaders who can vote as they please). You may recall superdelegates playing crucial roles in the delegate math during the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries, but after the latter contest, the party changed the rules to weaken their influence slightly. Now, only “pledged” delegates can vote on the first ballot for president; superdelegates join on subsequent ballots. The party rules state that delegates are bound by “conscience” to vote as they are pledged — and most are pledged for Biden. But from a formal rules perspective, it isn’t a big deal for delegates to vote differently on the first ballot at the convention. They aren’t legally bound, nor do the rules outline any consequences for delegates who vote differently. Where things get complicated is the informal party practices that have developed over time, and the voter expectations that come with them. It’s generally expected that delegates will vote as they are pledged — based on the primary votes of the states they represent. One reason for this is that primary contests help party leaders know what primary voters are thinking, and which candidates they prefer. It’s also expected that the nomination is sewn up well before the convention. Experts disagree somewhat about exactly how this happens. Some emphasize the early primaries as ways for candidates to show strength, while others stress the role of the “invisible primary,” in which different groups — say, environmentalists, labor or pro-choice activists for Democrats; religious conservatives and business interests for Republicans — weigh in and steer the process toward nominees who would be broadly acceptable to all groups. This is probably a much larger sticking point than the formal rules. In order to select a new Democratic presidential nominee, delegates would need some method to coordinate. Otherwise, the Wisconsin delegation could go in one direction, and the Florida one in another. Or progressives and establishment Democrats could set themselves up for a rough floor fight with the world watching. Or each faction could find itself divided among alternative candidates. As with the process under normal circumstances, party leaders would need to coordinate either among themselves or in consultation with voters. But what do the party’s voters want? At this point in the nomination process, the voters’ formal role has usually ended, with each state and territory having held its primary or caucus. The official rules of the party allow the delegates to make the selection on their own (or, if a post-convention nomination process is necessary, the party leaders can choose). But parties want to win elections, which requires paying attention to what voters want. And that’s tricky at this stage. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., floated the hypothetical idea of a “mini-primary” before the delegates take their roll call votes, but it’s not clear what that would look like. Delegates in a potential replacement situation would have public opinion data to build on, but it’s likely we would see some kind of institutional innovation in order to weigh the preferences of voters. This exact scenario has never played out. Parties have generally re-nominated sitting presidents, often without serious competition, since the late 19th century. But thinking through how it might happen requires pulling together these three strains: what the formal rules say, what the informal practices are and what the voters want. One possibility is that, should President Biden decide to withdraw from the nomination and not run for re-election, the Democratic Party would do a shortened version of its usual process, coordinating among leaders, crucial interest groups and the party’s voters, in order to select a new nominee. It’s likely that this process would heavily feature promotion of Vice President Kamala Harris, promoting her as the continuation of the administration while also gauging support for her. Absent the informal aspects of the process, a convention that relies simply on the party’s delegates could be quite chaotic. Even when conventions regularly chose presidential nominees — the first presidential primaries date only back to 1912 — there was often informal coordination and persuasion going on. This is what people refer to when they talk about a “brokered” convention — and the modern era leaves a lot of questions open about who the brokers would be and how they would operate. When these efforts failed, the conventions would need multiple ballots to figure out a presidential nominee, with new and sometimes unexpected names floated before the delegates. There’s nothing in the formal rules to prevent this sort of convention from happening now. If President Biden steps aside and the Democrats select a new nominee, the process can build on existing formal and informal rules. But it also will require innovation and indeed improvisation, because it will be unlike anything we’ve seen in American politics for decades."
‘The Bachelor’ let down its first Black male lead. Will it do better by Jenn Tran?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 1:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jenn-tran-asian-american-bachelorette-lead-rcna160934,"As the first Asian American Bachelorette, Jenn Tran is very aware of the added responsibility she carries.  “I want to be able to make everybody proud and make my heritage proud,” Tran, a 26-year-old physician assistant student, said during the season premiere Monday. “I think what it really comes down to is that I just have to be myself and do the best that I can do.” Indeed, already Tran is everything you’d want a Bachelorette to be: funny, bubbly, telegenic, open to new experiences and excited to find love. She can declare it “shot o’clock” one moment and then sit down for an earnest conversation about shared family history the next. (Bachelorettes can do it all!) There’s no question that Tran will be a capable lead — one episode in, she’s already shown herself to be a great choice. However, the jury is still out on whether a television franchise steeped in institutional racism is capable of doing right by her. When Tran was named the next Bachelorette back in March, the announcement was met with shock and excitement from Asian fans of the franchise. “I’ve watched #TheBachelorette since its first season and never thought I’d see the day we’d get an Asian American lead!” tweeted Washington Post reporter Jada Yuan, who watched the announcement live from a bar in Brooklyn, New York, and witnessed the pure joy of the two Vietnamese American women sitting next to her. After all, fans of color have come to expect as little as possible from “The Bachelor” franchise. The show’s less-than-stellar diversity track record is common knowledge at this point. For years, fans darkly joked about the way that contestants of color would show up for a week or two but never became serious contenders. After a class action lawsuit was filed in 2012 — the show began airing in 2002 — “The Bachelor” seemed to work a bit harder to inject racial diversity into its dating pool. But there were still no Black leads until Rachel Lindsay’s season of “The Bachelorette” in 2017, and the franchise took even longer to cast a Black man in the lead role, finally casting Matt James in 2020, the year George Floyd’s death at the hands of police set off national protests and a national racial reckoning. But the casting of Lindsay and James also proved that true representation is about more than ticking a box. Both grappled with the challenges of being a highly visible first while working within a show infrastructure that wasn’t equipped to support them. “I’m going to be really frank — we let Matt down,” executive producer Bennett Graebner told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published shortly before the beginning of Tran’s season. “That season went wrong on so many levels,” Graebner said, calling the show’s 15-year wait for a Black lead “inexcusable.” “We did not protect him as we should have.”  Graebner and fellow EP Claire Freeland seem ready to answer publicly for the franchise’s long-running failures — failures that didn’t stop with James’ season. Freeland came on board from the Canadian “Bachelor” franchise after creator Mike Fleiss was ousted in 2023 after a Warner Bros. investigation into allegations of racial discrimination made against him. (Fleiss told Variety he was “proud of the work we’ve done over the past five years to make the show substantially more diverse, but I do believe I could have done more. Hopefully, the franchise will continue to move in the right direction.”) Earlier this year, the American show came under fire after Rachel Nance, who made it to the final three on Joey Graziadei's season of “The Bachelor” and is biracial, said she was subjected to a barrage of racist messages after her hometown date. “I got a lot of hateful messages ... calling me the N-word or jungle Asian, all because I got a rose,” Nance told host Jesse Palmer during the women tell-all special. “It’s sad because my parents really enjoyed the hometown episode, and for them to see people attacking our culture and attacking me — I’ve been in this scenario before, but this was like a whole new level.” Instead of calling this what it was — racism from the show’s own fan base — Palmer asked all of the cast members if they had received hateful messages, and then asked the audience to temper their “strong opinions” in favor of “uplifting” the people who go on the show. (Freeland acknowledged to the L.A. Times that this segment “was another missed opportunity.” “Our intention was to bring light toward what Rachel was going through,” she said. “But we have to do better.”) This long history makes it hard to believe that even the noblest of intentions from producers will make a real difference for the people of color who are generous enough to share their lives and stories with millions of people each season. And even meaningful incremental changes from the show’s production team do not shield cast members from the racist aggressions of the fans that the franchise cultivated for years and years. Amid all of the Instagram posts from Tran excitedly boosting her season, she also reposted a commenter who noted, “We wanted white skin and blonde hair.” I have long wondered if and when “The Bachelor” franchise would be forced to choose between conservative white viewers who want to see the show remain as it was in its heyday when everyone was an evangelical dental hygienist and Black contestants never made it past week three, and more progressive viewers who have been vocally pushing for change from their problematic fave. For years, the show has tried to make both groups happy using cosmetic tweaks that never really addressed the rot at the core. The L.A. Times piece indicates that an affirmative choice has finally been made. Probably. “We can’t change the minds of people who aren’t interested in this new direction. What we have the power to do is change the program,” Freeland told the L.A. Times. Graebner was even more explicit: “If you don’t want to see a Black love story, an Asian American love story, an interracial love story, then maybe Bachelor Nation isn’t for you.” The sentiment is a great one, and one that so many members of Bachelor Nation have been waiting years to hear. But these words only have meaning if they’re backed up by action. So now we wait, and cheer for Jenn Tran. Here’s hoping she finds the love she deserves and doesn’t become a sacrificial lamb to the show’s growth."
Dems seek special counsel to investigate Justice Clarence Thomas,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 12:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-seek-special-counsel-investigate-justice-clarence-thomas-rcna160982,"As a matter of jurisprudence, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has reason to be delighted by the high court’s shift to the far right. Indeed, the controversial jurist has consistently found himself in the majority as he and other Republican-appointed justices have issued a series of reactionary rulings. But while Thomas is likely pleased with the Supreme Court’s ideological direction, he’s probably less satisfied with the difficult ethics questions he’s faced over the last year or so. The Hill just reported, for example, on the latest congressional escalation in the larger discussion. While the letter was dated July 3, the Democratic senators released the correspondence to the public Tuesday. “We do not make this request lightly,” Whitehouse and Wyden wrote. “The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations. Presented with opportunities to resolve questions about his conduct, Justice Thomas has maintained a suspicious silence.” The senators concluded, “No government official should be above the law. Supreme Court justices are properly expected to obey laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety and to comply with the federal tax code. We therefore request that you appoint a Special Counsel authorized to investigate potential criminal violations by Justice Thomas under the disclosure, false statement, and tax laws; pursue leads of related criminal violations by donors, lenders, and intermediate corporate entities; and determine whether any such loans and gifts were provided pursuant to a coordinated enterprise or plan.” Circling back to our earlier coverage, Thomas has faced difficult ethics questions for many years, but his difficulties took a more serious turn last spring. ProPublica published a rather devastating report in early April of last year, shining a light on the generous and undisclosed benefits Thomas has received from a Republican megadonor. In the weeks and months that followed, ProPublica took the lead on exposing Thomas’ other unusual ties to his wealthy friend, but the outlet wasn’t alone. The New York Times also took the story further, shining a light on previously unreported benefits the justice has received from a “cohort of wealthy and powerful friends,” thanks to his connections established through the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. The Times added fresh reporting last summer on one of Thomas’ other wealthy pals providing the sitting justice with undisclosed financing that made it possible for Thomas to buy an expensive recreational vehicle. How big was the loan? Neither the justice nor his friend say. How much did Thomas repay? They wouldn’t say. What were the terms of the loan? They wouldn’t say. Was there a formal loan agreement? They wouldn’t say. Soon ProPublica published another report that made the entire controversy look considerably worse, noting that Thomas had received “at least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” In each instance, the far-right jurist’s luxurious benefits “have been underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence.” Though the precise value of the trips is difficult to measure, ProPublica described it as “likely in the millions” of dollars. It’s an impossible dynamic to defend: Thomas has lived the life of a wealthy man, thanks to the generosity of his rich, likeminded friends. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, “There is nothing partisan about calling this what it is: a brazen, shameful abuse of power that undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. That Thomas reportedly took these gifts is alarming enough. That he reportedly took them without disclosing that he had taken them (with rare exceptions) makes it hard to believe that Thomas doesn’t realize how bad this all looks.” Earlier this year it reached the point at which Thomas became a punch-line to jokes about Supreme Court corruption. (In February, The Onion, a satirical outlet, published a memorable item with a headline that read, “Clarence Thomas Announces 50% Discount On All Favorable Rulings.”) Now, at least two senators want the Justice Department to take matters to the next level with the appointment of a special counsel. The attorney general is unlikely to agree, but it’ll be interesting to see how (and whether) Garland responds. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The end of libraries as we know them? with Brewster Kahle and Kyle Courtney: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 11:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/end-libraries-know-brewster-kahle-kyle-courtney-podcast-transcript-rcna160939,"Could the future of libraries as we’ve known them be completely different? Our guests this week say so. Megapublishers are suing the Internet Archive, perhaps best known for its Wayback Machine, to redefine e-books as legally different from paper books. A difference in how they are classified would mean sweeping changes for the way libraries operate. Brewster Kahle is a digital librarian at the Internet Archive. Kyle Courtney is a lawyer, librarian, director of copyright and information policy for Harvard Library. He’s the co-founder of Library Futures, which aims to empower the digital future for America’s libraries. They join to discuss what’s animating the lawsuit, information as a public good and the consequences should the publishers ultimately prevail. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Brewster Kahle: It’s really hard for people to fathom that all of these forces, political, judicial legislative, funding are all going against a tradition that built America out of a set of immigrants and brought us together to be able to know how to work as a populace. And all of that is in well, some of it is going to be judged again by an appellate group in lower Manhattan and we’ll see what it is they decide towards the fate of libraries as we know them. Kyle Courtney: It’s a slippery slope into a licensed only culture in which libraries cannot exist and mission this challenge. I do agree. A lot of people say, oh, this is just about the Internet Archives open libraries program. It’s a narrow focus. I don’t think that’s true. It’s about libraries entering and being supported in the digital space and through the use of either licensing or litigation. That’s a one-two punch, really will threaten the library mission now and in the future. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me your host, Chris Hayes. There is this news recently that I saw that just brought me up short, put my heart in my throat, which was nothing with life or death stakes, just that the mtvnews.com archives of 20 years had disappeared off the Internet. It had been removed by MTV’s parent company Paramount for reasons that were a little unclear, I think some financial decision or maybe site reorganization. But for a one-time freelance writer like myself, the notion of your work being on the Internet and then being taken off is really unnerving. I remember back when I started freelancing, I was writing for the “Chicago Reader,” which didn’t really even have an online version. It was just paper. I would go and pick up the paper version. And I got myself this kind of like leather book that, you know, has like the cellophane and you put the clippings in, and this was a big ritual for me. When I published a new piece, go get the “Chicago Reader,” bring it home, clip it out, put it in my clips book. And then at a certain point, you know, everything was online and there was some notion that we had back then that the Internet is forever, people would say. But the Internet is not forever. So one of the only ways the Internet is forever is an institution known as the Internet Archive, which does a bunch of stuff, which we’ll talk about in this hour, but runs the Wayback Machine you might’ve seen, which basically archives the Internet in real time. And so the Wayback Machine presumably will have the archives of mtvnews.com. And the Internet Archive is fascinating and important I think because it’s one of two pillars of what I would call the old pre-commercial and now non-commercial Internet. Wikipedia and the Internet Archive, neither of which are for-profit enterprises. They embody the notion of a non-commercial collaborative civic vision of the Internet as a storehouse of free and publicly accessible knowledge that people collaborate on. And that pre-commercial vision of the Internet Archive, which runs the Wayback Machine, but also does a bunch of other stuff we’ll talk about has come into conflict with commercial visions of knowledge and intellectual property in the form of a lawsuit, which has been brought by a bunch of publishers, Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley & Sons, Penguin Random House who is going to publish my next book I should note, full disclosure. They sued the Internet Archives in June of 2020, because Internet Archive digitizes physical books and makes them available to people to loan. We’ll talk about how that loaning works. And the publisher said, look, you can’t do this. They said it was willful digital piracy on an industrial scale with the program the Internet Archive runs called the Open Library. And the publishers included in their complaint that the Internet Archives did not have licensing agreements with them, nor does it pay its authors. So a federal district judge found in favor of the publishers in summary judgment ruling last year, and said that the use of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to be deemed fair use. Fair use, of course, is the carve out for a copyrighted material. And the Internet Archive has built a collection of more than 3 million books. It’s purchased them in print or received donations. And patrons of the digital library could borrow up to 10 books simultaneously for two weeks, each just the way you’d borrow physical book. And the Internet Archive says, look, this free e-book lending program is fair use, and it’s a controlled digital lending practice. The publishers say, no, this thing you’re doing controlled digital lending is a frontal assault, I’m quoting here, “on the foundational copyright principle that rights shoulders, exclusively control the terms of sale for every different format of their work. A principle that has spawned the broad diversity in formats of books, music, movies, television, music, the consumers enjoy today,” okay. So that’s part of the topic of today. We’re going to talk to some folks from the Internet Archive, but it’s a deeper conversation about the commercial versus non-commercial Internet, about what fair use is, about the notion of a public intellectual commons. And we should note that this conversation was recorded on June 26, 2024, which was actually just a few days before there was the oral arguments in the Internet Archive’s appeals before a three-judge panel to defend its Open Library controlled digital lending practice. Again, I want to be sort of bending over backwards to be fair here because we’re only listening to one side of the litigants, defendants actually, in this lawsuit. So just to lay this out, but I’m really, really fascinated and obsessed with the notion of reviving, expanding non-commercial models for digital life. So it was really enlightening and energizing to have this conversation about a case study in how that’s playing out right now with Brewster Kahle, who’s a digital librarian at the Internet Archive, intimately involved in the creation of the Wayback Machine, a founder of the enterprise, and Kyle Courtney, who is a lawyer, librarian, director of copyright information policy for Harvard Library. He’s co-founder of Library Futures, which aims to empower the digital future for America’s libraries. Here’s our conversation. Brewster, let me start with you and just take me through your background and how you, I mean, you’re one of the founders, creators, right? Brewster Kahle: Yeah, I’m the founder of the Internet Archive. Chris Hayes: You’re the guy, right. Brewster Kahle: Yeah, we started in 1996, and it took us that long because we had to get a lot of the rest of the Internet, like it was the ARPANET when I got going. So we had to actually get the Internet going. We had to have computers and search engines, we had the publishers online. But once I helped, I mean, I didn’t do all of that, but I helped go and get, you know, “New York Times’” first website up, the first “Wall Street Journal” website up, then we could build the library. So in 1996, we turned to build the library. And it’s been great. We’ve been archiving web pages, but also television, books, music, video, all your old flash games, all of that stuff. Chris Hayes: So just tell me about yourself personally, like how you found your way to this work. You’re obviously tech savvy, early adopter kind of person. Like what was your first connection to the Internet? Brewster Kahle: Oh, I’m a geek. So I started to at MIT, but I’m sort of in the tail end of the hippies, right? The sort of like, what can you do with your life that would be a good thing to do? And the idea of building the digital library of Alexandria seemed like a great idea in 1980. We’ve been promising the Library of Congress on your desktop for 35 years before that, starting with Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson. We’ve been promising this. It’s like, how hard could it be? And technically, it turns out to not be that hard, but boy, it’s been a long road. We’re not even there yet. Chris Hayes: I like this idea of the Alexandria Library of the Internet. Like, where did the idea come from and how do you start actually doing it? Brewster Kahle: It started with a technical conversation. We knew that digital publishing was going to happen. I mean, this is before the Macintosh. So it’s like, we knew all this stuff was going to go online. Chris Hayes: What years was this? Brewster Kahle: We’re talking 1980. Chris Hayes: Okay. So it goes back that far that you were thinking about this in these -- Brewster Kahle: Yeah, I’m old. But, you know, it wasn’t new to me. The idea of building access to all the information in the world, having that all at your fingertips has been in the air since the Library of Alexandria. The idea of having all the published works of humankind available to you was the promise when you walked into a library. And then you (ph) slogged your bones. When I was growing up, you slogged your bones in the library. They said, we have everything. And if we don’t have it here, we’ll get it for you from interlibrary loan. And that was how the American sort of Carnegie Library ethos of America and it was so important for educating people, for getting people ready for elections. A lot of it came out of the progressive era to go and try to get it so that when people are doing direct elections, they’re educated citizenry. All of that momentum was the world that I grew up in. And I had a new trick. I knew technology. And I also knew how long it would be before we would be able to have all of the books in the Library of Congress online and then all the movies online and all lectures at Harvard and anywhere else online. And you could just plot it out. So those conversations with Richard Feynman and Danny Hillis, Marvin Minsky, Stephen Wolfram. We just charted it out and it was like, this isn’t that hard. Let’s just go build it. And so that is, I don’t know, some of the early ethos of the Internet. It wasn’t uncommon, but it also sort of led some of those things. By 1996, it’s still before Wikipedia, it was before Google, it was way before YouTube. We knew that we needed to go and take the wonderful things that people were going and putting onto their websites. They were offering and sharing and putting unbelievable things and it was all getting lost. The average life of a web page is only 100 days -- Chris Hayes: Wow. Brewster Kahle: -- before it’s changed or deleted. And in the old days, publishers would go and publish things and they’d be bought by libraries and put in many places. So even when the publisher goes away, because they always do, there’s libraries that will be there that will store and keep the real precious things, which is the works of humankind, alive. And that’s what we went to try to build with the Wayback Machine and the Internet Archive. Chris Hayes: And that incorporated like officially in 1996? Brewster Kahle: Yes. Chris Hayes: And how -- Brewster Kahle: That’s when we started crawling the web with the Smithsonian Institution. Chris Hayes: Yeah. So how did you build it institutionally? Like, was it a 501(c)(3)? How did it work as an institution? Brewster Kahle: Nonprofit from the very beginning because this is everybody else’s stuff, right? We are custodians of everyone else’s materials, starting with the presidential election of 1996. You should see these old websites, man. They’re really critty-crufty, but they’re like the first bumper stickers in the early 1950s is the way the Smithsonian saw it. And we saw it as the beginning of the library of not just the elite that can publish books, but everyone’s words, everyone’s blogs, though there weren’t blogs yet. But every -- Chris Hayes: Web diaries. Brewster Kahle: -- city sites, web diaries, all of these things that were happening at that time as people were sharing up a storm because they could. Chris Hayes: So walk me through technically what the project was. Like, you said that you figured it out technically before you started doing it as an institution. Before we get to that, were you raising money? You have donors, you have members, did the Smithsonian pay you for the service? Like how did it work financially? Brewster Kahle: No, they didn’t pay us. I got lucky because along this route, I was helping building the publishing systems to get the publishers on board so they could start making money by publishing on the net. And that was bought by AOL. It was called Waze. It was the system before the World Wide Web. So that’s, I guess, why I’m probably in the Internet Hall of Fame is I did the earliest systems for publishers. And then that was put on AOL to help publishers. Then once I was done and I left, then the idea was like, what’s the most ephemeral of media? We said, let’s do the web. And so we made little crawlers and these crawlers are little robots. They’re programs that basically click every link on every web page and it just downloads a page and remembers it and then makes the file out of it and then finds the links and adds it to the queue. And then it clicks on that one and then finds the links on it and it’s a queue. And it just goes round and round and round and round. And we collected a copy of the web every two months, a snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, starting then. It’s gotten much more complicated now, but we’re collecting about 300 million web pages every day, about a billion URLs every day now. Chris Hayes: I have to say, back in 2002 or ‘03, I started a blog. This is pre-WordPress, so I had to hand code it in HTML. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. God bless. Chris Hayes: And put it up. And I had a thought a while ago, like, I wonder if that exists anywhere, and sure enough, on the Wayback Machine, I’m not going to tell you the name of this blog because I don’t want anyone to go read what I was writing when I was 23. It’s fine. It’s nothing like offensive. Brewster Kahle: Okay. Chris Hayes: It’s all perfectly defensible, but I was just a little baby. Brewster Kahle: Well, you started out with the MTV News and we got that for you. So MTV, we think we have it completely, but we also have the newspapers in Turkey and Russia and all these others that have been basically taken down with no warning. Chris Hayes: From a technical standpoint, it seems like a ton of data. And then you have, this is all very text-based, mostly text-based, text and image, still image when you’re when you start doing this in ‘96. Then you have the dawn of video and video comes to dominate huge portions of the Internet. I think it’s probably, if you think about social media -- Brewster Kahle: It’s huge. Chris Hayes: It’s the dominant media now. And that seems like an order of magnitude change in how you would do things and how you would save it. Like, do you start to have constraints on what you could hold? Brewster Kahle: Thank God that these guys are working so hard to make hard drives bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. So we have to replace all the hard drives every five years and then we have to reel in a new rack every few weeks to be able to keep up with the unbelievable amount of material. So we collect about a billion URLs every day. And a lot of those URLs now are images. Chris Hayes: It’s so nuts. Brewster Kahle: It’s nuts. People love this stuff. They are sharing up a storm. The idea that people will only do things for money is just not true. Chris Hayes: No. Brewster Kahle: People will do things because they can get some positive feedback from each other and share where they can, as long as it doesn’t cost them any money. So why don’t we make it so that giving things away doesn’t cost you? And that was sort of the premise of libraries and the Internet Archive. Chris Hayes: This point, just to go back, I’d like to hear some of your thoughts just to sync up with the monologue about the Internet I fell in love with, and again, I always sound like an old man talking about, you know, kids these days and in my youth, whatever. But the Internet I fell in love with is largely non-commercial enterprise in which people were motivated by all kinds of things, some of which were noble and some of which were base. I mean, you know, humans are humans. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But almost none of it was pecuniary, right? So people might want to, you know, get into a flame war because they wanted to assert domination or they were incorrigible contrarians and like to argue or they might want to share really cool stuff because creating cool stuff and showing it off as fun, the whole sort of spectrum of human motivation. But it was not commercialized and it was not done explicitly for profit, and it wasn’t done for profit at scale in which engineers are working very hard to figure out how to hack people’s attention such that you can maximize monetization. And I would like you to talk a little bit about why you think that’s an important ethos to preserve, because that is part of what you’re doing. And if it is an important ethos to preserve. Brewster Kahle: There’s a role on all sides of this. And so most people just want to be heard. They want to have some recognition. They don’t want to feel like they’ve been taken advantage of. And we develop search engines to help people, guide people to these even obscure topics to go and find your people no matter where they are in the world. Fabulous. But you also have people that wanted to make money by publishing on the net. And that’s not bad. Chris Hayes: No. Brewster Kahle: As long as if they’re not exclusionary about it or if they’re not sort of this platform that’s trying to control a whole media type, then that’s the controlling aspect that is really causing so much trouble out there, is not so much that, you know, a kid wants to sell his song off of his garage band. Actually, it’s really hard to do that. And that’s, I think, one of the faults is we made peer-to-peer selling so difficult and we basically have to sign up to go and put on iTunes or Amazon or the like. We’re trying to make a more decentralized web so that you can go and have people go and participate in their communities, sell a little bit if they can make some money off of it. And, you know, most people aren’t going to buy your rock and roll song, sorry, but at least it’s a possibility. And let’s keep it so that there’s no central points of control. And we have got people vying for monopoly control now in such a way that it’s really debilitating. So while we’re trying to keep up with the social media, some of those are very locked down. So you can’t even keep a record of it, even that’s sometimes the only way politicians are going and communicating their points of view. That’s not good. Chris Hayes: Oh, that’s interesting. So there are parts of the Internet on platforms that are essentially closed to the archiving that you’re doing. Brewster Kahle: Yes, but some of them are opening up. Reddit just yesterday went and said, yeah, we’re closing up to the AI guys, but the Internet Archive is A-okay, which we’re kind of happy about and other research organizations. So I think that going and showing that there is a role for libraries that’s different from Babylon is a good thing. But the control aspects and I wouldn’t say it’s just the platforms that, you know, you’re normally talking about the Internet platforms, but the publisher platforms and the back ends of these things, the television networks that are very closed, the book publishers, the magazine, the academic journals just so closed. Chris Hayes: So you’re saying when you say closed, what do you mean by that technically? Brewster Kahle: That it doesn’t operate the same way it used to, that basically libraries and people would buy things in the old days, they preserve them and then they would make them available to themselves or their communities through lending and they’d interoperate. But what we’ve got now is organizations going and saying, no, we’re going to want to watch every page turn. We’re going to want to be able to take that thing down. We want to be able to change that e-book. We want to go and make it so libraries don’t own anything in the digital world. That’s the problem. And there’s been lots of talk of the social media networks and the issues around that, you know, true issues. But I don’t think we’re really looking at some of the back end organizations that are exerting a level of control because they can in this digital world for surveillance and ultimately being able to change and delete things without anybody having a record of it. No libraries are allowed. Chris Hayes: Right. So if we think broadly, not just I mean, so when we started talking about this and when the way I think about the Wayback Machine specifically, which is just one part of the Internet Archive, right, is this all this sort of digital ephemera, you know, someone’s LiveJournal, right, someone’s MySpace page, someone’s political blog. When you start moving up to entities that are big corporate interests that are producing intellectual property that they want to charge people for, which, again, as you said, is all well and good, there’s a different set of questions, right. So, let’s talk about a show that streamed. This is a great example. The archivist in you, the librarian in you says what should be possible is that the library buys that show. It then owns it the way that a library owns a copy of Shakespeare’s completed works or a library owns the bestselling novel, it just came out, you know, by Miranda July and then can lend it to people, right? Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And what I’m hearing from you is that the entities are like, no, we’re not going to sell you our show for you to just have archived and lend to people we want to control if anyone sees. We want complete control of that model, we’re not going to abide basically. Brewster Kahle: You got it. That’s exactly what’s going on now. So libraries are not allowed from the big publishers. The small publishers are still, you know, in there trying to be, you know, publishers that we love. But the big corporate monopoly companies are basically making it so that libraries cannot own a digital e-book. So when you borrow an e-book from your local library, you think you are. It’s actually going and just being redirected into the publisher’s databases and they are surveilling everything about it and they’re changing and deleting those books at will. And so this is a future that is absolutely dystopian and counter to what it is we should be able to do now. We just want these people to sell. And it’s not it’s not happening. Chris Hayes: Right. You’re not saying give it to us. You’re saying we want to buy these things from you the way that a library buys things and then make it available. Brewster Kahle: Absolutely. And what libraries do is they often not just buy the blockbusters, but they buy the local content from the local authors and all of that’s being shut down and shuttled into these very few platforms And with the surveillance thing, it’s, you know, there’s a long history of libraries getting surveilled and then their patrons getting rounded up and bad things happening to them based on the books they’ve read. This isn’t good. So the libraries have always been a bastion of privacy. It’s part of our ethics. And so how do we go and move into this digital world in such a way we have many winners? So we have many authors, many publishers, many bookstores, many libraries and everyone a reader. That’s the world that we can live in. But it’s not the thing that we’re seeing happen at the tops of these mega corporations. Chris Hayes: That, I think, brings us to some of the legal issues the Internet Archive is facing. And maybe I’ll bring in Kyle Courtney here, who I know is also sort of read in on this. So a bunch of publishers have sued the Internet Archive. And Kyle, what is the lawsuit about? What are they contending? Kyle Courtney: So ultimately, I think the lawsuit is about to prevent libraries from being able to loan in the digital space now and in the future. Right. So if we imagine that loaning has always happened at the circulation desk. When it moves into digital space, this is what Brewster was referring to, they say, no, we haven’t sold you anything. We’re going to force you into renting your collections with these terms that basically eviscerate the library mission. So the case is about a methodology of lending called controlled digital lending, which I co-wrote in a paper in 2018. And it’s been endorsed by national library organizations, regional library consortia, specific library systems, individual librarians, legal experts. Ultimately, though, it comes down to this. We are being told, libraries, the royal, we are being told we’re not capable of entering the digital space with our same mission that we had. Now, of course, the library mission relies on the ability to acquire creative works, which, by the way, serves the economic purpose of copyright, right? We buy the stuff, right. This is not free. We’re spending money, millions and millions of dollars, and then distribute those works to the public, right. I always think this is a constitutional narrative, right. We’re promoting the progress of science and the useful arts by distributing those materials to this. And so that I think that the library loaning programs are part of this copyright cycle. Now, this method called controlled digital lending, which, again, digitally replicates what happens at the circulation desk, is more efficient. It’s less ableist. It’s good for folks that are remote, that can’t get to the library, senior citizens, et cetera, especially during our pandemic closures. But it’s through the lens of something called fair use, which is a copyright exception. And I’m sure that your show has heard about fair use before. I’m sure you have heard about fair use before. But this is basically saying, hey, copyright doesn’t mean total control of the copyrighted work. It does not. It is some control, certainly, but there are generous exceptions granted to users, to patrons, to libraries to be able to circulate those materials in service of that promoting progress of science and the useful arts. And again, I want to be very clear, libraries and their systems represent the commitment to both the economic and access parts of the copyright cycle. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: All right. So just tell me how does digital lending work under the scheme that you would like it to work? And what don’t they like about? Like, I still am having a hard time with this. What do you want to do and what do they not want you to do? Kyle Courtney: Yeah. So, imagine this. So, libraries spent millions and millions of dollars of collections that are in print, that are on our shelves, right. We have those books. We have paid for them. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: We control them. Chris Hayes: You own them. Kyle Courtney: We own them. We should be able to lend them without permission. Chris Hayes: Right. The publisher that you don’t have to check with the publisher. Kyle Courtney: Right, we do not. You can lend a book, yes, a thousand times and you never pay the rights holder again, right. You’re lending that book and you’re making sure it stays. You know, you bind the glue on the board. You know, you make sure that book lasts. That’s the way public libraries especially get a return on investment in their communities. And they’re holding on to those books. Many of those books never made the jump to digital, right. Maybe they’re not popular. Maybe they didn’t do well. But they were important for preservation and access purposes. So the controlled digital lending methodology says, okay, we take that book we bought and we digitize it and then we hide it away so it cannot be loaned. It’s not on the shelf. It’s not in a room, and we hide it away. Then we use that surrogate digital version to loan to one person at a time, just like we do at the SERC (ph) desk, except it’s digital. And then that person reads it, keeps it for two weeks, three hours, whatever the loaning period is, and then it automatically returns back to the library. Chris Hayes: So you’ve just created a digital version, a digital token of the physical book. But you’ve been the one that digitized it. Kyle Courtney: Yes. And more importantly, when the person’s reading it and looking at it, they can’t download it. They can’t copy it. They can access it. It prevents them from spreading Chris Hayes: It’s protected. Kyle Courtney: It’s protected. Using the same software that the publishers use for their e-books. I want to be very clear. Brewster has this system tight and perfect. And that’s what they’re suing about. Chris Hayes: Okay, so Brewster, the Internet Archive uses this method. Brewster Kahle: Yeah, we own a lot of books. We’ve been digitizing these and making them available for ourselves. But also hundreds of other libraries have been doing this all since 2011. This is common library practice. And we even stay away from the most recent five years just to, you know, knock off the commercial angle of these Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: And then we weave them back into Wikipedia. We basically fulfill a couple million links in Wikipedia so you can click to open to write the right page. What’s interesting is people only look at these books usually for a couple of minutes. They’re checking a fact. It’s not beach reading. You just don’t do that. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: You know, it’s basically you’re using it like you’re standing in a library. Chris Hayes: And why are they suing on this? Kyle Courtney: Because they feel that the licensed e-books, again, the forced rentals they’ve put upon libraries, should be the only way that -- Chris Hayes: The only standard. Kyle Courtney: -- the only standard that a patron can access at work, right? Licensing culture is out of control. You use Hulu and Netflix as an example, right. We don’t own any of that, nor are we likely to. My fear is as a result of this case, libraries become the next Hulu or Netflix and that says, you know, last day to read this book, August 31st, because that’s what happens. These books expire and they leave our communities unless we pay more. Chris Hayes: So the standard that you’re using is the CDL standard, which is we digitize books. We have tight controls on them so we could lend them one at a time. They can exist in digital space such that they could be used to check a fact. They could add to our store of knowledge. We don’t like that protocol because we don’t control it. Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Chris Hayes: We want to control the digital versions of our intellectual properties -- Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- such that we kind of hold always a sort of veto that it can expire. Like, we’re licensing it, which means we could always take it back. Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Ultimately, you don’t own it. You are a custodian of it for the time being Kyle Courtney: You’re a renter. They’re the landlords and we’re the renters. Libraries are being turned into renters. Chris Hayes: Right. So that’s actually very useful. So the library model is an ownership model because you guys buy the books and you own your collections. That’s the asset you have. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: And that’s what you make public. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: And they want to convert it to a rental. Kyle Courtney: Absolutely, because I understand why they would want us not to loan a book a thousand times and only pay once. They want us to get a thousand licenses, which is a revenue capital stream that looks much better to them than the -- Chris Hayes: Oh, so they want to charge you for each rental? Kyle Courtney: Oh, God, yes. There’s checkouts, price checkouts, there’s 26 checkouts and you have to buy the book again. There’s in a year or two years, these works expire. There’s many methods they use to prevent us from owning. Chris Hayes: Wait. I just want to make sure I understand this. You’re saying that’s the current market model for digital -- Kyle Courtney: Yes. Brewster Kahle: Yes. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- digital books from the large publishers. Brewster Kahle: Twenty six times and then it’s -- Kyle Courtney: Gone. Brewster Kahle: -- gone. It costs hundreds of dollars just to get those 26 potential lends. Chris Hayes: Okay, I know. Okay. I’m going to publish a book next year through a major publisher, Penguin Random House. And so walk me through. So I’m going to publish this book from Penguin Random House. Let’s say Kyle or Brewster or any librarian wants to get a digital version of that book to lend digitally from their library. How does that work? Kyle Courtney: So the publisher says, okay, here’s the terms by which this book is lent. Now, sometimes they say no libraries for the first two months. They’ve done that before. They embargo it, right? Or sometimes they say, okay, the average person gets it for $19.99, libraries path to pay $199 and they only get it, yeah -- Chris Hayes: Oh, $199 -- Kyle Courtney: Dollars. Yeah, Chris Hayes: But for multiple rentals, presumably. Kyle Courtney: No, not necessarily. Libraries pay five to ten times as much for access to e-books than the average consumer does off of a regular e-book site. Chris Hayes: Really? Kyle Courtney: Absolutely. And so we’re being punished for our mission, right. I call it a tax on libraries for being able to loan or provide access book. And Chris, this is what I’m talking about. The convenience of e-books comes at the expense of the library admission. And I don’t think that’s a tradeoff. But your book will be offered to libraries for under a twenty six check on model or under a multiple seat model or a pay for loan model. Or, you know, you can loan it as many times you can in a year, but then it goes away, it expires and disappears. So it depends on the publisher. It depends on the vendor, yeah. Chris Hayes: Okay, so this is clarifying. So the point is that there is a straightforward market logic here, I mean, someone once said to me, and it’s always stuck with me, that if libraries didn’t exist, there’s no way we could create them now. Kyle Courtney: I fully believe that. I think Brewster might too. I fully believe that. Chris Hayes: Hundred percent. Like, you couldn’t go to the publishers and all of them and say, hey, we’re going to create a non-profit, non-commercial, you know, in some cases subsidized or municipally-owned system that just gives away your product for free. Kyle Courtney: Now it’s not for free. I want to be very clear. Libraries pay through the nose, right. It’s not free. Chris Hayes: Yes. But to the consumers, yes, right. The point being that right now I can, from where I sit right now, right, I can walk to the library and borrow “Trust” by Hernan Diaz, or I can walk three blocks the other direction to my local bookstore and I can buy Hernan Diaz -- Kyle Courtney: Absolutely. Chris Hayes: Hernan Diaz’s “Trust.” And there’s not a ton of products about which that is true. Brewster Kahle: That is true. Chris Hayes: Right? If I want, like, you know, if I want, you know, a new basketball, you know, I’m going to buy a new basketball. There’s nowhere I could borrow a basketball. I mean, maybe I would go to the Y, but like the point is that, and I think the reason that you would say, I’m going to take your side of the argument here, is that like information is just different than other products because it has a social, civic, cultural role, right? Kyle Courtney: I’ll go one further. Libraries are supposed to be immune from market forces like that to provide information to their communities, right, so I agree. There is that marketization of this business model, but libraries are a special slice of the pie. And that’s what we’re trying to get done here. Brewster Kahle: And they’re widely supported. So, it’s about 20% of all trade publishing is the revenue comes from libraries -- Chris Hayes: Wow. Brewster Kahle: -- and what libraries are getting is less and less and less for that. So for instance, uh, the “Diary of Anne Frank” costs $27 per student for a 12-month subscription. Chris Hayes: Wait, that’s not public domain? Brewster Kahle: No. Kyle Courtney: It should be. Chris Hayes: Oh, right. Because the copyright keeps getting extended. Right, right, right. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Or you take Mary Grove College, a college that was focused on social justice and they announced their closure and they had this unbelievably great library. They donated it to the Internet Archive and we digitized 70,000 books, but now these publishers demanded that we take 14,000 of those social justice books, most of them are decades old, off the library shelves so no one can really effectively have access to these. And this is not Chris’s newest book. This is the long tail of books. Libraries support a broad range of authors and what we’re being told is you can only have bestsellers and you can’t even have them. You can just have to make it so that your patrons can go and give over their private information to us, the publisher. Chris Hayes: Just to be clear to loop back around because I think it’s important when I was using the thought experiment in my book. I mean, it’s not a thought experiment. It’s going to come out next year and hopefully you guys can go get it at your local library, I would hope. That that isn’t what’s at issue in the suit because that’s not the CDL stuff. The stuff that’s like the new to the market e-books is already being operated under these licenses that you’re talking about. The thing they’re suing about are the digitized books. Brewster Kahle: Well, we would want to go and buy one copy, just one -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- copy so that it could be put into Wikipedia so people could fact check out of your book and be able to refer to it. Not going through these checkout systems that often cost several dollars per ding -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- to go and even go into a fact check on. That’s what we’d like to be able to do. Penguin Random House has repeatedly refused to sell e-books. This could all be solved by they’re just selling e-books. Chris Hayes: They don’t sell them. They license them. Kyle Courtney: Right. Brewster Kahle: They license them in these draconian terms. But so we end up buying hard cover books that we digitize and then we make one copy available. But through this lawsuit, 500,000 books have now disappeared off of the digital bookshelves. This is a devastating blow for people that would never have bought these books. And the substitute of these books and also like page numbers, if you had a page number reference, I have never seen any book with a page number that you could refer to. So citations fail. We have the equivalent of what we were trying to fix in the web, a fix in the physical book world. And they’re basically saying, nope, that people cannot have access, digital access to the published works of a book form. Chris Hayes: So Kyle, the publisher’s lawsuit was successful at the district court level, right? Kyle Courtney: So the district court found it not to be a fair use. Brewster Kahle: So we lost. Chris Hayes: Well, meaning it was -- Kyle Courtney: Define success. I mean, it’s on appeal right now, right? Chris Hayes: Well, it was successful for the plaintiffs. I mean, the plaintiffs won. Kyle Courtney: I agree. So they wanted the lower court -- Chris Hayes: I’m not saying if they should have, it’s not a normative question. It’s a descriptive question about reality. Kyle Courtney: Sorry. I get very careful with my answers. Chris Hayes: The publishing, they sued. They said that the method you’re using was not fair use. They sued and they were found to be -- Brewster Kahle: Infringement. Chris Hayes: -- it was copyright infringement. And now that’s on appeal, right? Brewster Kahle: Yes. Kyle Courtney: So on Friday, the 28th of June is the oral argument. All the briefs have been filed with the second circuit. And this appeal is focusing on a few things, right? That through the control digital lending process, there are legally and economically significant aspects of physical lending that we want the court to review through the lens of fair use. You know, that it continues to preserve the power of print, right? A library has significant legal usage rights and great fiscal value in its collections and public library systems have spent millions of dollars in building these collections. And so the appeal is about a proper reading of the fair use analysis to control digital lending, but it’s also to reverse something that was stunningly disruptive, I think could be if it continues, which is anyone that has a donate now button or, you know, donate books or donate things, if you’re a nonprofit website, suddenly that’s a commercial action, according to the district court, that may weigh -- Chris Hayes: Oh, wow. Kyle Courtney: -- against your fair use and that cannot stand either. Chris Hayes: Oh, that’s interesting because fair use, right? Because part of fair use right is that we’re not trying to monetize this thing. It’s in the public domain. And so one of the findings of the district court level is that a donate now button is essentially commercial activity that it might vitiate your claim for fair use. Kyle Courtney: Yeah, which is just absolutely wrong on every level. I mean, it ignores -- Chris Hayes: Yeah, it seems wrong. Kyle Courtney: -- the major precedent in the second circuit. And so we’re hoping that second circuit court of appeals will hear that as well. Chris Hayes: Are there broader implications just for like the knowledge universe that we’re entering into? Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: Yes. So obviously, so I’m also a fan of open access and the knowledge economy is very important. I think certainly because we’re talking about control digital lending, you know, the books that we have on our shelves, for 20th century works that are in libraries, especially, you know, we refer to this as a 20th century black hole, right? They’re not available for purchase. No new copies are made. They’re unlikely to make the jump to digital, but they’re important works that need to be read, accessed and utilized by our modern patron. And by the way, our modern patron is younger and younger. And if something’s not digital, it’s as if it does not exist. So I would hate to see the generations be unable to access all of these works that we have preserved. And then the future for them is also bleak because it’s all licensing, whether it’s iTunes or Amazon or Netflix. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So one of the great ironies here, right, to go back to where this conversation started, Brewster, with the notion of the Library of Alexandria, a single repository for all human knowledge and cultural production and, you know, all captured in one place, archived, stored, made accessible. At one level, right, I have more access. I mean, it’s a crazy thing that at any moment I have access to anything and I think about this all the time. You know, when you sit down, I have a long riff on this in my forthcoming book about, you know, the attention forcing mechanism of the video store, which is that you had to go to the video store and you had to figure out what you’re going to watch that night. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And then you were making a committed decision that you come back, you explain to everyone at the house what you’ve gotten. Maybe they like it, maybe they don’t. But that’s what you’re going to watch, right. And at any given moment now, so at one level, we have this sort of overwhelming choice of I have access to so much of the world’s knowledge. I can watch anything at any time. But then there are these black holes emerging, huge swaths of things that are winking out of existence. And I remember, you know, there are movies that you can no longer get. There are, you know, a variety of places have taken shows off their service. And I know showrunners and actors who were on a show that’s now it just doesn’t exist anymore or anywhere. When Turner Classic Movies, there was some discussion in the corporate reordering that that might be taken off. And there was this like rebellion of folks, including, I think, like Martin Scorsese and everyone, because it’s like, this is the only way we can see these films. So there’s a weird paradox, Brewster, here, which is that we have access to more than anything ever before. Brewster Kahle: Yes. Chris Hayes: But the possibility of total death, of black hole, of things winking out of existence is also as present as it’s ever been. Brewster Kahle: Absolutely. It is so easy to get something on everything. And thank God for Wikipedia, another pillar of the open world. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: I love the line from the headline, Current Affairs, said the truth is paywall, but the lies are free. That we basically have this world that we’re coming to, where things are more and more promoted. And if we’re going to have people be educated, be ready for elections, we need to be able to think critically. We need to be able to quote what people have said. We need to be able to compare and contrast it. We need to be able to say whether historical events actually happen. This requires getting access. It’s the wonder of the Internet. It’s so freaking easy. I mean, all of the words in the Library of Congress would fit in two hard drives that cost less than a month’s rent. Our opportunity for educating people on a global scale is with us. And we have money. There’s a support for all this on libraries and things. It’s not going away. But we also have this sort of, oh, my God, I can control and clamp down and sell less for more is an ethos that we’re seeing. The St. Charles City County Library in Missouri is probably going to close this summer because of the e-book budget problem. So we’re having libraries hit with bannings and the like. We’re having them hit by budget shortages. We’re hitting them with license problems that we’ve covered for the last half an hour here extensively. But we’re now having also the judiciary starting to judge against libraries in ways that we haven’t seen in 100 years. I mean, the Carnegie Libraries exist because we have legislature and judicial support for educating a broad swath of people. And I don’t know, the United States that I grew up in is such a steeped in that tradition of the Carnegie thing. It’s really hard for people to fathom that all of these forces, political, judicial, legislative, funding are all going against a tradition that built America out of a set of immigrants and brought us together to be able to know how to work as a populace. And all of that is in, well, some of it is going to be judged again by an appellate group in lower Manhattan, and we’ll see what it is they decide towards the fate of libraries as we know them. Chris Hayes: So that’s a stark way to talk about it. I mean, is that is that how you see this case, Kyle, that like this case will determine the fate of libraries as we know them? Kyle Courtney: I mean, it’s a slippery slope into a licensed-only culture in which libraries cannot exist and missionless challenge. I do agree that a lot of people say, oh, this is just about the Internet Archives Open Libraries program. It’s a narrow focus. I don’t think that’s true. It’s about libraries entering and being supported in the digital space and through the use of either licensing or litigation. That’s a one-two punch, really will threaten the library mission now and in the future. That’s why, you know, I have been fully supporting the Internet Archive in this mission this entire time, because they represent a library that’s doing cutting edge, access oriented programming that was woefully needed. Chris Hayes: Do you think Brewster and I’ll go to you first and Kyle that I wonder also how much the kind of intellectual culture around this has changed? I mean, obviously, there are pecuniary motives for the big publishers, whatever. And that that is what it is. They have the incentives they have, and those are what they are. But it’s interesting to me this model of licensing, it’s amazing how much it’s crept up, like people’s printers, the software that, you know, now you don’t actually store your own information anymore. Like it used to be the case that I would and I do this now still because I kind of reject the, you know, all the cloud stuff, which I use for backup. But I am old fashioned. It’s like I want my files that I own on my physical hard drive, which is right here in my house that I control. And now everything is a license, you know, the software, you don’t buy anymore. Software-as-a-Service. Your hard drive space is essentially licensed. You sign a license and now it says, oh, you want to save this to Microsoft OneDrive? It’s like, wait, what? What are we doing here? What can I save it to my hard drive? I know where my hard drive is. I control my hard drive. Well, no, why don’t you just save it to OneDrive? It’s like, okay, here’s the end user license agreement. Okay, scroll through 5,000 words, click, okay. What did I just sign? I don’t know. Did you just say did I just click yes, that you can take anything in there and sell it or publish it? I have no idea. I just signed some license agreement for you to store my data. And this model is so ubiquitous, just even in like consumer life, Brewster. It increasingly is the life, it is the model for interaction with anything digital. Brewster Kahle: Well, we have things that we can do. The technologists are working on decentralized web technology, which is encouraging and please cover it. You as an author, Chris, can go to your publisher next year and say, I want my books to be sold, really honest to God’s sold in the same sense that my hard copies are sold to a library, I want an e-book sold so that they don’t get a license. They get a receipt, you know, after they pay money for it and just charge the same amount as an e-book is a book. There was this sort of like, oh, everything’s new again. We can repaint all of the rules. The powerful can become even more powerful because of this new technology. And they’re taking advantage of that. But we can also make it so that it’s a much more of a people’s thing where there’s broad support for authors. There’s broad support for publishers. We can have no centralized points of control. That was the dream of the Internet that I signed on to. It is possible. Wikipedia, Internet Archive, there are lots of nonprofits that are doing some of this. It’s a choice. We even have news organizations that are going open access and they’re making it work. The Internet Archive had 150,000 people click donate to the Internet Archive last year. That’s kind of awesome. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: You know, because we’re kind of a back end thing. People know they’re on Wikipedia. They often don’t know they’re on the Internet Archive. But 150,000 said this is important to keep alive. And maybe it’s because they were Grateful Deadheads or they like their flash or their old time radio or their whatever it is that they like. But they know that they have to support the things that they love, that there are mechanisms to make an economy work where there are lots of winners, the people get what they want, but it doesn’t play into one corporate control panel. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: So, of course, I agree with what Brewster said. Chris, I think you have a natural inclination for being maybe a collection development librarian or archivist because you’re like, I want my stuff right here and physically access it. And I talk with a lot of folks across the United States and libraries that are out there. The questions that are coming from patrons and folks that are aware of this case in general and stuff are interesting. But the answer from the publishers and rights holders is always more licensing. That’s the answer to everything, right? No fair use, get a license. No text data mining, get a license. No AI training, get a license. Everything is licensing. And this answer of licensing threatens the purpose, values and missions of all libraries. It undermines the ability of the public, right, the taxpayers to access the materials that are purchased with their money, right, for use in public libraries and state institutions. And further, I think it’s short sighted is what you’re saying, right? You’re like, how come I can’t get this stuff anymore? How can we have access to stuff? We have a 20th century black hole. We have swaths of information that just will never be released again unless you pay a license. So it’s not in the best interest of library patrons, the public at large. But that kind of knowledge economy that you’re discussing, that we need to be able to provide these materials to everyone. Chris Hayes: You know, it’s funny, too, as you talk about the licensing, I mean, on the flip side, on the other side of this question about fair use is AI, right, where now you’ve got this like insane situation where everyone put everything on the Internet for public use. And then a bunch of companies sent their large language learning models and fed it all that stuff, not for the purpose that the Internet Archive exists, which is to make it publicly accessible, but to train large learning models to, you know, talk like people in a chatbot, basically, or do whatever they do. And then monetize it, you know. So, I realize that the publishers are the are the quote, unquote “bad guys” in this lawsuit from your perspective, but they’re now suing. Now, there’s going to be a bunch of lawsuits on the other side. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: Right? On exactly this, in which you’re already seeing publishers and I think a whole bunch of, you know, entities that publish or produce or own the intellectual property on content, suing the AI people to say you can’t just take this stuff to make your models and be okay with it. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. I would suggest what we need is a rule of law, not rule of contract. Chris Hayes: Yes. Right. Brewster Kahle: What happens when you have a rule of contract is you have very big people just bludgeoning it out with lawyers. Chris Hayes: Right. Yes. Brewster Kahle: And nobody that has lots of lawyers are going to be at that table. So we’ll end up with a deal between these publishers and, you know -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Right. Brewster Kahle: -- the big AI companies. But the idea I’d love to see, we have a new tool in town. It’s kind of cool. Let’s go and use it for some big, hard problems like health care or climate inventions. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: Or there are things that we could go as libraries. It could be the research libraries day. The research libraries have been basically holding on to these materials. Why would you read agricultural records of Argentina from the 1930s? We happen to have them. No human is going to do that, but machines do. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: And unless these lawsuits make it so that it’s taken out of the possibility of the public sphere -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- and only lands with the very wealthy. And people usually don’t think that next step through. The United States the last time that AI came around, it was Google. They basically hoovered up other people’s websites and made a search engine out of it. And they were allowed by law in the United States to do that. Chris Hayes: And it was important they did because if they weren’t, then we wouldn’t have the Internet. Kyle Courtney: Absolutely. Brewster Kahle: Absolutely. The dotcom boom happened in the United States because of law and -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- judiciary allowing that to happen Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: It did not happen in Europe or Japan. You notice there’s no search engine in Europe. There’s no search engine in Japan. It’s not because they’re stupid. It’s because their laws sided with the publishers. And if we go and do that in this AI round and I’m not, you know, just trying to shill -- Chris Hayes: That’s Internet. Brewster Kahle: -- for the big guys, I want the little guys. I want every library to go and take their collections or take the ornithology information from Cornell and around all of the ornithologists and start training models. If we make that illegal based on this, we will lose out on a major opportunity in the United States. And I’ll tell you, Europe has seen around this corner and they’ve already made regulations allowing cultural heritage institutions and research organizations, nonprofits to train AIs. Japan went further and said, we’re not going to step out of this next level of innovation. We’re going to allow it. Let robots read. In the United States. It’s just a free for all. We don’t have a legislature that’s really guiding things very well. And we’ll see what happens in the judiciary. So it’s a new game. And innovation, is it going to be grassroots or is it only going to be a few gigantic players that have enough lawyers to sue themselves into a deal with these gigantic publishers? Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: That’s where I see this is going. And I’m a big fan of a game with many winners. I want to see libraries and archives be able to bring their materials to bear under the right circumstances. Maybe it’s nonprofit works. Maybe it’s these, you know, nonprofit models to be able to do great things with these tools to help solve some of the big problems we’ve got. Chris Hayes: That’s interesting. It is very interesting. You know, all my feelings about AI are sort of, I would say, instinctual, impulsive, visceral and not -- Brewster Kahle: Careful. Chris Hayes: Yeah, I mean, they are. I mean, I’m thinking about it a lot, but I don’t feel like I have a fixed view on things. I’m sort of open to persuasion on a bunch of things. There’s a bunch of it that I find like weird and crass and like I’m being -- Brewster Kahle: It’s early days. They’re weird. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And there’s a lot of like shoving a solution to me without a problem. Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Like you need to buy this solution. It’s like, what is this solving for? It’s like, well, okay. Well, I don’t know if I need it. Brewster Kahle: Oh, you’re talking to archivists. So you remember the dotcom boom? Do you remember when you got warm cookies and milk delivered to your door? It’s just our dog food shipped through the mail. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: It was just -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Brewster Kahle: There was this weird, wonderful things that came about. Most of it made no sense. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: But it was kind of cool. And people believed and they put their dreams into this new technology. And right now, people are putting their dreams and their fears into this AI thing. Let’s shape it to be something that serves us. Let’s go and actually have some rules and guardrails on it by legislatures, not just -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: -- corporate rule. Chris Hayes: Yes. That line rule of law, not rule of contract, is a really important one, because you’re right. That’s so much the way this all gets settled in the U.S. is large litigation between powerful entities fighting each other and working out some settlement between tem as opposed to -- Brewster Kahle: Right. The people are not at that table. Chris Hayes: Yeah, we are a culture. Brewster Kahle: They are on there. Chris Hayes: We’re a culture that litigates rather than regulates. Generally, that’s how things work here. Kyle Courtney: Oh, well, that’s why there’s over 30 lawsuits currently in the courts about -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kyle Courtney: --  and by the way, it’s mostly books. Now there’s some music on there, too. You know, just last week, the major music labels sued some AI startup music companies. Chris Hayes: Yeah Kyle Courtney: But again, the answer, I just want to say, it’s the same answer we’re seeing in the CDL case to bring this together for a moment. The answer is licensing, right? So I’ve been in many AI discussions room where they’re like, you want to use our stuff, you want to train, get a license, get permission. That’s the only way to do it. And thankfully, the rule of law is not that, right? We have text and data mining. We have Google Books. We have Google Images. We have all these things where you can copy the entire thing, the whole thing, use it for something new and different and allow that technology to exist. So I think we have our answers through the rule of law already. But all these cases, all this litigation is going to slow down the entry for nonprofit, right -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: -- research based. And, you know, Brewster and I are waving our arms saying we’re not mega companies We’re not for profit things. We’re researchers that want to do text and data mining. We’re high school students that want to experiment with AI. All of these things should be able to be done in the nonprofit educational standpoint, where libraries have been planting their flag for forever. Chris Hayes: Brewster Kahle is a digital librarian at the Internet Archive. He’s perhaps best known for the Wayback Machine. Kyle Courtney is a lawyer, librarian, director of copyright and information policy for Harvard Library, co-founder of Library Futures, which aims to empower the digital future of America’s libraries. That was a totally fascinating conversation about something I knew literally nothing about. It was one of my favorite kinds of conversations. Kyle Courtney: Oh, my pleasure. Brewster Kahle: Thank you very much, Chris. Chris Hayes: Once again, my great thanks to Brewster Kahle and Kyle Courtney. No decision has been made in this appeal yet. A decision may come this fall.

Unpacking WTH Project 2025 is with Thomas Zimmer: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 11:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/unpacking-wth-project-2025-thomas-zimmer-podcast-transcript-rcna160927,"Project 2025, also known as the Presidential Transition Project, is a collection of policy proposals from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The group’s 920-page “Mandate for Leadership” is an extremely granular playbook that includes sweeping policy changes aimed at reshaping and dismantling American government. It’s pretty alarming. With so much at stake, we thought it would be good to do a deep dive into what the document contains and what it could portend for a possible Trump second term. Thomas Zimmer is a historian at Georgetown University. He’s studied and written about Project 2025 extensively, including for his Democracy Americana newsletter on Substack. Zimmerman is also the host of the “Is This Democracy?” podcast. He joins WITHpod to discuss what Project 2025 proponents aim to accomplish, how the plans within the mandate reflect broader American right ideology and more. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Thomas Zimmer: Project 2025 is their declaration of war on this idea of America. That’s what this is. And so in many ways, this is on the ballot in November. Those are the stakes. And I think this is really, you know, in a fundamental way in November, it’s going to be a referendum on whether or not we want to continue down this path towards multiracial pluralistic egalitarianism or not. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Well, as we’ve been saying throughout this campaign year, covering campaigns are always a little bit speculative in this sense. We don’t know the future. And when someone’s elected to be president, you don’t know ultimately what they’re going to do because that lies out in the future. And you can make pretty good educated guesses, but sometimes there’s surprises. I don’t think people that had closely studied LBJ in the, you know, ‘50s and early ‘60s would necessarily have thought this will be the person that pushes through the most landmark civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, but that’s what happened. There were reasons to think that FDR, who at one point ran on austerity and balanced budgets, would sign the new deal. So there are surprises for sure. But as I keep saying, in this context, we have a unique situation where for the first time since the late 19th century, we have two men squaring off who both have records because they’ve both been presidents. And then there’s an additional way in which we have a pretty clear sense of what the future will hold in a Donald Trump presidency. And that is this extremely granular roadmap that has been put together by a bunch of sorts of right-wing activists and think tank folks and ex-government employees that’s called the Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project Mandate for Leadership. And you’ve probably heard about it as Project 2025. Now, interestingly enough, I saw some polling today that suggested only about one in four voters have heard of Project 2025. But it’s a pretty remarkable document because basically the kind of leading lights of the MAGA movement and American Republican conservatism writ large came together to basically say, you know, agency by agency in the federal government, these will be our objectives. This is how we intend to govern. This is what we plan to do with the executive power vested in us should we win the presidency. And it’s really clear and I think really alarming. There’s been a fair amount of coverage of it. “The New York Times” has been running a series about it. A lot of outlets have talked about it. We’ve talked about it on the show. But today it’s not quite a “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes” because we’re not comparing the records here. But it’s in line with that theme because I thought it’d take some time with someone that has spent a lot of time reading and thinking about Project 2025 to talk about what is in there, what does it portend for a possible Trump second term? And a great person to do that with is Thomas Zimmer, who’s a historian at Georgetown University. He writes about and studies the sort of anti-democratic tendencies in the American right since the 1930s. He has a Substack that’s called “Democracy Americana.” And on that Substack he has been writing about Project 2025 extensively. He’s read it and been writing about what it is and what it means and sort of putting it in a broader context of these anti-democratic tendencies, which I think are reflected in Project 2025. So, Thomas Zimmer, welcome to the program. Thomas Zimmer: Thank you so much for having me. Chris Hayes: First of all, just tell me how you got interested in Project 2025, like your entrance point into it. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah, I think I started hearing about it when it was launched about two years ago and then they published this, you know, this 920-page report which outlines their policy agenda. That is what you have been referencing, is what they call it mandate for leadership. That was actually published about a year ago. And at first, you know, it seemed like maybe that’s just, you know, whatever. They have some plans. They’re making plans. Who cares? There was some reporting about it, right, and I felt like maybe I should take a look at it, right, and get some sense of what it was. But I didn’t think it was going to be that important. But then when I started reading, I felt like, wait, they’re outlining their vision for America and how they want to impose it on the country in really the clearest way possible. And this is something that if you want people to know what the American right is all about and what they want to do to the country, this is the best way to clarify that for people. It’s not me telling them. It’s actually me telling people, look, it’s out there. Read it. Right? So I started digging into it. And I think I mean, just to be clear, this policy report is only one part of Project 2025. It goes even well beyond that. This is a massive planning operation. It’s also a massive hat hunting operation. They’re looking for personnel, thousands of people to staff the government. That’s all part of Project 2025. And the deeper you look at, the deeper you dig, the more I became convinced that this really is such a great insight into where the American right is today and really what they want to do to the country. Chris Hayes: So here’s my understanding of the problem that Project 2025 seeks to solve. And I think it’s similar in some ways to 1980, what we call the Reagan revolution. There are some echoes here, although I think this is much more sort of forthrightly anti-democratic and authoritarian than the Reagan revolution. But the basic sense is the structure of the federal government, particularly the federal agencies, are in some ways bound to a vision of governance that is antithetical to right-wing objectives because of the permanent civil service, because of the institutional cultures. This is something that Reagan thought as well, that they’re kind of the enemy. They are, in Trump’s words, the deep state, which is what he talks about a lot, right, in terms of the CIA and FBI. But more broadly, this idea that there’s a sort of set of institutions that are hostile to the most extremist imperatives of MAGA right-wing governance. And so you have to have a plan, both in terms of policy objectives, personnel and internal mechanics, to basically remake these places totally, to transform them ruthlessly. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: So as to turn them, the way that a virus turns a cell into a factory for producing more virus, that basically you need to take these organs, you need to take these cells that are the federal government agencies and turn them into actively places that will reproduce this kind of right-wing governance. Because if you don’t do that, then you’ll fail to achieve your objectives and that’s the general sense about much of the Trump agenda in the first term. Is that your understanding of it? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah, it’s really crucial to sort of understand the diagnosis from which all of this starts. They are convinced. They, meaning the people behind Project 2025. But this goes beyond just those people. The entire American right is very clear about the fact that they see the first Trump presidency as a failure, right? They are extremely disappointed with the first Trump presidency. And they’re extremely clear about the fact that when they first rose to power in 2017, Trump world had no concrete plans. They had no personnel to implement whatever plans they might come up with and just very little understanding of the vast and powerful machine that is the American government. They were not ready. And really, no one understands this more clearly than the right themselves. And they are determined to just not let that happen again and eliminate all of the hurdles that slowed them down or sabotaged them as they see it in Trump’s first presidency. And that is precisely those two levels, which is, one, we need plans. We need to know what we want to do. And two, we need the right kinds of people in place to actually implement those plans and not be, again, sabotaged like the first time around when they were running up against what they see, like a bunch of quote, unquote “woke bureaucrats” who would just, you know, sabotage everything they wanted to do. That is that is the whole plan. And that’s also why when you read about Project 2025 in mainstream coverage, you hear a lot about, oh, they want to dismantle government. And I think that’s really not what this is about. This is about sort of an authoritarian takeover of government. Yes, they want to dismantle certain parts of government, everything that can be used as a tool for like a more egalitarian, fairer society. That needs to go. But other parts of government, they want to mobilize and weaponize and not dismantle at all. They want to turn government into an instrument to impose their vision of society on the country. And I think that’s really something very different from dismantling the government. Chris Hayes: Yeah, that’s really well said and important. And there’s two things I think that are sort of important to note. One is, in some ways, the existence of the vast bureaucracy that is the federal government and the civil service and the Pentagon, for instance, like every administration comes in and is a little bowled over by this. I mean, it really is the case that the federal government is enormous, that it contains all sorts of organizations within it that have their own imperatives, that trying to get things done, even in the most benevolent sense, right, look, just trying to do good stuff. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: You can be really frustrating. I know people that worked in government and there’s a lot of people telling, you know, all the time. There’s a lot of lawyers saying you can’t do that. But at the same level, those are part of the checks, right, that like there’s a kind of, I would say, productive friction that is in some ways kind of the point between the restraining forces of the vast architecture and bureaucracy of the government -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and the imperatives of an administration. And that productive tension, which I think can be frustrating at a personal level to people, whatever your ideological inclination are, right, I know this for a fact. They view it as like a structural flaw they want to get rid of. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And they want to like truly reconceptualize the federal government from, and maybe this is a good place for us to start the Schedule F stuff, which is -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- a huge thing is that most of the people that work for the federal government are civil service employees, which means -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- they are not political appointees, which means you can’t come in day one and be like, you’re fired because we don’t like you, we want to bring in your own people. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And the reason for that is prior to the civil service reforms in the 19th century, the federal government looked a lot more like what a big urban machine, like the Chicago machine would look like. You get into power and then like you appoint all your partisan buddies to be postmasters. At the time, this was like, you know, these post office jobs is the big bank of jobs in the federal government. And then they kick favors upstairs and they go and do stuff for you. And it was basically like an enormous corrupt machine. Civil service reform was a way of doing away with that. It’s embodied in something called Schedule F, which is the -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- tell me a little bit about this structure, before we get to like the ideological -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- there’s a structural goal here, which is to remake the civil service and get rid of it as it’s currently constituted. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. So some people may remember this shortly before the 2020 election, Donald Trump signed an executive order, Schedule F, that’s what it was called, that was rescinded then by President Biden immediately upon taking office before it could really do any damage. But it was intended to fight the deep state and they are now Project 2025. And really, everyone on the right is determined to execute Schedule F as soon as they get another chance. It would convert tens of thousands of career civil service positions into political appointments. So, you know, there are about 4,000 or so political appointees across the American government. And every administration, when they come in, they look at all those political appointees and they usually, you know, they usually bring in about a thousand or so of their own people, you know, plus minus a little bit. But, you know, the vast majority of people who work in government are civil servants and they have job protections, right? And the Trump administration wants to come in and turn, again, tens of thousands of those career civil service positions into political appointments so that they can fire them. That’s the whole point, right? Because that would take away all the job protections that come with civil service because they don’t want any more independent experts and they don’t want competent bureaucrats. They want their own people. They want loyalists. They want ideological conformity because, again, that’s what they feel like sort of hampered them the first time around and they don’t want to let that happen again. Chris Hayes: I just want to, like, put a fine point on this -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- because this can all sound abstract. Like somewhere in the federal highway transportation bureaucracy, there are a bunch of civil engineers who have to evaluate, like, what the safe turning radius for a road is. Like if you’re doing a federal, you know, on a federal highway and on ramp or off ramp, they promulgate regulations. And there are people that are not ideologues or partisans. They’re civil engineers who evaluate this, right. And then there are people who manage those. Like, you don’t want that job, I think. You don’t want someone who’s got 20 years of experience doing that kicked out and replaced with someone who is like a right-wing vlogging influencer. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Because they’re going to be ideologically devoted to Donald Trump and they’ve been handpicked to put in to now run the bureau that’s going to figure out the turning radiuses. You want actual expertise there, but that’s kind of what’s on the table. I mean, I’m making up this specific example, but that sort of thing happens throughout the federal government in a million different ways. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. I mean, again, the whole point about these civil service protections is to say we need the federal government to be staffed with people who are not replaced every four years by whatever ideological criteria, but who are they are because of their expertise and because they can do the job that they are supposed to be doing. But this would change that. Now they’re saying, oh, we’re converting people in policy adjacent positions or policy advisory roles. But those terms are so vague that no one really knows what that means. And really, it would probably go down to even maybe like some administrative assistance somewhere in some agency because, you know, aren’t they also executing policy? So who knows, right? Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: Again, they’re explicitly talking about 50,000 people. All of this, of course, only makes sense if you have 50,000 of your own ideological loyalists that you can replace them with, because otherwise you’re just firing people and you have no one to come in. And that is why, again, part of all of this Project 2025 is also this really unprecedented headhunting operation where they are looking for, they’re vetting thousands and thousands of people, trying to find their type of ideologically pure right-wingers. Chris Hayes: Yeah, there’s this old saying in D.C. and I think it actually is a Reagan era that personnel is policy, right? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: That when you get people in and I’ve watched this in government up close, how true that can be. Maybe this is a good time to talk about, like, who’s doing this? Like, it’s not explicitly the Trump campaign, which they’ll tell you, although it’s a lot of people who are Trump aligned. And the idea is like this is a toolkit for whoever. This actually happened before the primary. So whoever was going to be the Republican president or nominee, it’s now Trump is the nominee. Who is actually doing this? Thomas Zimmer: Right. So we should probably say that planning operations are happening on several factions on the right are sort of coming up with their own plans right now. But what makes Project 2025 really stand out, even in this sort of universe of emerging right-wing planning, is that this is spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. And it stands out because it unites much of the conservative movement and the machine of think tanks and activists and lobbying groups behind this goal of installing a more effective, more ruthless right-wing regime as members of its advisory board. Project 2025 currently lists over 100 organizations and institutions. By the way, this is all online. If you just Google Project 2025, you’ll get right to it. You can click on it and then you can read this for yourself. If you look at the advisory board, it’s a who is who of right-wing actors, Alliance Defending Freedom, America First Legal Foundation, Center for Renewing America, Claremont Institute, Young America’s Foundation, Moms for Liberty. They’re all on there, right? And this is really why I believe this stands out. Again, it’s spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, which for decades has been the most influential, most really the power center of the conservative think tank world. They’re spearheading it, but they have managed to really unite much of the conservative machine behind this. And I think that’s what makes Project 2025 really so both interesting, but also threatening because this is what they what they have agreed to do. Chris Hayes: And Heritage is interesting, too, because it’s been around for decades. It’s always been at the center of conservative politics in Washington. It has taken a very MAGA-esque turn recently. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: Almost in its like tonal, all of its public communication and its president sound like Truth Social posts, like all caps -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- like truculent, trolling, aggressive, aggrieved, like it’s in that like Trumpian register, like everything they’re doing now. It used to be a little more like chin stroking -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- tonal, like we’re serious people -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and now it’s just like F.U. libs. Am I wrong about that or do you feel like that? Thomas Zimmer: Oh, no. No, absolutely. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: So, I mean, Heritage was established in 1973. And for the longest time, it’s associated itself with Reaganism and it was associated with Reaganism. But in recent years, they have gone in a decidedly more Trumpian direction. And Kevin Roberts, who took over as president of the Heritage Foundation at the end of 2021, he has been really key in this development. Roberts is not some moderate imposter who just pretends to be hardcore, you know, to blend in with the MAGA crowd. No, this guy comes from the religious right. He comes out of the world of reactionary Catholicism. He also, by the way, before he became the president of the Heritage Foundation, he also worked for a lobbying group in Texas that made the quote, unquote “moral case” for fossil fuels. So he’s like a hardcore culture warrior, but also fossil fuel industry, that type of thing. He holds a Ph.D. in history, you know, whatever that means. But this guy, again, he is in his own words, he has sort of defined the mission of the Heritage Foundation now as, quote, “institutionalizing Trumpism.” And they don’t mean this as sort of, you know, taming it. They mean it as making it more efficient, making it more effective. And he’s also been entirely clear about, you know, what his politics is. People may remember that in the summer of 2022, in the fall of 2022, the sort of neo-fascists in Italy came to power under Giorgia Meloni, and like Roberts was just ecstatic about that, right. Absolutely ecstatic. He was like, this is it. This is the model for American conservatives. And so, yeah, it’s very clear. These people are true believers. This is not some moderate Republican traditional conservatives. These people are all in. And Roberts is really, I think, indicative of how much the power centers of the right have radicalized towards Trump and Trumpism. Chris Hayes: So let’s stay on this personnel’s policy, because I think the civil service reforms that they envision are one of the biggest sorts of fulcrums here. Can you do that unilaterally? Like it’s just now clear to me that civil service, I think, is set by a set of statutory requirements passed through the years. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So can you unilaterally just be like we’re making 50,000 more political appointees or would that have to go through Congress? Thomas Zimmer: I mean, look, some of this is certainly legally questionable. And I’m certain that Schedule F, you know, if executed, would it would certainly be tested in court, especially now that the administration, the Biden administration, has just really, I think, has enacted a new rule that basically prohibits the kind of intervention that Schedule F envisions. This came down from the Office of Personnel Management basically saying, look, you can’t do this. So, if the Trump administration now wants to overrule that or change the rule, they would have to find a court that agrees with them. They would have to find a federal judge that says, yeah, that’s fine. Or they could ignore maybe the rule and just do Schedule F anyway. And then again, it would be tested in court. But I think, you know, here’s the thing. I think what we’ve learned over the past, if we didn’t know this already, what we’ve learned is that you can do a lot of things if you just ignore norms and precedents. A lot of this stuff doesn’t necessarily run-on law. It runs on norms. And if you are entirely willing to discard those and just do at the very least, you’ll get a lot of time to cause harm and damage. Chris Hayes: Before the courts catch up to you. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah, exactly right. And I think that is the problem here, right? You can say, oh, they can’t just do that. This strikes me as yeah, and maybe again, it will absolutely be tested. Chris Hayes: Well, the other lesson is that the law is whatever five right-wing justices say is. I mean -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- you know, you can make all sorts of preposterous claims and they might get a hearing. I mean, like the president is immune from, you know -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- sending SEAL Team six to assassinate political rivals. So, yeah, I mean, ultimately, this stuff will be sorted out by the courts and I think the courts did a decent job last time around of checking some of these imperatives and I think that’s not at all a foregone conclusion -- Thomas Zimmer: No. Chris Hayes: -- this time around. So my understanding is the parts I’ve read, it sort of breaks it up by agency -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- like different parts of the federal government, right. Thomas Zimmer: That’s right. Chris Hayes: So I think it’d be a little tedious to go through each one. So maybe just like what do you what do you see as the most important things for people to know about what’s being called for? We talked about this sort of structural change -- Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: -- to the way the very fabric of government personnel functions, like Trump toadies in positions way further down into the bureaucracy than were imaginable. I mean, you know, a 25x increase, right, in sort of political appointees or a 10x, I mean, depending on how it all shakes out. What do you see as the other top things to take away from this document? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. So, again, this is the part of Project 2025 that outlines a proper policy agenda. It’s like a 920-page report. It goes agency by agency, federal. Like you’ll find agencies in there that I believe few people have actually ever heard of, probably. And they go chapter by chapter. Again, I think it’s really important to understand, it operates on two level. On one level, this is a program to dismantle the state, right. And you see this, for instance, with Department of Education needs to go out. We don’t want it. They want to just completely abolish it, right? Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: That needs to go. Or for instance, when it comes to the EPA, any sort of climate change regulation, that all is out. It needs to go. We don’t want it. So that is sort of the dismantle part of this project. But then there is the weaponize and mobilize part. And that is sort of the idea to turn government into a tool that you can use for really only two purposes. One is to punish your enemies. And two is to impose this sort of vision of white Christian patriarchal order on American society. Now, you see this, for instance, in the Department of Health and Human Services, which is I mean, if you read it, it’s it has very little to do with public health at all. It’s entirely conceived as an instrument to impose a certain understanding of what, you know, a sort of heteronormative understanding of gender. There’s just man and woman, a heteronormative understanding of marriage, a sort of hardcore, pro-life, anti-abortion sort of approach. And that’s what the Department of Health and Human Services is for, right? It’s not about, oh, you know, public health in the broad sense. It’s about here’s what’s right. Here’s what they call it, the natural order. And here’s how we’re going to use this, you know, this machinery to impose that on society. So, for instance, the CDC, which on the one hand, they really hate because of COVID, right. So parts of the CDC, they want to dismantle and say never again can these bureaucrats, you know, tell us what to do in case of a pandemic. But then also they want to turn the CDC into sort of a sort of an all-knowing departmental institution where information about every single abortion in the entire country, including like the name of the people who are pregnant, the doctors, everyone who quote, unquote “helped” with the abortion, right. They explicitly say we’re going to use the CDC to do something against all this quote, unquote “abortion tourism” by, again, turning this into a repository for detailed information about every single abortion, entire country. And they want to force blue states to give that information to the CDC, which as of right now, California, for instance, doesn’t give that information to the extent it even has that information. It doesn’t give that information to the federal government. But they are saying we’re not going to accept that anymore. Every abortion in the country, we’re going to collect all this information at the CDC. And, you know, this is not a small government vision, right? That has nothing to do with small government or -- Chris Hayes: I got to say, that’s really -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- that’s deeply chilling, sense of saying. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, yes, absolutely. It absolutely is. But I mean, explicitly, again, that is in the chapter on the Department of Health and Human Service. And I think it captures that dichotomy, right? Parts of the CDC, dismantle. We don’t want it. But also, oh, nice, we can turn this into a tool for the kind of society we want to create here. Chris Hayes: So nationwide surveillance of pregnant people. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Chris Hayes: In states red or blue, states where it’s legal or not legal. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So that we just know who’s getting abortions. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, they’re being sort of ominous or they’re not explicitly saying what they will then do with this information, right. But the entire chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services is all about basically banning abortion through the back door, even without national legislation, because that’s not what they’re talking about. And also, they know that that might not come. They might not be able to enact sort of a national abortion ban. But they’re very clearly saying that they want to outlaw mifepristone. They’re talking about outlawing, again, any sort of medication that is used for abortion. They’re talking about this vision of abortion surveillance. And again, they’re being very explicit about using the Department of Health and Human Services for this of hardcore pro-life. They’re basically saying explicitly the Department of Health and Human Services needs to be a pro-life tool. Chris Hayes: Right. That’s Health and Human Services as an example -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and you have a background in actually writing about public health through your scholarship. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the Department of Justice, because -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- the place that all this stuff kind of gets the scariest to me and the place that I keep referring to the Department of Justice as sort of like the Chekhov’s gun of American liberal democracy — Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: -- which we’ve seen tested a few times and really was tested during Nixon, which is that the Department of Justice is in the executive. It is part of the Article 2 branch. It reports to the president. The president appoints various people. And at the same time, not really through statutory restriction -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- but through norms and promulgations within precedential findings by the department itself -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- there are all sorts of ways to regulate that power such that it isn’t just turned into a kind of authoritarian police force, right? Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: You signed a petition against my government. The FBI shows up at your door the next day to investigate you about X, Y, Z, right? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And this happens in authoritarian regimes all the time. Presidential dictatorships that are sort of like plausibly democracies, but aren’t really in action. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: This is a key way that those become corrupted. What do they say about all that stuff? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. I mean, they’re being 100 percent clear. There’s not going to be a Department of Justice with any kind of autonomy from the White House. They’re being very explicit. Now, the Department of Justice has to do what the president tells us to do. And this is one of the biggest frustrations, not just of Trump himself, but also of these people that are behind Project 2025. They believe that in the first Trump presidency, they were hampered by these lawyers in and around the White House who had too many qualms about questions of legality and norm and precedent. And by the way, we’re already talking about even in the first Trump presidency, we’re talking about Federalist Society lawyers, right? Chris Hayes: Yes. These are all right-wingers. Jeff Sessions, and yes, yeah. Thomas Zimmer: Proper conservative/right-wing lawyers. But the people behind Project 2025 are convinced that, you know, they were putting too much of a brake on, for instance, they are convinced they should have invoked the Insurrection Act in the summer of 2020 to suppress the protests in the wake of the George Floyd murder. They are convinced that, you know, there should have been more investigations into Trump’s enemies and they feel like they’ve been, you know, they’ve been sabotaged by these lawyers. So this time around, I mean, there’s been basically a falling out between Trump world and even the Federalist Society. And they’re like, no, we’re not going to do this anymore. This whole idea of a sort of a semi-independent Department of Justice, that’s entirely out. And by the way, I can really recommend reading that chapter on the Department of Justice, because it’s really funny how they kind of try to justify this idea of making the Department of Justice into just a tool that does the president’s bidding. They basically say, oh, the people have lost the trust into the Department of Justice. And if this report is to believe that’s because the Department of Justice didn’t investigate Hunter Biden’s laptop enough and also because it was just not going hard enough after the, quote, “radical agents” of the left like Antifa. It reads like a sort of a hardcore culture war. It could be written by Marjorie Taylor Greene. But this is, again, an ostensibly a policy document in which they are outlining this is what we’re going to do to the Department of Justice. And they’re talking about Hunter Biden’s laptop, and that really gives you a sense of what sort of the spirit is behind these ideas. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And there’s a broader ideological vision here, which we should maybe take a step back to talk about, which is back during the Bush administration, one of the things they would talk about is this notion of a unitary executive -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- which is that the constitutional structure of the country has an Article 2 branch, which is the executive. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And all power flows from the president. And anything that sort of checks that is itself kind of constitutionally suspect. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: So when you have all these kinds of consultative boards, you know, all that are promulgated by statute, when you have administrative procedures, like there has been a hostility to that running through conservatism for a while. It’s also a hostility that is showing up before the Supreme Court and the federal society -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- towards the administrative state, which is basically we don’t like these bureaucrats, despite the fact that they have been given this authority via perfectly like, you know, past statutes signed by a president, right, through the constitutional order. They have been created and given this, you know, authority to decide these questions, right? We just don’t like them. And we’re sort of coming up with a reason why they’re unconstitutional. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And so this idea of basically making the president’s authority within the government itself kind of more dictatorial -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- is something that they kind of are all on the same page against on. We don’t want lawyers and bureaucrats saying, no, you can’t do that. We want the edict of the president to go. Thomas Zimmer: Well, as long as and if the president is a Republican, we should say -- Chris Hayes: Because it’s an important point, because if it’s the wrong president that we don’t want it. Thomas Zimmer: No -- Chris Hayes: Then the government no longer has the power to regulate carbon (ph). Thomas Zimmer: No. If it’s a Democratic president, then everything the president does is a sort of dictatorial overreach. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: But no, absolutely. I mean, again, at its core, Project 2025 envisions a vast expansion of presidential power and hovering sort of in the background of all of this, is this unitary executive theory, this of legal theory. It basically says there are zero limits of presidential power when it comes to the executive. Like the president has absolute king-like powers over the executive branch. And like you said, that’s been around for decades. It’s something that the conservative legal movement has been pushing for a long time. And it does have significant support, not only in the conservative legal movement. Certainly there are at least two, maybe more conservative justices on the Supreme Court who are certainly -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- let’s say, a unitary executive theory interested. And you see this throughout Project 2025, the vision of the president’s sort of basically unlimited control over the government is justified by this. But it’s also justified by something even more profound, by this idea that the president, at least this president, a right-wing president, embodies the true will of the people -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- and that nothing must impede the will of the quote, unquote “real America,” you know, the sort of -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- white patriarchal America, and certainly not some bureaucrats or lawyers or even the law itself. I also want to be clear, you know, they’re talking about this like the unitary executive theory, but it’s really not about a consistent legal theory with these people. Chris Hayes: Yes, it’s not very theoretically developed. Thomas Zimmer: No. Chris Hayes: Right, yes, that’s a good point. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, this is explicitly designed as a response to what they see, what they call the leftist woke threat. And they see what they do as justified because everything, no matter how radical, is justified in defense of, quote, unquote, “real America.” That is sort of the permission structure that governs conservative politics in these circles. And so, yeah, if they can latch onto unitary executive theory to make that sound more or less extreme or more, you know, more legitimate, they will do that. But, you know, they will also do whatever they want to do here, even without that theory. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: You know, one of the things that’s been a little lost to history is that Donald Trump wanted the Department of Justice to prosecute his political enemies and called for them to do so publicly via Twitter all the time. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And they largely didn’t. They had the John Durham sort of special prosecutor who kind of did that and then very embarrassingly failed to secure convictions on the two trials he brought. Both were acquittals, which is like essentially unheard of in federal prosecution. Like no one goes 0 for 2 anywhere in the federal government prosecution. But they used it more as a shield than a sword. And I think the place where the rubber really hits the road and the thing that really concerns me is using the Department of Justice as a as a weaponized tool. And they talk about this all the time because they’re doing this projection now with the cases brought against Donald Trump, that that’s what’s happening to him here and that turnabout will be fair play and that there will be special prosecutors and they’re going to just start prosecuting everyone in sight who stands against them. And I guess there’s no way you could answer this. But given the fact that you’ve embedded yourself in this world, how realistic eventuality do you see that if Trump is elected? Thomas Zimmer: Do you mean specifically the Department of Justice going after Trump’s enemies? Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: Oh, I mean, look, I would say generally they will not be able to implement all of these plans exactly as they have outlined them here. That’s just not how the world works, right? But if you combine the plans with this sort of personnel operation that they’re running, this hat hunting operation, and if you think about who the people are going to be that they will that they will be bringing in and there’s nothing going to stop them from bringing in those people. There’s nothing going to stop them from staffing the Department of Justice with people who are on board with this kind of vision. Chris Hayes: I mean, some are Senate confirmable positions, but they did a lot of messing around with vacancy appointments last time. Thomas Zimmer: Yes, exactly right. I mean, that’s a really important point. In some sense, we’ve already seen sort of a preview of -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: -- what we might be getting ins of the last year or so of Trump’s first term when he was starting to play around with this sort of stuff. Chris Hayes: They basically avoided confirmation battles altogether and everyone was sort of acting under the -- Thomas Zimmer: Acting something, yes. Chris Hayes: Yeah, right. Exactly. Thomas Zimmer: And by the way, all of those acting some things are now among the people who have contributed to Project 2025 -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- a lot of them have written those chapters on this department or that agency. So yeah, I mean, in that sense, it’s absolutely realistic. Again, all of this will be challenged. It will be challenged in court. There might be a public outcry against it. But the idea that we can all just dismiss this as just hot air. I don’t see how that is a realistic take on this, because again, this is not just Project 2025. This is a good example of how Trump himself and the Trump campaign and Project 2025, what they are envisioning, again, while those are two separate kind of planning operations and two separates, although not entirely separate, is a lot of overlap, personal overlap between those camps, but there are two separate camps. But you can see with this point specifically with what they want to do with the Department of Justice and how they want to bring in these lawyers who will just provide, you know, pseudo legal justification for whatever the Trump regime wants to do. I mean, this is entirely compatible what Trump wants to do and what Project 2025 is outlining here. There is no friction. There is no, you know, tension here. Oh, they’re entirely on the same page about this. Chris Hayes: Yeah. One of the big lessons of the period between the election and inauguration in 2020 and 2021 and the run up to January 6th and this aftermath is that ultimately what mattered was what the people with law degrees in positions of power were willing to accept or not. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And enough people in positions of power with law degrees, including the acting head of the Department of Justice, the acting AG, the chief counsel to the vice president of the United States, his chief of staff, all of these people were simply not willing to go along with a coup. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: There were people who were, but they were outnumbered. And if you rerun that experiment in which all the people not willing to go along are willing to go along and are willing to say, yeah, that’s fine. Let’s do this. Let’s send out this DOJ letter on DOJ letterhead saying the results are, you know, called into question and you should convene your state legislature. Like that was a place where this question of personnel is policy and actually more than personnel is policy. Personnel is law -- Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: -- really comes into focus. Thomas Zimmer: And you know what? It’s even worse than that. I think this is maybe to me the biggest mistake that people make that look at these planning operations and say, oh, you know, I’m not going to take this too seriously. We’ve had Trump in power before and we’re just looking at a rerun. It’s just going to be more of the same. But this time, not only are they going to have the plans and the personnel, which again, they did decidedly not have in 2017. They’re also going to be operating under circumstances that are decidedly more favorable to their overall project. They will be working with a supermajority on the Supreme Court, which again, they did not have in 2017. Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: They will be operating with a fully or almost fully Trumpified Republican Party. Like there’s like the Mitt Romneys -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- the Liz Cheney’s, they’ve all been ostracized from the party, right? So, these people are out. This is an entirely different, not entirely different, but a significantly different Republican Party. And also, they’re going to be operating in an environment in which everyone who stands up against whatever Donald Trump wants to do, and I’m not talking about people on the left. I’m talking about whatever level of resistance is even still left within the Republican Party. They have all seen now that they can expect an enormous level of violent threat directed at them, right, because that is what all the election workers are facing across the country. That is what every Republican is facing who has said anything critical about Trump. So we are operating under entirely different conditions. That was just not the case in 2017. Chris Hayes: Or less so the case. I mean, there were some of that. Thomas Zimmer: Less so the case, yes. Chris Hayes: It’s way more widespread and almost sort of priced in as ubiquitous now. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: I mean, you just look at the judges and the district attorneys and the -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- judge’s clerk in a civil fraud trial. I mean, anyone that gets in the crosshairs has to deal with a security situation. They have to deal with doxing. Maybe their phone is going to be overwhelmed. They may have to move apartments. Like, these things are real tangible costs of sort of the threat of violence and the security burden is a tax that is applied to people that cross Trump. Thomas Zimmer: Yes, absolutely. And again, I think if you combine those three elements, right, so different Supreme Court, different Republican Party, and this sort of environment of heightened violent threat, this does not mean that they will be able to do whatever they have outlined here. Again, this is not what I’m arguing, what anyone, any serious person is arguing. But it will mean that the idea that we’re just looking at a rerun of like the first Trump presidency, that is just not a plausible analysis of the situation. Chris Hayes: I feel like now at this point, we have to talk a little bit about the sort of the fascism debate or the authoritarian debate. Thomas Zimmer: All right. Chris Hayes: I mean, the language in this Project 2025, and I have read large parts of it, not all it. I have read the Justice Department section. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: It’s pretty close to fascist language. I mean, it’s a constant paranoid obsession with an internal enemy who is seeking to undo the purity of the nation from within. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: It’s textbook fascistic. Now, it’s also you could say textbook reactionary or textbook conservative, and there’s lines between those. I’m not that interested in this debate -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- that has played out over the last 10 years about the degree to which Trumpism is fascism or not. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: The name doesn’t matter that much to me. But what does matter is models of authoritarian governance. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: And, you know, people talk about Hungary a lot as a sort of model. And Donald Trump has explicitly said, Orban’s great. I like what he’s doing. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And one of the things you see there is, you know, the newspaper that is, you know, or the university that is a sort of bastion of dissent and criticism comes under all sorts of regulatory scrutiny or tax scrutiny. Or in Turkey, where Erdogan is also sort of overseeing this kind of presidential dictatorship, which is ostensibly democratic, but corrupted in key ways. You know, you pass a law regulating large media enterprises and then they’re sort of forced to sell to friendly competitors. There are all these ways in which, like, it’s not the tanks roll in. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: But you’re using essentially the mechanisms of governance in a fundamentally coercive fashion directed at constraining speech and against political enemies. And I wonder how much you think what’s laid out in Project 2025 fits with these other kind of presidential dictatorship authoritarian models. Thomas Zimmer: So, I mean, look, the answer to the question of, you know, whether or not this is adequately described as fascism depends on how you define fascism, and there’s no consensus definition of fascism out there. So that’s one of the problems here. But I think you’ve framed this exactly right. It’s not about what label you slap on it. It’s about we shouldn’t get bogged down in labeling fights. To me, I will say this, and I think most serious economic observers, I think, would agree with this. There is Trumpism specifically. Trump and Trumpism specifically represents a specifically American, specifically 21st century version of fascism. That does not mean that everything on the right is fascism. It doesn’t mean the whole Republican Party. If you look historically, so fascist movements and parties have always existed in sort of coalitions and alliances with more established conservative right-wing reactionary forces. And I think that’s also exactly what we’re seeing here, right. We’re seeing sort of an alignment. We’re seeing an alliance, a sort of a coming together, and making common cause between these different strands on the right. The people behind Project 2025, they’re not Trump, although, again, there are strong connections. There are many sorts of Trump alumni, Trump administration alumni among them. But again, granted, they’re not Trump himself. But what Project 2025 offers is a story of a once great nation in decline because of the enemy within and the enemy without, but they are in cahoots, right. It’s like the woke enemy within is in cahoots with and the globalist elites are in cahoots with like communist China. They’re being 100 percent explicit about this, by the way. I’m not just paraphrasing here. And Project 2025 is sort of a promise to restore this former national glory by purging these enemies and these deviants from the nations. It is viscerally -- Chris Hayes: Why did you put it like that? Thomas Zimmer: I’m somewhat, you know, on purpose putting it like that. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: But look, Project 2025, regardless of where you look, regardless of what chapter you read, it offers sort of a visceral disdain for any kind of pluralism and diversity. And all that is channeled into this program, aiming to extinguish that pluralism diversity. Look, again, I think by any reasonable definition of fascism, there’s some key elements of that that are present here. But again, if you’d rather call these people enablers of fascism or making common cause with fascism, I don’t care. I really don’t. What is important here is that we understand how radically anti-democratic this is, how radically anti-pluralistic, and that this is really an extreme reactionary vision of white Christian patriarchal dominance and an aggressive embrace of state authoritarianism in order to impose that vision on society against the will of the majority. And as long as we can agree on that and how dangerous that is, you can honestly call it whatever you want. I don’t think it matters all that much, but the diagnosis matters. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So one of the things that I wrestle with here is that I think there’s a little bit of a psyop being run by Bannon and some people on the right, which is, and you even saw this the other day, Ronnie Jackson, who’s the, you know, ex-White House doctor turned right-wing MAGA Texas congressman, you know, saying people are scared about Trump’s second term, you should be scared. And there’s a little bit of big bad wolf happening. You know, it’s like Steve Bannon is like talking a lot of trash from his microphone, and it’s like, I’m not scared of you, sweaty doofus. Like, you know, I just refuse to be too cowed by these losers. And I wrestle a little bit with balancing two imperatives that are an intention. One is taking seriously the authoritarian aspirations and threat represented by this movement in which they say, I mean, Bannon the other day literally said, we got to get rid of the entire FBI and start over. It’s totally corrupted. And yes, we are going to prosecute. There will be punishment for anti-Trump forces in a Trump term, like not even in coded language, right, like straight up saying this is what’s coming. So one level I’m trying to balance in the way I think about this and the coverage of it being very clear eyed and serious about what a threat this is, but also not letting their like trash talking make them seem more powerful and imposing than they are. You know what I mean? Because that’s part of the game here. Part of it’s like -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you should be scared of us and Trump’s going to rule forever and, you know, it’s the last election in America. And it’s like, no. I refuse to seed all this stuff. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: I refuse to seed it because if you seed it ahead of time, you say, if Trump’s elected, all these terrible things are going to happen, you may have to wake up on the Wednesday morning after he’s elected and say, like, no, like we’re not going to go without a fight. And I wonder how to think about those two imperatives, because there’s a certain amount of like braggadocio that’s happening here. Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: They really like to talk like Disney villains. Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: Like there’s this like cackling like, I’ll get you. You know, it’s like, all right. Thomas Zimmer: So, I mean, I will be honest with you. I try to ignore Steve Bannon as much as I can -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- because I do not find that very insightful. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: I’m not gaining any insights from listening to whatever he has to say. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: I’ll say this, everything we’re seeing here, this sort of radicalization, this sort of anti-democratic radicalization of the right, of which Project 2025 is a manifestation, it’s not coming from a place of strength. It’s coming from a place of weakness. Chris Hayes: That’s an interesting way of putting it. Thomas Zimmer: Because the reason why they are radicalizing is because they, and I think they’re quite correct about this, they can feel and they can see that American society is moving away from their vision of what America should be. Broadly speaking, over the past two decades, right -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- the country has become less white, more pluralistic, more diverse. Chris Hayes: More secular, certainly. Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: Yes, absolutely. Yes. And that’s mostly for demographic reasons, right. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: So, again, I mean, Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012 with like 40 percent of the white vote or something like this, entirely unthinkable in previous eras of American history. And so in a very real sense, they are reacting to something that’s real. They’re not imagining the fact that the country is becoming more pluralistic and more diverse. And so that is why this of this sense of being under siege that is really that you can grasp. And I really recommend everyone read the full word that Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, wrote for this policy report that Project 2025 put out. It’s only like 15, 16 pages long. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And it’s so tangible, the sense of being under siege and having their backs -- Chris Hayes: Aggrieved. Thomas Zimmer: -- yes, and having their backs against the wall. Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: It’s all about this, we are losing and the left and the wokes and the globalist elites and the progressives, they have taken over all the institutions of government and all the institutions of American life. This is precisely why they say conservatism is no longer enough. That’s now explicitly what you hear on the right. We can’t be conservative anymore. We need a counterrevolution. We have to embrace sort of a counterrevolutionary spirit, right. There’s nothing left to conserve. We need to we need to be much more radical than this. But again, don’t let Steve Bannon tell you that this is because they’re so strong and so manly or all this kind of nonsense. It’s because of out of a sense of weakness. And that is, I think, a sort of a glass half full kind of way to look at the current situation -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- right. In many ways, and I mean this sincerely, in many ways, the country has just never been closer to finally realizing the promise of sort of egalitarian, pluralistic, multiracial democracy, that, I mean, it has never kept that promise so far, but that promise has always been part of the American project. And in many ways, the country has never been closer to realizing that. And that is precisely why they are, again, feeling so much under threat on the right. And I think it’s really important to keep that in mind whenever you hear Steve Bannon like pretend, he’s like the man. Chris Hayes: There’s a line, I think it’s a Benjamin Wittes line of Lawfare who said that, you know, describing the Trump administration or Trump as, you know, malevolence tempered by incompetence, which I thought it was. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And one thing I think is good to remind people, even though, again, I don’t want to fall into a trap of being like, oh, it can never happen here. It will be fine. I don’t think that. But also the incompetence isn’t just going to go away. Like there’s something woke like they will be more competent this time -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- but it doesn’t mean it’s going to go away. Like Trump is still Donald Trump, and in certain ways, extremely distractible, you know, flawed figure for executing projects in a systematic fashion. I mean, that’s just the truth about him. Thomas Zimmer: Let me take of the other side of this of this debate and push back a little bit against it, although I’m not saying you’re entirely wrong, but look, it is true, right? In some ways, Trump is a less than ideal vessel for the kind of ambitious, comprehensive plans that are emanating from the right. He’s erratic. He’s lazy. He’s volatile. He’s certainly not sitting down and reading his extensive policy memos. I mean, no one believes that he is -- Chris Hayes: Right. Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- like reading 920 pages -- Chris Hayes: Nor does he care about anything except, you know, himself and his own glory, and yeah. Thomas Zimmer: No, that’s right. But in other ways, Trump is especially suited to lead this kind of crusade. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: He isn’t restrained by norms or questions of precedence or forbearance. I mean, that is why the right united behind him in the first place. It really takes a radical leader -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- to implement extremist plans and kind of, you know, that’s Trump. Look, I mean, if you strip it down to its core, what Project 2025 is about is, again, this massive expansion of presidential power and making the executive into a tool for whatever the regime wants to do. And it doesn’t take much sophisticated analysis to explain why such a plan would appeal to Trump. He wants power. He wants immunity. Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: And he wants the ability to plunder, right? And so, again, while he will not sit down to read those plans, he will look at this and say, oh, yeah, I get more power and I totally go after my enemies. Awesome. Chris Hayes: He doesn’t have a lot of ideological commitments, but he does have a few. The biggest one is his own glory and vanity and power. But he’s genuinely, I think, a bigot. Like I think he -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- he’s not an egalitarian. He really thinks there’s like a small group of people and of certain races and nationalities that are better than others. And he’s genuinely authoritarian at a principal level. Like I think -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- he’s really genuinely viscerally deep in his heart, thinks democracy is bad and strong men are good. And I think he thinks that -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- as like a foundational fact, like it’s not a made-up thing. It’s not just an incidental thing. He likes dictatorship affirmatively as a model of governance. And every time he talks about Kim Jong Un -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- or Xi or Putin or whoever, it’s like they’re strong, they’re strong. It’s like that his people salute when he says something. I want my people to say that. He once said that about Kim Jong Un. To his cells, is an authoritarian. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, he is the perfect avatar of sort of aggrieved masculinity -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- and he’s the perfect avatar of sort of a white male grievance. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And he’s not putting on a show. He is not like Kevin Roberts is, again, he’s the president of the Heritage Foundation. That guy’s coming out of this of reactionary Catholicism world, right? Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: That’s not Trump -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- and Trump is not deeply steeped in white Christian nationalism in that way. But again, he is sort of an aggrieved white male alpha who believes the world is not giving him his due anymore -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- and that’s not right, because all the women and the brown people and the black folks they’re being a little too loud and too rowdy and why are they not shutting up? And so, again, I think in that sense, I kind of struggle when people say, oh, all he wants is like plunder and enrich himself. No, I mean, there is this sort of aggrieved white male masculinity and that is also very much what he is. And again, in that sense, also, how he sees the world and what he wants America to be is entirely 100 percent compatible with this vision of white patriarchal order that emanates from Project 2025. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Where are you from, Thomas, originally? Thomas Zimmer: I’m German. How about that? Chris Hayes: What brought you to the States? Thomas Zimmer: Well, you know, I was offered a job at Georgetown. And so, and my wife was also at the very same time offered a very good job in D.C. We were offered our jobs within three days of each other and so we felt like that’s too good. We can’t say no to that. So we came over. Chris Hayes: Can I ask as a final question as someone who -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- is from a nation whose sort of defining feature of the last, say, 70 years is reckoning with fascist evil and the aftermath of that, like how you feel about being an American or living in America at this moment? Thomas Zimmer: That’s a good question. You know what? I struggle with this a little bit because I’m not an expert on, like, German history. I’m not an expert on Nazism. But it is true, certainly, that the idea that it cannot happen here is certainly not something that you have in your DNA. If you grow up in Germany in the late ‘20s -- Chris Hayes: Exactly. Thomas Zimer: Right? I mean, I was born in 1982. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And so it is the very core of my school education about German history, that it can absolutely happen because it did happen, right? Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And so I do think that this has probably immunized me a little more against the sort of tales of American exceptionalism, the sort of tales of America supposedly immune to this kind of stuff and America supposedly has 250 years of stable, consolidated democracy and stable, consolidated democracy do not fall to authoritarianism. I mean, first of all, it’s not 250 years of stable, consolidated democracy. Chris Hayes: Correct. Thomas Zimmer: The first time America had any right to call itself a multiracial democracy in any sense of the word is in the 1960s after the civil rights legislation of the ‘60s. And even then, this has been the defining political fault line in American history, whether or not the country should actually continue on this path towards becoming, again, which it has often promised to be, a multiracial, pluralistic, egalitarian democracy. That’s what all people are created equal ultimately means, right? A country that is not defined by sort of, you know, discriminatory hierarchies of race and gender and wealth and religion, but something where the individual is, again, not measured by, you know, who you are and what you look like and who your parents were and all of these things. America has never been that. But since the 1960s, there has been this sort of struggle over should we continue down this path towards becoming that, finally realizing that promise? And I think, again, when I hear people who are confidently telling their audience and these are people with like big platforms writing for mainstream media outlets, confidently telling their people that, you know, it’s all just hysteria and liberal alarmism and like democracy in danger, stop with this alarmism. Like Project 2025 is immensely helpful, at least in this one respect. You don’t have to trust me, some lefty liberal like -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- professor or whatever, who cares? Or you, right? The lefty liberals over here, like, okay, if people don’t want to trust us, fair enough. Chris Hayes: (inaudible) Thomas Zimmer: These people could not possibly be clearer about what they want for the country. So at least trust them and believe them when they say they are just fundamentally not on board with this vision of an egalitarian, pluralistic democracy. Project 2025 is their declaration of war on this idea of America. That’s what this is. And so in many ways, this is on the ballot in November. Those are the stakes. And I think this is really, you know, in a fundamental way in November is going to be a referendum on whether or not we want to continue down this path towards multiracial, pluralistic, egalitarianism or not. And this should be read as a reminder of the fact that those are the actual stakes in the election. Chris Hayes: Thomas Zimmer is a historian at Georgetown University. He writes a Substack called “Democracy Americana.” He’s co-host of the “Is This Democracy?” podcast. Thomas, that was fantastic. Thank you so much. Thomas Zimmer: Thank you so much for having me.

"Discussing criminal justice, faith and politics with Rep. Jasmine Crockett: podcast and transcript",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/discussing-criminal-justice-faith-politics-rep-jasmine-crockett-podcas-rcna160922,"Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett is one of the most interesting figures in Congress. You may have been introduced to her in recent weeks following a House committee during which Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene insulted her appearance. The verbal spat between the two took the internet by storm and became a viral moment. But that exchange, and her clapback, is only one part of her story as a rising star within the Democratic Party. She joins WITHpod to discuss the impetus for her political work, how her faith keeps her grounded in the often vitriolic world of politics, serving as a criminal justice advocate and more. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Rep. Crockett: A lot of times people try to act like Democrats are the Antichrist. And so then I’m like, my daddy’s a preacher, go look him up, you know. And so I think that it allows me to engage in the conversations and really be a good representation for what actually a lot of black folk are. I mean, when you think about politics and advocacy in general, so much of it was born out of black church and it really is centers to the core of who we are. It’s how we were able to get so much. I mean, when you think about the leaders, whether you’re talking about Martin Luther King, who comes from more of the traditional Baptist background, or whether you’re talking about Malcolm X, who comes from the Muslim faith. It always, for black folks, somehow our leadership came directly out of the church for moving us forward. And I don’t ever want that to be lost at all. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. You know, Congress doesn’t make a lot of headlines these days unless something’s going sideways, I think I would say. And partly that’s the news media. There’s an expression we have in the news media, we don’t cover the planes that land. We tend to focus on, you know, disaster and conflict. Also, this Congress, particularly the House, has been historically unproductive. There’s a whole bunch of, kind of objective metrics you could use, and it’s been one of the least productive Congresses in a very, very long time in terms of moving legislation. It’s also a Congress where there’s a very razor-thin Republican majority and the defining feature of that majority has been dysfunction, factional infighting, multiple ballots to elect the Speaker Kevin McCarthy the first time, and then deposing that Speaker, and then an interregnum in which no one can get the votes, and now Mike Johnson, and threats against Mike Johnson, and battles between various factions for a Republican caucus that seems mostly devoted to sort of signaling their fealty to Donald Trump. There was a viral incident a few weeks ago. I say all this because the context is there was a viral incident a few weeks ago in a committee hearing where two members of Congress kind of went at it. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican member of Congress from Georgia, and a representative from Texas who represents Dallas and parts of Tarrant County named Jasmine Crockett. Now, you may have seen this go viral. We’re going to talk about what happened and play you some of the sound of what happened in this conversation. But when I saw it, I thought, oh, you know, I saw a lot of people commenting. It got a lot of life on social media, and there was a little bit of like, oh, these clowns in Congress debasing themselves, or a little bit of when you’re dealing with folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene, you can’t escape but being brought down to her level. But when I saw it, I thought that the congresswoman involved, Representative Jasmine Crockett, is a really, really interesting figure in Congress. I’ve had the opportunity to talk to her a few times on the show and had done a little research on her background and think she’s a really interesting member of Congress. And again, if you listen to the show, you know that I’m always interested in members who are coming from backgrounds that aren’t the sort of standard backgrounds that a lot of representatives come from. And Congresswoman Crockett is one of those people. And so I thought a great person to talk to would be Jasmine Crockett herself about both what it’s like to serve in Congress now, what her path was to becoming the United States congressperson, and of course, the by now infamous viral moment. So, Congresswoman Crockett, it’s great to have you in the program.   Rep. Crockett: Yeah, it’s great to be with you, Chris. Chris Hayes: You and I have talked a bunch before and I’ve known a bit about your background and you were a criminal defense attorney, civil rights attorney. You served in the Texas Statehouse before becoming a member of Congress. A lot of people probably were introduced to you by this crazy moment that happened recently in the House Oversight Committee. And before I get into it, I want to just say up top that you’re, I think, a really interesting politician. There’s a lot I want to get into, so I don’t want to reduce you to this moment. But I do want to talk about it first because it got out there and it went viral and a lot of people had reactions to it and I wanted to sort of start with that. And so first, before I play some of the sound, I would love for you to just take me through. This is an oversight committee hearing. James Comer is the chair of the oversight committee. Jamie Raskin from Maryland is the ranking member. The oversight committee has been the site of a lot of the most, kind of the Fox News on Capitol Hill center. It’s where James Comer sort of produces content for Fox News, chasing after Hunter Biden, promising an impeachment that ultimately they didn’t have the goods for, constantly promising these huge explosive revelations about the quote “Biden crime family” that never bear fruit, but always with the intent of sort of producing fireworks that can then be rolled into the Fox News evening programming. And so this took place in that committee. Tell me what happened. Just you take me through it before we play this out.   Rep. Crockett: Yeah, so it was already a very frustrating hearing as most oversight committee hearings are. Definitely didn’t think that I would walk into Congress as a freshman and almost immediately find out that I was going to have to engage in a faux impeachment kind of exercise of sorts. But nevertheless, these folk are basically using this committee to campaign for Donald Trump. And so on that day, we were supposed to have our committee hearing at 11:00 a.m. The committee hearing was about hopefully for them, jailing Attorney General Merrick Garland, not because he went out and fondled women inappropriately or sexually assaulted any women or committed some type of fraud or engaged in anything that would be by law a crime that required him to be jailed.   But instead, because they were upset because they wanted the audio recordings of the interview, the voluntary interview that was taken of the president as he was being interviewed about the documents that he ultimately had in his possession, that special appointee Hur decided not to go forward on. Unfortunately, we could not have our hearing at 11:00 a.m. where they were trying to hold the attorney general in contempt for not turning over the audio, even though they had the transcripts for this, because they decided they wanted to take a field trip to New York because they needed to stand with their man. They needed to be by his side. Chris Hayes: Oh, so they postponed the hearing to go after Garland for not turning over the audio, despite the fact of the transcript, because they wanted to go to New York to do the thing where they stood with Donald Trump in his criminal trial. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. So they had to stand with Donny as he was going through what he was going through. And so ultimately, they rescheduled our hearing for 8:00 p.m. So we as Democrats have been at work all day working and now we have to have this late night  hearing. Chris Hayes: I didn’t even know that detail. Rep. Crockett: Oh, yeah. No, no. We had to have this late night hearing because they went on their field trip. So, it was really kind of like I was already annoyed because here it is, I’m going to be at work. Chris Hayes: You’re within your rights to be annoyed, I think. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, I was super annoyed. So anyway, so we’re in the hearing. And of course, they have their grievances against Merrick Garland. Fine. Air your grievances. Say what you got to say. I know what the vote is going to be. We know that you’re going to vote to move forward with the contempt. So like say what you have to say. But it was so much more infuriating because they were still stuck on court that day and still stuck on doing their service to Donald Trump and making sure that they could get around the gag order and be his mouthpiece. So here it is. Marjorie starts talking about Judge Merchan. Chris Hayes: This is Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s a member of Congress you might have heard of, a Republican from Georgia. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. Chris Hayes: So she’s talking about Juan Merchan in a hearing ostensibly about Merrick Garland. Rep. Crockett: Correct. They have nothing to do with one another. And this is at 8:00 p.m. at night. So, I’m like, I’m so upset, and like say what you got to say about Merrick Garland, but like, I’m tired. And don’t remind me that you skipped out on work today to go and play in New York. So I was like, do you realize why we’re here? Because like her not knowing the purpose of a hearing, absolutely, that could be a thing with her. And ultimately, when I asked her the question, that is when she decided to lash out against me. Chris Hayes: And she said some nasty things about your appearance, I believe. And that violates House rules, right? I mean -- Rep. Crockett: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- the normal thing is these House rules exist for a reason. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And they go all the way back, I think, to pre-Civil War when there -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- was actually famously violence on the floor of the House, which is that you can’t talk to people directly. You’re supposed to evoke them, the gentleman or the gentlewoman. And it’s out of order, I think, usually if you just directly address someone. Is that right? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So it’s called engaging in personalities. So, like it’s all about like making sure that you are maintaining a decorum, right? So you’re like the gentlelady. Like there’s nothing gentle about half these people, right. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: You’ve got to use like the language and you’re supposed to be polite enough, like you can go on Fox News and Newsmax and say what you got to say, go on Twitter, wherever, go on Truth. You can do whatever you want to outside of the chambers, but we’re supposed to remain somewhat respectful. And so you’re not supposed to do things that would normally be considered offensive and directed at a member while you’re in the chamber or in committee.   Chris Hayes: So she says this thing about you. There’s an objection that it’s out of order, right? Rep. Crockett: Right. Exactly. Chris Hayes: And the objection is overruled by the committee. Rep. Crockett: Ultimately, Chairman Comer overruled it, yeah. Chris Hayes: And everyone votes to say it’s fine for her to say this nasty thing directed at you. Rep. Crockett: Well, actually, the chair just makes a decision. Chris Hayes: I see. Rep. Crockett: So, essentially she asked to basically remove her words from the record. And you can do that if there’s unanimous consent. And the deal was we would not object to unanimous consent so long as she apologized. So we just simply wanted her to apologize for being offensive. And then no one would object. She’s like, well, I’m not going to apologize, but I’ll go ahead and say that, you know, you can just remove my words from the record. Well, no. Now, we want a ruling because if we get a ruling saying that you were wrong, which is the only reason that she agreed to say, okay, fine, I’ll remove what I said, is because if the ruling came down the way that it was supposed to, then she was going to be kicked out of committee for the rest of the day, which meant I didn’t have to hear from her. And it also meant that Comer was going to lose one of his votes. Yeah. Chris Hayes: So he didn’t want to do that. So he ruled them in order. And then your colleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was like, wait a second, you can’t do that. That’s not in order. And then you posed a hypothetical question.  Rep. Crockett: Yes. Chris Hayes: As a question about whether what would be in order or not order. And that hypothetical question got some traction. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. So essentially, AOC actually kicked off the objection. So she was at the very beginning. And then Raskin was negotiating and the parliamentarian was advising the Chair. And the agreement was that there would be an apology and Marjorie decided she wasn’t going to do that. So ultimately, when I found out that the Chair was ruling against me, that was when I decided to pose a hypothetical so that he could see that this committee could devolve into certain things. If they’re going to throw punches, just know you may end up having a few thrown back at you. Chris Hayes: All right. So we’ve stitched together a little bit of this committee, I don’t know if you want to call my highlights or the lowlights or the latter, but --   Rep. Crockett: Yeah, the lowlights. Chris Hayes: -- take a listen to folks that were not familiar with this. (BEGIN SOUNDBITE) Rep. Greene: Do you know what we’re here for? I don’t think you know what you’re for. Rep. Crockett: Well, you’re the one talking about -- Marjorie Taylor Greene: I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you’re reading. Rep. Crockett: No, ain’t nothing -- Rep. Comer: Hold on, hold on. Rep. Crockett: Listen -- Rep. Comer: Order. Rep. Lynch: Mr. Chairman -- Rep. Raskin: That’s beneath even you Ms. Greene. Rep. Lynch: -- you need to regain order of your committee. Rep. Comer: Order. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: I do have a point of order and I would like to move to take down Ms. Greene’s words. That is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person. Rep. Comer: Hearing will suspend. Hearing will suspend. Rep. Greene: Are your feelings hurt? Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Move her words down. Rep. Greene: Oh. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Oh girl, baby girl. Rep. Greene: Oh, really? Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Don’t even play. Rep. Greene: Baby girl? I don’t think that -- Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: We are going to move and we’re going to take your words down. Thank you. Rep. Raskin: I second that motion. Rep. Comer: Well, you ready to strike your words? Rep. Greene: Yeah. I’ll do it. Rep. Comer: Okay. Ms. Greene agrees to strike her words. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: I believe she needs to apologize. No, no, no. Rep. Comer: Hold on. Then after Mr. Perry you’ll be recognized then Ms. Greene -- Rep. Greene: I’m not apologizing. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Well, then you’re not striking your word. Rep. Greene: I am not apologizing. Rep. Comer: Well, let’s not. Come on, guys. Rep. Crockett: It’s me. Rep. Comer: Ms. Crockett. Rep. Crockett: I’m just curious just to better understand your ruling, if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody’s bleach blonde, bad built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct? Rep. Comer: A what now? (END SOUNDBITE) Chris Hayes: Now, needless to say, bleach blonde, bad built, butch body went viral on TikTok. There were cultural remixes of it. People made songs about it, country songs. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: House music. Rep. Crockett: Gospel. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Dance songs. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: I think the Biden campaign put an e-mail out that was like six B’s in a row. Rep. Crockett: They did. They did. Chris Hayes: I have a few questions about this. Rep. Crockett: Okay. Chris Hayes: One is I have had the phrase bad built in my head since hearing it because as an arrangement of words, I have never encountered it. But there’s something very cutting and specific about the phrase bad built. Where did bad built come from? Rep. Crockett: It came from my granny. So, my granny and if anybody knows anything about older Black women, they say a lot of stuff like they just don’t care. And so my granny was good for saying that somebody was bad built. And so while she probably was my favorite person on the face of the planet and I miss her every single day and I could only imagine, you know, what she would think of me now. But it’s amazing when you think about how important people like my grandma has been to my life. And even when they’re gone, they’re always still with you. And so I have been able to share my granny with the whole world. But no, that was something that my granny used to say. Chris Hayes: All right. The second thing I want to ask is what the reaction was like to this, because obviously, like, I think in a in the sort of Drake v. Kendrick Lamar sense, like you got the Kendrick Lamar half of it. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. Yep. Chris Hayes: So like, I think you had the kind of final word.  Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But then at the same level, people were like, there’s a certain like, oh, this is what Congress has come. This is what it’s descended to and I saw a lot of that. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And I was sort of torn because I don’t like to be too pearl-clutchy. But also there is a reason those rules exist so that it doesn’t devolve into this. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Exactly. Chris Hayes: What was your sort of takeaway from this episode? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So here’s the deal. We were trying to do what Democrats try to do all the time. We were trying to follow the rules because the real party of law and order is the Democratic Party. And so this is why AOC jumped in. She’s the vice ranking member on the committee. And then Jamie Raskin was right there talking to the chairman. He is the ranker on the committee. And there was an agreement that was made, which is why, you know, she’s like, yeah, I’ll strike my words, but it has to be by unanimous consent. And so we understand the rules. We try to play by the rules. We honor the rules of decorum in this body. We’ve seen a devolution of Congress and people call it a circus and things like that. But it’s all been the MAGA folk. It’s all been the right. We know that they were engaged in physical altercations from the Speaker of the House, elbowing one of his members. There was another situation where somebody got chased down in the hall. I don’t remember exactly who that was, but it was during fight week is what I call it. And then we also had the situation on the Senate side where Senator Bernie Sanders had to interject. We also have had Marjorie Taylor Greene disrupting the president in the State of the Union address this year, as well as last year. She was yelling at him. There’s the images of that and the audio of that. We also know that Marjorie Taylor Greene got into it with the other MAGA darling, Lauren Boebert, and she called her the B word on the floor and they got into it. It was all about who filed to impeach the president of the United States first. And so they had their own spat. But it was all kept on that side. This was the first time that they crossed over or any one of them crossed over and attempted to bring it to this side. And, you know, for me, it wasn’t so much about doing a tit for tat, even though that’s how people have described it. That’s not what I did. Number one, I never addressed her at all. I asked a question. Chris Hayes: You asked a hypothetical. Rep. Crockett: I asked a question that was parliamentary in nature to seek clarification and also kind of send like a warning to the Chair, like, just know, I got bars. Like, so this is not the smoke that you all want. Like, we can do this if this is what you’re going to turn this committee into. And I don’t expect Marjorie to ever honor the rules of decorum or respect who we are supposed to be when we’re within the halls of Congress. But the question is, Chairman, how are you going to conduct your hearings? Is this what you want? And so it was more so for him. And that’s why I addressed it to him. And I still stayed within the rules. So not only did I respond, but I responded in a way that also was reflective of the fact that, again, Democrats can actually do this game better while also staying within the rules of decorum. And I think that that was really important for me to do instead of kind of like, you know, going back and forth and being as grade school as some people want to say we were. I could have been like your mama. That’s like the grade school thing, you know? Chris Hayes: Right. Right. Right. Rep. Crockett: But I didn’t do that. Chris Hayes: This is your first term in Congress, right? Rep. Crockett: It is. Chris Hayes: So you just you just got there in ‘22. Rep. Crockett: ‘23. I was elected in ‘22, yeah. Chris Hayes: That’s right. You were elected in ‘22, right. You got there in ‘23. Okay. So, this is your first term. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Let’s zoom out one level from this interaction, but just the broader context of what it’s like to work in that House. You’re coming in having never been in the majority. You’re coming in having never served in the body, never having served under previous Congresses so this is all you know. And the first thing is, you know, a historic multi-ballot speaker vote and then the first ever, you know, vote of no confidence essentially in the Speaker to topple him. And then -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- a long period of interregnum, and then Mike Johnson. What is it like to work in that body as the first time that you’re ever serving and only knowing this? Rep. Crockett: It is wild. It’s interesting because coming out of the State House, I obviously was in a significant minority being in Texas. But, you know, the idea is that you level up when you go to the big house. And it seems like I actually went down a little bit, right? Because even being in the minority in the Texas House and granted, you know, I disagree with the vast majority of the agenda that has been moving very swiftly through the chambers in Texas. But somehow they figured out how to function. So I was used to like a functioning majority. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: And like it absolutely is to the benefit of the American people that these people can’t function. Chris Hayes: Right, right, right. Yeah, right. Probably better they can’t. Right. Rep. Crockett: Correct. It’s a lot better that they can’t, but I expected to walk into a situation where they were trying to function. And considering the fact that the Democrats have the White House and the Democrats have the Senate, I thought these people will know how to function in this divided government, and they can’t. They are unable or and or unwilling. Chris Hayes: Well, it’s interesting because the Texas State House for years has operated under a kind of like almost tripartite and Texas Senate as well, factions. There’s a Republican supermajority in both houses. There’s a Democratic minority. But the Republican supermajority has both kind of normal Republicans. I mean, is any Texas Republican normal? But there’s the more Republicans who have some kind of set of tangible objectives in terms of getting stuff done. And then there’s like the real wing nuts. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And they sort of functions with a kind of tacit, sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit partnership between the Democrats and Republicans on the kind of the functional part of the caucus as opposed to the wing nuts, right. Is that a fair -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah, it is. So, interestingly enough, as you brought up the speaker fight, no Democrat defected when it came down to it. Everyone was voting for Hakeem Jeffries. On the state level, that’s not what it was. There’s like two kind of factions that are trying to like -- Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: -- and Democrats jump in and they pick the lesser of the evils. And so then you also end up in a situation where Democrats have chairmanships over committees. It’s not a matter of it’s all Republicans as chairs and things like that. And much like we see in the U.S. House, the House tends to function wildly differently than the Senate. And so I will say there was more of a cohesiveness in the House. It definitely ain’t good for sure, but like, you know, when we saw the impeachment of our attorney general, that was Democrats and decent enough Republicans coming together and saying, well, this guy has like gone too far. Now, mind you, he’s been under federal indictment for almost a decade at this point, but it took him trying to take taxpayer dollars to go ahead and pay off a settlement for them to say, okay, now you went too far. Now, granted, I believe that he went too far a long time ago. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: But that was kind of the breaking point for some of the people. And they spent a lot of money. You know, we don’t have limits in Texas. And so a number of those Republicans that voted for the impeachment of our corrupt attorney general, they ended up being primaried and they lost. So, the Texas House is going to move further to the right. And I wonder if they question the heavy gerrymandering that they did in this last session or the session that I was there because if it wasn’t so heavily gerrymandered and there were more normal lines, they would probably be in a better position -- Chris Hayes: To survive those primary challenges. Rep. Crockett: Exactly, exactly. Chris Hayes: Yeah, I mean, it’s interesting because it’s an interesting training ground. How long do you serve in the in the Texas ledge? Rep. Crockett: Just one crazy freshman term. Chris Hayes: Just one term. How old are you, Congresswoman? Rep. Crockett: I am 43. Chris Hayes: Okay. Rep. Crockett: And Chris, your people need to tell you, don’t be asking those questions. No, but it’s all good. It’s only because people can Google and get it. Chris Hayes: It’s on Wikipedia. Rep. Crockett: Exactly. Chris Hayes: Well, you’ve had a very quick rise. Tell me first what your background is, where you grew up and how you became a lawyer. Rep. Crockett: Yes. So, from St. Louis, Missouri, originally born and raised there. And after I graduated high school, I went to undergrad in Memphis, Tennessee at Rhodes College, who’s definitely gotten more so a bad rap because of one of the Supreme Court justices, Amy Coney Barrett. Chris Hayes: Oh, right. Rep. Crockett: So, interestingly enough, I don’t think that we ended up getting the same education, but nevertheless -- Chris Hayes: Is that like a Bible college? Rep. Crockett: It is.  Okay, fine. Yes. Yeah. Chris Hayes: No, I don’t mean that disparagingly. I mean, that descriptively.  Rep. Crockett: It is. Chris Hayes: I mean, there are many throughout the South. There are, you know, largely they’re Southern Baptists, not always exclusively -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah.  Chris Hayes: -- but often Southern Baptists are called Bible colleges. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, we’re not Southern Baptists, but yeah. Chris Hayes: But it was. And did you like it there? Rep. Crockett: I actually did. I did. But I did endure some hurdles. The very first time that I ever felt or experienced racism was actually on my campus. And it is a part of the fabric of who I am and why people see the fight that they see. And it’s actually what really propelled me on this legal journey. So, I was always a math and science girl. That’s what I was always great at. I never took a political science course a day of my life. I wasn’t really big on history. I wasn’t big on English either. I was always into math and science.  And so for me, it was going to be become an anesthesiologist or a CPA or an engineer. And ultimately, I thought that I was going to become a CPA. So I majored in business. And I went through this experience where I was a junior, myself, along with other African-American students on campus. We were the targets of hate crimes, direct targets. They put hate mail into our on-campus mailboxes. They were keying various people’s cars with the N-word. And I felt something that I never felt before, and I definitely felt like I was a little lost in a space that I felt safe. When I entered Rhodes College, I was one of 18 Black students in my class. Chris Hayes: Out of how many? Rep. Crockett: It was close to 400. Chris Hayes: Oh, wow. Okay. Rep. Crockett: And then by the time I left, there were probably only about 10 of us left. But, you know, we’re in the heart of Memphis and we’re in North Memphis, not necessarily Lily-white. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: So, you know, it really made me question who my real friends were. And it was just a different feeling, even coming out of St. Louis, Missouri. And so they brought in the Cochran firm to try to investigate and figure out what was going on. A Black female lawyer who graduated from University of Houston School of Law was assigned to me and she became my shero. They never really figured out what happened. But having someone that was there and advocating and trying to fight for me, it really kind of changed my trajectory a bit so, that was kind of the beginning for me. Chris Hayes: When you got there, were you raised in a religious Christian household? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. My dad’s a preacher. Chris Hayes: Your dad’s a preacher. So -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- that meal (ph), you must have felt familiar and comfortable. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But those first two years before this happened, junior year, what was your experience of campus, like the levels of, you know, friendship, social life, racial tension, et cetera? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. I never felt any racial tension at all on campus. I was very good friends with everybody. I was a bit of a social butterfly. I kind of always have been until now. I’m actually a little less social now, which is really weird. But nevertheless, they had started a gospel choir. I did that. I played softball for a second, did the dance team for a little bit. So, I mean, I was really engaged. And even when this happened, I actually did a musical on campus, which was “Little Shop of Horrors.” So I’ve always loved singing and not really that good of an actress. But nevertheless, I always have loved singing. And it was actually the mock trial coach. So I usually tell people that if I tried at my life, it would look nothing like it currently is, but God kind of finds a way to yell at me. And so him recruiting me to do mock trial combined with my experience were kind of the two things that made me say, okay, fine, I’m listening. Chris Hayes: I mean, it sounds like a horrible and traumatic experience. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And this was directed at other Black students, not just you, you’re saying. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And it was actual mail being put in your mailboxes? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So if it’s the on-campus mailbox, that information just isn’t public. And it made me really question like my friendships because no one from outside could come and get that information. And it was only two Black students. Yeah. Chris Hayes: So it’s someone on campus who’s putting this in your mailbox. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: It was never resolved. The perpetrators were never found or punished. Rep. Crockett: No. Chris Hayes: And you had this lawyer who was there who sort of inspired you. So you went to law school afterwards. Rep. Crockett: I did. So I was recruited to do mock trial. So the mock trial coach, I wouldn’t do it my junior year because kids were crying, saying they won’t get into law school and I wasn’t going. And he told me to promise to go back my senior year. I went back my senior year. I became a national All-American. He said, well, you trust me now and just apply to law school. I applied to law school, got a full ride with a stipend to attend law school in Houston. I actually got waitlisted for University of Houston. And so I ended up at Texas Southern, ended up top 10 percent of my class. And then they were having some money issues with finding my money. And so I then applied again to University of Houston. And after showing that I had great ability to do well, they accepted me and I transferred. And so ultimately I graduated as a Cougar. Chris Hayes: And what kind of lawyering did you do when you got out of law school? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So, interestingly enough, I mean, what got me to law school is absolutely not the way that I decided to go. I found out I could make money -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Rep. Crockett: -- and so I was like, oh, I want to go where the money is. Chris Hayes: That happens to a lot of people in law school. Rep. Crockett: So, yes -- Chris Hayes: When you interview them first, you’re like, well, criminal defense, environmental law -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you know, and then it’s like, I’m going to summer at WilmerHale and they have very good hors d’oeuvres and cocktails. And they took us on a boat. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, I know. Yeah. You lose your way a little bit, yeah. Chris Hayes: No, I honestly I’m not saying that. Rep. Crockett: No, no, no. Chris Hayes: I mean, first of all, people have a ton of debt. So that’s a huge factor. Rep. Crockett: It is. But I just realized I could make money. Chris Hayes: Right, yeah.   Rep. Crockett: I didn’t quite realize this. So, I ended up doing class action defense work for a firm. And I really wanted to be in the courtroom. I clerked for Shook, Hardy and Bacon, which has a large presence and I thought for a while that I would go back to the Midwest. So I went to their main location right there in Kansas City. And then I was like, never mind. I remember why I left the Midwest. And so I ended up at a small firm that was really running point for so many big cases that were coming through at that time, they call the Rocket Docket, which was in the eastern district of Texas. So behind Silicon Valley, it was the fastest moving kind of docket for so many intellectual property cases and things like that. So we were always hired by the big guys. But it gave me a chance to kind of get engaged in litigation a lot earlier.   But pretty early on in my career, I was like, wait a minute. Why did I go to law school again? Like, I just like, I don’t think I like this. The hours were long. I didn’t really like defending some of the stuff I was defending. And I just felt like, yeah, I don’t want to do this. And I almost quit law completely. But they decided to open a public defender’s office in Texarkana. And while I had said I would never deal with criminals because I was like, I don’t want somebody trying to come kill me if I mess up. So I was like, I don’t want to do that. I did decide that it was still a better way for me to really get the trial experience that I wanted. And so I went and interviewed with my boss at the time. His name was Charlie. And I remember walking in and he was like, you have no experience and I was like, that’s okay because I’m smart. And he was looking at me like, what? You know, and I was like, I’ll figure it out. And I was like, I will study, I will read. And I was like, but the one thing that you’ll get out of me that you probably won’t get from anyone else is that I’m black. And he looked at me and I was like, listen, I know the numbers. I will walk in with an instant rapport with so many of the criminal defendants that you guys are going to be charged with defending. And that’s something that no education can give you. And I was the only black female lawyer in I don’t even know how many. Chris Hayes: In the office. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Well, in the office and in the cities. Chris Hayes: Wow.  Rep. Crockett: And so it really did make a difference. It brought so much value to the office, but he took a chance on me and it really worked out really, really well.  Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: What was the most surprising thing to you from practicing as a criminal defender about the way the criminal justice system functions? Because I imagine that you had not had a lot of interaction with it up until that point. You were doing civil litigation, you’re at a small Christian college. And, you know, the system it’s an enormous entity with its own sort of set of internal logic and internal rules and institutions and patterns and practices and traditions. And what struck you about it as you were coming to learn this system? Rep. Crockett: Yeah, man, so much. I was incredibly green. So, as a kid that grew up in the 90s, I mean, I could rap almost any 90s rap song that you like put in front of me because my older cousins were listening to all of it. But for me, it was just a song. It wasn’t anything other than a song, but it definitely brought color and informed me so much more about the experiences that people were having with law enforcement and otherwise. I was like, oh, is that what you meant? Like, this is this is a very real thing. And so it brought to life so many lyrics of the experiences that so many of those that were rap about were saying. And so I really ended up in the belly of the beast, in my opinion, because when you start talking about criminal justice and what it looks like and the inequities, especially when you start talking about in small towns, it is even more ridiculous. And you start talking about small towns in Texas and Arkansas because I practice on both sides. I mean, you could see just the stark difference in how prosecutions were sought and the types of time that was sought and the lack of compassion and understanding that existed. And even the juries, I mean, the jury verdicts were just off the charts. I’m like, this would never happen in Dallas, you know, by the time I started practicing in Dallas. And so it also gave me my real taste of some of the struggles that exist that cause people to be caught up in the system.   And it is why I will always be kind of a fighter for those that have been ignored, forgotten or even targeted. Because the average person has not had those conversations to better understand why did you decide to sell drugs. Tell me what was going on, because I have to know this if I’m going to adequately defend you. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: Or learning the stories of the cycles of abuse that people endured or learning the stories of the cycle of what some would call the generational curses, where it’s like everybody’s in prison. My mama, my daddy, my stepdad, like everybody’s been in prison. And it’s kind of been all I’ve known. And it really brought me, in my opinion, the closest that I’ve ever been to the real struggles that exist in this country. Chris Hayes: I had you on the program the other night and we talked about this, but I want to talk about a little more here because I’ve been thinking about what you said. You’re sort of a perfect person to ask about Donald Trump’s conviction because you practice criminal law. You are a public defender in Texarkana. You’re a black woman from the South. And there’s this very strange thing happening where Trump is sort of, I mean, he doesn’t really have an option, right? He just got convicted of 34 felony counts. It’s, you know, if it were anyone else, that would be you’d say, well, that’s bad. So he’s kind of trying to lean into it. And he did this rally in the Bronx where he had these two rappers with him on stage who are both been indicted for a sort of widespread conspiracy that includes murder and drug trafficking, if I’m not mistaken. And he’s kind of like there’s this discourse of him and his allies being like, this will help us with black voters -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- because they’ll see themselves in me, Donald Trump. And as someone who represented black clients caught up in the system as one of the few black women in Congress, like, what do you think about that? Rep. Crockett: It really is infuriating for me. And, you know, when I was on with you and playing some of the clips and it was almost like a pile on of emotions for me because I have had people that have been treated so much worse than this guy. And he believes that somehow they will see him and say, well, just like MAGA is, you know, like that’s our orange Jesus. Now, all of a sudden you’re going to be our savior. Like, miss me. Talk to me about policies, like policy changes that you want to make. I think he could get so much further if he’s saying, listen, these are policies that I want to implement because now I have gone through the system that he may end up, you know, having the ear of people, but just trying to play people and saying, well, I’m just like you. No, you’re not. You know, I can tell you stories that led me to decide that I wanted to run for higher office, that I wanted to make a change to the laws, because, you know, one of those situations was even as I was running for the State House, I had a 17-year-old that was accused of being an accomplice to murder, which means he was facing murder. They don’t say accomplice in the charge. Chris Hayes: Like felony murder. It was a felony murder charge. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, because it was capital murder. So here it is, he’s facing capital murder. He’s 17-years-old. Texas is one of only five states that says at the age of 17, you’re an adult only for criminal justice purposes. And here it is. His mom was on felony parole. His dad was in prison and his stepdad was also on felony probation or parole, right. And he’s got a public defender because they don’t have money, or I’m court appointed. I was doing a court appointed case. And this kid could not afford to get out pretrial. His family couldn’t afford to get him out pretrial. And so he sat in custody for two years, two years waiting to go to trial. And this kid was incredibly courageous because his family is saying, listen, they’re going to mess you up. They’re going to send you to prison. You just need to take a -- Chris Hayes: Take a deal. Rep. Crockett: And I’m sitting there like there is no evidence, like there is no evidence. I’m not saying he did anything wrong or not, but I’m saying there is no evidence that the state has. And I’m fighting with the state. And they’re literally looking to take his entire life. And so here it was, my initial offer was 30 years day for day. This meant that this kid would come out of prison at the age of 47. And they never, ever alleged that he had actually done any of the killing anyway, right. Forty-seven-years-old. So we fight, we fight, we fight. And basically about a week before trial, they said, we’ll offer you 10 on murder. So that meant he would be eligible after five years. So his family is like, yo, take it. Now, if we went to trial and we lost, he was facing mandatory 40 years day for day. That is what he was facing. And he had to put his trust in me as his court appointed attorney. And I started to get nervous because I’m like, well, wait a minute. Five years is better than 12 jurors who will look at you and know that you have pending drug charges against you, who will find out at sentencing that you have this juvie record. I just don’t trust it. And he said, I believe in you. Let’s fight it out. And I got to the day before trial and the state dismissed the case. Chris Hayes: Straight up dismissed. Rep. Crockett: Straight up dismissed. And there was this, oh, you won. And I’m like, did I? Because I had a kid who lost two years of his life, who did not finish high school because he was sitting behind bars because he could not afford to get out because the presumption of innocence did not work for him. So when Donald Trump starts talking this noise, I literally look at it as noise because that’s not the real experience. And honestly, he’s not taking two seconds to go and try to find out what is it to be black in America and to go through the criminal justice system. And it looks nothing like what he experienced. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One of the points that drives me crazy and you highlighted here is who is benefited by delay completely flips based on whether you are incarcerated pretrial or not. And this is really the change in the whole thing. If you are incarcerated pretrial as your client was, then delay is bad for you because they’re just locked up and you’re locked up. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And the system goes so slow. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And prosecutors come and say, we’re not ready yet, judge. Could we roll it over? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: I’m going to be on vacation in August. Rolls over, winds its way slowly.  Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: On the other hand, Trump was out. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Right. Delay works for him. So the entire way the process works and delay benefits has been completely put on its head. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And in fact -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah.  Chris Hayes: -- the delay is the tool by which pleas are produced, which is the tool by which the whole system functions because there is no capacity to try everyone. So you have to have pleas. Rep. Crockett: Exactly. That’s exactly right. And this idea of speedy trial, right, and how you define it and what it looks like. And the rules were basically people that were incarcerated and it went from most serious offense on down. That is supposed to be the priority. And so people that were out on bond, they never want to go to trial, especially if they knew they didn’t have a good chance. You know, like it was hard to get them. Like, they’re not -- Chris Hayes: Right, exactly. Yes, so you’re on a bond. You don’t like delay. Rep. Crockett: No. Yeah. You’re like, forget that. Like they’re like, oh, if I pay you more money, can you get me another continuance? And it’s like, that’s not how it works, guys, right. But that’s very, very true. And we see that there is this kind of breakdown and all of the norms when it comes to trying cases, because you know what, none of my clients had the benefit of putting three people onto the highest court of the land or into any of the courts. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And they didn’t have any interlocutory appeals to send up to that court. Rep. Crockett: They did not. And they didn’t have the benefit of running for office and raising money to pay their very expensive attorney’s fees. Like they don’t, like they’re not going to have 50 appeals before you even get to trial because they’re going through every interlocutory appeal. You know, he’s been convicted. It’s not a final conviction. He’s going to go through as many appeals after appeal, after appeal as he can. The average person does not have that money. So, again, when you started talking about Black folk can understand me. No, they can’t, because that has not been their existence. They make decisions. And we’ve seen so many people that said, I took a plea because it was what I had to do for my family -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Rep. Crockett: -- because they couldn’t afford it and I needed to get out as soon as possible and minimize the fact that I’m going to be gone. Those are the real decisions that a lot of people have had to make in this country. And Donald Trump has never had to make a decision that comes close to that.  Chris Hayes: So what made you want to run for office the first time? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So doing the criminal work, definitely there’s a significant overlap with the civil rights work. You find out about who the bad cops are and you hear these stories and they’re told over and over and over. And, you know, one of the places I felt like I was losing too much in both of these arenas where I may have people that are taking pleas because they just don’t believe that they’ll ever be given a fair shot when they go to trial. And I’m asking them to trust me and they literally have lost belief in the system. As well as those mothers that I’ve had to talk to and say, while I know you lost your baby, we’re going to do everything we can, but our hands are a bit tied from things such as qualified immunity. Chris Hayes: You’re saying lost your baby at the hands of police? Rep. Crockett: At the hands of police, yeah. And so, you know, you start to think, am I really doing enough fighting one case at a time? I can’t be everywhere and I can’t fight every case. And so for me, I was like, I need to change the laws in this state. We’ve got 254 counties in the state of Texas, 30 million people. Maybe if I can effectuate change to how prosecutions come about or what a stop looks like, I can, number one, hopefully save lives. And number two, hopefully we can see a little bit more parity between what happens to say that kid that’s caught with a brownie and the big city versus the kid that’s caught with a brownie that’s laced with marijuana in the small towns. In the small towns, they’ll give them the felony conviction. In the big city, they’ll reduce it down to a misdemeanor and give them an opportunity to go to college, to get the financial aid that they need and to be the amazing, you know, citizens that we know that they can be. And so I just wanted to bring about a bigger change and hopefully save some lives at the same time. Chris Hayes: So you ran in 2020, is that right? Rep. Crockett: Yes. Chris Hayes: So that was your first race. Rep. Crockett: It was not. That was my first race for the State House. Actually, my very, very first race that nobody ever talks about, I try to bring it up when I’m encouraging candidates was actually I ran for the district attorney position when I was 28 years old in Texarkana and the state of Texas had not elected a black woman DA. Chris Hayes: They were like, we’re going to keep that streak going. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, pretty much. But that level of frustration, again, wanting to do more. And I felt like I need to make the decisions. So I actually raised a whopping $7,000. You could not tell me anything. And I won the early votes and ultimately lost on election day. They spent close to $60,000 to beat me. Chris Hayes: What year was that? Rep. Crockett: 2010. Chris Hayes: 2010. So, at 28 you run for district attorney, you lost -- Rep. Crockett: And then I said I would never run for office again. Chris Hayes: So you lost in (inaudible). It must have been crushing. Rep. Crockett: I was okay with it. I mean, I don’t know what I expected. I consulted with my pastor at the time and I was like, I think this is what God is leading me to do, but I don’t want to do it. And so I ran, I educated people. I actually informed policy changes within the DA’s office based on things that I proposed. And ultimately, it’s just not where I was supposed to be. But the lessons that I learned from actually having run a race before allowed me to be successful when I ended up running a decade later for the State House. Chris Hayes: Right. Because you had you had some reps. You kind of knew what you were doing. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Absolutely. Chris Hayes: You just mentioned your pastor. Are you still religious? Rep. Crockett: I am. And, you know, you played that clip and it’s interesting because my pastor texts me while the hearing was going on. He actually called me. He ultimately texted me, but he called me and I was in that hearing. And it was after this exchange had taken place. And I text him. I said, I’m in a hearing. He said, I know. And I mean, why are you calling me in the middle of a hearing? And he ends up texting me and says, I need a warning before you say. And then he said, like, be six. And I was like, huh? I was like, I guess my team -- Chris Hayes: I guess this were -- escaped. Rep. Crockett: -- must have -- Chris Hayes: It’s escape the room. Rep. Crockett: Well, I thought my team clipped it and put it online. And that is not what happened. Everybody else was clipping it. And so it was going immediately viral because I was still sitting in committee when he called me about the interaction. Chris Hayes: How do you think about your faith and how it informs what you do? And particularly in a time when certain forms of Christian faith, including, you know, the Amy Coney Barrett, who went to your same school. She’s Catholic, so it’s a little different. But so much of the presence of pious Christian faith, devoted Christian faith in public life is coded with conservative republicanism and increasingly support for Trump. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. You know, I think that it is great because a lot of times people try to act like Democrats are the Antichrist. And so then I’m like, my daddy’s a preacher. Go look him up, you know. And so I think that it allows me to engage in the conversations and really be a good representation for what actually a lot of black folk are. I mean, when you think about politics and advocacy in general, so much of it was born out of black church.  And it really is centered to the core of who we are. It’s how we were able to get so much. I mean, when you think about the leaders, whether you’re talking about Martin Luther King, who comes from more of the traditional Baptist background, or whether you’re talking about Malcolm X, who comes from the Muslim faith, it always for black folks somehow, our leadership came directly out of the church for moving us forward. And I don’t ever want that to be lost at all. And I think that, you know, there are those that are trying to get us back into finding our voice and our leaders in black church. And my pastor is absolutely one of those. Freddie Haynes is very well known throughout the country because he is an activist and I like to call him a throwback preacher. But when somebody tries to, quote, unquote, “out Christian me,” it’s a little tough when you’re coming at me like that. And I think that what we see out of this Christian nationalism movement is probably what I would imagine those Christians who justified slavery to have been. Those are those kind of people. And I don’t think that they love the same Jesus that I love. I think that tolerance and respect and compassion and empathy is who my faith instructs me to be. I don’t have to agree with you to love you, respect you. And I think that I can bring more people to Jesus by how I live. And so, you know, even when it comes to working together, I say a lot of times, I’m like, listen, if you want to do good by the people, I’m down. I don’t really care if you’re MAGA, if you’re just a general Republican or otherwise, I want to do the work and I can work with anybody. And I know that we will definitely disagree on tons of things, but where we don’t disagree, I don’t hate you. I hate your ways. I hate some of your policies, but I really am a very loving person.  And, you know, for me to get angry enough that I needed to prove a point with the Marjorie Taylor Greene situation, you know, that’s not what I want to happen on a daily basis at all because I don’t think name calling gets us anywhere. And I’d rather build relationships and open hearts and get them to kind of start to be the Christians they proclaim to be than to engage in kind of that level of back and forth. Chris Hayes: Representative Jasmine Crockett is the representative for Texas’s 30th congressional district. She’s serving her first term after one term in the Texas State House. She’s a civil rights attorney and criminal attorney. That was fantastic, Congresswoman. Thank you so much. Rep. Crockett: Thank you, Chris. Chris Hayes: Once again, great thanks to Representative Crockett. I learned a ton. I still can’t get over the fact that she and Amy Coney Barrett went to the same small Christian school for college.

The Top 10 reasons Joe Biden should (and shouldn’t) step aside,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/top-10-reasons-joe-biden-2024-election-trump-rcna160907,"Democrats hoping to keep Donald Trump from returning to power currently have a handful of options, each of which carry a significant amount of risk. The party is largely united on the basics — the presumptive Republican nominee poses an extraordinary risk to democracy and the future of the American experiment — but divided on how best to move forward. There’s no shortage of relevant questions Democratic officials, donors, insiders and voters are confronting right now, but at the heart of the matter is a straightforward line of inquiry: Is President Joe Biden the best option for the Democratic ticket in 2024? If the answer is “yes,” the least risky thing the party can do right now is simply stay the course and stick to the status quo. If the answer is “no,” then Democrats might have a narrow window of opportunity to improve their chances. So, what’s the correct answer? I have plenty of opinions on the matter, though I’ll concede that both camps have made credible arguments in the wake of Biden’s dreadful debate performance 12 days ago. In fact, while organizing my thoughts on the matter, I managed to pull together two contradictory Top 10 lists — one making the case for the Democratic incumbent to pass the torch, and another making the opposite case. Let’s start with the pro-Biden case. 1. If you want to defeat Trump, it makes sense to nominate someone with experience defeating Trump. 2. Biden has an impressive record of success that warrants a second term. 3. Biden’s ideas, goals and priorities enjoy broad public support, which seems like a relevant detail in a national campaign. 4. Post-debate polling has been discouraging, but his support hasn’t completely collapsed, and his current deficit is hardly overwhelming. 5. Biden easily won nearly all of his party’s presidential primaries and caucuses, and it would be undemocratic (and arguably un-Democratic) to discard those results. 6. There are legal and procedural measures in place that make it extremely difficult to replace Biden on the ticket. 7. Removing an incumbent president, four months before Election Day, would signal to the public that Democrats are in a state of chaos and disarray. 8. The intra-party fight over replacing Biden would be divisive and tumultuous at a time when Democrats want and need to be focusing their political fire at the GOP ticket. 9. Plenty of experienced observers and political professionals are convinced that voters simply won’t re-elect Biden given the circumstances, but their assessments have been wrong before — remember when the “Access Hollywood” tape was supposed to doom Trump’s candidacy? — and the whole idea of political “deal-breakers” is probably overdue for a reassessment. 10. It’s simply too late in the process for a new candidate to vet and choose a new running mate, while launching a national organization. And then there’s the case against Biden. 1. The incumbent president was struggling in the 2024 race before his debate failure, and now things are worse. What’s more, Biden is the first Democratic candidate in the 21st century to be trailing at this stage in the race. 2. Public opinion research has been consistent for quite a while: Most voters believe Biden, who'll turn 82 in the fall, is too old. In fact, a New York Times/Siena poll conducted after the debate found that 74% of the country sees the Democrat as “too old to be an effective president.” In campaigns, some problems are relatively easy to fix. The fact that Biden, if re-elected, would turn 86 in his second term isn’t easily cast aside, and denying the problem won’t make it go away. 3. Polling averages suggest Biden’s approval rating is down to nearly 37%. When was the last time an incumbent president won a second term with an approval rating this low at this stage in the process? Never. Since the dawn of modern American polling, it’s simply never happened. 4. Neither Biden nor his team have articulated a compelling strategy to help turn things around. 5. Biden excelled four years ago, not by barnstorming the country, unveiling an exciting new agenda, and being an inspirational voice, but by leveraging his relationships and years of experience. In 2024, however, with Trump’s lead growing, Biden’s skills are incompatible with what his party needs to prevail. 6. Republicans desperately want Biden to remain atop his party’s ticket, and given the stakes, it’s folly for Democrats to give the GOP what it wants. 7. The Democratic plan for 2024 was to turn the race into a referendum on Trump. As Biden struggles, it’s quickly become a choice between two unpopular candidates. Similarly, the more the president’s age becomes the centerpiece of the cycle, the less oxygen there is for everything else, including Trump's and his party's many vulnerabilities. 8. A Biden defeat wouldn’t just cost Democrats the White House: The party’s latest polls suggest the president’s difficulties are on track to create a drag on the party’s down-ballot candidates, making it nearly impossible for Democrats to take control of Congress. 9. The Democrats’ problem appears to be largely Biden-specific: In key states, the president is running behind his own party’s other statewide candidates. It suggests Democrats could still excel in this cycle with a new candidate that voters might get excited about. 10. There’s reason to believe things will get worse: Biden’s campaign has already invested millions of dollars in battleground state ads, in the hopes of moving the needle. It hasn’t worked. (Another part of the strategy was the early debate, and that didn’t work, either.) Trump, meanwhile, has narrowed the financial playing field, and will soon start competing in states where Biden has had the airwaves largely to himself. Which case will prevail? Watch this space."
The stakes for antitrust with Timothy Wu: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/stakes-antitrust-timothy-wu-podcast-transcript-rcna160877,"We’re sharing another episode in our WITHpod 2024: The Stakes series, in which we choose specific areas of policy and talk to an expert about Trump and Biden’s records on the topic. We couldn’t think of a better person than our guest this week to help unpack the two candidates’ stances on antitrust. Timothy Wu is the Julius Silver professor of law, science and technology at Columbia University. He’s known as the “architect” of the Biden administration’s competition and antitrust policies. Wu joins WITHpod to discuss Trump and Biden’s different views on corporate power, the current antitrust landscape, major mergers being challenged this year and more. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Timothy Wu: You know, in some ways, President Biden noticed and learned from the fact that Trump had noticed something. People were mad. But, you know, there’s some ways we disagreed with the Trump administration. We certainly disagreed with the corrupt way it was done. But we also noticed that they had their finger on something that the Democrats were kind of ignoring, which was the rise of corporate power was making a lot of Americans very angry. Chris Hayes: Hello, welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Well, we’re back for another edition of our recurring series this year “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes,” in which we take a look at the records of the two previous presidents, well, the current president, the previous president, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who are running against each other. It’s the first time we’ve had this setup of two incumbents facing off in anyone’s lifetime. It’s a rare thing. Usually in presidential elections, you’ve got to speculate about, you know, what’s this young senator from Illinois going to do as president of the United States or this former governor from Massachusetts? In this case, no speculation required. Obviously, the future is unwritten and things can change, but we do have solid records of both of these individuals as president and what they did. So we’re taking specific policy areas. And this week, a policy area that is, I think, a little off the radar, although occasionally pops in the headlines. For instance, recently a headline in “The New York Times” and “Dealbook” that reads the following, “U.S. clears way for antitrust inquiries into NVIDIA, Microsoft and OpenAI. It’s news the Justice Department, the FTC are teaming up to investigate the AI industry, particularly those three companies, NVIDIA, Microsoft and OpenAI, to see whether they are in violation of antitrust law.” The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are the two main entities of the federal government that investigate antitrust. And you’ve seen more and more headlines about this in recent years because the Biden administration has been one of the most active antitrust administrations in recent memory, definitely in decades. You may have seen the news about Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which are the sort of huge concert venue enterprise of Live Nation and the ticket enterprise of Ticketmaster, which combined, which has led to a lot of headaches for consumers. That’s being challenged and investigated by the Biden administration.  And so I thought antitrust would be a fascinating place to turn our attention on “The Stakes,” partly because this is something that I’ve talked about a little bit over the course of this series. When you’re talking about domestic legislative policy, it’s contingent on Congress to a great degree, right. What kind of laws you pass and sign into law. And we’ve done stuff on that. We have definitely looked at, for instance, taxes was one of our “WITHpod: Stakes” conversations. We looked at taxes and taxes are, you know, set by Congress and then the president signs it. There’s things you can do in the sort of administrative side with the IRS. Antitrust is really interesting because it’s really in the executive domain. You don’t really have to depend on Congress that much. And so it’s a place where presidential prerogatives are kind of at their height. And so I thought it would be great to compare the antitrust records of these two presidents. And so I thought there’s no one better to have this conversation about antitrust with than Timothy Wu. Timothy Wu is the Julius Silver professor of Law, Science and Technology at Columbia University. He’s a public intellectual as well as a legal academic. He’s written on a variety of topics, including books that I think are some of the best books on sort of tech, monopoly, tech culture capitalism. I’ve read “The Attention Merchants” and “Master Switch,” which are particularly excellent. Tim’s been on the program before, so he thinks about this. He’s been studying this and thinking about it for literally decades and also was a practitioner. He actually went into the Biden administration and in the Biden administration was known as one of the key architects of the competition antitrust policies. So he has a sort of inside outside perspective on this. Tim, it’s great to have you in the program. Timothy Wu: It’s great to be back. Chris Hayes: So when we’ve done other topics in this series where we compare the records of Donald Trump and President Biden in their time in office, I think the issue set itself has been a little more self-evident than competition policy and antitrust, which is slightly more obscure. So what I want to sort of just start out with is a kind of one on one about antitrust competition policy. Like, what is it? What are the major tools that a given president has to pursue it before we get into any type of sort of comparative look at the two? Timothy Wu: Yeah, no, that’s a great question. Well, you know, just starting at the basics, it’s the antitrust progressive era policy that I kind of think is almost like the private version of constitutional law. It’s sort of ultimate checks on corporate power and monopoly. It’s a big economic lever. I think the president, in some sense, using antitrust is deciding how concentrated or unconcentrated the economy is going to be by who they appoint. You know, it’s the big difference between a merger friendly and non-merger friendly administration, and also basically how the big monopolists are treated, I think, differs. Is it like monopolies are our friends are going to solve all our problems or, you know, is it more like we’ve got to break these guys up or have some control over them? You know, that’s at the sort of the biggest 10,000 foot view. Chris Hayes: And there’s sort of two places that this really comes into play, as my understanding, which is the Department of Justice, which can pursue lawsuits, right, backed by the U.S. government to break up companies or to stop mergers and the Federal Trade Commission, right. Is that fair to say those are the two main areas where this policy is enacted? Timothy Wu: I’d say yes. But in my time in the White House, one of the things we made a major effort to do was to put the presidency a little more forward and central in the question of announcing what the policy should be. And also we tried to recruit. We created something called the White House Competition Council that tried to involve all the other agencies that have authority. Chris Hayes: Interesting. Timothy Wu: Yeah. And one of the good examples, Department of Transportation. So we got, you know, Secretary Pete involved and said, roughly, you know, you’ve got to be a little harder on the airplanes here and, you know, not just let them merge whenever they want and like shrink streets. You know, things have gone too far in the airline industry. We got the Pentagon, the Department of Defense got more involved in mergers. They ended up blocking a major missile merger that would have combined like the last two missile producers. Yeah. So, more technically would have allowed the bigger (ph) producer to own the engine maker. But we tried very hard in the Biden administration to say, you know, it can’t just be about a bunch of lawyers sitting in Justice and FTC and their economists kind of making these huge decisions. The presidency, at some level, popular opinion has to play a little more of a role here. Chris Hayes: So let’s also sketch a little bit. Let’s do a little bit of the history of antitrust, because I think you need that background in order to kind of appreciate where we are right now and particularly appreciate how much the Biden administration has done or attempted to do and even in some ways the break that Trump represented from his predecessors because I think there’s a real intellectual and ideological movement, political movement. So the birth of antitrust is industrial capitalism in the 19th century. Tell us a little bit about just the origins of the both intellectual and policy regimes of antitrust.  Timothy Wu: Yeah, the origins are sort of mixed very closely with the Gilded Age and the birth of a new form of business, the monopoly trust. So late 19th century, you see for the first time companies that have something like the power of countries or, you know, just an unrivaled level of power and wealth, much greater than anything that I’ve ever seen before in a private enterprise. You know, Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, men like J.P. Morgan, John Rockefeller and the public. And during that time, particularly workers, farmers and some consumers, felt like, you know, this is terrifying. We’ve seen something new in the United States, inequality. This is kind of a much more, particularly in the north, obviously, much more even handed sort of small business kind of country, what’s going on here? And, you know, these have seemed to have no limits on their power and are really changing America in fundamental ways.  So the antitrust movement, late 19th and early 20th century, was an effort to change the structure of the U.S. economy, break up the monopolies and create much more limits on their power. Probably Louis Brandeis, one of the most famous figures involved during this period. Theodore Roosevelt brings the first big cases and they are successful. They do restructure the U.S. economy. We don’t accept monopolization of every sector. There’s a big difference here between the course taken by the United States and other industrialized countries, particularly Japan and Germany, which were much more comfortable with the concentration of their industrial economies. So, yeah, that’s the origins. And it has a sort of progressive populist origin that I think matters because from the early days it was tied to public fear of giant monopolies. Chris Hayes: And my understanding is that the logic as articulated by Brandeis and Teddy Roosevelt and the progressive crusaders for trust busting was sort of twofold. There was an economic logic and there was a political logic. So the economic logic was the basic idea that when competition goes away, prices for consumers go up and you get all sorts of inefficiencies. Monopolies can essentially exert total price control. And if you have vertical monopolies like Standard Oil, which owned railroads and distribution and oil, and they can basically charge whatever they want. And then there’s a political argument that any private entity that gets big and concentrated enough is going to pose some kind of fundamental threat to liberty, as we understand it, which is akin to the constitutional structure argument you were making before, that this is a means of restraining private power in the same way that divided government and checks and balances restrains public power. Is that a fair way to talk about the two?  Timothy Wu: Yes, very fair. I think that Theodore Roosevelt and Louis Brandeis and Woodrow Wilson, those figures were very explicit about the sense that monopoly was a danger to democracy, and Brandeis said this a lot, sort of the American character. Brandeis once said, you know, the question is not whether U.S. Steel is efficient or not, it’s whether it’s consistent with a country in which people want to be free. And they had a very visceral sense that there was extraordinary incompatibility with companies that are as powerful, more powerful than political actors that have extraordinary influence over the political system, like who’s really in charge. So I think that was much more of a factor then than now. You know, to go on a little bit, Theodore Roosevelt, when he launched his first big case against J.P. Morgan. In a letter, he wrote, he said, you know, the people want to know who runs this country and they want their, you know, their president and they want their government to stand up to powers greater than they are. So we have to bring this case. You know, I think he’s an okay guy, JPMorgan, but, you know, the people want this done. So there was that. If I can add one more thing, I think it was less about prices back then and more about, you know, small businesses, farmers, sort of regular Americans, their opportunities to start a business. Brandeis was very concerned that if everybody was an employee of a giant company, we’d all sort of be like a new version of serfdom. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: They were very worried more about that than like, oh, no, they’re going to raise the prices on milk or something. They’re worried about that. But I think they were more worried about these structural things. Chris Hayes: Right. So the structural idea is that, like, if you have a country where there’s two grocery chains, that like no one can start their own mom and pop grocer and that actually starting your own mom and pop grocer and having mom and pop grocers has some like small d democratic value. It’s this sort of entrepreneurial spirit. The fact that people can have kind of a stake in their own community, like all this kind of localism, small business. This was all heavily part of the ethos that was driving this intellectual movement. Timothy Wu: Yes, absolutely. And, you know, we should not neglect labor. Brandeis, to give him credit again, was very prescient in seeing these big businesses are just going to crush labor. I mean, actually, he saw it. He watched Carnegie Steel, you know, hire private armies and gunned down labor workers who were on strike. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: And he’s like, it’s one thing when it’s a, you know, business. But these businesses are so powerful that there’s no way labor can stand up to them either, even organized in union form. So, yeah, I think they’ve thought fundamentally about power and thought that you need the federal government as a countervailing power against entities of this size. I want to say those days, small business and unions were in much better terms. We can talk about that later, but, you know, they saw this as sort of everyone against the monopoly trust. Chris Hayes: Right. That’s a good point. So, this vision, I think it’s fair to say, you know, it’s not like every administration is the same. There are huge variations in the level of concentration they allow, which mergers they allow, which they go after, which companies they try to break up. But that general antitrust consensus, let’s call it, held until around the ‘70s when this new thinking about antitrust emerges, particularly coming from the late Robert Bork and the law and economics movement that’s coming out of the University of Chicago associated with Richard Posner, among other others. Tell us about that sort of challenge to the old consensus of antitrust. Timothy Wu: Yeah, there’s a big turn in the starts of the ‘60s, but becomes politically effective in the ‘70s and ‘80s, particularly after the election of Ronald Reagan. And the intellectual component suggests that the government’s gone too far, that we shouldn’t fear big business, but we should understand the efficiencies possible in big business. And the overriding presumption is Chicago, a very kind of laissez faire school that if business is doing something, it’s probably for a good reason. That’s kind of the intellectual. We’ve been too suspicious. And so, you know, if they have this highly vertically integrated corporate structure, it’s probably for a reason that isn’t fully understood, but it’s probably efficient. And the kind of core of it was this new idea called the consumer welfare standard, which said, you know, the antitrust laws shouldn’t be concerned with democracy, shouldn’t be concerned about power or bigness or, you know, labor relations or unions. They should be concerned just about the question of prices. It’s a very economic, microeconomic focus. Is this merger clearly going to make prices higher? Has this monopoly abused its power such to increase prices? And if you can’t prove that, you don’t have a case. Chris Hayes: And that standard leads to a new regime of antitrust from Reagan. I think it’s fair to say through Obama, although I’m curious if you think so, where that’s the kind of default operating conditions, this sort of consumer welfare standard. We’re not worried about like, do we have enough small business mom and pop grocer entrepreneurs? Are we worried about bigness, qua-bigness and its role in the political economy of American democracy? We’re not interested necessarily in these labor questions. Really, it’s a purely economic question, which is, A, let’s default to the economic logic of these firms that we are assuming making self-interested decisions in favor of efficiency. And two, we’re going to analyze whether we think there’s a likelihood of this ending up in price hikes for consumers. And if it’s not, then we’re basically not going to get involved. Timothy Wu: Yes, I think that’s exactly the right summary. Chicago School of Antitrust is, one way or another, the dominant school of thought from the ‘80s, and I would date it to the end of the first Obama term. So, you know, there’s variations and the Democrats are a little more likely to bring cases than the Republicans. But, you know, a good example is a switch between the George W. Bush and the Obama administration, which, you know, in many ways seem like a watershed. But in antitrust, nothing happened for the first four years, you know, that Obama appointed people who were, I guess, slightly more inclined to bring cases. But the ideology was more important than the personnel at that point. And, you know, jumping ahead a little bit, the Obama administration didn’t stop any mergers either. Larry Summers was in the White House, very critical of antitrust, didn’t really believe in it at all. So there’s some of that. But, you know, ideologically, I think things only really started to shift at all late in the Obama administration and then only slightly. Chris Hayes: Okay. I mean, I don’t think you can overstate this. Like, it’s almost a Copernican revolution that takes place intellectually, like the degree to which the Bork-Posner law and economics use Chicago view of this, which was a challenge to the old consensus becomes a new consensus. You almost can’t overstate it. I mean, it is what antitrust law is. It’s what is taught in schools. It’s like you learn the consumer welfare standard. It is the corpus of antitrust law that people learn as the as what we do now, right? Timothy Wu: Yes. You know, maybe not in my class as much. Chris Hayes: Right. Yes.  Timothy Wu: But it’s no question it became absolutely ideologically dominant. The older concerns about power, democracy, workers, farmers, small business were seen and almost targeted as out of date, obsolete, backward looking. I want to say a thought crime. And many of this, even the statutes were kind of excised from the collective memory. You know, there are entire statutes designed to protect small business like the Robinson-Patman Act. And so strong is the ideological hold that no one will enforce them. It was a famous conference where someone showed up at a discussion of the Robinson-Patman Act in a clown outfit. He just showed up and he said in a clown outfit, you know, this statute is like an imaginary creature and doesn’t work. And if you read the antitrust case books from the ‘90s and onwards, they have a little brief section on the early days, but then they skipped the price theory pretty quick. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So there’s a kind of counterrevolution represented by this school, Bork et al. And then a challenge to that really starts to form. You’re at the center of one of the people who I think is thinking in these new ways that’s kind of revived and furthered a vision of antitrust far more broad in its concerns and vision of what it’s there to do, right? Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think, you know, my myself, I was in the Obama administration first term in the Federal Trade Commission working on enforcement, and I think that was a radicalizing experience. Great people, very hardworking, but there was not a merger that we could find a problem with. You know, they would work really hard. They would do the numbers. It was incredibly, you know, this weird way you can be inside an institution and everyone inside is working hard, so you’re satisfied. You’re not lazy, but you’re not actually doing anything.  And we didn’t stop. I mean, it’s egregious some of the things we let go. That’s when Facebook bought Instagram and we let Google buy Waze. We let Zillow buy Trulia, and before me, we had just let Ticketmaster buy Live Nation. You know, this stuff was pretty much merger to monopoly. Like, it’s hard to know how we got to this position. But even the Democratic administration, that was a very radicalizing period for myself. Chris Hayes: And one of the things that’s also happening during this period, and there are different empirical metrics by which this might be measured, but a lot of concentration happens during the period in which the antitrust consensus shifts to letting mergers happen, to allowing concentration, except in totally extreme circumstances. I mean, it’s striking to me the other day, it is amazing to me, you know, Barry Lynn, who wrote this book, “Cornered,” opens with this amazing anecdote about the pet food when there was like, I think about a decade ago or so where there was a pet food factory in China that was producing pet food that was making pets sick and had to be recalled. And the recall was across like every single brand of pet food, more or less, because it turned out that like the amount of concentration of pet food is like there were very few actual distinct companies making pet food. There were a bunch of brands that are all been integrated into the same company. You find this out. The other day I walked over to get to my local Walgreens, which is now Dwayne Reed Walgreens. And I was like, wait, I thought those were like the last two, I mean, CVS, but the last two left now. Now they’re the same? You know, Zillow, Trulia, like there has been an enormous amount of concentration, right? We’re not imagining that over the last several decades. Timothy Wu: No, not at all. I think that, you know, across industries, you see this pattern of everything going down to, you know, two or three big guys, maybe four big guys. Some of the industry is very dramatically affected. Our hospitals is a very good example where you across the country, you see and maybe listeners experience this, like what used to be three or four hospitals in a town become like one hospital. Chris Hayes: Yep. Timothy Wu: Airlines merged down. I already talked about Live Nation, Ticketmaster. Ticketing becomes a monopoly. Broadband, the cable companies merged together. There’s a few little challenges here or there, but basically it was what called the green light era for antitrust or conversely the, you know, the winter for antitrust law enforcement. And, you know, a bunch of us started to wonder, you know, what was going on. There were always a number of people who were questioning of the Reagan view, but they’d been pushed to the side and treated as like weirdos and ostracized and not given government positions. Guys like Bert Foer, Frank Foer’s father, he kind of was carrying the flame. But, you know, took some Barry Lynn. I give him a lot of credit. You know, he wrote this book in, I guess, ‘08t or so, “Cornered” saying, like, what’s going on here? He wasn’t even a lawyer. He just like had noticed everything. I got into this. Zephyr Teachout and I ran a political campaign. We ran for lieutenant governor against Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul, and we made antitrust a big part of our campaign. And, you know, on the campaign trail, people were like, yeah, why the hell is our hospital merged? You know, what’s going on here? Why is my broadband provider, you know, hiking my rates? There’s no competition. So we got a lot of traction for that. Lina Khan was part of that campaign. She was our advisor. So there’s this like small group of people. There’s other names I probably should mention, but relatively small kind of dissenting groups who start to think like we have gone terribly wrong here somewhere. Chris Hayes: And we should say Lina Khan is the head of the FTC now under the Biden administration, had been at Yale Law and was also one of the people writing in this space about this sort of reviving this view of antitrust, this broader view of what it was there to do and why it was important to enforce existing statutes. So all this set up now to talk about characterizing the Trump administration. Part of the reason I wanted to do this, this topic on “The Stakes,” which is this series we’re doing, “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes,” is I’m really trying not to like make this a hackish enterprise in which we tell you why Donald Trump is bad and Joe Biden is good, but we genuinely try to be like pretty clear eyed about like what the different priorities are. And I do think antitrust is a place where Donald Trump’s legacy is interesting and kind of complicated for the Trump administration. How would you describe it? What would be your top lines to characterize the Trump administration’s antitrust policy? Timothy Wu: If you don’t mind going personal to being in the Obama, I was in the Obama White House the very end of it. And, you know, the campaign was ongoing and we started to realize we had a problem. You know, the economy was consolidated. The White House had done all these own studies about inequality and there was a little like, what the hell happened here over eight years? We let the economy get a little too unfair here. And in its own way, I think Trump has, whatever you want to say about the guy, he has political instincts. And, you know, he noticed that a lot of Americans were also angry about the economy and the sense that, you know, a couple of big companies on the east and west coast seem to have more power than seem fair. So I would characterize him. I’ll say two or three things. I think he is a populist and I think he has, to his credit, an instinct for what the public fears and is concerned about when it comes to big business. It’s often expressed in very strange ways, you know, like somehow immigrants are running these companies or whatever or -- Chris Hayes: Right, globalist elite.  Timothy Wu: Yeah. Or sometimes again, anti-Semitic in weird ways, although now that’s gotten more complicated, but whatever. So, he has his finger on that. And one thing that Trump did is he broke the sort of total freeze on antitrust cases. He refused to hire people who would just sit there and do nothing. So it was a break from the George W. Bush administration, which did almost nothing, very close to nothing. But on the other hand -- Chris Hayes: Yes, what’s on the other hand? Timothy Wu: -- like many Trump things, the whole enterprise was idiosyncratic and personal and seemed to have a lot to do with who his enemies were and who his friends were. So, you know, during the Trump administration, it started to feel like, well, you go in to see Trump to see if your merger is going to get approved or not. Chris Hayes: Yes.  Timothy Wu: You know, this was the impression. And some of the mergers that seemed obviously illegal were nonetheless approved. A good example is a Sprint T-Mobile, you know, two phone companies who have merged and since then raised prices. Chris Hayes: Shocker. Timothy Wu: You know (ph), it’s shocking. It was obvious to anyone that that would happen. But, you know, they seem somehow to have special regard for them. In fact, his head of the Justice Department negotiated a deal. He got involved in negotiating the deal between them. He got involved -- Chris Hayes: The attorney general?  Timothy Wu: No, not the attorney general, the head of the antitrust division. All this stuff came out about his texts as he was like trying to broker a deal. Very inappropriate to like try to make -- Chris Hayes: While being the head of the antitrust? Timothy Wu: Yeah. He used his position of examining the merger to set merger conditions and broker a deal and have them give assets to another company. The whole thing was terrible. Yeah, the whole thing was terrible. Chris Hayes: Wow. Timothy Wu: Yes. Chris Hayes: And there was some reporting to suggest that I think, I forget which of those companies was held at large part held by SoftBank, right? Timothy Wu: Yeah, that’s right. Sprint. Chris Hayes: Sprint was held by SoftBank and the owner of SoftBank, I believe, was a Trump supporter. And there was some reporting to suggest that they were looked upon favorably for that reason.  Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think that there was a lot of smoke, how much fire there was. But, you know, I think there’s a lot of evidence. There was very much the question of favorites, you know, what’s this going to do for me and enemies? One of the first things that the Trump administration did was attack an AT&T Time Warner merger. You know, no one’s fully, completely proved that Trump ordered that merger. But of course, he hated Zucker, hated CNN, hated everything about Time Warner. Lo and behold, his enemies end up having their mergers challenged. His friends get their mergers appealed. So we kind of went from this do nothing kind of law, which was bad, to something which arguably is worse, which is the antitrust law is the cat’s paw of the king kind of situation. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Right. I want to stay on this for a second because I think people don’t quite appreciate how much this was the case, that there was a break with the ideological antecedents of conservative antitrust policy under Trump. No question. Timothy Wu: Yeah. Chris Hayes: It was far more activist. And yet it remains to be definitively determined how much this was the case. But there were indications, genuine bits of evidence, indications and a widespread perception amongst, I think, Fortune 500 corporate elite, that this was essentially if you were with Trump, if you were his friend, you can get the merger approved. And if you were his enemy, you’re going to have a problem. And that this became this kind of incredibly powerful, almost unilateral lever for Trump to wield against people he didn’t like. And in the most notorious case being, and I think it was somewhat surprising when the DOJ announced it would be blocking a proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger. There is some evidence to suggest that at least partly it was born of the animus Donald Trump had towards Jeff Zucker and CNN’s coverage of him. And to the extent that’s true. That’s pretty bad, right. Timothy Wu: Yeah, I used think it’s one of these things where Trump didn’t think there was any problem with it. Chris Hayes: No. Timothy Wu: I mean, I think -- Chris Hayes: He’s just like, oh, I can do that? Yeah. Timothy Wu: I think he thought it was fully within his rights to, you know, order breakup of any company he didn’t like. And I think his White House counsel sort of restrained or slightly done that. But there’s so much circumstantial evidence that the White House, the presidency were involved in antitrust decisions that it’s hard to sort of deny it. And, you know, over drinks, over beers in ways that can’t fully be reported that I hear it even more about it. You know, a good example, a good evidence came from a whistleblower at the DOJ, a guy named John Elias, who’s a friend. And, you know, he witnessed the attorney general, Bill Barr, asking or ordering that the antitrust officials to take a hard look at the marijuana industry and investigate their mergers. And anything else was going on, I guess, based on a personal animus against marijuana industry, cannabis industry. So, you know, it was it was up and down like this. And I think it became understood, as you said, that corporate executives understood that the antitrust law was something where you went to plead your case in the White House and to the president, if possible, you know, which is the opposite of what you would hope would happen in a real democracy. Chris Hayes: And we should be clear, too, that because we did recently a podcast on Project 2025, I think you said Trump didn’t see a problem with this. I think there are people around him, if we think about an ex-Trump administration, who basically think there’s no problem here. In fact, they think the problem is these bureaucrats as intermediaries that the executive is vested in the president. If the president wants to block an antitrust, he’s been empowered by the people to do that. And we don’t need all these civil servant bureaucrat nerds like Tim Wu and Lina Khan, all these people running these analyses to come up with some kind of even handed notion of the president could do what he wants. He wants to block mergers, he blocks mergers. He wants to say okay, it’s okay. He’s elected. Ultimately, he’s accountable to people. So I think there’s a view that like what we’re describing as like appalling and corrupt, you know, if confirmed, I think there are people on the other side who say that’s fine. Timothy Wu: Yeah, there are people who say it’s fine. There are people who see the Justice Department as a group of lawyers who are supposed to work directly for the president. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: You know, this is kind of a pre-Nixon view -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Timothy Wu: -- that they are the government, the president’s lawyers, and he can fire them if they don’t do what he says. So, you know, if he hates Jeff Bezos and wants to order his department to break up Amazon, well, you know, he was elected by the people and they know he’s a little bit hot-tempered. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: But that’s what they voted for. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: There is that position. I think, you know, maybe the risks are stating the obvious. It’s dangerous. I do think the president should have a role in staying policy, like maybe say big tech is a problem. But the idea that, you know, whoever donates more money to the presidency, you know, is safe seems to me obviously pretty dangerous to democracy, too. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: Just in terms of the Trump record, there’s the Sprint T-Mobile, which they allow, DOJ blocks the AT&T-Time Warner, which ends up having huge ramifications because then there’s subsequently another merger that does go through and has changed the media landscape in important ways. In the last year, there’s actions against Google and Facebook, and again, I think both of those. kind of like the AT&T-Time Warner. could be justified in the merits as good antitrust enforcement and also were colored by a perception that this was part of a broader animus against big tech, which he felt had betrayed him. Timothy Wu: Yes, I think that’s right. And that’s the problem with having a personality driven antitrust law. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: Yeah. You know, you want people to trust in the rule of law, not in the rule of men. Let’s put it that way. Chris Hayes: And one more thing about the Trump administration seems important to me is that all the things we’re talking about are coming out of the Department of Justice. There’s an antitrust division at the Department of Justice. There’s also the Federal Trade Commission, FTC. That’s where you worked in the first Obama administration. They also have tasked competition policy. They can bring actions on mergers and things like that.  My understanding is that the FTC, unlike the DOJ, which was more activist than its predecessors, although arguably in ways that raise suspicion, the FTC was pretty silent during the Trump years and didn’t do a ton. Timothy Wu: Yes, that’s right, other than the Facebook case. The FTC did break up Facebook. So they didn’t do nothing. Sorry to -- Chris Hayes: All right, that. Good point. Timothy Wu: Can I say another thing about the Trump years? Many, you know, experience in the White House is when you look carefully at most things the Trump administration did, there was a big difference between the facade and then like what was behind the scenes. You know, it was often like going to a Hollywood film set where you notice that just the front is there. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: And the front in the in the Trump antitrust enforcement was the big case against Google, the big case against AT&T-Time Warner, and the big case against Facebook, sort of big celebrity defendants. But behind the scenes, there was a lot not happening. Like it was sort of --  Chris Hayes: Interesting. Timothy Wu: Yeah. And a good example, really one of the most troubling was a great reduction in the criminal investigation of cartels. So, you know, price fixing cartels are criminally enforced. And this is when people get together in smoke filled room, old school style and say, all right, let’s raise the price of wheat or something or, you know, this component you never heard of. And it’s not famous companies or anything like that. Well, for whatever reasons, during the Trump administration, behind the scenes, criminal enforcement cartels went way down. And, you know, maybe the guys he appointed just like were kind of like him. On the one hand, wanted to say and make a big splash. But the other hand, were quietly like letting business have what they want. A lot of much lower profile mergers were passed on, even troubling ones and they’re including a bunch of Defense Department stuff, you know, all the kind of slightly less visible kind of corrupt feeling industries. They seem to get all their mergers through. So, you know, telecom and defense, those kind of things. So I just want to say at the core was this highly lax attitude, which was sort of masked by a high profile side to it. It didn’t go deep. It did not go deep is what I want to say. Chris Hayes: That’s a great summary. So that brings us to the Biden administration -- Timothy Wu: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- which I think is really quite a break with its predecessor and with predecessors in Democratic administrations and you have first person account. You were brought into the White House, right, in a White House position to sort of oversee and advise on anti-competition policy. He appointed Lina Khan, who is, you know, one of the most outspoken intellectuals, writers, theorists of this kind of new antitrust in the country, arguably, which is a huge deal, and business hated it and fought it. So, what is the Biden administration’s antitrust vision and implementation been like? Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think there was a conscious explicit decision by the president to go back to FDR and Theodore Roosevelt and Brandeis style antitrust to revive progressive era antitrust, new deal antitrust, and make it as it once was, oriented less towards prices, more towards small business workers, and this question of corporate power. So there was there was a major turn. The president himself blessed this. He gave a speech announcing that we are going back to the FDR style doing things. You know, we pitched the president on this. The president said, you know, what are we going to do to make the economy fair again? But, you know, in some ways, President Biden noticed and learned from the fact that that Trump had noticed something. People were mad. But, you know, there’s some ways we disagreed with the Trump administration. We certainly disagree with the corrupt way it was done. But we also noticed that they had they had their finger on something that the Democrats were kind of ignoring, which was the rise of corporate power was making a lot of Americans very angry.  And so, you know, Biden comes in, gives this big speech, writes an executive order, creates the White House Competition Council. He then appoints Lina and also Jonathan Cantor, who is a figure, very pro enforcement figure. And, you know, we wanted to make not a little adjustment like the Obama administration or Clinton, but to turn the ship 90 degrees. And, you know, I think we’ve had some success. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Tell me about some of the cases and some of the areas where you can point to that success. Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think a big one, not always in the headlines, is this merger and consolidation policy. Jonathan Cantor, Lina Kahn have blocked over 40 mergers already. Chris Hayes: Wow. Timothy Wu: They’ve challenged some big ones. Stuff that happened during Trump or during Obama is not happening. I think it’s a totally different atmosphere if you talk to people on Wall Street about what it, you know, trying to get them trying to merge the monopoly looks like. You know, it’s not like Facebook’s trying to buy TikTok or anything like that. It’s a totally different story. I think it was clear in the 2010s, particularly in tech, they felt they could just buy any competitor and that would be the answer. So I think merger environment has changed. If you talk to anyone on Wall Street, they’ll agree with that. And another big thing, very visible, is we have broadened the attack on big tech and the effort to sort of, you know, have a reckoning with the power of big tech. So there’s a lawsuit against Facebook seeking dissolution, which we restarted. We have had a trial against Google. The verdict will be coming out soon.  Chris Hayes: And that’s on its ad pricing?  Timothy Wu: No, this is on the deal with Apple to prevent Apple from going into search. Chris Hayes: All right.  Timothy Wu: And in exchange, take $20 billion a year. That’s a short form of it. So this kind of, you know, deal to keep Apple and other competitors of a search in exchange for money. Lawsuit against Amazon. Lawsuit against Apple. That’s basically almost every company in big tech. And those are, you know, big old style, you know, Theodore Roosevelt style antitrust suits. Chris Hayes: And those are coming out of DOJ? Timothy Wu: And Federal Trade Commission, a mix. Chris Hayes: Okay. Cool. Timothy Wu: They kind of divide them up. You know, in the federal government itself, I mentioned earlier we founded the Competition Council. So every six months, all of the secretaries or heads of agencies who have something to do with competition policy come in front of the president and like, what have you done lately? What are you doing to kind of move the economy? And I think it’s had some big results. If you haven’t noticed, the Department of Transportation is finally being a little harder on the airline industry after essentially being in some version of their bedroom for the last 40 years. The Defense Department has finally started to think that it might need more than one person building some of our most important defense equipment, including missiles and airplanes and other things. Chris Hayes: That’s such an interesting area, too, right? Because you’re talking to go back to Trump about the sort of these kind of celebrity defendants, right? So the idea of like, if you bring some big actions against companies, everyone knows and their faces with every day. And that’s, you know, that’s true in Biden as well. Amazon, Apple. But a huge part of the economy is happening within companies that you’re not necessarily thinking about or interfacing with every day. Timothy Wu: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And that’s particularly true about weapons and the provision of like no consumer buys missiles. There’s only one entity that’s going to buy missiles here in the United States. And that’s the Department of Defense. It is the sole purchaser. Timothy Wu: Yes. Chris Hayes: And so the question of how diversified do you want this sort of military industrial base to be? Do we need more than one company providing our missiles? Should there be three or four? It just exists in a totally different universe than consumer goods. Timothy Wu: That’s right. And it’s pretty dangerous, I guess, should say to have just one company for anything truly essential. And also, then they charge whatever they want. Chris Hayes: Right. Yeah. Timothy Wu: I mean, the cost of American taxpayers, hundreds of billions of dollars when you have single source contracts. I mean, the numbers are crazy in defense. The difference in the Biden administration is we went deep. We spent a lot of attention on the little stuff that doesn’t make the headlines, but, frankly, has billion dollar price tags, whether it’s in defense, whether transportation, the shipping industry. We got very concerned with trains, blocked train merger. A lot of stuff is, as I said, not going to make a lot of headlines. The effort to break up Ticketmaster, Live Nation, which launched just a few weeks ago, is high profile, but we didn’t just want to make this a show and a dance. Chris Hayes: Tim Wu is a Julius Silver professor of Law, Science and Technology at Columbia University. He’s the author of a bunch of books, all of which I’ve read that I’ve recommend. And he’s known as one of the chief architects of the Biden administration’s competition antitrust policies. Tim, it’s great having the program. Timothy Wu: Pleasure. It’s great. Thanks a lot. Chris Hayes: Once again, great thanks to Timothy Wu. He really is one of my favorite public intellectuals. I think he’s just an incredible writer and thinker. And his books are great. I really highly recommend them. You can e-mail us at withpod@gmail.com. Get in touch with us using the #WITHpod. Search for us on TikTok by searching WITHpod.

Jon Stewart’s ‘told you so’ about Biden was the scolding we needed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-tried-warn-us-joe-biden-rcna160914,"Monday night, “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart power-washed, rinsed and then blow-dried advocates of President Joe Biden who have tried to spin his abysmal debate performance against former President Donald Trump as just an off night, or no big deal, or insignificant given the magnitude of the authoritarian apocalypse that may loom ahead. It was a well-earned victory lap for Stewart who’d been roundly criticized, including by me, for some of his routines about Biden’s age and fitness for office.  “Get on board or shut the f--- up,” Stewart demurred Monday, “is not a particularly pro-democracy bumper sticker.” “For a campaign based on honesty and decency,” he opined, “the spin about the debate appears to be blatant bulls---.” And if Stewart seemed more animated than usual, then, again, perhaps he was impelled by (justified) indignation at his critics. Back in February, Stewart endured his very own digital rinse at the hands of Mary Trump, Keith Olberman, assorted internet randos and, yes, this writer right here. The claim — our claim — was clear: Dude, now’s not the time for symmetrical yucks, or bothsidesism. Train your comedic flamethrower on the unambiguous orange threat to our democracy. Or, make a d--- joke. Those are funny. Do that! And stop, we implored him, stop! likening Biden to Colonel Butters, an oldster who seems to inadvertently shamble onto the set of a 1970s sitcom.  Monday, an  agitated Stewart bristled at the notion that by criticizing Biden he was “enabling facism.” He mocked Biden’s resigned response to ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that if Trump wins, he’ll console himself as having done his best.  After showing a clip of Biden saying, “As long I gave it my all and I did the goodest job that I know I can do. That’s what this is about.” Stewart responded angrily: “THAT’S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT!” Riding that rage, Stewart fumed: “There are no participation trophies in end-game democracy.” He dutifully reminded his audience that Democrats could work this all out at, let’s say, a convention. In a place like Chicago, perhaps? In like, six weeks maybe? While there, the Dems could reflect upon their options after, for example, visiting the restaurant featured in the FX series “The Bear.”  In the flurry, Stewart clarified “I am not saying Biden should drop out; [but] can’t we open up the conversation?” That sounds reasonable to me. So here we are. In retrospect, Stewart was likely correct to light up Biden a few months back. He did so not in the name of bothsidesism, but to warn his viewers of a serious vulnerability, a vulnerability Republicans and their comms people were already pouncing on. Comedy isn’t always “correct” or” factually true.” Actually, it rarely is, and we wouldn’t like it if it aspired to be so. But in this case it was and, though damning for some of us, Stewart is vindicated as having tried to warn America about a Biden weakness we were trying not to see."
Biden's doctor says neurologist's White House visits were not for the president,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 9:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-neurologist-white-house-parkinsons-rcna160839,"Hours after a White House press briefing turned combative over questions about a neurologist's repeated visits to the White House, President Joe Biden's physician said that those appointments were not related to the president. In a letter released by the White House on Monday night, Kevin O'Connor, the president's physician, said Biden has only been examined by Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders and Parkinson's disease, in each of his three annual physicals and on no other occasions: O'Connor's letter was released after a testy White House press briefing earlier that day in which White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped questions about Cannard’s repeated visits to the White House. Several news outlets reported that visitor logs showed Cannard visiting the White House eight times in eight months. Jean-Pierre said she could not confirm details about Cannard's visits due to “security reasons.” But she denied that Biden was being treated for Parkinson's disease or that he is taking medication for it. Cannard did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, and the White House subsequently issued a statement that a “variety of specialists from the Walter Reed system visit the White House complex to treat the thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds.” Biden's last annual physical was in February. In his report at the time, O'Connor deemed the president ""a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male"" who is fit to serve in office, but did not mention an evaluation of Biden's cognitive ability. At the time, Jean-Pierre said Biden's doctors determined he did not need a cognitive test. It’s unclear if such an evaluation, on its own, is adequate to assess whether a person is fit for office. Biden himself has recently dismissed the idea of taking such a test. In an interview with ABC News last Friday, he said his duties as president are, in themselves, a test of his mental acuity. “Not only am I campaigning, I’m running the world,” Biden said.   Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have ""aced"" a recent cognitive test, though his campaign has yet to make public any such results. Biden, already struggling with voters’ concerns about his age, has faced immense pressure from his party since his poor debate showing in late June. The president has remained defiant about staying in the race, saying he believes he’s still the best person to defeat Trump. Congressional Republicans have sought to capitalize on the discussion about Biden’s age and mental fitness. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, whose impeachment inquiry into the president has largely fizzled out, asked O’Connor to appear for an interview about the president and has attempted to connect him to Biden’s relatives."
"Tuesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 7.9.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tuesdays-campaign-7924-rcna160888,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In case Democrats weren’t already worried, a newly released AARP poll in Wisconsin — generally seen as one of the nation’s most important battleground states — finds Donald Trump leading President Joe Biden by 5 points in a head-to-head matchup. The margin grows to 6 points with third-party candidates in the mix. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * The same poll, however, found incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leading Republican Eric Hovde in Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race by 5 points. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * A variety of Democratic senators continue to appear quite skeptical of Biden’s electoral future, including Sen. Patty Murray, a member of Democratic leadership and the chair of the Appropriations Committee. The Washington state Democrat said in a statement that despite her “strong respect” for the president, “we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job.” Murray added, “At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.” * On a related note, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, went public yesterday with his belief that Biden should abandon his re-election bid. * Trump told Fox News last night that he has delayed his running mate announcement because he’s waiting to see whether Biden will remain his opponent. “You know, we wanted to see what they’re doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,” the Republican said, referring to Democrats. * In Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race, Republican David McCormick claims to have created “hundreds of jobs” in Pittsburgh. The evidence suggests otherwise. * And in Arizona, failed Senate candidate Blake Masters is now running for the U.S. House and keeps suggesting that he enjoys Trump’s support — despite the fact that Trump endorsed his primary rival, Abe Hamadeh. Politico reported that Team Trump has reportedly contacted Masters “to urge the Arizona Republican to pull or change ads that falsely or incorrectly imply that he has Trump’s endorsement in his congressional campaign.”"
"Zelenskyy, U.S. allies bristle at the prospect of Trump’s return",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 8:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/zelenskyy-us-allies-bristle-prospect-trumps-return-rcna160868,"For Democratic officials and voters, this is a time of extraordinary anxiety. Donald Trump appears to be the worst presidential candidate imaginable, but he’s nevertheless winning the 2024 race — and his advantage is growing. The prospect of the felonious Republican wielding power alongside a far-right Congress and radicalized Supreme Court is very real. The intensifying fears, however, are not limited to the United States. As NATO leaders prepare to meet in Washington this week, NBC News reported that Trump’s possible return is “casting a shadow over the summit.” Officials from U.S. partners are keenly aware of the fact that the former president, if returned to power, could endanger the future of the alliance, among other radical departures. After all, as a report by The New York Times reminded readers overnight, “Mr. Trump once declared NATO ‘obsolete,’ threatened to exit the alliance and more recently said he would let the Russians do ‘whatever the hell they want’ to any member country he deemed to be insufficiently contributing to the alliance.” A Politico report added that U.S. allies in NATO want President Joe Biden to win another term, but they no longer believe that’s likely to happen, fueling international fears. But as concerned as NATO members are about the future of American leadership, unease in Kyiv is at a whole other level. The Times reported over the weekend: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to Bloomberg News last week, for example, and was rather candid about his fears. “If there are risks to Ukrainian independence, if we lose statehood — we want to be ready for this, we want to know,” the Ukrainian leader said. “We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S. or will be all alone.” “If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,” Zelenskyy added. That said, it’d be an overstatement to suggest every prominent foreign official is fearful about Trump’s possible second term. The Times’ report added that Russia’s Vladimir Putin recently delivered public remarks and “seemed to relish the prospect of Mr. Trump’s return.” Imagine that."
Why Trump keeps demanding credit for Biden’s insulin breakthrough,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 7:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-keeps-demanding-credit-bidens-insulin-breakthrough-rcna160858,"It’s not a secret that Donald Trump spends a great deal of time watching television, which means he occasionally sees Democratic campaign ads — many of which note President Joe Biden’s accomplishments. If I had to guess, I’d say the former president saw just such an ad yesterday afternoon, leading to this item by way of his social media platform: If the message sounded at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. About a month ago, the presumptive Republican nominee published this item, insisting, “Low INSULIN PRICING was gotten for millions of Americans by me.” He added that the Democratic incumbent “had NOTHING to do with it.” Soon after, during the first presidential debate of the 2024 cycle, Biden briefly referenced his success in making insulin more affordable. Trump was outraged. “I’m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors,” the former president claimed. “I took care of the seniors.” The day after the debate, Trump held a rally in Virginia and repeated the lie. “I was the one that got you the inexpensive [insulin], not him,” the Republican said, adding, “I did the insulin!” Even by Trump standards, this is pretty weird. Indeed, while the GOP candidate clearly hopes to score a few campaign points, especially with seniors, the truth is unambiguous, whether the former president understands it or not. In reality, it’s true that Trump said he would address insulin costs while in office, but he didn’t. The issue then fell to Biden, who signed the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act — which included the policy on insulin costs. As a result, American consumers are benefiting from a policy that caps the cost of insulin at $35. Complicating matters, Trump isn’t just claiming credit for one of Biden’s accomplishments, he’s also planning to undo the Inflation Reduction Act, which would necessarily mean the end of the price caps that the Republican is falsely attributing to himself. It doesn’t help that the former president might not know what insulin even is. At an event four years ago, for example, the then-Republican president said, “I don’t use insulin. Should I be? Huh? I never thought about it. But I know a lot of people are very badly affected, right? Unbelievable.” To this day, I still don’t know what point he was trying to communicate. Nevertheless, the issue has returned to the fore in an unexpected way, and Trump’s rhetoric is plainly bonkers. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The far-right House Freedom Caucus continues to shrink,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/far-right-house-freedom-caucus-continues-shrink-rcna160840,"As the current Congress got underway, members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus probably felt a degree of optimism about their power and influence. The radical faction was largely unified; it had relatively specific ambitions; and thanks to then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s desperation, Freedom Caucus members were positioned to have an impact. A year and a half later, the far-right contingent hasn’t just failed to secure any accomplishments, it’s also shrinking. A year ago this week, for example, members of the group agreed to oust Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia from the Freedom Caucus. It was the first time the faction had ever chosen to kick out one of its members. But it wasn’t the last time. Republican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas was reportedly pushed out of the conservative group earlier this year because he hadn’t attended enough caucus meetings. Soon after, the Freedom Caucus voted to remove then-Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, too, because of his willingness to occasionally break with party orthodoxy. More recently, Republican Rep. Bob Good of Virginia — the chair of the House Freedom Caucus — narrowly lost his re-election bid, coming up short in a GOP primary. Though there will apparently be a recount, if the certified results hold, it means the contingent’s top leader will soon no longer be in Congress. This week, the Freedom Caucus’ roster grew even smaller. Politico reported: But wait, there’s more: Axios reported that Rep. Troy Nehls didn’t approve of the way the group ousted Davidson, so he quit, too. “I will continue to support their conservative agenda, I just won’t be a member,” the Texas Republican said. Some might be tempted to argue that the Freedom Caucus will be better off with members who are more closely aligned, but on Capitol Hill, there’s strength in numbers — and right now, the far-right faction’s membership list is moving in the wrong direction. If recent history is any guide, this is usually around the time the faction’s members do something dramatic to remind the political world of their relevance. Watch this space.

"The new Republican platform is special, but not in a good way",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-republican-platform-special-not-good-way-rcna160824,"The fact that the Republican National Committee has written a platform suggests the party has finally cleared a low bar. It was, after all, just four years ago when the RNC — for the first time since 1856 — skipped the platform-writing process altogether and instead declared that it simply wanted whatever Donald Trump said he wanted. With this in mind, the fact that Republicans actually bothered to write down their principles, priorities, values and goals certainly looks like progress — at least until one actually reads the document the party produced. USA Today’s Rex Huppke made the case that the Republicans’ new platform reads as if it were generated “by an authoritarian-leaning AI that was fed a Trump rally transcript.” What, specifically, makes the Republican platform so extraordinary? Let us count the ways. The preamble: Before the blueprint begins in earnest, there’s a preamble, spanning nearly three pages, which appears to have been written by Trump himself. It’s filled with vapid, all-caps, bumper-sticker-style declarations, featuring a combination of vague goals and proposals that President Joe Biden has already delivered. The contents: Some of the reporting about the new RNC blueprint has suggested that it was made deliberately more “moderate” than some far-right partisans preferred. Don’t believe it. As American Bridge’s Brandon Weathersby summarized in a statement, “The Republican National Committee platform is one of the most extreme party platforms ever in the history of modern presidential elections.” From immigration to education, taxes to law enforcement, there should be no doubt that this assessment is correct. The omissions: Hoping to avoid campaign-season attacks, the Republican platform no longer calls for federal prohibitions against abortion and same-sex marriage, but as the editorial board of The Washington Post summarized, “The former president wants the 2024 GOP platform to be anodyne, but don’t be fooled. He has an extreme agenda.” The language: It was hard not to notice that the new Republican platform condemns “Christian-hating Communists,” which is a phrase with a deeply ugly history. The length: The party’s platform in 2016 was nearly 60 pages. There were some reports indicating that this total, at Trump’s insistence, would be cut in half. Those reports understated matters: The actual text of the 2024 platform spans roughly 10 pages — reinforcing the fact that the contemporary Republican Party just isn’t serious about governing and policymaking. The process: While Republicans have spent decades crafting the party’s platform in public, this year, the process was moved behind closed doors. Even more incredibly, Politico published this report on the way in which the platform was approved: “Representatives from Trump’s campaign walked around the room with a ‘vote yes’ sign as voice votes were being held. ... One RNC member who was present inquired about why staff of the Trump campaign and RNC were taking photographs of delegates as they voted.” For now, the document is still a draft platform: As NBC News reported, the blueprint “still must get approval from the full Republican National Committee.” Watch this space."
"What is Project 2025? The plans for Trump's second term, explained",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-what-know-trump-president-second-term-rcna160465,"A far-right blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration has become an increasing source of controversy, leading Trump to at least try to distance himself from it. But what would Project 2025 actually do? Clocking in at a staggering 920 pages, the proposal from the conservative Heritage Foundation and more than 100 like-minded groups outlines step-by-step plans to give the next president massive new powers and politicize federal agencies. It also outlines a long wish list of conservative ideas he would pursue with those powers. Among other things, Project 2025 proposes: • Passing sweeping tax cuts • Limiting the U.S. role in NATO • Developing new nuclear weapons • Abolishing the Department of Education and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration • Reversing the FDA’s approval of abortion pills • Reducing legal immigration • Ending Head Start • Stripping NPR and PBS of federal funding • Outlawing pornography While not new, the proposal has received a lot more attention in recent weeks. HBO host John Oliver dedicated a segment on his show, “Last Week Tonight,” to Project 2025, which has now been viewed 6.9 million times on YouTube alone. Black Entertainment Television Awards host Taraji P. Henson encouraged viewers to look up Project 2025 in late June. Other celebrities, such as actor Mark Hamill and singer Lizzo, have posted about it on social media. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts inadvertently drew more attention when he said in an interview that the U.S. was in the process of a ""second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be."" And now, there are signs that voters are responding. Searches for ""Project 2025"" have spiked on Google, while it has become a hot topic on Reddit, where a subreddit with more than 54,000 members is dedicated to defeating it. This guide answers some of the biggest questions Americans have about the conservative playbook. Trump has recently sought to distance himself from Project 2025, but he has close ties to the people behind it. Russ Vought, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, wrote the chapter on the executive office. John McEntee, who was director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office under Trump, is a senior adviser to Project 2025. Three former Trump administration staffers — Paul Dans, Spencer Chretien and Troup Hemenway — are listed as the heads of the Project 2025 team. The Heritage Foundation has a track record of getting Trump to support its ideas. In 2018, it claimed that Trump had carried out or embraced at least two-thirds of its ideas in his first year in office, exceeding a previous high-water mark set in President Ronald Reagan’s first year. In a 2022 keynote address at Heritage’s annual leadership conference, Trump effusively praised Roberts shortly after the latter became the group's president and said Roberts was ""going to be so incredible"" in his new role. Still, Trump denies any connection. ""I know nothing about Project 2025,"" he wrote on his Truth Social account last week. ""I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them."" Notably, the former president did not say which Project 2025 proposals he opposed. In November, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying that proposals by ""various non-profit groups are certainly appreciated and can be enormously helpful"" but stressing that ""none of these groups or individuals speak for President Trump or his campaign."" ""Unless a second term priority is articulated by President Trump himself, or is officially communicated by the campaign, it is not authorized in any way,"" it said. The proposal's most dramatic shift would be to reclassify thousands of federal jobs, allowing Trump to fire career employees and replace them with his picks. This would be the most dramatic shift in the federal workforce since the 1880s, when reformers ended the partisan ""spoils system,"" which led to incompetence, graft and corruption within federal agencies. ""Our goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained and prepared conservatives to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State,"" the authors say in a foreword. Trump previously tried this move toward the end of his presidency, signing an executive order to create the new job classification — known as ""Schedule F"" — in October 2020. President Joe Biden repealed that order when he took office and sought to add new protections for federal workers. Many other Project 2025 plans rely on this broad new proposed power, as they would need federal workers to sign off on implementation. Robert Shea, who served in the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, has said that Schedule F would create ""an army of suck-ups"" within the federal government since if federal workers objected that a policy was unwise, impractical or even illegal, they could be fired. The proposal would roll back many current efforts to fight climate change while also promoting oil and gas. In short, the proposal calls for a “whole-of-government unwinding” of what it calls “the Biden Administration’s climate fanaticism.” Project 2025 calls for ending subsidies for wind and solar power, making it easier to drill domestically for oil and natural gas and build nuclear power plants, promoting fossil fuels in the developing world, ending federal mandates and subsidies for electric vehicles and breaking up NOAA, which it says has “become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.” One section says the Environmental Protection Agency has used “fear-based rhetoric” about “the perceived threat of climate change” by overstating its “actual harms.” Another says the secretary of energy should “oppose eyesore windmills built at taxpayer expense.” The proposal would add new restrictions on legal immigration and use various executive actions to reshape the immigration system. Project 2025 would target the ""Dreamers,"" people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and who received protection from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Under Project 2025, the Department of Homeland Security would deprioritize staff work on DACA and other ""unlawful programs"" to the point that Dreamers would be unable to renew those protections. The proposal would take the same approach with Biden's Uniting for Ukraine program, which allows more Ukrainians to come to the U.S. The proposal also calls for blocking federal student loans to DACA recipients, as well as state colleges that provide in-state tuition rates to Dreamers. Project 2025 also calls for the secretary of homeland security to decline to update or expand H-2A and H-2B visas used by guest workers, restrict temporary visas given to victims of human trafficking, let Temporary Protected Status designations for countries affected by armed conflict or environmental disasters lapse and increase fees on immigration paperwork. An analysis from the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank, summarizes the proposals as a ""meticulously orchestrated, comprehensive plan to drive immigration levels to unprecedented lows"" while circumventing Congress and the courts. The proposal calls for a ""top-to-bottom overhaul"" of the Justice Department and the FBI, repeating Trump's baseless claims about the department and the bureau: It proposes changing the supervision of the FBI within the Justice Department to curb its independence, a move that critics say would give the president more power over prosecutions. It also calls for an ""immediate, comprehensive review"" of all active FBI investigations, ending any that are ""unlawful or contrary to the national interest"" and possibly issuing a public report. It would also bar the FBI from attempting to combat ""the spread of so-called misinformation and disinformation."" The proposal calls for reducing the federal role in education policy, including eliminating the Education Department and refocusing higher education policy on job skills. Overall, Project 2025 proposes eliminating federal education spending programs or turning them into ""no-strings-attached"" block grants that states could spend however they wanted. It also suggests tying federal spending directly to students, which would allow it to be used on private schools. (The proposal is vague about how exactly this would be implemented.) One section calls for ending Head Start, a comprehensive early education program for low-income children under five that has served about 39 million children since it started in 1965. The proposal also calls for rescinding the congressional charter of the National Education Association, the leading labor union for teachers and other educators, and conducting congressional hearings about its political activities. In higher education, it calls for focusing more on ""bolstering the workforce skills of Americans who have no interest in pursuing a four-year academic degree."" The proposal calls for limiting or ending student debt forgiveness programs, turning the current government-run student loan program over to a new federal authority and tightening income-driven student loan repayments. ""The new Administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,"" it says in a criticism of Biden's student debt forgiveness measures. ""The new Administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans."" The proposal criticizes the expansion of income-driven repayment programs, which tie payments on federal student loans to income. It says the Education Department should phase out existing programs and consolidate them in a new plan open only to the lowest-income Americans: The proposal calls for the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw its 2000 approval of mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill that has recently become a target of anti-abortion-rights activists. The U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected a legal challenge to the drug, arguing that a group of doctors who brought the case did not have standing to sue. Louisiana recently classified mifepristone and misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, as controlled dangerous substances. The proposal also calls for barring sending abortion pills through the U.S. mail or by private companies like UPS and FedEx by reviving the Comstock Act, an 1873 law, a move that abortion rights supporters say would amount to a ""backdoor scheme"" to ban abortion. It also proposes banning the military from spending any money to ""facilitate abortion for servicemembers,"" creating a ""pro-life task force"" in the Department of Health and Human Services to ""promote the life and health of women and their unborn children"" and appointing a ""special representative for domestic women's health."" ""HHS should return to being known as the Department of Life by explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care,"" it says. The proposal calls for the federal government to promote heterosexual marriage and proposes new restrictions on transgender Americans. On education policy, it would bar public educators from calling students by names other than what are listed on their birth certificates or pronouns other than their ""biological sex"" without written permission of their parents or guardians. It would also allow all public educators to opt out of using pronouns if they are ""contrary to the employee's or contractor's religious or moral convictions."" On health policy, it calls for ending any research based on “woke transgender activism” at the National Institutes of Health and having the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend that gender-reassignment surgery not be covered in state health plans. On military policy, Project 2025 proposes banning transgender Americans and people with HIV from serving in the military, expelling any current service members with ""gender dysphoria"" and barring the military from spending any money on ""transgender surgeries."" More broadly, the proposal calls for rescinding regulations that bar discrimination “on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics” and removing “divisive symbols such as the rainbow flag” from U.S. embassies as part of an effort to stop promoting “pro-LGBT initiatives” in Africa. The proposal also calls for the federal government to ""maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family,"" which it defines as a ""heterosexual, intact marriage:"" Another section calls for the secretary of health and human services to ""proudly state that men and women are biological realities that are crucial to the advancement of life sciences and medical care and that married men and women are the ideal, natural family structure because all children have a right to be raised by the men and women who conceived them."" The proposal calls for dramatically restricting pornography, arguing that it does not deserve First Amendment protection. The foreword argues that pornography — which it defines to include the “transgender ideology” — is “as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.” (Experts disagree about whether people can become addicted to porn the same way they get addicted to alcohol or drugs.) The proposal calls for a dramatic buildup of nuclear weapons, accelerating the development and production of new weapons despite current arms treaties. Among other things, Project 2025 proposes increasing funding for new and modernized nuclear warheads, developing a new sea-launched cruise missile, buying more intercontinental ballistic missiles and preparing to test new nuclear weapons. It also outlines transforming the U.S. role in NATO, reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe and requiring allies to provide ""the great majority of the conventional forces to deter Russia"" while relying on the U.S. to provide a nuclear weapons deterrent. The U.S. should ""expand and modernize the U.S. nuclear force so that it has the size, sophistication, and tailoring to deter Russia and China simultaneously,"" the proposal says. In an analysis of the proposal, the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said that it ""would accelerate the nuclear arms race the United States is already engaged in and encourage the expansion — or initiation — of new nuclear weapons programs in other nations around the globe."" The proposal calls for ending government funding for NPR, PBS and other public broadcasters and ending their status as noncommercial education stations, which exempts them from licensing fees and allows radio stations to broadcast at certain reserved frequencies that can be heard farther away. It notes, however, that this may not be easy. ""The President may have to use the bully pulpit, as NPR and PBS have teams of lobbyists who have convinced enough Members of Congress to save their bacon every time their taxpayer subsidies have been at risk since the Nixon era,"" it says. The proposal calls for dramatically simplifying the tax code in ways that would hurt lower-income earners and benefit people with higher incomes. Currently, the U.S. has seven federal income tax brackets, with rates from 10% for taxable income up to $11,000 to 37% on income higher than $578,125 in the 2023 tax year. As an intermediate step, Project 2025 calls for reducing that to two brackets of 15% and 30%; ending ""most deductions, credits and exclusions""; and setting a cap on untaxed employee benefits. In the long term, it calls for ""fundamental tax reform"" that could include implementing a national sales tax or requiring a supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. It also calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate from its current 21% rate to 18% and repealing various changes to the tax code in the Inflation Reduction Act. That bill, signed into law by Biden in 2022, included a corporate alternative minimum tax, a tax on stock buybacks and tax breaks for clean energy. An analysis of Project 2025 in Tax Notes found that these plans would depend on whether Democrats control the House or the Senate, allowing them to block legislation. But under unified Republican control, ""Trump would likely obtain passage of a great deal of his tax and spending proposals using a single budget reconciliation bill, which, instead of needing 60 votes to block a filibuster, would need only a simple majority,"" it noted."
J. Edgar Hoover should validate our fears about SCOTUS’s immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 2:49 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-immunity-fbi-rcna160514,"There’s been much talk about the gravity and impact of this month’s Supreme Court finding granting a former U.S. president presumptive immunity for “official” acts, and absolute immunity when exercising “core constitutional powers.” In the oral arguments preceding this decision, and in the dissenting opinion of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the justices raised the scenario of a president getting away with ordering Navy SEALS to kill a political opponent, using the military to stage a coup or accepting a bribe in exchange for a pardon. Chief Justice John Roberts called his colleagues’ remonstrations “extreme hypotheticals” and” fearmongering.” There was nothing extreme in Sotomayor’s concerns, and her fears were justified. As a national security analyst, with 25 years as an FBI agent, I know we don’t need to engage in hypotheticals to lay out this ruling’s likely consequences. All we need to understand what a criminally immune Trump might do, with even one executive branch agency given carte blanche, is to remind ourselves what the nation learned about the FBI during the 1970s. The great unraveling started in 1971, when a group of peace activists broke into a small FBI office in Media, Pa., and stole whatever files they could carry out. They suspected that the FBI was spying on anti-Vietnam war protestors, especially on college campuses. The files confirmed their suspicions, but unsure of what exactly they were looking at, they handed some of the files to reporters. One journalist, then-NBC reporter Carl Stern, was intrigued by a code word in the files: “COINTELPRO.” It would take years of dogged reporting, lawsuits to uncover documents and a number of congressional committee inquiries to fully learn the details of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s secret counterintelligence program to covertly address anything and anyone deemed to be a threat by Hoover or the presidents he served under. For over a year, a special Senate committee chaired by Idaho Democrat Frank Church conducted 800 interviews, demanded documents and held public and closed-door hearings. What they learned shocked the nation. The Church Committee and other investigations confirmed that the FBI, the CIA and the NSA had been unlawfully spying on American citizens. The FBI, with the approval of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and later with the encouragement of President Lyndon Johnson, illegally wiretapped Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders. The FBI sent a letter to King, using details uncovered in the wiretap, essentially blackmailing King and suggesting he kill himself. There were countless other “black bag jobs” where the FBI, without court authorization, broke into people’s homes, took evidence, opened and read mail, and planted microphones — all outside the law, because someone in power deemed those American citizens to pose some kind of threat. In 1968 and into the 1970s, Hoover claimed the Black Panther Party was “the greatest threat to internal security of the United States.” (It wasn’t.) Hoover discussed the Black Panthers with then-President Richard Nixon and got the green light to go after them, when, as Nixon directed, “you sort of had the scent of the smell of a national conspiracy thing. You know, the kind of thing like the Panthers, and all that … ”  The FBI developed an informant to penetrate the Panthers’ Illinois chapter. In the evening of Dec. 3, 1969, the informant drugged Fred Hampton, one of the chapter’s rising leaders. Chicago police officers, coordinating with the bureau, raided Hampton’s apartment and fatally shot him as he slept. Unsurprisingly, these sorts of actions did not stop at the Panthers. Nixon ordered the FBI to unlawfully wiretap members of the media without benefit of lawful court orders, simply because Nixon didn’t like those reporters. And, during the Watergate scandal, he ordered the CIA to tell the FBI to end their investigation into the illegal break-in directed by Nixon’s campaign. Remember, it was Nixon who infamously said during an interview, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” Nixon’s assertion was wrong back in the 1970s. Yet, with this month’s court ruling on absolute immunity, an American president can make that declaration with a straight face. If a president is acting within his Constitutional powers, they can tell the FBI to do almost anything to suppress any “threat” — real or imagined, political or not. According to a Reuters report, Trump’s allies are already planning to give their candidate direct control of DOJ and the FBI so that they will no longer function independent of the White House. “Two prominent Trump allies told Reuters they support eliminating the FBI’s general counsel” — the office that flashes a red light whenever the bureau is about to do something unlawful. If that red light is removed, there'd be nothing standing between a president and a crime spree. The Church Committee’s findings resulted in numerous regulations and policies that established guardrails to prevent the FBI and other intelligence agencies from unlawfully spying on Americans. The committee also established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to ensure that federal judges approve all national security wiretaps and covert search warrants. Today, a president could tell the FBI to ignore the formalities of the FISA court and simply spy on his enemies — without fear of criminal liability. Do Sotomayor’s hypotheticals seem “extreme” now? They shouldn’t, because we’ve already “been there, done that” as a nation. If none of this troubles you, you’re not paying attention. Because some day, a president you don’t support can designate you, your friends, your employer or your favorite organization or news platform a threat. That president could direct the FBI to spy on those entities and people, and you won’t know about it until it’s too late. It’s happened before, and it can happen again."
Why Trump doesn’t want you to know he knows about Project 2025,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 2:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-project-2025-truth-social-rcna160774,"There’s no sugarcoating it: The last few weeks have been bad for Democrats. And yet, former President Donald Trump and Republicans still appear to be panicking. The problem isn't President Joe Biden, who continues to combat internal pressure to step aside. Instead, the Republican Party, including apparently Trump himself, seems suddenly worried about growing mainstream awareness of Project 2025, a set of far-right policy initiatives developed by the Heritage Foundation and a slew of Trump-supporting thinkers and organizations. Last week Trump took to Truth Social to deny any knowledge of the project. “I know nothing about Project 2025,"" the former president wrote. ""I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.” You may have heard the expression, “A hit dog will holler”? Even for Trump, someone who lies easily and without remorse, the suggestion that he has “no idea who is behind” Project 2025 is laughably false. The truth is Project 2025 was enabled by a raft of former Trump administration officials, including Paul Dans, former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management; John McEntee, former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office; Rick Dearborn, former White House deputy chief of staff for legislative, intergovernmental affairs and implementation; Ben Carson, former Housing and Urban Development secretary; Ken Cuccinelli, former deputy secretary of homeland security; Peter Navarro, former director of the White House National Trade Council and director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy; Christopher Miller, former acting secretary of defense; Stephen Moore, an adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign; Russell Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget; William Pendley, former acting director of the Bureau of Land Management; Paul Winfree, former director of budget policy; Brooks Tucker, former chief of staff for the Department of Veterans Affairs; Roger Severino, former director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services; Kiron Skinner, former director of policy planning at the State Department; and Bernard McNamee, former commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  In fact, Project 2025 is staffed by more than 200 former officials of the Trump administration. Is it really possible that Trump is unfamiliar with the massive conservative project worked on by hundreds of his own former officials? Or is the toxicity of this agenda just that evident?  Common sense and Occam’s razor would suggest it’s the latter. And it does make a lot of sense that Trump would want to try to distance himself from the project, because it is legitimately extreme. The project’s main “playbook,” called “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,” is itself is over 900 pages. In a nutshell, the playbook calls for nullifying anti-climate-change efforts while supercharging its deadly effects, abolishing the Education Department and dramatically cutting back on free school meals and the Head Start program, cutting earned benefits like Medicaid, expanding the deportation powers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, banning pornography and imposing criminal penalties for those who produce it, strictly limiting abortion and rolling back pro-choice policies, blocking federal health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to trans people and consolidating presidential power significantly.  The fact that Trump is attempting to distance himself from this agenda is a testament to how obviously out of step it is with mainstream America. It’s not that he doesn’t agree with it; he just rightly recognizes that the vast majority of voters don’t. The bigger point here is that nothing Trump says about Project 2025 going forward has any credibility. And that’s important context for when Trump inevitably claims he would never try to implement any part of it. I’d be slightly more likely to believe he doesn’t remember who Ben Carson is."

"It’s over, insurgent Democrats. Biden’s not going anywhere.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 1:23 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-democrats-beat-trump-rcna160727,"President Joe Biden’s interview on “Morning Joe” today is exactly what everyone has been waiting and wanting to see from the president. What we saw this morning was quintessential Joe Biden; it was also just great politics. And his campaign should be doing more of it.  Democrats who want Biden to step aside have had over a week to get their act together and mount their insurgency. But now, that’s done. It’s over. I think the president ended it with that interview. I believe we’re going to look back at the debate, and all the chaos that followed, and see this interview as a market shift, the catalyst that the president’s campaign needed.  Biden can present himself as the scrappy insurgent, waging war on the elites who want him out of the race. There’s one person who will likely be very unhappy with that: Donald Trump. That’s the lane he’s always wanted — the “they’re ignoring you and I’m on your side” — and that’s the case Biden can now make to voters.Biden is going directly to the American people and saying he doesn’t need a filter, he doesn’t need any elite platforms, and he doesn’t need other elected officials because he is fighting for you. My only hope is that he doesn’t go totally silent for another extended six-day period. Or over plan for some news conference. Or go back up to Camp David and act like he’s prepping for the SATs or a McKinsey interview. Just let the guy be who he is. President Biden is the Democratic Party’s nominee. He’s not going to blink in this game of chicken. If any further Democrats come out against Biden, they are part of the problem, not the president. It’s time that everyone gets together, gets disciplined, and focuses on the actual problem: the existential threat to the future of this country, Donald Trump.  This is an adapted excerpt from the July 8 episode of Ana Cabrera Reports."
"On politicized prosecutions, Marco Rubio has a poor memory",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 11:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/prosecutions-marco-rubio-trump-biden-memory-rcna160742,"By all accounts, Sen. Marco Rubio is a finalist for his party’s vice presidential nomination, and with this in mind, the Florida Republican has been an eager participant in the GOP’s “race to the bottom.” It was against this backdrop that the senator sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash, who asked about the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. In a move that likely pleased viewers at Mar-a-Lago, Rubio largely ignored the question and toed a partisan line. From the “State of the Union” transcript: The Republican senator added moments later that Trump, in a second term, wouldn’t target his perceived political foes. “His vengeance is going to be by winning and making America great again, not going after his political opponents,” Rubio said. So, a few things. First, if the senator or his allies have any evidence of White House officials “going after their political opponents,” Republicans have kept the proof well hidden. Second, the idea that Trump has no interest in vengeful, retaliatory tactics is belied by Trump repeatedly expressing explicit interest in vengeful, retaliatory tactics. Indeed, the question of whether or not the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would try to prosecute his perceived political enemies in a second term has already been answered by the former president himself many times: As regular readers know, Trump has publicly acknowledged his intentions in multiple interviews. Perhaps Rubio missed them. But of particular interest in the CNN interview was Rubio’s suggestion that Democratic fears of abuses are absurd. Look at that quote again: “It’s funny to me to read these people and hear these people out there warning about all the horrible things they ridiculously claim Donald Trump is going to do if he becomes president again.” The trouble is, Rubio doesn’t seem to recall Trump’s actual presidency. The former president’s critics aren’t just raising concerns about his future plans, they’re making accusations based on Trump’s unambiguous record. As we’ve discussed, the former president spent much of his White House tenure trying to transform Justice Department prosecutors into his own personal attack dogs. The New York Times reported in 2022 that Trump and his team “tried to turn the nation’s law enforcement apparatus into an instrument of political power” to carry out the Republican’s wishes. A Washington Post analysis published soon after highlighted the many instances in which Trump not only leaned on the Justice Department to follow his whims, but also his efforts to push federal law enforcement to validate the “big lie” in the wake of his election defeat. The Republican’s weaponization efforts reached a truly amazing pinnacle less than a month before Election Day 2020, when Trump publicly called on federal prosecutors to go after Joe Biden — at the time, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee who was leading the Republican incumbent in the polls — and accused him of undefined crimes. The then-president added that his future successor shouldn’t be “allowed” to run against him. On Oct. 7, 2020, with early voting underway across much of the country, Politico published an especially memorable headline: “‘Where are all of the arrests?’: Trump demands Barr lock up his foes.” The next day, the Republican incumbent spoke with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo and called on the Justice Department to “indict” his perceived Democratic foes — including Biden. After Trump’s 2020 defeat, his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said the former president “regularly” wanted to use the Justice Department to retaliate against critics. To date, Rubio never expressed a word of criticism about any of this, and now the senator appears to have forgotten recent history altogether. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Right or wrong, Biden is the candidate Republicans want to face",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 9:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-election-candidate-republicans-want-face-2024-rcna160720,"In mid-January 2008, it was an open question as to who would win the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Republicans, however, had a preference. Writing at the time for National Review, Byron York reported on a Barack Obama campaign rally he attended in South Carolina with a Republican friend. Watching the candidate, seeing the crowd, and hearing the message, York’s Republican friend said at the time, “Oh, s--t.” The report added that some Republicans were hoping that Hillary Clinton would ultimately prevail because “running against the man on stage at the convention center would be a hard, hard campaign.” In other words, in 2008, Republicans took a long look at Obama and saw him as a formidable opponent. They were, for lack of a better word, scared that they just wouldn’t be able to defeat the Illinois Democrat — and those fears were proved true months later when Obama dispatched a popular and respected war hero with relative ease. Sixteen years later, it’s probably fair to say that Republicans aren’t scared at all of President Joe Biden. On the contrary, it appears their greatest fear is that the Democratic incumbent might be convinced to abandon his re-election plans. The Washington Post reported: They have plenty of company. Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump insisted last week that if Democrats were to choose a new nominee, it would be an affront to the democratic process. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina argued soon after that Biden’s refusal to withdraw is “very good news” not just for Trump, but also for “the entire down-ballot Republican team.” In case that weren’t quite enough, the far-right Heritage Foundation has indicated that it’s eyeing steps that would make it “extraordinarily difficult” for Democrats to replace Biden on the general election ballot. There’s no great mystery here. The political dynamic is not subtle. In the wake of the presidential debate 11 days ago, Republicans and their allies have come to believe that Biden would be easier to beat in November than the other possible Democratic contenders. It’s at this point when the incumbent president’s allies are likely saying, “Yeah, but Republicans might very well be wrong.” The benefit of this response is that it’s true. Not only does Trump have terrible political instincts, but the GOP has been wrong about questions like these plenty of times before. In fact, it’s not especially unusual for partisan players and operatives — folks with extensive experience in professional politics — to embrace all kinds of false assumptions. In October 2016, a striking number of Republicans concluded that there was simply no way Americans would elect Trump to the presidency after the “Access Hollywood” recording reached the public. Those conclusions were mistaken, and Trump won soon after. It’s entirely possible that many of these same GOP officials, certain that Biden is simply unelectable, are wrong again. But as Democrats weigh their options, the fact that Republicans appear even more excited about Biden’s candidacy than many in the president’s own party seems like a relevant detail."

"Despite reality, Trump tries to distance himself from Project 2025",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 8:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-election-project-2025-rcna160703,"In recent weeks, President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign and its allies set out to inform the public about Project 2025 — a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by The Heritage Foundation, with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. The Democratic incumbent’s campaign website created a page dedicated specifically to the governing blueprint and promoted it via social media in the hopes of getting the word out. The push caught on. Not only has it become more common to see “Google Project 2025” messages online, but as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones recently noted, the right-wing plan also became “the talk of the Black Entertainment Television Awards” after host Taraji P. Henson “made multiple references to it.” By Friday, it reached the point that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee decided to issue a brief statement about it by way of his social media platform: There are, of course, a few glaring problems with Trump’s pushback. The first is the flawed logic: On the one hand, the former president would have the public believe he doesn’t know anything about Project 2025. On the other hand, Trump believes some of the provisions in the right-wing document are “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” — suggesting he does know at least something about it. The second problem is that it’s impossible to take seriously. Popular Information’s Judd Legum published a detailed takedown on this, highlighting the lengthy list of people from Trump’s own team who co-authored the Project 2025 document. “I literally don’t have enough time to list every connection between Donald Trump and Project 2025,” MSNBC’s Ali Velshi told viewers over the weekend. “But I can absolutely confidently say that Donald Trump’s claim that he ‘knows nothing about Project 2025’ and has ‘no idea who is behind it’ is, how do we say it in Canada? Complete and utter BS.” But I’m also struck by the larger context: Trump wouldn’t have bothered to publish a denial unless he was concerned that Democrats’ focus on Project 2025 was gaining traction. In other words, the efforts to make Project 2025 a real campaign issue are having the intended effect, and it’s making the former president nervous."
"Biden pushes defiant message in letter to Dems, MSNBC appearance",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 7:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-pushes-defiant-message-letter-democrats-msnbc-appearance-rcna160688,"In the seven days following his awful debate performance, President Joe Biden adopted a low-key approach. He held no press conferences. He sat down for no major on-air interviews. He was slow to call his congressional allies. The incumbent Democrat appeared to be operating under a dubious assumption: The uproar would fade, the public conversation would shift, and the race would return to “normal.” If that was Biden’s assumption, it was a mistake: The number of Democratic lawmakers, officials and donors urging the president to withdraw from the race grew considerably as the incumbent waited for the story to blow over. And so, he’s clearly adopted a new posture. NBC News reported: “I’m getting so frustrated by the elites in the party. ... They know so much more,” Biden said, mockingly. “If any of these guys don’t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce for president — challenge me at the convention!” The incumbent added that he believes “average” Democratic voters want him to stay in the race — a conclusion he arrived at after some events in recent days with supporters. On the one hand, it was a clear message delivered in a high-energy way. On the other hand, it seemed far from ideal to see Biden chastising members of his own party, while complaining about Democratic “elites” — a label the experienced president was apparently applying to his longtime friends and governing partners. What’s more, it’s worth noting for context that recent polling suggests it’s not just folks attending cocktail parties in Georgetown who believe Biden should stand down. The call-in appearance on MSNBC dovetailed with a two-page letter sent to congressional Democrats in which Biden argued, among other things, that he won the party’s nominating contests. “We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively,” Biden wrote, referring to his primary and caucus victories. “The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,” he added. “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now,” the president’s letter went on to say. “And it’s time for it to end. ... Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task head only helps Trump and hurts us.” Biden’s strategy, in other words, is rooted in defiance. He’s not addressing the concerns of his intraparty critics, so much as he’s telling them that the conversation they’ve created is irrelevant: If the president isn’t going to end his candidacy, the argument goes, Democrats waiting for him to pass the torch shouldn’t waste everyone’s time with a pointless effort. This might work, but in my experience, members of Congress don’t like to effectively be told, “Shut up and stop talking about what you want to talk about.” As for the argument that Biden earned the nomination by way of his party’s nominating process, that’s true. Aside from American Samoa, the president cruised to lopsided victories in every Democratic primary and caucus. But I’m reminded of the 1980 election. In case anyone needs a refresher, in 1980, then-Sen. Ted Kennedy challenged then-President Jimmy Carter in a Democratic primary. As the process was just getting under way, the Iran hostage crisis broke, and Carter’s public support initially surged. The incumbent cruised to easy victories in nearly all of the early primaries and caucuses, mostly by wide margins. But as the nominating fight continued, and developments in Iran dragged on, public support for Carter’s handling of the crisis deteriorated. By the time the June primaries came along, Kennedy was in a vastly stronger position, and as the nominating process wrapped up, he closed out the calendar with several key wins, including a big victory in California. As the convention drew closer, Kennedy went to party officials with a compelling message rooted in fact: Democratic voters who backed Carter in January’s and February’s contests couldn’t have known what conditions would be like in June and July. It’s not that those contests didn’t count, so much as it was incumbent on the party to recognize the facts that weren’t available to primary and caucus voters months earlier. If Democrats had it to do over again, Kennedy argued, knowing what the crisis in Iran would do to the president’s national support, the results would have been much different. And while Kennedy was probably correct, his pitch didn’t work. Party officials stuck to the rules: Carter had earned a clear majority of the delegates, and so he would be the Democratic nominee. The incumbent soon after lost in a landslide, winning only 49 electoral votes. Biden’s absolutely right that he received the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination. But if the Democratic electorate had it to do over again, would they make a different choice?"
Hurricane Beryl's 'Armageddon-like' destruction also comes with scary timing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 4:55 PM PDT / Updated July 8, 2024, 7:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-beryl-jamaica-record-breaking-rcna160053,"UPDATE (July 8, 10:32 a.m. ET) Hurricane Beryl made landfall near the coastal town of Matagorda, Texas, about 85 miles south-southwest of Houston on the Gulf coast Monday morning. Sustained winds were 80 mph and the National Hurricane called the high winds and potential floods a life-threatening situation. Given the extreme weather we’re seeing across the country — flooding rains in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota, excessive heat warnings on the West Coast and in the south-central U.S. — the approach of a destructive Hurricane Beryl this early in the hurricane season doesn’t exactly come as a surprise. After all, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast the highest number of storms ever for the 2024 hurricane season: 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes. Still, Beryl, which had already killed at least seven people in the Caribbean as it approached Jamaica as a Category 4 storm Wednesday, is shocking for the records it has broken. Let's start with the fact that it became a hurricane on at 5 p.m. Saturday 720 miles east-southeast of Barbados, making it, according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher, the farthest east a hurricane has developed in the Atlantic in June. At 11:35 a.m. Sunday, when its winds hit 130 mph, Beryl made history as the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record. Then it became the earliest Category 5 and the strongest July hurricane we’ve ever seen. In Grenada, where at least three people were killed and many homes were destroyed, the prime minister called Beryl’s impact “Armageddon-like.” Though it had weakened somewhat as it approached Jamaica on Wednesday, on Tuesday it had maximum winds of 165 mph for at least six hours, beating the 160 mph record Emily set July 17, 2005. As a meteorologist who worked for 45 years in New Orleans, I certainly can’t forget hurricane season 2005. That’s the year hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit Louisiana, Hurricane Wilma hit the Florida Peninsula, and, for the first time, we had so many named storms that we exceeded the list of that year’s names and had to use six Greek letters to label the storms. That was the most active storm season we’d ever seen — until 2020, when we needed nine Greek letters. The storms that hit us are getting stronger, most likely because of warmer ocean temperatures. Look at Ida, Laura, Michael and Harvey as examples. In addition to that, they are developing rapidly. They can go from tropical depressions to major hurricanes inside three days. Hurricane Michael was a tropical depression on Oct. 7, 2018, and on Oct. 10 it made landfall at Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph. People who weren't paying attention to the changing forecast were caught off-guard. That’s why meteorologists always tell you to check on the forecast at least daily, because forecasts change quickly. That storms are rapidly intensifying before they make landfall is scary enough, but they’re also taking longer to diminish in intensity after they make landfall and causing major impacts well inland. Look at Hurricane Ida, which made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on Aug. 29, 2021, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. That’s scary enough. But Ida made landfall with winds of 150 mph. The previous year Hurricane Laura made landfall near Lake Charles, Louisiana, with 150 mph winds. Before then, you would have had to go back to 1856 to the Last Island Hurricane to find a storm with winds of 150 mph. Major hurricanes are happening more often now. They are also decreasing in intensity after landfall at a slower rate. Ida was still a Category 4 storm inland by Houma, and it was even at Category 2 on the opposite side of Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. Hurricane Laura, which landed in 2020 as a Category 4 storm at Cameron, Louisiana, maintained hurricane strength almost as far north as Shreveport and entered Arkansas as a tropical storm. I suggest that when people see a National Hurricane Center forecast, they plan as if a storm one category higher in strength will actually hit. That guidance is especially important for people along our Gulf Coast to keep in mind. Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said in a statement, “While Texans take time to enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends, it’s important to stay weather aware, pay close attention to the rapidly-changing forecasts, and don’t be caught without an emergency plan.” NOAA predicted such an awful 2024 hurricane season because all the ingredients are there or are expected to be there: Hot sea surface temperatures. An Active West African monsoon. No El Niño and La Niña, which we associate with an absence of wind shear that might tear tropical systems apart, forecast to develop during the August-October peak of hurricane season. What we’ve seen from Beryl supports that forecast. Klotzbach says that when early-season storm activity occurs in the tropics east of longitude 75 west, it tends to be a harbinger of a very busy season. Why is Beryl in particular so bad? Water temperatures are “crunk.” That’s another word for extreme. In this case, the water is hotter than it has ever been at this time of the year. In fact, these are the water temperatures we normally see in September. Water temperatures are running about 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius above normal, and warm water is the fuel for tropical development. Beryl encountered the perfect environment: warm water, moisture through the atmosphere and little wind shear. Beryl was also small with a small, well-organized inner core. Small storms can intensify faster and take advantage of those conditions. In short, Beryl was the perfect storm. And it has been almost mesmerizing to me, as a meteorologist, at least, to watch the satellite loop of Beryl intensifying over the west Atlantic into the Caribbean. That having been said, Beryl will have major impacts on Jamaica. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a video statement Tuesday, “If you live in a low-lying area, an area that is historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river ... I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground.” This is where we are one month into hurricane season. So far, we have had tropical storms Alberto and Chris and Beryl and a major hurricane, Beryl. And what’s scary is that we aren’t even in the active part of the season yet. I’ve known a lot of hurricanes: Betsy, Camille, Charley, Ivan, Katrina, Ike, Laura, Delta, Zeta, Ida and all the ones in between. I’ve seen relatively inactive seasons that had major hurricanes — like Andrew in 1992. I’ve seen active hurricane seasons that had no impacts on my area, as was the case last year. Active seasons don't tell us where a hurricane will hit. Active seasons mean that statistically there is a greater chance of impact. But with my experience, when I see early major development as with Beryl this year, I get concerned.  "
"Comer, GOP colleagues breathe new life into anti-Biden crusade",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 6:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/james-comer-gop-republicans-biden-election-2024-rcna160668,"The House Republicans’ impeachment crusade against President Joe Biden isn’t technically over — the GOP lawmakers behind the gambit haven’t officially pulled the plug — but it’s no secret that the entire effort was an embarrassing failure for the Democrat’s opponents. Indeed, the whole endeavor made Republicans look far worse than their intended target. As recently as a couple of months ago, among GOP officials on Capitol Hill, there was a grudging realization: Biden may or may not be brought down in 2024, but either way, the hapless Republican investigations were a pointless distraction that have had no meaningful impact on the election cycle. GOP crusaders were left to lick their wounds and fight amongst themselves over why they failed — right up until the first presidential debate 11 days ago, at which point congressional Republicans breathed new life into their campaign against Biden. NBC News reported overnight: I’m skeptical this will amount to much — the president’s physician appears to be little more than a new toy for GOP lawmakers to play with after they broke their earlier playthings — but what’s notable about Comer’s letter is the degree to which it’s part of a larger flurry of activity. 25th Amendment: After the debate, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the White House cabinet should explore invoking the 25th Amendment and ending Biden’s presidency. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina made related comments, and Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas went so far as to introduce a formal House resolution on the matter. More impeachment: In addition to his 25th Amendment resolution, Roy last week raised the prospect of impeaching Vice President Kamala Harris for, as the Texan argued, covering for Biden. Select committee: Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida told Fox News last week that there should “absolutely” be a congressional investigation into the president’s health, and soon after, Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana also told Fox News that he’s “all for“ the creation of a new House select committee that would focus entirely on Biden’s fitness for office. The point, of course, is not that these endeavors are serious. They are not. But after the impeachment effort flopped, GOP members were looking for something new to do in the hopes of undermining the Democratic ticket, and the presidential debate apparently got the party’s creative juices flowing. What’s more, this list is likely to grow in unpredictable ways as members return to Capitol Hill today following a two-week break. Watch this space."
"Ahead of elections, job growth continues to exceed expectations",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elections-jobs-economy-trump-biden-2024-rcna160662,"Expectations heading into Friday morning’s unemployment data showed projections of about 190,000 new jobs having been added in the United States in June. As it turns out, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job market managed to do a bit better than that. NBC News reported: In addition to the encouraging top-line data, we also learned that wage growth continued to outpace inflation. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, inched a little higher in the new report, climbing to 4.1% from 4%, which obviously isn’t ideal, though the figure is still incredibly low in historical terms. Nevertheless, what matters most about the latest report is the overall job creation totals. I’m mindful of polls showing a discouraged public, but over 1.3 million jobs have been created so far this year, and if this pace keeps up, the United States will see roughly 2.7 million new jobs this year, which is excellent. As for the politics, let’s circle back to previous coverage to put the data in perspective. Over the course of the first three years of Donald Trump’s presidency — when the Republican said the U.S. economy was the greatest in the history of the planet — the economy created roughly 6.38 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018 and 2019. According to the latest tally, the U.S. economy has created over 16 million jobs since January 2021 — more than double the combined total of Trump’s first three years. In recent months, Republicans have responded to developments like these by pretending not to notice them. Not surprisingly, GOP officials kept the trend going late last week. For some additional context, consider job growth by year over the past decade, updated to reflect the latest data revisions: 2013: 2.3 million 2014: 3 million 2015: 2.7 million 2016: 2.3 million 2017: 2.1 million 2018: 2.3 million 2019: 1.98 million 2020: -9.3 million 2021: 7.2 million 2022: 4.5 million 2023: 3 million Six months into 2024: 1.33 million This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Biden’s post-debate strategy falters, more Dems call for a change",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bidens-post-debate-strategy-democrats-election-2024-rcna160659,"In the aftermath of his troubled debate performance a week and a half ago, it stood to reason that President Joe Biden and his team would turn to the Crisis Management 101 playbook. It was widely assumed that the Democratic incumbent would quickly arrange a press conference or two, blanket the airwaves, and engage in furious outreach to members of Congress and major donors. For the most part, that’s not what happened — at least not in the first week after the debate. Much of the pushback strategy focused on an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, which aired eight days after the debate, and which did little to silence those who are eager to see the president pass the torch. As a Politico report summarized as the holiday weekend got underway, “For years, Joe Biden’s team has responded to a storm of bad news with a tried and true approach: hunker down, ignore the chattering class and weather the storm.” And while this approach has been effective in the past, the report added, “[A]mid the wreckage of his disastrous debate performance — and the much bigger questions it raises about his health, his White House’s candor and his ability to effectively make the case against Donald Trump — that approach just isn’t cutting it this time.” To be sure, the president appears keenly aware of the larger conversation, and he’s taken steps to try to shut it down. Indeed, Biden has declared categorically that he would not, barring divine intervention, withdraw from the 2024 race. The message to his intraparty critics seemed obvious: There’s no point in speculating further, he effectively declared, because he would remain atop the Democratic ticket. That message is not having its intended effect. NBC News reported overnight that four additional congressional Democrats told their colleagues during a Sunday phone meeting that they believe Biden should step aside. They join an existing group of Democrats who’d already made similar public declarations. Stepping back, Team Biden is clearly facing a multifaceted problem: Withdrawal calls: The number of congressional Democrats who want Biden to end his re-election campaign is growing steadily, and as members return to Capitol Hill for the first time in two weeks, it’s very likely that the list is poised to grow longer in the coming days. Other vocal critics: Plenty of other prominent Democratic voices have come close to calling for his withdrawal, and have done so in ways that add to the pressure on the president. See, for example, Rep. Adam Schiff’s comments on “Meet the Press” yesterday. Commentators: Biden might not care about the “chattering class,” but when leading voices such as The Washington Post’s E.J. Dionne, among many others, call on the president to stand down, it affects the public conversation in ways that make matters worse for the incumbent. Donors: Presidential campaigns are extraordinarily expensive, and as Biden’s fundraising advantage over Trump vanishes, some leading Democratic donors are ready to close their wallets unless Biden is replaced atop the ticket. A pre-convention “blitz”? Last week, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime Biden ally, raised the prospect of a “mini-primary” process for other would-be Democratic nominees — a Semafor report referred to it as a “blitz primary“ — and the idea has received support from some donors and observers, as evidenced by Ezra Klein’s latest New York Times column. I haven’t the foggiest idea how such a process would work, but the conversation is itself emblematic of Biden’s larger problem. We’ll know soon enough what the president and his party decide to do next, but the status quo — every day, the pressure gets a little worse as more Democrats urge Biden to call it a day — appears untenable. Watch this space."
‘Some folks need killing’: North Carolina Lt. Gov takes Christian nationalism to dangerous low,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mark-robinson-north-carolina-killing-trump-rcna160433,"On the Sunday before the Fourth of July, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, stood on a church pulpit and called for the extrajudicial killing of people he considered to be enemies of Christian America. Republicans’ continued support for and promotion of Robinson’s candidacy show how the GOP and the religious right have mainstreamed calls for violence in the name of Christian nationalism. The address — first reported by The New Republic’s Greg Sargent — was part of “God and Country Sunday” at Lake Church in White Lake, North Carolina. “We now find ourselves struggling with people who have evil intent,” Robinson declared, adding that “some folks need killing. … It’s a matter of necessity!” He compared these supposed enemies on the American left to Nazis in World War II: “We didn’t argue and capitulate and talk about, ‘Well, maybe we shouldn’t fight the Nazis that hard.’ No, they’re bad. Kill them.” And the state’s would-be governor had no qualms about marshaling state power: “Time to call out, uh, those guys in green and go have them handle it. Or those boys in blue and have them go handle it.” The exact identity of the “folks” who deserved death was unclear. There are “wicked people doing wicked things, torturing and murdering and raping,” Robinson said. But he clearly had in mind a far broader spectrum of leftist foes, warning about those “making 1776 a distant memory” and those advancing “the tenets of socialism and communism.” Cameron McGill, the church’s pastor, defended Robinson. “Without a doubt, those he deemed worthy of death [were] those seeking to kill us,” McGill told The New Republic, claiming that Robinson “certainly did not imply the taking of any innocent lives.” The pastor, in other words, gave Robinson his permission to deem some fellow citizens “worthy of death” based only on conspiratorial lies that such people want to kill Christians. Robinson, an unabashed Christian nationalist, has a long history of extremist and bigoted positions, promoting conspiracy theories, and making racist, antisemitic, homophobic and transphobic attacks on fellow Americans. He launched his political career by attacking gun control and ridiculing survivors of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He has expressed support for the 1970 National Guard shooting of anti-Vietnam War protesters at Kent State University, denied the Holocaust and called for trans women to be arrested for using women’s restrooms. Robinson’s supporters on the Christian right treat his vicious, bigoted attacks as evidence of his heroic stands against “woke” enemies of Christian America. The church introduced Robinson, who was fresh off an appearance at the Road to Majority conference hosted by the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Washington, D.C., with a clip of his appearance at this high-profile event for Republican heavyweights, including former President Donald Trump. In the segment, Robinson attacked the media as anti-American, saying, “I don’t care about your plans and your schemes to bring this nation down, with your Democratic friends. Why? Because Jesus Christ is still on the throne!” In a friendly interview between McGill and Robinson before the candidate gave his speech, the pair reiterated Christian nationalist dogma that the founders intended America to be a Christian nation, and that the separation of church and state was intended to protect the church from government interference, but not to stop the church from influencing government. “You cannot tell me we can separate our government from the laws of God, from the Bible,” said Robinson. “Our Constitution is based on the word of God, I don’t care what anybody says.” At one point in the interview, McGill told Robinson that he has an “anointing.” With that endorsement, Robinson took to the pulpit for his speech. This is far from the first time Robinson has used the violent language of warfare to pit MAGA Republicans like himself against others. In 2021, he said in a speech that he was born “to be one of God’s freedom fighters” in order to “literally make war on the devil.” He warned he wanted to make “the literal foundations of hell tremble, and I want this nation to join with me in doing it.” That same year, Robinson said in another speech that Christians and conservatives must “get as bold and unafraid and warlike in spreading the truth in this nation as these people have been in spreading the lies that are currently destroying it.” But in those instances, Robinson stopped short of endorsing murder. Explicitly advocating for supposed “enemies” of Christian America to be killed — on a church pulpit, no less — is a clear and dangerous escalation of Christian nationalist support for “spiritual warfare” against “demonic” enemies. Many promoters of “spiritual warfare” have long insisted, citing Ephesians 6:12, that they are not talking about actual war with “flesh and blood,” but rather a battle against “principalities and powers” that takes place solely in the realm of spirituality and prayer. Yet Robinson’s newly explicit calls for killing perceived enemies show just how seamlessly Christian nationalist extremists can glide into promoting real violence. Trump wanted to shoot racial justice protesters in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd in 2020. Robinson, who could be North Carolina’s next governor, wants to get “the guys in green” or the “boys in blue” to “handle” unspecified “wicked people.” It’s all part of the MAGA quest to upend democracy and replace it with far-right authoritarianism. Robinson is merely taking the lead on turning this project into a twisted Sunday school lesson for Christian nationalists."
The Roberts Court has checkmated the other branches,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-john-roberts-chevron-immunity-rcna160448,"Chief Justice John Roberts likes to present himself as an institutionalist, concerned with upholding the legacy of the Supreme Court. He has positioned himself as the voice of reason on a court that has swung steadily to the right since he was first confirmed to the role almost two decades ago. But this term, he authored a series of decisions that completely shattered the previous balance of power within the federal system. In opinions that on the surface show deference to Congress and the president, Roberts has managed to consolidate an unprecedented amount of power in the only branch of government that is entirely unelected. Roberts’ opinions in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Trump v. United States fundamentally reject one of the key premises of the constitutional order. If you’re an American reading this, you likely remember learning in school how the three branches of government — the legislative, executive and judiciary — operate through a separation of powers that distributes different parts of governing among them. A series of checks and balances prevents any one from assuming too much authority over the others. In the first case, Loper Bright, Roberts has pantomimed a defense of the former principle while completely ignoring the latter. Previously, under the Chevron v. NRDC decision from 1982, courts were instructed to defer to executive branch agencies’ “reasonable interpretation” of imprecise or ambiguous statutes. This precedent was crucial, given the difficulties of drafting perfectly precise statutes, the broad sweep of many laws on the books, and the amount of power Congress has delegated to these agencies to figure out the details. In overturning Chevron, Roberts stripped that deference from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Trade Commission, curtailing their ability to issue regulations and increasing the odds of those standards being challenged in lawsuits. Roberts claimed the court was returning authority from agency bureaucrats back to the elected members of Congress who write the laws. (Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch went further in their concurring opinions, explicitly claiming that Chevron was a violation of the separation of powers that was now being rectified.) In practice, as MSNBC contributor Steve Vladeck pointed out, there is no realistic way for even the most productive Congress to pass clarifying legislation relating to every detail of every agency’s work. “The reality, then, is that the only transfer of power the Supreme Court accomplished by overruling Chevron is a transfer of power to the courts,” wrote Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “After all, it is now going to be up to judges to decide what each and every statute agencies enforce means.” In contrast, Roberts’ opinion in Trump v. United States at first seems to empower the executive branch with its declaration that “official acts” taken within the president’s “core constitutional functions” have absolute immunity from prosecution. But while the decision elevates the president and inoculates the office from accountability, Trump v. U.S. nevertheless siphons power away from the executive branch broadly toward the judiciary. In doing so, Roberts at times treats the presidency as utterly separate from the machinery that acts with the executive’s authority, producing a yawning gap between the office of the president and the rest of the executive branch’s functions. Bear in mind that federal prosecutors in the cases against Trump are doing so as the enforcement mechanism of the executive branch, acting through the president’s authority. This relationship is why it was absurd for Trump to attempt to cite executive privilege during the Department of Justice’s investigations, as it exists on the same side of the separation of powers as the White House. The immunity decision likewise stressed that the president has “exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials.” And yet that same ruling has bound those officers of the executive from enforcing federal laws at the highest level when the president is acting with the greatest amount of power at his disposal, and thus the greatest opportunities for criminality. Then there are the acts on the “outer perimeter” of the president’s role where “presumptive immunity” exists, meaning the standard of proof falls on the prosecution, not the defense, to overcome it. Notably, there is no indication in Roberts’ opinion that Congress could overturn this standard by passing laws that strictly delineate what counts as unlawful behavior from the president. I can only assume that Roberts would likely see this as another violation of the separation of powers if it were attempted. Instead, it is again only through the courts that this immunity can be rebuked and a prosecution allowed to proceed. We are left then with a Congress unable to act as a check on the Supreme Court due to self-imposed restrictions, both on its legislative role via the filibuster and hyperpartisanship, and as part of a similar unhealthy fetishization of the separation of powers that dissuades it from conducting oversight. On the other hand, we have a presidency where it is only the better angels of the officeholder’s nature that prevent tyranny from taking root. Roberts seems confident in the courts’ ability to hold off this fate, but to paraphrase a likely apocryphal quote, I would like to know how many army divisions the justices command. There is no reason that the courts should have accrued this much power, an imbalance completely antithetical to the role the founders envisioned the third branch playing. It is also ironically a more dangerous form of “lawmaking from the bench” that the conservative legal movement once accused liberals of pursuing. Through its decisions, the Roberts court has gone far beyond what the early adherents of that movement, with its backlash to the liberalism of the Warren court, could have plotted. It also feels fitting that this is the fate of a campaign that began as a call for judges to follow “originalism” and “textualism” in their decisions. Rather than merely being content to erase their predecessors’ gains, Roberts and his fellow conservatives have now rewritten the Constitution’s words to map out their own power-hungry ideology. In doing so, they have eliminated any check that the other branches might have over them, and deeply imperiled the country in the process."

Transcript: Spectacle,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 8, 2024, 2:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/transcript-spectacle-rcna160637,"Transcript Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra Episode 4: Spectacle  Elements of the American ultra right -- including the trailing ends of the America First movement -- begin taking up a strange new cause after the war... sympathy for Nazi war criminals. The surprising efforts to oppose the Nazi war crimes trials, and advocate for individual Nazis at home and abroad, will involve some of the most high-profile voices on the American right, and will jumpstart the career of one rising Republican star, Sen. Joseph McCarthy. (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rachel Maddow: The cartoon appeared on the front page, right in the middle, above the fold. Reporter: Already we are having sentences passed, passed on the defendants who were found guilty this morning. Maddow: It’s the day after the Nuremberg verdicts, in October 1946. The surviving leadership of the Nazi regime has been convicted of war crimes. Many of them sentenced to death. Judge: On account of the indictment on which you have been convicted, the tribunal sentences you to death by hanging. Maddow: The cartoon that appeared on the front page of the newspaper right after those verdicts showed a Nazi soldier standing on top of a makeshift pedestal. And on the pedestal, it says, quote, German martyr. Below that, it says, Nazi criminal convicted by a biased court composed of Germany’s enemies in an illegally conducted trial upon unlawful evidence illicitly procured. It’s the day after the Nuremberg verdicts, and on the front page of this newspaper, the convicted Nazis are martyrs. The publication that ran that cartoon on the front page that day, it was not a German newspaper. It was not some old Nazi paper somehow still being published over there. No, this was the Chicago Tribune. According to the front page of the Chicago Tribune right after the Nuremberg verdicts are announced, when the Nazi war criminals are convicted, among other things, for orchestrating the Holocaust, on the front page of the Tribune, those Nazis are the martyrs. And the real crime here is the fact that the allies put the Nazis on trial at all. The Chicago Tribune in the 1930s and 1940s was a goliath. It was one of the most widely read newspapers in the whole country. Every edition of the paper featured an American flag at the top, with the tagline, An American Paper for Americans. And the paper had an unmistakable editorial bent. Announcer: You have just heard Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune. Maddow: Robert R. McCormick had inherited this important newspaper from his grandfather and his father. He was an intimidating 6 foot 4. He was very, very, very sure of his own brilliance. His politics were sometimes described as Republican but it was probably closer to the mark to call them reactionary. One critic famously said that Robert McCormick had quote, the greatest mind of the 14th century. In the 1920s, McCormick’s Chicago Tribune editorials repeatedly praised Mussolini, saying quote, dictatorships frequently are constructive and we can use that sort of government here. When Rhode Island named what he considered to be too many Democrats as judges, McCormick ordered that one star, the star representing Rhode Island, should be physically ripped out of the American flag in the Chicago Tribune’s lobby. He only relented on that one after being told that mutilating the flag was a federal crime. Under Robert McCormick, the Chicago Tribune called an African American murder suspect a quote, “jungle beast” and pointed to the darkness of his skin tone to suggest, explicitly, that he might not be fully human. McCormick and his newspaper picked all kinds of fights. McCormick: The Senator asks if Al Capone was at one time on the Tribune’s payroll. Al Capone was never on the Tribune’s payroll. Maddow: As a business, the Chicago Tribune under Robert McCormick was repeatedly accused of gangster tactics against its competitors. Robert McCormick: I will say that the senator’s statements were without basis in fact. And in particular that Mr. Annenberg did not ever shoot or shoot at an officer or employee of a competing newspaper. Maddow: That was Robert McCormick. And by the 1940s, his big, pugnacious, controversial newspaper was the beating heart of the American right. McCormick: We have chosen to fight New Deal communism. Maddow: McCormick and his Chicago Tribune were vocal critics of FDR, of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They were vocal supporters of the America First Committee, which tried to stop America from joining the war against the Nazis. America First rally speaker: I only wish there were more Americans in the United States of America that loved America First. Maddow: Once the war had been fought and won by America and its allies, McCormick and his very profitable, very influential paper decided to take up a strange new hobbyhorse, a new cause, sympathy for Nazi war criminals. Anchor: History wrote a new page in responsibility for making war today as the war crimes trial of 20 former top Nazi and German military leaders opened at Nuremberg. Maddow: The Chicago Tribune argued vociferously, repeatedly against prosecuting the Nazis. One Easter Sunday, the Tribune editorialized that the Nuremberg trial was so corrupt it would have quote, gagged Pontius Pilate. And the Tribune was not alone in this effort. Republican Congressman Clare Hoffman of Michigan had been a loud, proud member of the America First movement.  Rep. Clare Hoffman: Unless we adhere strictly to these provisions in the Constitution, we’ll have a dictator right here in Washington. In fact, we almost have one now.  Maddow: When Americans, during the war, were put on trial for sedition, for working with the Nazis, Clare Hoffman was one of the congressmen who came to their defense and criticized the trial. Now, after the war, he was railing against putting the German Nazi leadership on trial as well. But it was more than just the right wing juggernaut Chicago Tribune and far right congressmen like Clare Hoffman. Announcer: Distinguished United States Senator from the state of Ohio, the Honorable Robert Taft. (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Senator Robert Taft was such a titan of Republican politics, his nickname was Mr. Republican. He was the son of Republican President William Howard Taft. He was expected by many people to be president himself one day. Senator Taft had also been among the members of Congress who had railed against the sedition trial during the war.  Then after the war, Taft also launched a very public crusade against Nuremberg. Taft started giving speeches saying that prosecution was not derived from quote, Anglo-Saxon heritage. He said it was motivated by a spirit of vengeance. He said America would long regret its involvement in prosecuting Nazis for war crimes. And as strange as that sounds today because America by and large does not regret its involvement in prosecuting Nazis, that line of argument actually came off a little strange then too. President Harry Truman said he would have no comment on these Republicans making such a big show of opposing the prosecution of Nazis. But he no commented it with such a look of satisfaction on his face that it got a big round of laughter from reporters in the White House press corps. But as crazy as their arguments seemed, morally and honestly politically, this idea did take hold in part of the Republican Party. And they were willing to push through the initial negative response to it because it was important to them, this argument. That the Nazis were being unfairly persecuted by the United States, both our pro-Nazi groups over here, and the actual German Nazis over there. It was our government that was the bad guy. With that case to make, as unpopular and as radical as it was, things were about to get weird in Washington. And two very different politicians were about to be set on a fatal collision course. This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Announcer: You’re about to hear an address delivered before a meeting of the America First Committee in Madison Square Garden in New York City. John Jackson: Most of these people were fascists, were aligned with the fascist cause. Anchor: Today’s guest, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Steven Remy: What he wanted was an investigation. The problem was he did not know what he was talking about. ******************************** Maddow: Episode 4, Spectacle. Speaker: I present to you a great American, Colonel Charles Lindbergh. (CROWD CHEERING) Maddow: Ahead of World War II, the famous American pilot Charles Lindbergh had led the America First Committee, arguing that we weren’t at any risk in this war, that we shouldn’t join it, that we would lose the war if we did. Charles Lindbergh: We are on the verge of a war for which we are still unprepared against armies stronger than our own. Maddow: When America was attacked and America did join the war, that put Lindbergh and his organization in a tough spot. The America First Committee formally disbanded itself just after the Pearl Harbor attack. Lindbergh himself even briefly attempted to re-enlist in the military. But once we were in the war, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reported to the White House that even though America First had officially dissolved, some of the group’s leadership kept meeting during the war in secret. In his words, they had gone underground. FBI files record that at one of their underground meetings in New York, Lindbergh told the group that they should quote, keep on the alert and be ready to reemerge, because soon the American people would see how they’d been betrayed by their own government. In other words, these guys were still expecting us to lose the war to Hitler and the Nazis. Whereupon, they were planning to reemerge as the Americans who would work things out with Hitler. They thought they would be the ones to make the arrangements for America’s surrender. A negotiated peace with the Nazis. Had the war gone that way, who knows? Maybe they might have. But things didn’t go that way. America won the war. Where did that leave members of the America First movement? Many America First lawmakers were voted out of office after they were implicated in the huge Nazi propaganda scheme in Congress that had involved some of the defendants in the great Sedition Trial during the war. Newsreel Announcer: Sedition trial opens in Washington. Maddow: Some lawmakers like Congressman Clare Hoffman were even hauled in to testify to the grand jury in that case. Newsreel Announcer: Thirty in all charged with scheming to establish a Nazi government in the United States. Maddow: But despite their participation in that conspiracy to push Nazi propaganda through Congress and feed it to the American people, no criminal charges were ever brought against any members of Congress for that. We just let it be and moved on.  And so a bunch of powerful forces and figures who’d been involved in America First before the war, they got to work on this brand new project after the war, coming to the defense of the now-defeated Nazis. Here’s historian John Jackson. Jackson: Henry Regnery was part of the isolationist crowd before World War II. Maddow: Henry Regnery was a prominent member of the America First Committee before the war. He was from a very rich family. His father had co-founded and funded America First. Henry Regnery, the son, helped found a right wing magazine called Human Events.  Reporter: The war crimes trial of 20 former top Nazi and German military leaders opened at Nuremberg. Maddow: Just one day after the Nuremberg trial started, the magazine railed against that prosecution as a quote, travesty of justice. Regnery then launched his own conservative publishing company, which is still around to this day. The first books he published argued that the Nazis were being treated very unfairly, that the supposed atrocities committed by the Nazi regime were really no worse than what anyone else did. Jackson: He was searching around for authors who would make that case, that equivalent sort of atrocities were committed by the allies as the axis powers. The problem was most of these people that Regnery publishes in the late 40s, early 50s were fascists, were aligned with the fascist cause, with Hitler’s cause. Maddow: It’s one thing to be opposed to the Nuremberg trials on legal grounds, to be wary of the idea of any sort of ad-hoc post-war legal proceeding. There were definitely some people making those good faith arguments at the time, right, left, and center. But you could tell when it was something else, when it wasn’t just the defeated Nazis overseas that they were taking up for. It was for our Nazis here at home as well. Newsreel Announcer: American justice returned a verdict of guilty in the trial of William Dudley Pelley, Silver Shirts leader.  Maddow: The defendants in the Great Sedition Trial had mostly been freed after their case ended in a mistrial. But by the time the war was over, there was one of them still behind bars. William Dudley Pelley. Bradley Hart: He wants to build an American version of fascism. Maddow: That’s historian Bradley Hart. Hart: Pelley’s people were ready to rise up and fight on behalf of the Nazis domestically. And he -- he really didn’t even conceal the fact that that was what he had in mind. Maddow: Pelley was the founder of the Silver Shirts, which was an antisemitic, pro-Nazi, armed militia in the United States before World War II. He repeatedly ran into legal trouble for fraud, for grifting and conning his own supporters. But Pelley ended up in prison for most of the war, specifically for his conviction for plotting to overthrow the U.S. government. Hart: This is a -- a group that -- that I think is a very serious national security threat. I mean there’s really no veneer of this being in any way, interested in anything other than -- than violence and political revolution. Maddow: It’s hard to imagine a less appealing political poster child than William Dudley Pelley. Hart: He actually says outright, I intend to overthrow the U.S. government. He’s open about these objectives. Maddow: But at the end of World War II, there was a groundswell of support among the old America First movement to free Pelley, to spring him from prison. The campaign was led by the Chicago Tribune, which began editorializing in favor of getting Pelley paroled. They published letters describing Pelley as a political prisoner. His cause was also taken up by America First members of Congress. Announcer: Tonight from Washington, D. C., you are to hear an address by the Honorable William Langer, twice Governor and now Republican Senator from North Dakota. Maddow: During the war, Republican Senator Bill Langer had turned up at the courthouse in D.C. to show off his support for the defendants in the Sedition Trial. Announcer: The pick of the bunch of pro-Hitlerites is Mrs. Lois de Lafayette Washburn, who rips off a Nazi salute -- Maddow: He sang their praises on the Senate floor. He helped arrange their legal defense. After the war was over, Langer took up the cause of getting parole for William Dudley Pelley, for this fascist leader. He made a personal visit to the federal prison in Indiana where Pelley was serving his sentence. When Pelley was denied parole, Langer introduced a Senate resolution to look into why it was that Pelley was being persecuted so unfairly. After pressure from Langer and other Republican members of Congress and from the Chicago Tribune and other parts of the conservative press, William Dudley Pelley did get parole. They got him out. Along the way that campaign to free him attracted the support of one young up-and-coming member of the United States Senate. A new Republican senator from the state of Wisconsin. Anchor: Today’s guest, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Maddow: Joe McCarthy was in his first term. He had just been elected to the Senate after unseating a longtime popular incumbent. After that upset victory, one of the first things McCarthy did was run to Chicago to go kiss the ring of Chicago Tribune publisher, Robert McCormick. Then McCarthy got to work in the Senate, aligning himself with some of the Tribune’s pet causes. Like parole for American fascist leader William Dudley Pelley, like opposition to the Nuremberg prosecution of high-ranking Nazis. McCarthy described Nuremberg as a quote, sorry spectacle. And then McCarthy jumped headlong into what would become a brand new crusade. It had to do with one of the most notorious crimes against American soldiers in the whole war. Reporter: The military court of Dachau in Germany has just finished that trial of Hitler’s SS men who were charged with the slaughter of American prisoners at Malmedy in Belgium. Maddow: The Malmedy Massacre, the Nazi soldiers who had carried out the Malmedy Massacre of unarmed American POWs, they had been put on trial and convicted and sentenced. In the wake of their convictions though, the convicts and their Nazi lawyer had cooked up an elaborate false story that they had all been tortured, horribly mistreated by Jewish investigators and interrogators in the U. S. Army. Here’s historian Steven Remy. Remy: That they had had limbs broken, that they had been assaulted, that their testicles had been damaged, that bones had been broken. It was very graphic. Maddow: The claims were very graphic. They were also very false. The men who initially made these false claims admitted they were false. Their defense lawyer at trial admitted they were false. And they’d been proven baseless by no fewer than four separate American reviews of the case. Remy: They all conclude that there was no torture. Maddow: But for the convicted men and their Nazi supporters inside Germany, these false claims about them having been tortured, it served their direct purpose of trying to overturn their convictions and get out of jail. Remy: German lawyers were feeding these stories of torture to really any American who would listen. Maddow:  It also served a larger purpose, portraying the Nazis as the real persecuted victims, and hopefully monkeywrenching the whole process of holding Nazis accountable for their crimes. What American would want to be part of that, would want to help with that? Remy: One of those was the McCormick family’s Chicago Daily Tribune. Maddow: The Chicago Tribune. Remy: The torture stories were headline getters. Maddow: The Tribune ran detailed stories with all of these graphic allegations about how those Malmedy Massacre defendant Nazi officers had been tortured by Americans. So did the conservative New York Daily News, the sister paper of the Chicago Tribune, run by Robert McCormick’s cousin.  These outlets breathlessly, credulously reported about Malmedy defendants who had suffered broken jaws and broken arms, permanently injured organs, burning matches driven under their fingernails. They had no evidence to support any of this. Remy: These were very serious accusations of extreme forms of physical and psychological abuse. They did nothing to confirm the accusations. They presented them as factual. Maddow: Not too far behind was Regnery Publishing, which began putting out books about how terrible and evil the American interrogators had been to those poor Nazi SS officers in the Malmedy trial. The America First movement may have lost the fight to keep America from going to war against the Nazis in the first place but this was kind of their next project, accelerating these false claims about evil Americans and innocent Nazis. The people pushing this hoax would find the most help among sympathetic members of Congress. Remy: A small number of American congressmen start picking up on this story. Maddow: That included Republican Senator Bill Langer, fresh off his efforts to free fascist militia leader William Dudley Pelley. Langer started promoting these baseless torture claims, including all the horror movie details the Nazis had invented to try to really sell the story. Like for example, the guy who said he had the burning matchsticks shoved under his fingernails. Not only was that proven to be false, but that guy was never even in prison with the Malmedy defendants. Remy: Now, Langer is very confused. He presented a highly distorted account of what supposedly had gone on during the investigation and the trial. Maddow: This was propaganda manufactured inside Germany, pushed by well connected operators who were trying, among other things, to return Nazism to power there. In the United States Congress, there was a select group that was more than willing to repeat that stuff, to give it their personal stamp of validation. It was the exact same play the Nazis had run with their favorite members of Congress before the war. Now here it was again. Joining the chorus on Malmedy was Bill Langer’s new wingman in the Senate, young Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy. Remy: McCarthy, at that time, was relatively unknown, a still relatively unknown junior senator. Maddow: Joe McCarthy was a fairly unremarkable, under the radar Republican senator. He had taken down a big name in order to get himself into the Senate though. And now that he was there, he saw an opportunity to make a big name for himself. Remy: He was looking for a way to raise his visibility, and he caught wind of the Malmedy case. Maddow: McCarthy had a sizable German American population back home in Wisconsin. He also had a particular German American to whom he paid lots of extra attention. It was his largest donor, someone who not only supported McCarthy’s campaign, he’d also personally bailed McCarthy out by posting collateral for the senator when he fell into financial trouble early in his Senate career. He was a businessman whose company had been in trouble under FDR for advertising that it only wanted job applicants if they were white and gentile. When the Nazi propaganda hoax about the supposed torture of the Malmedy defendants started to make news in the United States, McCarthy’s big donor told the senator that he was sending a lawyer from his own company in Wisconsin to Washington to go work in McCarthy’s office specifically on that issue. McCarthy, at that point, looking to make a splash, hoping to get some press, trying to curry favor, both back home and with right wing kingmaker publications like the Chicago Tribune, he had started repeating these baseless claims that Nazi officers had been the victims of abuse and torture at the hands of vengeful, mostly Jewish American G.I.’s. Remy: He read in a very cursory way some of the torture stories and he accepted them at face value. The problem was he did not know what he was talking about. Maddow: McCarthy said that he had important information indicating that the actions of the Americans involved was quote, more than improper. His partner on this in the Senate, Bill Langer, described the Malmedy case as shocking. He said it was one of the most deplorable miscarriages of justice in history. Remy: What he wanted was an investigation. He wanted one of the committees of the Senate to carry out an investigation of the whole sordid affair. Maddow: Bill Langer and Joe McCarthy wanted an official Senate investigation of these allegations. And that is what they got. By echoing and amplifying these false Nazi torture claims, they got the Senate Armed Services Committee to agree to formally look into it. The investigation would be chaired by Republican Senator Raymond Baldwin of Connecticut, along with Democratic Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, and also a young freshman senator who had only been sworn into the Senate a few months earlier, Democratic Senator Lester Hunt. This investigation was his first major assignment as a new senator. McDaniel: Well, he was one of the three members of the committee, quite a -- quite a coup for a freshman. He had been in the Senate only a couple of months. Maddow: Baldwin, Kefauver, and Hunt. Those were the three senators who would look into these allegations. At least that was the plan. Senator Joe McCarthy had other ideas. McDaniel: That was Lester Hunt’s introduction to Joe McCarthy and it was -- it was quite ugly. Maddow: That’s next. ******************************** McDaniel: Lester Hunt had been in the Senate only a couple of months when the Senate decided it would investigate the Malmedy massacre. Maddow: It’s his first major assignment in Washington as a brand new U. S. Senator. Reporter: One of the prosecutors of the Nazi stormtroopers sentenced for their role in the Malmedy massacre has been invited to testify before the Senate committee now checking into the trial. Maddow: After a massacre of unarmed American prisoners of war, after the perpetrators were caught and put on trial and convicted, after four separate reviews of the investigation and the trial and the convictions found them all to be legit, found them all to be sound, now the U. S. Senate is doing its own additional investigation, basically because of a foreign influence operation that worked. Reporter: The senators are probing reports that the Germans were beaten and starved to get confessions from them. Remy: The torture stories began to be fed to the United States and picked up by the American press and by other sympathetic and interested Americans, including some members of Congress. Maddow: The Senate hearings began in earnest in April 1949. The Armed Services Committee had appointed three senators to investigate, Raymond Baldwin, Estes Kefauver, and Lester Hunt. They’re from different parties, different parts of the country but they’re united in their determination that they’re going to do this properly. Remy: The three members of the subcommittee, Baldwin in particular, was determined to make this investigation as thorough as it possibly could be. Maddow: That earnest determination from these three senators soon runs right into the equal and opposite force that was Joe McCarthy. McDaniel: For reasons that aren’t clear, Joe McCarthy somehow wiggled himself onto the committee and -- and convinced the leadership to let him come to the committee hearings as a special observer. Maddow: Once the hearings start though, he sheds any pretense that he’s there just to observe. McDaniel: He, in a very belligerent and forceful way, hijacked the hearings and made them very difficult for anybody to -- to find the truth. Maddow: The transcript of the hearings is wild. McCarthy over and over again interrupts the senators who are actually doing the investigation. He speaks more words in the transcript than some of the actual members of the committee. He objects to American G.I.’s, the survivors of the Malmedy Massacre being called to testify. When witnesses do testify, he speaks over them too. Some of them he just berates. Right from the jump, he turns this whole investigation into a spectacle. He basically bullied himself into the hearing room in the first place. Once he was there, he was determined to get his money’s worth. Remy: McCarthy thought this was an easy way to score, an easy and cheap political victory. McDaniel: When you read through the manuscripts, as I did, the picture you get is Hunt, rather reserved, using his time to ask questions that were penetrating and -- and designed to get evidence, but confronted with this brawler Joe McCarthy. Maddow: This strategy, of course, would become a hallmark later in McCarthy’s Senate career, but this is where it starts, the Malmedy Massacre. Joe McCarthy and others, spreading to the American people, pro-Nazi propaganda, straight up lies cooked up in Germany, specifically to undermine and mess with the United States. McDaniel: Almost inexplicably, Joe McCarthy took the side of the Nazis and advocated their position. Maddow: McCarthy announced in the Senate all the Nazis’ horror movie claims as if they were proven facts. They were not. He said the vast majority of the Nazi defendants had been quote, crippled for life by the supposed torture. None of them were. Weirdly, he embellished even that, saying the crippled-for-life Nazis were kids. They were 15 and 16 years old. That wasn’t true either. But by then, he apparently was just riffing, just making stuff up. Anchor: In the Malmedy case, the army denied any brutality to obtain confessions. Maddow: And then he goes even further. He zeroes in on U.S. soldiers who had been involved in the investigation in questioning the Nazi defendants. He zeroes in on very specific U.S. soldiers. Remy: McCarthy learns about the background of some of the interrogators, and he makes a connection that some of the investigators were Jewish. He starts to parrot some of the same antisemitic narratives and he tries very clumsily and ineffectively to introduce this into the dialogue. Maddow: He calls U.S. soldiers who were Jewish, who were investigators on the case quote, a vengeance team. He said they had committed quote, brutalities greater than any we have ever accused Hitler Germany of employing. He said the soldiers who obtained confessions from the Nazis were quote, non-Aryans who quote, intensely hated the German people as a race.  This Senate performance by Joe McCarthy, his takeover of the investigation, his amplification, even his embellishment of these lurid Nazi talking points, it made for a real spectacle. Even more so when he made a big show of storming out of the proceedings. Remy: He quit and storms out of the committee very dramatically and very publicly and accuses the army of a cover up and a whitewash. Maddow: When he stormed out of the hearing, McCarthy went straight to the press. He accused the U.S. Army of terribly mistreating the Nazis. He said the Senate investigation was rigged. He said what the U.S. Army did in the Malmedy trial was quote, a brand of brutalitarianism worse than that practiced by the most morally degenerate in Hitler’s camp. He said the day is going to come when the chair of the Senate investigation, Senator Baldwin, would quote, bitterly regret what McCarthy called his criminal responsibility for a whitewash. This Nazi propaganda, this hoax, was a cause that had been championed by the Chicago Tribune and by trailing ends of the America First movement, by those who had taken up for the pro-Nazi Sedition Trial defendants during the war. And now, here was Joe McCarthy getting his first national attention as a senator for grabbing that same mantle. It got him a big picture in the New York Times. The caption was, an irate senator takes a walk. The senators on the committee, as shocked as they were by McCarthy buffaloing his way through the hearings and storming out theatrically and uncritically shoveling all the claims made by the Nazis, they knew they still had an investigation to complete, with or without him. They brought the investigation all the way to Germany to talk firsthand to the Nazis who were claiming they had been tortured by Americans. They talked to the Nazi lawyer, who had been spreading those claims so effectively, both in Germany and the United States. They interviewed medical personnel and reviewed medical records to look into all those supposedly severe and permanent injuries. Remy: The medical exams simply showed no evidence of the kind of physical damage to bones, to testicles that the prisoners had claimed in their affidavits. Maddow: Senator Lester Hunt himself proved particularly valuable to that part of the investigation, thanks of all things to his background as a dentist.  McDaniel: He reviewed medical records from their period of confinement to determine whether he saw any evidence of torture. And he was specifically assigned that because of his medical background. Maddow: The Senate’s investigation of the Malmedy trial was the most thorough review that was done of the entire affair. The official record of the hearings alone is nearly 2,000 pages. They interviewed more than a hundred witnesses, including every investigator who questioned the Nazi defendants. They spoke to the officials who ran the prison where the defendants had been held. They spoke directly to the Nazi soldiers who claimed they’d been tortured by the Americans. They spoke to doctors who had treated them. They spoke to the assistants of the doctors, at least one of whom bluntly admitted that the affidavit filed in her name had been written up by the Nazi lawyers who had taken over the case without even consulting her. In the end, the findings of the investigation were clear. Remy: The committee concluded that the torture claims were baseless. Maddow: Baseless, like every review that had come before it. No matter what Joe McCarthy and Bill Langer and the Chicago Tribune and all the old America First guys were trying to sell, it just did not happen. Remy: Some of the convicted men themselves later admitted that they had lied or that they had grossly exaggerated what had happened to them. Maddow: As part of their investigation, the senators had asked U.S. Army counterintelligence in Germany to look into the origin of these false claims. Counterintelligence reported back that quote, a number of former ex-Nazis, particularly high ranking ones, are financing and supporting campaigns against the Malmedy case. Remy: Groups of ex-Nazis worked to undermine both the project of denazification, right, purging German society of all traces of national socialism. They also fought very hard to undermine war crimes trials. This was mainly because, not only were they unrepentant Nazis, they considered Germans to be victims. Victims of the Jews. Maddow: The Senate committee wrote in their final report that the torture claims had been ginned up in Germany as part of what they called an organized effort to revive the nationalistic spirit in Germany through every means possible, an effort to revive the nationalistic spirit. The Associated Press put a bit of a finer point on it. Their headline was quote, Senators See Malmedy Case as Dangerous Pro-Nazi Plot. So, the torture claims, they were not just frivolously made up, they were deliberately created for a reason. Not only to free the members of the Nazi SS Blowtorch Battalion but also to try to free all of the Nazis, to try to vindicate the Nazis, and to discredit the allies. And in Germany, to try to return Nazism to power. Why were there Americans who were willing to get on board with this, including this World War II veteran, this ambitious young senator, Joe McCarthy? Remy: Why did he become involved in this? And that’s an interesting question. Maddow: Joe McCarthy’s speeches about Malmedy, his repetition and exaggeration of the false torture claims, his accusations that the investigation in the Senate was a big cover up, these claims by McCarthy not only got him attention in the United States, they were getting picked up and broadcast all over Germany. This U. S. Senator validating, legitimizing the Nazis claims about the terrible allies, the terrible Americans, doing to the innocent Nazis things that were worse than anything Hitler ever did. One Washington columnist wrote, throughout Germany today and particularly in underground SS and reviving Nazi channels, Germans are circulating savagely anti-American propaganda. This propaganda represents Americans as brutal, gangster-like oppressors. Senator Joseph McCarthy gave this propaganda an important assist. That was columnist Marquis Childs. And as he and other members of the press tried to sound the alarm about the consequences of what McCarthy was doing, one senator who knew exactly what McCarthy was up to was deciding what to do about it. McDaniel: I suspect he was a little shell shocked by McCarthy’s tactics. He was not bound by the truth or by facts. He would say anything at any time. That -- that was something that Lester Hunt, both on a personal level and in political experience, had never encountered. Maddow: Lester Hunt was disgusted with what he saw from Joe McCarthy. When McCarthy released his own report on Malmedy, repeating the torture allegations and alleging, again, some sinister cover up in the Senate, Senator Hunt went through it line by line. And he wrote in the margins where McCarthy was wrong, where he was definitely lying, and must have known he was lying. McDaniel: He’d only been in the Senate such a short period of time and didn’t quite know what to make of it or how to -- how to challenge it. It just wasn’t Hunt’s style to engage in that sort of verbal combat. You know that’s not the way they did things back in Wyoming, and he wasn’t accustomed to that. And this was his first time on that stage with people of that kind. Maddow: Lester Hunt did mostly hold his fire while the Senate investigation was ongoing. But when it was over, he decided he did need to take a stand against McCarthy. He accused him publicly of hitting below the belt with his attacks. He said he personally resented McCarthy’s efforts to delegitimize the Senate investigation. He was not shy at all about telling the country what he thought about McCarthy. McDaniel: He called him an opportunist. Said he was a liar and a drunk. He was pretty -- he was pretty blunt about it. Maddow: Lester Hunt standing up to McCarthy in this way — it would end up costing him. Because Hunt and his colleagues on that committee, and members of the press, they soon discovered what exactly McCarthy had been up to with this Malmedy stunt. Who he had been involved with. Joseph McCarthy’s maiden voyage into the national spotlight, this strange defense of the Nazis, it was not a one-off for him. In many ways it was a sign of what was yet to come. David Austin Walsh: He would take information wherever he could find it. And if it meant working with, you know, far-right people with a specific agenda, then he would do that. Maddow: McCarthy was about to open the door to some of the darkest elements on the American ultra right, groups who wanted to end American democracy. Steven Ross: He would start his meetings by heiling Hitler and then heiling McCarthy. Maddow: And a man who at that very moment was on the run from U.S. authorities over his explicit ties to the Nazis. Jackson: Yockey assumes a number of identities, keeps moving, first he’s over here, then he’s over there. Maddow: Francis Yockey, the fugitive American fascist, was about to re-emerge in a way that would leave American authorities in something approaching a panic. Mostrom: If any journalist had learned about this connection, I think Joe McCarthy’s career would have been severely damaged right then and there. But the fact is no one found out. Maddow: That is next time. Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra is a production of MSNBC. This episode was written by myself, Mike Yarvitz, and Kelsey Desiderio.

Netflix’s hit documentary ‘Tell Them You Love Me’ highlights a misleading promise,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 7, 2024, 10:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-new-documentary-tell-them-that-you-love-me-rcna160480,"My first encounter with the method known as “facilitated communication” (FC) dates back to 1990, at the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication Conference held in Stockholm. During that event, I attended a presentation by Rosemary Crossley of Australia, the inventor of FC. She claimed that hidden language, literacy and cognitive skills among individuals who are nonspeaking could be unveiled using a new strategy. And she described the process: using a facilitator supporting the hand or arm of a nonspeaking individual to construct a message by pointing to letters on an alphabet display or keyboard. Given my extensive experience at Boston Children’s Hospital, where I had established the first clinic in the country devoted exclusively to developing and applying a variety of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies for children and adults who used limited or no speech, I was immediately skeptical. But as the talk concluded, I figured, “What harm can it do?” Netflix’s new documentary “Tell Them You Love Me” sadly answers that question. The film, which delves into complex themes of race, disability and communication in the context of sexual exploitation, quickly captivated audiences. For years, FC has sparked debate over its bold but I would argue unproven assertions of unlocking hidden linguistic and cognitive abilities among individuals with significant developmental disabilities. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence against the method, its persistence remains. Numerous established professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association uniformly reject FC, yet it continues to have enthusiastic supporters. Soon after the Stockholm conference, I was recruited by a prosecutor to determine the authorship of messages generated using FC in a case regarding allegations of sexual abuse. I was tasked with developing a method to identify who really generated the messages in question: the individual being facilitated, or the facilitator who was in continuous contact with their body as the messages were typed. I devised and administered a series of procedures in which neither the facilitator nor the person being facilitated were aware of what the other was shown. The findings left no doubt in my mind that the facilitator authored every response, and in turn was responsible for making false allegations of abuse. After publishing the results of this investigation, I was asked to participate in many more cases over the next three decades where teachers and family members were falsely accused of sexual misconduct. In these legal cases, my testing found that it was the facilitator and never the individual being facilitated who authored all messages. Sadly, dozens of similar cases involving FC took place in courtrooms across the country. Netflix’s hit documentary details one of these legal cases. I believe the driving forces behind FC’s continued popularity are multifaceted. On the one hand, there are clinicians and educators who ardently promote FC even though it lacks empirical support. Their unwavering belief in its efficacy likely stems from a genuine desire to help individuals with disabilities communicate, but does not reflect evidence-based practices. As Janyce Boynton, a former facilitator, asserts in her article “Facilitated Communication — What Harm It Can Do: Confessions of a Former Facilitator,” a well-meaning facilitator can be completely unaware that they are authoring facilitated encounters. In 1995, I was part of a research team that proved that facilitators could be easily created. Initially, study participants were informed that a promising new communication method that required they “facilitate” was being explored. After viewing a short training video on how to facilitate and watching the initial positive footage taken from the PBS “Frontline” documentary “Prisoners of Silence,” they met and went on to facilitate answers to a series of questions that only they — and not the actor pretending to be nonspeaking — knew. This experiment suggests that what was at play was the ideomotor effect, a psychological phenomenon often used to explain the mystery behind the Ouija board. On the other hand, families often cling to FC because it offers a semblance of normalcy. The illusion that their children can express themselves independently becomes a powerful motivator. The litany of sophisticated messages often created using FC likely feel compelling because they align with the value our society places on cognitive and behavioral norms rather than accepting individuals with disabilities and providing them with appropriate accommodations. In essence, this is an understandable clash between evidence, deeply held convictions, societal norms and hope. At the end of “Tell Them You Love Me,” the mother of a man diagnosed with cerebral palsy states: “Just embrace him. Just love him for who he is.” As a clinician aware of the plethora of existing augmentative and alternative communication methods, the acceptance of an individual and their disability is a vital part of identifying appropriate accommodations for authentic communication. For decades, I have asked what I consider to be an obvious and essential question: Why aren’t individuals who use FC routinely given the opportunity to use existing and well-established assistive technology strategies that would increase their independence and eliminate the relentless question of authorship? These independent means of creating messages include a wide range of proven clinical options such as specialized keyboards, software programs that only require a single, controlled movement like a head nod or eye blink to spell words, or advanced technologies such as eye-typing, which allows spelling by just looking at letters on a screen. In hindsight, “What harm can FC do?” feels premature and grossly inaccurate."
I’m a doctor. Biden’s debate performance led me to a very different takeaway.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-debate-nominee-ageism-aging-rcna160319,"Following President Joe Biden’s troubling performance at the presidential debate with Donald Trump, Democrats have been consumed by a frenzied dispute around which candidate should replace Biden on the November 2024 ballot. But I came away from the debate with a different takeaway: How does the United States treat its aging population? Despite advancements in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, ageism remains one of the last socially acceptable prejudices, not so subtly ingrained in our culture, media and institutions. Age is inescapable. It comes for all of us, if we’re lucky. For those who are not experiencing symptoms of advanced aging themselves, they’re almost surely impacted by an acquaintance or family member who is. Yet as a society we portray aging as something to be feared and avoided, reinforcing negative perceptions that contribute to the marginalization of older adults — including our elected leaders. At the same time, society is pushing to increase longevity and life expectancy, evidenced by an entire industry based on the fallacy that we can stave off age with the right product, practice or diet. Our treatment of older Americans reflects a dismal reality: We are not prepared for our aging population; the number of people 85 and older is expected to nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040. By 2034, older adults will outnumber children under the age of 18 in the United States for the first time in history. With this aging come some important societal dilemmas. Older adults have more chronic health needs, are more isolated and are also more likely to work and experience workplace discrimination due to their age. And as we age, we are also leaning on family members for assistance: 1 in 4 family members serve as a caregiver, often unpaid. One in 6 older Americans face hiring discrimination when looking for a job and 2 in 3 face discrimination once hired. Biden’s symptoms on display during the debate were a medical textbook of common findings for a geriatric population — delayed response time, difficulty finding words and so on. Combine that with little sleep and a viral illness or a cold, anyone over the age of 40 would likely suffer similar symptoms like hoarse voice, slowed reaction time and confusion. This is not a defense for the debate performance, but simply a reminder that both presidential candidates are, simply put, old. With such age there is an expected degree of possible setbacks; a bad cold, a hip fracture that could turn fatal, a cardiac event that lands you in the hospital. It is completely misguided to also deny our society’s appetite for engaging in both ageism and our own amnesia regarding the effects of age. Historically, the age of U.S. presidents has been a subject of debate and scrutiny, with concerns often raised about their physical and mental capacity to handle the rigorous demands of the presidency. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 at the age of 69, he became the oldest president to be inaugurated at that time. During his second term, which began when he was 73, questions about his age and cognitive abilities intensified. Despite these concerns, Reagan completed his term and left office at 77, setting a record as the oldest president at the end of his tenure. Since Reagan’s time, the life expectancy for all adults, including white males, has increased several years due to advancements in medical technology, such as innovations in cancer treatment and cardiac drugs, even with Covid-19 causing a setback in life expectancy. In short, we are living longer and longer thanks to science. Having two of the oldest people to date running for presidential office is a sign of success and progress, even with the setbacks it presents. Which brings us back to the age paradox: Our desire to live longer is difficult to reconcile with society’s treatment of people who manage to do it. Polling data indicates that a majority of voters have reservations about the ability of older candidates to effectively manage the responsibilities of the presidency. For instance, a Pew Research Center survey found that only 3% of Americans believe the best age for a president is in their 70s or older, with the majority preferring candidates in their 50s. The concerns are not unfounded, as cognitive decline can affect decision-making, memory and the ability to handle stress — all critical aspects of presidential responsibility. But it is also true that age brings experience and wisdom, undoubtedly valuable assets in a president. While debates will always have some element of disagreement, and the recent one is no exception, a conversation about aging need not be yet another thing that divides us. Instead, it is a chance to reflect deeply and show great compassion for our elderly, while also acknowledging that we are intelligent enough to discern between showmanship and substance. Therein lies true common ground."
How a second Trump term could put military officers in a dangerous bind,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 7, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-trump-military-rcna160172,"In her dissent from Monday’s Supreme Court ruling that a president enjoys immunity for “official acts,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the 6-3 ruling makes possible the hypothetical scenario of a U.S. president evading prosecution after ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent or even organizing a military coup. Sotomayor, who concluded her opinion by writing, “With fear for our democracy, I dissent,” isn’t wrong to feel that way. It’s questionable at best whether the guardrails of our military officers’ oaths to support and defend the Constitution would be able to sustain our democracy in the face of a relentless assault sure to come in a second Trump administration. The relationship between our civilian and military leaders is foundational for our democracy and rests on an implicit “contract” requiring mutual respect, trust and consultation. The military is allowed autonomy over decisions within its professional jurisdiction and expects to be consulted on matters of national security. The military’s professional responsibility is to provide unbridled advice to civilian leadership and accept that final decisions rest with those elected by the American people. In return, the military expects to remain apolitical and not be used as a partisan tool. Ours is one of the few nations whose military swears allegiance to a system of government and not a dictator, king, queen or president. However, during Trump’s term as president, he sought the support of the military even as he was sometimes contemptuous of its prerogatives. At times, he seemed to view the military as just another political force to be used for partisan advantage, and he frequently referred to senior officers as “my generals.” Because Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution says that “the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States,” some Americans fear that military officers will follow any order from a president reflexively and without question. That’s not necessarily true, but Monday’s immunity ruling may encourage a president to pursue absolute obedience from our nation’s military. And that’s dangerous. What’s known as the commander in chief clause caused significant debate during the Constitutional Convention, and our Founding Fathers were determined to ensure military and political leaders worked together and that no one leader would be able to order the use of military might unilaterally or illegally. Even so, they didn’t precisely define the extent of those powers in the Constitution. Thus, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling exposes not only the clause’s ambiguity but also a potential dilemma facing military officers who swear to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” As a faculty member at West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy and a dean of the U.S. Army War College, I frequently witnessed cadets, midshipmen and serving officers discussing the legal and moral obligations of their oath. They’re taught that following a clearly illegal order would make them morally and legally responsible for their actions. It wouldn’t matter if it’s Lt. William L. Calley ordering his men to shoot Vietnamese civilians or, to the SEAL Team Six hypothetical, a president ordering a political opponent’s assassination. (As an aside, let me say that I know and have known a significant number of SEALs. They are some of the most professional officers in the military. They find this scenario insulting.) Tragically, the Supreme Court decision may have made it likely that military personnel will wrestle with the dilemma of either openly defying the commander in chief or subverting  their sense of both duty and personal morality — at least if there’s a second Trump administration. The military leadership’s collective discomfort was demonstrated multiple times when Trump was president. He belittled senior military officers and took over Independence Day, ordering service members to participate in a celebration that was as much about himself as it was about America. A military officer serving on the National Security Council cited his oath as an officer to explain his resignation following his testimony during the first Trump impeachment. Trump interfered with the military justice system by pardoning three service members convicted of war crimes and suggested to his chief of staff that generals should follow his orders like German generals did for Hitler. Ultimately, his actions resulted in the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issuing a memorandum to all top military commanders reaffirming the critical importance of the oath taken by every member of the armed forces. Gen. Mark Milley wrote in the margin, “We all committed our lives to the idea that is America. We will stay true to that and the American people.” Some in the military — as well as retired officers serving in senior administration positions — exercised “respectful disobedience” in order to appear supportive of the president while keeping his worst excesses at bay. Disturbingly, Trump has revealed how he might abuse civil-military relations during a second term. He has said he’d use the military to carry out mass deportations of people here illegally, contrary to “Posse Comitatus” law, which forbids the military from conducting operations on American territory. He’s also said he’d make extensive use of the Insurrection Act and order federal troops to American cities as he sees fit. The former president has even written on social media that he would order a televised military tribunal for former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, who co-chaired the U.S. House Jan. 6 committee. Such actions could result in mass resignations by senior military officers. But Trump could also seek to avoid opposition to any questionable orders by placing loyalists such as retired Gen. Michael Flynn in key positions or by appointing only senior military officers who have passed some form of political loyalty test. A second Trump term could bring “the end of our democracy,” says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, “and the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order.” That’s not hyperbole. Trump showed an increasing willingness to force senior military officers to choose between these potentially conflicting loyalties, and he would likely do so with even greater intensity if he becomes commander in chief again."
Conspiracy theorist RFK Jr. has some thoughts on how to address 9/11 conspiracy theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 1:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rfk-jr-9-11-conspiracy-ufos-rcna160550,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., independent presidential candidate and proponent of various conspiracy theories, said he will “open the files” on the 9/11 attacks if elected president, vowing not to “take sides” on the issue. “My take on 9/11: It’s hard to tell what is a conspiracy theory and what isn’t. But conspiracy theories flourish when the government routinely lies to the public,” Kennedy wrote in a post on X on Friday. “As President I won’t take sides on 9/11 or any of the other debates. But I can promise is that I will open the files and usher in a new era of transparency.” The long-shot presidential candidate said his stance on 9/11 came in response to recent reporting from CBS News’ “60 Minutes” that a Saudi intelligence operative with ties to two 9/11 hijackers may have been involved in planning the attacks. Kennedy said that releasing government files on “contentious topics” like 9/11 and unidentified aerial phenomena, or UFOs — issues he said he was “personally agnostic on” — would be his way of re-establishing public trust in the government. “Speculation about what our government may be covering up is rife outside the mainstream of our political culture,” he wrote. “Trust [in] government is at an all-time low. The way to restore that trust is through honesty and transparency.” Kennedy’s reputation as a conspiracy theorist precedes him. He has repeatedly spread debunked anti-vaccine claims, suggested that gender dysphoria is a result of chemicals in the water supply, questioned whether HIV infections cause AIDS, and promoted the conspiracy theory that the CIA assassinated his uncle President John F. Kennedy. His comments about the 9/11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people, also came on the heels of recent disturbing news reports about his past. In May, The New York Times reported that Kennedy said in 2012 that a worm had eaten part of his brain. This week, Vanity Fair reported on a sexual assault accusation against Kennedy and suggested that he may have eaten dog meat in the past.

The filing goes on to claim that President Joe Biden’s rebuke of the Supreme Court for instituting virtually no limits on a president’s power was proof that Biden had coordinated with the Justice Department to target Trump. The claim that the criminal justice system has been weaponized against Trump is a long-running accusation that Republicans have leveled against Democrats, even as Trump himself has vowed to use the power of his office to punish his enemies if re-elected. (Read more from my colleague Ja’han Jones on the right’s deployment of the “lawfare” claim against Democrats.) Cannon agreed on Saturday to push back some deadlines in the case, giving special counsel Jack Smith until July 18 to respond to the request for further delay. The high court ruled on Monday that Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for some official acts in his federal election interference case, but the decision also threatens the prosecution of Trump’s other ongoing criminal cases, as well as his conviction in the New York hush money case. The sentencing hearing for the latter, initially scheduled for July 11, was pushed back to September following the immunity ruling, as his attorneys seek to toss out the conviction entirely. Trump’s classified documents case was already bogged down by a host of issues, in large part because of Cannon’s decisions (or the lack thereof), which have baffled legal experts. She has refused to set a trial date, opting instead to hold long evidentiary hearings on motions, and has moved the case along with little sense of urgency. The defense also presented a presidential immunity argument in the case back in February. A trial in the classified documents case — already unlikely to happen before November — now seems an even more remote possibility altogether."
Tucker Carlson gets embarrassing rebuke from Ukraine,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 8:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/volodymyr-zelenskyy-tucker-carlson-interview-rcna160471,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office on Thursday denied social media pundit Tucker Carlson’s claim that he had landed an interview with the nation’s leader. In a statement in Ukrainian on Facebook, Zelenskyy’s spokesperson Sergii Nykyforov took a swipe at the far-right commentator, telling him to check his sources in Russia’s FSB security service “more carefully.” “The President of Ukraine has a completely different schedule, and Tucker Carlson is not there,” Nykyforov said, according to an English translation of the statement. Carlson had teased an interview with Zelenskyy the day before, writing on X, “Looks like we’ve got the Zelenskyy interview. We’ve been trying for two years, and with particular intensity after interviewing Putin in February.” Carlson, who has been attacked for his pro-Kremlin stance, interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin in February. It was Putin’s first interview with a Western media figure since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Carlson was widely criticized for his softball questions and his apparent deference to the Russian leader. A former Fox News cable show host, Carlson has tried to reassert himself as a power player in the media landscape since being booted from Fox in April 2023. Months afterward, he launched the Tucker Carlson Network, a subscription streaming service, where he has continued to peddle conspiracy theories and misinformation to his audience. Segments of his show have also aired on Russian state TV. (Carlson has denied any involvement, telling CNN, “Of course I have no partnership with Russia.”) Carlson’s process for verifying sources has raised questions in the past. In March of this year, two YouTube pranksters claimed they tricked Carlson into believing that he was interviewing a Kensington Palace employee who had been fired for poorly editing a photo of Catherine, Princess of Wales."
'As long as I gave it my all': Biden reflects on potentially losing to Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 6, 2024, 8:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-abc-interview-gave-it-my-all-rcna160528,"President Joe Biden’s make-or-break interview with ABC News on Friday night did little to convince alarmed Democrats that he is capable of winning the election and serving another four years in the White House. But among the more jarring moments in the interview was when Biden framed his insistence on running in this critically important election — and his potential defeat — as a personal endeavor. “And if you stay in and Trump is elected, and everything you’re warning about comes to pass, how will you feel in January?” asked ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. “I’ll feel, as long as I gave it my all and I did [as] good a job as I know I can do, that’s what this is about,” Biden said. To hear Biden say the election is about putting his best foot forward is striking, given the stakes as Democrats themselves have described them. And the growing public discontent within his own party suggests that not all Democrats believe they are giving this election their all with Biden as the nominee. Biden also demonstrated an unwillingness to address real concerns about his fitness for office, dismissing his flagging poll numbers and a belief among some Democrats and donors that he cannot beat Trump. Instead of reassuring Democrats, the interview may accelerate the revolt against his nomination. After it aired, two more House Democrats, Reps. Mike Quigley and Angie Craig, joined the calls for Biden to step aside. An anonymous House Democrat told NBC News: “It made me sad. Completely out of touch with reality and insulated from truth. I’ll be breaking my silence soon.”"
Hunter Biden accuses Fox News of distributing 'revenge porn' of him in mock trial miniseries,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 11:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/hunter-biden-fox-news-revenge-porn-lawsuit-rcna160006,"Hunter Biden has filed a lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the network of distributing “revenge porn” in its miniseries of a mock trial over imaginary criminal charges against him. Filed in New York state court on Sunday, the lawsuit accuses the network of engaging in “unlawful commercial exploitation of Mr. Biden’s image, name, and likeness” in its six-part miniseries, “The Trial of Hunter Biden.” Although the series is fictional, it points to real stills and videos that show the president's son unclothed, with his intimate parts exposed and engaging in sex acts. “Fox published and disseminated these intimate images to its vast audience of millions as part of an entertainment program in order to humiliate, harass, annoy, and alarm Mr. Biden and to tarnish his reputation,” the complaint states. Fox News called Biden’s lawsuit “politically motivated” and “devoid of merit.” “Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon,” a network spokesperson said. “Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden’s own making, and we look forward to vindicating our rights in court.” Biden last month was convicted on federal charges of lying to obtain a firearm, which he is appealing. He is also set to stand trial in a federal tax case in September. But the Fox News series, released on its streaming service in October 2022, is centered on a mock trial over hypothetical charges of illegal foreign lobbying and bribery against the president's son, crimes he has never been charged with. Biden threatened to sue the network in April, prompting Fox News to quickly remove the series from its platforms. Months later, Biden has made good on his threat. The lawsuit alleges that Fox News' publication of his nude images violates New York's statute on the distribution of intimate photos of a person without their consent. It also seeks damages from Fox News — which already reached a $787 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems last April and is battling it out in court with Smartmatic in a separate defamation lawsuit — and an order to remove any copies of the explicit images from the network's platforms."
The Biden admin is taking a dangerous approach to Israel’s other war,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 10:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hezbollah-war-looming-know-rcna159948,"Benny Gantz, a former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff who left his country's war Cabinet last month, was blunt during a security conference when addressing the ongoing conflict at the Israel-Lebanon border last week. “We can bring Lebanon completely into the dark, and take apart Hezbollah’s power in days,” Gantz said. If there is anything Middle East experts can agree on, it’s that a large-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah would be a travesty for all involved. Inside Israel, it’s a different story; many Israelis believe another war with Hezbollah is inevitable, if not long overdue given the security environment Israel has faced since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack undermined the IDF’s perceived invincibility. The IDF have already approved plans for an offensive in Lebanon, and the language from some Israeli officials, including Gantz, suggests an operation will occur sooner or later. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, stressed over the weekend that more Israeli reservists will be deployed to the north as operations in Gaza wind down. It’s a stark departure from where much of the international community stands. On June 21, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres told the U.N. Security Council, “The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.” Days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated to reporters at the Pentagon, “Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war with terrible consequences for the Middle East.” Ditto German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, whose own rhetoric during a recent trip to Israel and Lebanon was nearly identical to America’s top defense official: “Another war would mean a regional escalation on a scale we can hardly imagine.” Washington, for its part, has tried to prevent war in Lebanon by catering its messages depending on the audience. To Hezbollah, the Biden administration is making it plain that, while the U.S.-Israel relationship is tight, it can’t control Israel and it would therefore be wise for the U.S.-designated terrorist group to start cooperating on a diplomatic way out. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to stress to Israel that, although it opposes a war, Washington will have Israel’s back come hell or high water.  President Joe Biden, though, needs to start getting real with Israel. Right now the administration is trying to have it both ways by stressing just how awful an Israel-Hezbollah war would be while echoing that the U.S.'s support is automatic regardless of what Israel decides to do. This is likely to embolden, not discourage, Netanyahu. And it’s a dangerous approach. What the U.S. should be doing instead is making it known to Israeli officials, both publicly and privately, that the U.S. doesn’t support a war in Lebanon and won’t bail it out if it initiates one. Yet just because something is a terrible idea doesn’t necessarily mean it will be avoided. Israel and Hezbollah, two archenemies that have engaged in multiple armed confrontations over the last four decades, are in essence already in a war. Ever since Oct. 8, a day after Hamas’ deadly assault into southern Israel, the IDF and Hezbollah have turned the Israeli-Lebanese border region into their own personal firing range. Hezbollah has launched more than 5,000 anti-tank rockets, drones and missiles against various Israeli targets in the north of the country. Israel, in turn, has conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah positions nearly every day, killing high-ranking field commanders in the process. Nearly 350 Hezbollah fighters have been killed to date, a toll that surpasses the group’s casualty numbers during the 2006 Second Lebanon War. At the time of writing, Israel has registered a total of 25 deaths, 15 military and 10 civilian, on that front. For most of the last eight months, the violence has been relatively contained to within approximately 3.5 miles of the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line, the unofficial boundary between Israel and Lebanon. The fact that tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border were evacuated allowed to keep civilian casualties to a minimum. Yet Israel and Hezbollah’s rhetoric, in addition to deeper Israeli airstrikes into Lebanon and Hezbollah’s use of more sophisticated weapons like precision-guided munitions and drones —one of which injured 18 Israeli troops this weekend — are a bad omen for averting an escalation that the Biden administration is working desperately to prevent. Despite Gantz’s aggressive language, there is some truth to it. Outside of the United States military, the IDF is still the region’s most powerful military force. If Israel can turn Gaza into a wasteland of rubber and rebar, it can certainly do the same thing in Lebanon. This isn’t supposition but fact; Israel has invaded or bombed Lebanon so many times over the preceding decades (1978, 1982, 1993, 1996 and 2006) that it’s difficult to keep track. The 1982 invasion, which aimed to disband Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization for good, was especially deadly for the country, caused considerable friction with the United States and resulted in a nearly two decade-long occupation that created the very terrorist organization — Hezbollah — Israel is now seeking to deter.  The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war was deadly as well. Approximately 1,200 Lebanese lost their lives, as did 158 Israelis (the vast majority of whom were soldiers. Much of Lebanon’s public infrastructure, including the Beirut International Airport, was bombed. Even so, a new war with Hezbollah would make the 2006 conflict look tame in comparison. The 2006 war was a tactical success but a strategical failure for Israel, as it destroyed a decent chunk of Hezbollah’s offensive military capabilities but jeopardized Israel’s international reputation. The Lebanese militia was bloodied but not destroyed. The Hezbollah of 2024 is larger, better armed, more experienced and more politically powerful today than the Hezbollah of 2006. The group continues to boast its insurgent roots but increasingly resembles an army, possessing as many as 200,000 rockets and missiles of various ranges. Some of those missiles can reach any point in Israel, which means that, in the event of a war, Israel’s critical civilian infrastructure — airports, ports, electrical networks and power plants — could be targeted. Millions of Israelis would be living in bomb-shelters as the country’s major cities, from Tel Aviv to Haifa, are subjected to barrages that the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system would have a tough time neutralizing. Israeli ground forces, meanwhile, would be fighting against an organization that learned a great deal about military tactics, processes and procedures after years of ground operations in Syria, where Hezbollah proved crucial in saving Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from becoming the Syrian version of Muammar al-Qaddafi. In short, Israel would be acting against an adversary that is not only the Middle East’s strongest non-state actor but one that frankly fights more effectively than most of the region’s regular armies. The main motivation behind a hypothetical Israeli offensive is to allow its people to return to their homes. This is both a humanitarian and political imperative — humanitarian because Israelis, like people anywhere else, have the right to live in peace; political because a lingering internal displacement crisis is embarrassing for Netanyahu, whose entire career is premised on claims that he is the one man who can assure Israel’s security.  Yet it’s hard to see how launching a full-scale war in Lebanon accomplishes this. Any war is going to produce tremendous materiel and physical damage, not only to the lives of ordinary civilians but also to the towns, small villages and kibbutzim that dot the Israeli side of the Israeli-Lebanese border. Israel’s economy in the north would be even worse off than it is today as more Israelis pull out of the area for their own safety. Israel has to think bigger. Any war with Hezbollah increases the risk of Iran or proxy militias in Syria, Iraq and Yemen escalating their own direct involvement. It’s important to note that Hezbollah is Iran’s most valued asset in the region, a group that is meant to not only tie Israel down but to deter Israel and the United States from taking military action against Iran itself. While Iranian intervention of some sort is not a guarantee, it’s certainly possible if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps believe it’s necessary to preserve Hezbollah’s longevity. U.S. forces deployed in Iraq and Syria wouldn’t be out of the woods either; as demonstrated multiple times in the past, U.S. military outposts in both countries are opportunistic targets for Iran-backed militias who wish to send a message of disapproval about U.S. or Israeli policies. Although attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have largely subsided since the Biden administration bombed dozens of militia and IRGC-linked targets in February — retaliation for a militia drone strike that killed three U.S. troops at a remote basis along the Syrian-Jordanian border — nothing is permanent in the Middle East. U.S. officials will have to be aware that, in any Israel-Hezbollah war, there’s a chance Americans wouldn’t be immune from the fallout.  The Biden administration should keep this in mind and conduct itself wisely with Israel. The U.S. may not be able to control Israeli policy but it doesn’t have to be trapped by it, either. "
The reason Black voters say Trump should drop out won’t surprise anybody but him,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 10:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-black-voters-presidential-debate-rcna159840,"Much of the Democratic Party has been in a full-fledged panic since President Joe Biden’s struggles in Thursday’s CNN debate against Donald Trump. The editorial boards of The New York Times and Atlanta Journal-Constitution channeled some of the most desperate members of that party by arguing that Biden should abandon the race. One vital Democratic voting bloc appears to be somewhat more resistant to this anti-Biden panic, however. Black voters, Democrats’ most reliable voting bloc, are aware of the president’s problems and are divided on whether he should keep fighting or step aside. Yet there appears to be a consensus that Trump's really got no business running. Importantly, this dispels a narrative Trump’s been sharing, that his being booked for crimes a handful of times gave him street cred with Black voters. According to a CBS poll, 74% of Black registered voters say Trump shouldn’t be running for president, and 92% of them cite “decisions he might make in office” as a reason he shouldn’t be running. That same poll found 45% of Black voters think Biden should bow out; and there’s no way to dismiss that as insignificant. That figure must be factoring into the Biden camp’s calculations right now. But it would be punditry malpractice to focus on that number, as high as it is, and not the much higher number who say Trump shouldn’t be in the race. The poll was conducted Friday and Saturday — that is, on the two days after the debate. But something far more consequential than the debate happened Monday: The Supreme Court made it all but impossible to prosecute a president. That ruling will embolden a future President Trump like the matador’s cape emboldens the bull. It seems likely, then, that there would be even more voters — Black, white or otherwise — worried about potential Trump decisions than there were last week, before the rule of law expired.” Departing from the pundits who focused more on how the candidates looked and sounded than on what they said, a plurality of Black registered voters, 39%, said Biden won Thursday’s debate. The next largest, and perhaps the most honest group, was the 35% of respondents who said neither candidate won. Then there was the 25% who said Trump did. As much as reports on the debate have focused on Biden’s difficulty countering Trump’s incessant lying — and cited that difficulty as disqualifying — the Black voters who say Biden won appear to have focused more on those lies. The CBS poll reported that only 10% of the Black registered voters who watched that debate found Trump to be telling the truth. That’s because he didn’t tell the truth. As Paul Waldman wrote for MSNBC Sunday, “[T]here was not a single answer Trump gave that did not include some awful prejudice, a preposterously misleading statement or an outright lie, often more than one.” Registered voters surveyed in the CBS poll weren’t given the option to cite Trump’s lying ways as a reason he shouldn’t be a presidential candidate, but of the 74% of Black respondents who said he shouldn’t be a candidate, 98% cited his felony conviction, a consequence of his lying ways, as a reason. Wait, wasn’t his criminal trouble supposed to make him Soul Brother 45? Trump’s response to being convicted in Manhattan — and, before then, having his mug shot snapped in Atlanta — sounded a lot like the nonsense spouted by a clueless white person who bakes on a beach and then finds a Black person and says, “Now I’m just like you!” For example, when speaking to Black conservatives in South Carolina in February about having been indicted multiple times, Trump said, “And a lot of people said that’s why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against. It’s been pretty amazing but possibly, maybe, there’s something there.” Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, a Black Republican, quickly co-signed that foolishness on NBC’s Meet the Press when he told host Kristen Welker that Trump getting indicted “is something similar that Black people have to deal with, with the justice system themselves.” But the finding that three-quarters of Black voters polled think Trump shouldn’t be running and almost every one of them cites his Manhattan convictions as a reason, ought to come as a bracing slap of reality to everybody who has talked about Black voters as simpletons who can’t distinguish between justice and oppression. In advance of Thursday’s debate, Rocky Jones, a Black Atlanta barber, hosted a gathering of Black Republicans that included Donalds, Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas and former HUD Secretary Ben Carson for a discussion on small businesses. Images from the event showed signs on the wall like “Black Americans for Trump” and one with Trump’s mug shot with the words “Never Surrender.” If Black people were really moving into Trump’s column, the way Donalds and other Black Republicans have claimed, then Jones should be feeling pretty good with the attention he got from hosting the event. Instead, he’s been claiming he didn’t know he was hosting a political event. “I feel like I’ve been betrayed,” he told an Atlanta television station. In a social media post, the Trump campaign said, “The business owner signed an agreement with the Trump campaign and received payment for the time spent in his location for this event.” As hard as it is to accept that the Trump campaign is telling the truth about something, it seems likely that Jones is now realizing there aren’t enough “Black Americans for Trump” who want the services a Black barber provides. “We definitely got some calls, some backlash, some angry people…” he told the television station, “and I have to deal with that.” It’s still impossible to know what’s going to happen in this presidential election, or if the two presumed nominees will be the two candidates on the ballot. But it does appear Vote for me because I’ve been arrested just like you people isn’t a winning pitch. As anybody with any respect for Black people should have already known."
Heritage Foundation president raises alarm with cryptic threat,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 9:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/heritage-foundation-american-revolution-threat-bloodless-left-rcna160188,"For the last half-century, the Heritage Foundation has presented itself as the right’s premier think tank, but that only tells part of the story. The organization has also been a key piece of the right’s broader political infrastructure, providing countless staffers for Republican administrations, and helping craft policy proposals adopted by GOP officials at multiple levels of government. All the while, the Heritage Foundation enjoyed an air of respectability. Those looking for conservative cranks and conspiracy theorists were told to look elsewhere — because Heritage, the story went, was serious. These conservatives cared about substance and governing. This think tank, above all others, expected to serve as the flagship of the conservative movement, home to the right’s preeminent scholarship and academic research. In time, however, as Republican politics grew more radical, the Heritage Foundation shifted, too. In 2013, then-Sen. Orrin Hatch told MSNBC, “Heritage used to be the conservative organization helping Republicans and helping conservatives and helping us to be able to have the best intellectual conservative ideas. There’s a real question in the minds of many Republicans right now, and I’m not just speaking for myself: Is Heritage going to go so political that it really doesn’t amount to anything anymore?” Eleven years later, the idea that the Heritage Foundation is producing “the best intellectual conservative ideas” is plainly laughable, as its president reminded the public again yesterday. HuffPost noted: “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless ― if the left allows it to be,” Kevin Roberts, president of the right-wing Heritage Foundation, said on a conservative media outlet called Real America’s Voice. Pointing to Republican Supreme Court justices elevating the American presidency above the law, Roberts said in the same interview, “We’re in the process of taking this country back.” Not surprisingly, more than a few observers interpreted his “bloodless — if the left allows it to be” comments as a not-so-subtle threat. And while those concerns are warranted, they’re made worse by the broader significance of Heritage’s ongoing political efforts. Who’s responsible for the radical Project 2025 agenda? The Heritage Foundation. Who’s “pre-screening the ideologies” of thousands of people in the hopes of installing “a pre-vetted, pro-Trump army of up to 54,000 loyalists” across the federal government? The Heritage Foundation. Who’s funding an apparent blacklist of federal government workers who might stand in the way of a MAGA agenda? The Heritage Foundation. Who put up billboards in Alabama in support of Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville while he undermined his own country’s military? The Heritage Foundation. Which group’s former staffers have complained about their former employers prioritizing political messaging over policy formation? The Heritage Foundation. Whose president might be in contention for White House chief of staff in a second Trump term? The Heritage Foundation. It was against this backdrop that Heritage’s chief told a national television audience, “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless ― if the left allows it to be,” which was every bit as unsettling as it seemed."
Biden jokes he ‘almost fell asleep’ on the debate stage. It doesn’t help his case at all.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 9:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-debate-fell-asleep-travel-schedule-rcna160137,"President Joe Biden, facing increasing pressure to leave the 2024 race, seemingly joked at a campaign event Tuesday that he had been so weary from his June travel schedule that he “almost fell asleep” on the debate stage. “I wasn’t very smart,” he said at the fundraiser in Northern Virginia, adding: “I decided to travel around the world a couple of times ... shortly before the debate. ... I didn’t listen to my staff … and then I almost fell asleep onstage.” Biden said it was “not an excuse but an explanation.” NBC News reported that it wasn’t clear how much the president was joking about nearly falling asleep. The president did, in fact, have an intense itinerary in the weeks leading up to the debate: He flew to France and Italy on two separate trips to meet with foreign leaders, and from Italy he flew to California for a fundraiser before returning to Washington. Then he dove into debate preparations at Camp David. But the explanation for his hapless showing at the debate and the suggestion that he could have done even worse that night does little to assuage fears that he, at 81, is too old and too infirm to serve four more years as president. What’s more, his remark about nearly falling asleep onstage plays directly into Donald Trump’s “Sleepy Joe” nickname for him. As the panic within the Democratic Party deepens, Biden’s inner circle is reportedly growing even more defiant and isolated. The New York Times reported that the president has been experiencing increasingly frequent cognitive lapses, echoing The Wall Street Journal’s reporting about Biden’s mental acuity from early June. One Democratic member of Congress has already called for Biden to withdraw from the race. Even as prominent Democrats reiterate their support, not everyone is entirely rejecting the possibility of replacing Biden on the ticket."

Speaker Johnson rejects possibility of ‘crazy criminal activity’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 8:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-mike-johnson-trump-immunity-crazy-criminal-activity-rcna160166,"In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. U.S., which effectively put the American presidency above the law, a great many observers started imagining the practical implications of a lawless presidency. In fact, one of the dissenters in the case explored some of those possibilities. “The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. “When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune. “Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority’s message today.” Hours later, as The Hill noted, Congress’ top Republican lawmaker adopted a far more relaxed posture. “Look, there’s all sorts of hyperbole tonight ... and just this, fantastical, these hypotheticals they’ve made up [that] future presidents are going to turn into assassins and all the rest,” the Louisiana Republican told Fox News. “It’s madness.” Johnson added, “Listen, remember this. The president and vice president are the only two officers in our constitutional system that are elected by all the people, no one who is elected to that office is going to be prone to this kind of crazy criminal activity.” The House speaker’s lack of concern is well taken. Why assume that the United States would ever have a president who engaged in “crazy criminal activity”? It’s not as if Americans have ever seen a president who, for example, ran a fraudulent charity, a fraudulent “university,” and a business that was convicted on multiple felony fraud counts. And it's not as if we’d have a president who launched an illegal extortion scheme against a foreign ally in the hopes that he’d help the incumbent cheat in an election. And the United States would certainly never elect a president who falsified business records as part of an illegal hush-money scheme after allegedly cheating on his third wife with a porn star. And it’s silly to think an American president would defy a federal subpoena and keep highly sensitive national security secrets at his glorified country club. And voters would obviously never elect a president who tried to use the levers of federal power to target his perceived political foes in his own country. And we’d never elect someone who was held liable for sexual assault, just as it’s silly to think an American president would get indicted for trying to overturn an election and deploying a radicalized mob to attack the U.S. Capitol as part of an apparent coup attempt. Given these realizations, Johnson’s case sure is persuasive. No one elected to the nation’s highest office would ever be prone to “crazy criminal activity.”"
Only one person can reset the narrative about Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 8:24 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/joe-biden-age-narrative-rcna160040,"President Joe Biden lost ground at the debate, but he risks losing the race due to the way his team has handled things since. There’s a sense of permanence setting in, and that's the last thing that any candidate wants. The reason the last week has been so bad for the Biden campaign is because it’s not acknowledging reality. The American people are wrestling with a few very hard questions. First, can Biden be president today? The answer is yes. Look at his record, look at how he’s performing, look at what he has delivered at home and on the world stage. Second, can he be president for the next four years? The Biden camp's most powerful line of the last week came from Biden himself. He said he wouldn't ask for the American people's support if he knew he couldn’t do the job for the next four years. He said, “Trust me, I can do this.” Those are powerful words. The third question is: Can he win? And that’s what you see the Beltway pundits and Democrats wrestling with now. What Biden’s team needs to recognize is that telling Democrats to buckle down, breathe through their noses, not panic and ignore what they saw isn’t enough. The Biden coalition isn’t just Democrats. It’s a lot of soft Republicans, independents and soft Democrats who come out for Joe, but are not loyal or excited about the party. And just rallying loyal Democrats right now isn’t enough. And so, the only person who can reset the narrative about Joe Biden is Joe Biden. Not his team. Not calls with donors or loyalists or “Never Trumpers.” Forget about party loyalty. We haven’t had a national conversation about an aging president this intense since Ronald Reagan’s second term. The spin doctors in Washington, D.C., are going to say what they want to say. But only Biden can convince the American people he can see this campaign through successfully. And ultimately, that's the only thing that is going to reset this race.  This is an adapted excerpt from the July 1 episode of “Chris Jansing Reports.”"
Why the Supreme Court’s immunity decision might impact Trump’s New York verdict,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-conviction-new-york-rcna160033,         
Trump still struggling with the plain meaning of ‘exoneration’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 7:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-still-struggling-plain-meaning-exoneration-rcna160154,"It’s been nearly five weeks since a New York jury found Donald Trump guilty of 34 felonies, though the former president is still awaiting sentencing. According to the original plan, the Republican criminal was set to learn his fate next week. That plan has since changed: The judge in the case approved a delay sentencing until at least September 18, allowing Trump’s lawyers to review the potential impact of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. As USA Today reported, the presumptive GOP nominee responded to the news in an overly excited way. The same online missive added, “It is clear that the Supreme Court’s Brilliantly Written and Historic Decision ENDS all of Crooked Joe Biden’s Witch Hunts against me, including the WHITE HOUSE AND DOJ INSPIRED CIVIL HOAXES in New York.” At this point, we could talk about why the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. U.S. was not “brilliantly written,” why Trump’s hush-money case isn’t over, why there’s literally no evidence of President Joe Biden being “crooked,” why Trump’s legal problems are neither “witch hunts” nor “hoaxes,” why the White House has nothing to do with the former president’s prosecutions, and why the Justice Department is unrelated to the Republican’s criminal case in New York.  We could even pause to marvel at the lie-to-word ratio, which was quite extraordinary, and which reflected Trump’s fractured relationship with reality.  But what stood out as especially notable was Trump’s latest claim to “total exoneration.” The truth, of course, is that the Supreme Court concluded that official presidential acts are immune from prosecution, but that’s not the same thing as “total exoneration.” In the hush-money case, jurors still found the Republican defendant guilty of crimes unrelated to Trump’s official duties. In fact, much of the case focused on events that predated his inauguration. At no point has any judge or court wiped the slate clean, undoing the jury’s verdict. Trump’s claims to the contrary were absurd. But they were also familiar. For those who’ve kept an eye on the former president’s rhetoric over time, he has some unmistakable tells. When Trump tells stories, for example, about big, burly men who profess their love for him while crying, he’s lying. When he vows to release information in “two weeks,” he’s lying. And similarly, when the Republican uses the word “exoneration,” he’s lying. Let’s revisit some of our earlier coverage and take a stroll down memory lane. In March 2018, Trump claimed that the House Intelligence Committee had completely exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That wasn’t true. In June 2018, Trump said the Justice Department inspector general’s office had “totally” exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That was both wrong and kind of bonkers. In February 2019, Trump claimed that the Senate Intelligence Committee had also exonerated him in the Russia scandal. That also wasn’t true. In March 2019, Trump claimed the judge in a Paul Manafort trial exonerated him, too. That also wasn’t true. In June 2021, Trump claimed he’d been “totally exonerated” by testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn, which was largely the opposite of the truth. In February 2023, Trump insisted that a special grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia had rewarded him with “total exoneration.” That not only didn’t happen, that same special grand jury criminally indicted him soon after. In June 2023, Trump published an item to his social media platform, declaring that he’s been “totally exonerated” in the classified documents scandal that led to a federal indictment. That was also the opposite of the truth. In June 2024, Trump claimed to have been “exonerated“ for referencing the “very fine people” he saw protesting in Charlottesville. That wasn’t true, either. And in July 2024, pointed to “total exoneration” in the hush-money case, which didn't make any sense at all. There’s no great mystery as to the former president’s motivations. Trump has faced a series of controversies, each of which has caused political damage, and he’s been desperate to convince the public that he’s been cleared — in every instance — of any meaningful wrongdoing. But either Trump doesn’t know what “exonerated” means or he’s spent years trying to deceive the public about his culpability in a variety of serious scandals — or, more likely, both.

Bob Good’s Republican’s primary loss is certified in Virginia,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 6:28 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/bob-goods-republicans-primary-loss-certified-virginia-rcna160132,"In recent months, quite a few congressional Republicans have faced primary challenges, though in every instance, the GOP incumbents have prevailed. That is, except for Rep. Bob Good, whose apparent primary defeat in Virginia was certified by the state elections board yesterday. NBC News reported: Good, the chair of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, has already made clear that he will, in fact, pursue a recount. As for the larger context, in recent years, a variety of congressional Republican incumbents have come up short in primary races because they lost the backing of the GOP’s rabid far-right base. Good’s apparent defeat is something altogether different. As regular readers know, the GOP lawmaker dismissed the pandemic as a “phony“ crisis, championed a baseless impeachment crusade against President Joe Biden, and helped take the lead in pushing a debt ceiling crisis. The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank went so far to refer to Good as a “legislative terrorist.” There was, in other words, no reason for the party’s base to kick Good out. His allegiance to far-right orthodoxy has never been in doubt. So why is his congressional career coming to an apparent end? There are a few angles to this story that are worth keeping in mind. First, Good played a prominent role in ousting then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which generated some ill will within the party. Indeed, the Californian still has a political operation of sorts, and it was turned against the Virginian. Second, Good’s colleagues have come to see him as something of a joke: Even one of his Freedom Caucus colleagues recently conceded that Good is not a serious policymaker. Another GOP member predicted a few weeks ago, “The only Republican incumbent that loses this cycle is going to be Bob Good. And he won’t lose because of policy, but because of tactics and because his colleagues overwhelmingly do not trust or respect him.” But perhaps most importantly, the Virginia Republican endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Donald Trump in the GOP’s presidential primary — at which point some of his ostensible allies labeled him a “disloyal MAGA traitor.” It didn’t take long for Good to acknowledge his political difficulties, and in January, he endorsed Trump. The Virginian was also one of the many congressional Republicans to travel to the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse to show his support for the former president during his recent criminal trial. But Trump concluded that the gestures were “too late,” adding, “The damage had been done!” In late March, The Washington Post quoted John Fredericks, a conservative Virginia radio show host who’s been part of Trumpworld for years, who said Good’s fate was in the former president's hands. “If Trump endorses McGuire, McGuire is going to win,” Fredericks said. Two months later, Trump endorsed McGuire, who appears to have won. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Dems' Golden peddles misplaced optimism about Trump, democracy",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 5:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-golden-peddles-misplaced-optimism-trump-democracy-rcna160123,"With just a few days remaining before Election Day 2016, The Washington Post’s Kathleen Parker wrote a notorious column. “Calm down,” the headline read. “We’ll be fine no matter who wins.” Parker’s argument at the time was that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offered competing visions, but Americans who were concerned about the nation’s future had no reason to feel too much anxiety about the outcome of the competitive race. As Trump’s presidency unfolded, Parker’s misplaced optimism became infamous. The lesson for political observers seemed obvious: Don’t underestimate the amount of damage one radical and transgressive president can do in short order. It’s a lesson Democratic Rep. Jared Golden apparently did not learn. In fact, in an op-ed for the Bangor Daily News, the three-term Maine congressman not only predicts a Trump victory, he argues that there’s no reason to be overly concerned about the damage the Republican might do. The best-case scenario is that Golden knows better, but he wrote a strange op-ed in order to distance himself from his national party and align himself with his more conservative, rural constituents. The worst-case scenario is that Golden actually believes what he wrote. The Maine Democrat’s op-ed is worth reading in its entirety, if for no other reason than to marvel at the oddity of his claims. Amanda Carpenter did a fine job highlighting some of the congressman’s more glaring errors of judgment, and her online thread is definitely worth checking out. But I’m also curious what more Trump would have to do in order to cause Golden to feel some anxiety. For all intents and purposes, the presumptive Republican nominee isn’t just running against President Joe Biden, Trump is also running against democracy itself. We’re talking about a radical, twice-impeached felon who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings for federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump's ideological ambitions. Just as importantly, Republicans on the Supreme Court this week effectively told Trump that if he were to return to the Oval Office, he could take comfort in knowing that he’s above the law, leading a lawless presidency. To hear Golden tell it, the United States has endured before, so we should simply assume that the United States will continue to endure in the future. The problem with such misplaced optimism is that sometimes, countries face new and unique threats that are different and more serious than earlier challenges, and the result is unprecedented peril. For the Maine Democrat to simply shrug his shoulders with indifference is to wonder whether he’s paid close enough attention to current events and world history."
Why Michelle Obama’s polling lead over Trump (sort of) matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/michelle-obamas-polling-lead-trump-sort-matters-rcna160119,"It’s not exactly a secret that President Joe Biden’s re-election prospects have faltered in the wake of last week’s debate. Most of the latest polls show Donald Trump’s advantage growing; some Democrats have called on the incumbent president to end his 2024 candidacy; and others in Biden’s party have started distancing themselves from the presumptive Democratic nominee. With this in mind, it’s easy to understand why pollsters would start asking voters, not only about Biden-Trump match-ups, but also about what the presidential race would look like if the president weren’t at the top of the Democratic ticket in the fall. Over the last 24 hours, two national surveys — a Reuters/Ipsos poll and a CNN poll conducted by SSRS — found the former Republican president leading each of the Democrats whose names are often included in speculative chatter about the 2024 race. There was, however, one notable exception. From the Reuters report: At this point, let’s pause to acknowledge reality: There is literally no reason whatsoever to think the former first lady will run for public office, this year or any other. Michelle Obama has been categorical on this point on multiple occasions, across several election cycles. As recently as March of this year, in a statement to NBC News, the former first lady’s office tried to rein in imaginations, making it clear her 2024 plans don’t include running for office. “As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,” her communications director said. “Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign.” In other words, I have some advice for those ready to put a “Michelle Obama 2024” bumper-sticker on their car: Don’t bother. It’s a near-certainty that this candidacy will not happen. So if the former first lady simply isn’t interested, what difference does it make that she has a double-digit lead over the presumptive GOP nominee? If this is all in the realm of fantasy, why take note of polling related to a hypothetical contest that won’t happen? The answer has less to do with Michelle Obama and more to do with the Republican candidate she leads by 11 points. To hear Trump and his acolytes tell it, the former president isn’t just a candidate, he’s also the head of a powerful political movement. What’s more, as far as Republicans are concerned, Trump’s lead in the polls isn’t rooted in an anti-Democrat sentiment; it’s the result of an American electorate that loves the presumptive GOP nominee and is clamoring to vote for him. Perhaps, though in a match-up against the former first lady, Trump not only trails by double digits, he also fails to crack 40%. The point is, Michelle Obama’s polling lead suggests there’s a broad political appetite for someone other than the former president. The challenge for Democrats is presenting those voters with a ticket they’ll be excited about."
The Supreme Court has signed off on a Trump takeover of the DOJ,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-doj-rcna159968,"In the process of granting former President Donald Trump immunity for at least some of his actions between Election Day 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021, the Supreme Court’s sweeping decision also provided a stamp of approval for one of the most dangerous parts of Trump’s second-term agenda: payback. In doing so, the justices rolled back one of the key post-Watergate reforms preventing presidents from abusing their vast power, freeing Trump, if he’s re-elected, to use the Department of Justice as his personal weapon. The scheme Trump and his allies cooked up in 2020 involved enlisting the Justice Department to give their lies about widespread election fraud an official patina. Then-Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark drafted a letter to send to several states, including Georgia, that would falsely claim that “various irregularities” existed that cast those states’ election results into doubt. Had it been sent, the letter would have encouraged those state legislatures to convene special sessions to “investigate” and potentially send to Congress slates flipping the states’ Electoral College votes to Trump. When the acting attorney general refused to send the letter, Trump threatened to fire him and replace him with Clark. He yielded only when a slew of top Justice Department officials promised to resign in protest. Apparently, though, according to the Supreme Court, there was nothing about that chain of events that falls outside the scope of the president’s “official acts.” As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 6-3 opinion, “The President may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” The line seems innocuous compared to some of the other more dumbfounding statements within the decision, but the problem is that it’s written as though there was nothing wrong about the content of those discussions. A few paragraphs later, Roberts clarifies that sentence’s importance in explaining why the pressure campaign against Justice Department officials can’t be used to as part of the federal case against Trump: Putting those two ideas together effectively signs off on ending the last 50 years of Justice Department independence. The way then-President Richard Nixon and his attorney general, John Mitchell, used and abused the DOJ and other law enforcement bodies to shield Nixon’s allies and harass his enemies was one of the most damaging revelations of Watergate. Following Nixon’s resignation and Mitchell’s eventual prosecution and conviction, subsequent attorneys general have all strived to keep the White House at arm’s length from the day-to-day decisions regarding investigations. But there were few legislative reforms that safeguarded the Justice Department from being used as a political tool — it has almost entirely been the work of norms and precedents that have cut across administrations. Even Trump’s White House counsel Don McGahn issued a memo at the beginning of his term laying out the firewall between the White House staff and the Justice Department. It’s a standard that Trump’s allies, including Clark, have railed against, making no bones about the fact that, if given the chance, they intend to tear it down entirely. If that happens, there will be little to prevent Trump from launching his promised revenge campaign against his enemies. Given the leeway Roberts has granted for the president to order even “sham” investigations, anyone could be subject to arbitrary probes, prompting unnecessary (and expensive) legal defenses and social stigma. It’s not absurd to imagine this resulting in the arrest and detention on made-up charges for anyone on the long list of people who’ve earned Trump’s ire. Conversely, this ruling also seems on its face to allow a president to order an investigation to end for any reason. Under Roberts’ test, there would be no means for a court to assess, for example, whether Trump’s corruptly ordering that a GOP megadonor be beyond Justice Department scrutiny was a criminal violation of the law. Instead, the court’s conservatives have chosen to write this opinion from a worldview that assumes every “official act” taken by the president within his authority is legal and constitutional. Roberts attempted to give the illusion that opinion was written with anyone but Trump in mind, and in doing so, he obscured how far removed from the average president Trump is. What Roberts frames as a simple declaration of the president’s authorities under the Constitution is now poised to become Trump’s go-ahead to target the political opposition with impunity. Likewise, in granting presidents the broadest benefit of the doubt possible to “take care that the laws are faithfully executed,” the court has all but guaranteed that, if Trump is returned to power, he will do the exact opposite."
Joe Biden is getting the most important advice from the least qualified people,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 3, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-age-debate-2024-election-rcna159918,"After President Joe Biden’s catastrophic debate performance Thursday, a number of top Democratic donors are expressing anxiety to the White House, and many commentators — including the editorial board of The New York Times — have called for him to end his candidacy for the White House and allow another Democrat to replace him.  But those closest to the president disagree. Biden’s family has reportedly encouraged him to stay in the race. His aides have rallied behind him and are pushing back aggressively against questions about his physical and cognitive fitness for 2024. This pushback campaign at times has gone beyond firmly executed damage control and evolved into arrogant dismissals of a vital conversation. “The bedwetting brigade is calling for Joe Biden to ‘drop out,’” Robert Flaherty, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, wrote in a campaign email Sunday.  Biden’s inner circle seems more resolute than ever that he still has the juice. But their track record suggests that, at this crucial juncture, they are among the very last people who should be trusted to assess whether Biden should remain in the race.  Biden’s debate performance made it plainly obvious that the president has trouble communicating clearly and coherently; as he struggled to spar with Trump, he frequently spoke almost inaudibly, struggled to remember numbers and policy details and even failed to complete sentences at all. Biden’s behavior tracks with The Wall Street Journal’s reporting in June, based on several sources familiar with Biden meetings, that the president has shown notable lapses in memory and struggled to communicate his ideas. After the debate, Axios, citing current and former Biden aides, reported that Biden appears to have limited hours in the day during which he’s fully engaged. (NBC News has not independently confirmed these reports.)  Whatever the reality behind the scenes, Biden’s recent public appearances have shown a man greatly diminished by age in his ability to communicate — an utterly essential skill for any president. Ultimately his debate performance alone — a stunning decline from just four years ago — has been enough to rattle many people who have been supportive of the Biden presidency and would otherwise love to see him run for another term. It almost goes without saying that Biden’s family members — who are urging him to stay in the race — are poorly positioned to counsel the president on this matter. They of course have a deep personal attachment to Biden and, having seen him age for many years, may be too close to appreciate the full scope and scale of his decline. Like any family, they’re going to find it painful to admit that he has exhausted his ability to fulfill his vocation. They typically see him when he’s more relaxed; they aren’t sitting in on high-stakes negotiations with him. And of course they also have a personal interest in his remaining in the White House, because the presidency confers many unique advantages and opportunities upon a president’s family.  Biden’s inner circle of staffers may also be unusually prone to similar biases. To begin with, like any group of political aides, they have a natural incentive to try to keep the boss’ prospects afloat — and preserve their own power to steer the ship of state. But as The Atlantic’s Franklin Foer, author of a book on Biden’s first two years in office, points out, this dynamic is exacerbated by the fact that Biden’s top aides have all been with him for so long: Is it possible that some of them harbor private doubts or ambivalence about Biden’s competence? Of course. But in general the “familial” ties that define Biden’s team make it less likely they will confront Biden with hard conversations.  The people who are most likely to be able to move the needle are not in the White House but outside it. If Biden were to step down, it most likely would require former Democratic presidents, Democratic leaders in Congress and other top Democratic elites to come out in concert against Biden. These are players who are better positioned to put the interest of the party first and are less likely to be compromised by self-interest or emotional ties. So far, we’re very far from anything like that happening. Regardless of where you stand on the question of whether Biden should step down on a strategic level, it should be clear that he should be getting advice from those best qualified to offer it — and those closest to him do not fall in that category.

RFK Jr.’s response to allegations of sexual assault: ‘I am who I am’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-f-kennedy-sexual-assault-allegation-dog-vanity-fair-rcna160048,"On Tuesday, Vanity Fair published an explosive piece about independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that was rife with shocking details, including allegations that he sexually assaulted a babysitter he employed and that he may have eaten a dog. According to Vanity Fair’s reporting (which has not been verified by MSNBC), a woman named Eliza Cooney, who had been hired to babysit Kennedy’s children in 1998 when she was 23, alleged that he groped her or behaved inappropriately toward her on three occasions. Cooney told the publication that she wrote about the first incident in her diary at the time and that she had confided in her mother in 2017 during the height of the #MeToo movement. She said she had also told several of her friends about Kennedy’s alleged behavior last year, after he announced his run for president. Kennedy did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment on the allegations. But asked about the assault allegations in an interview on “Breaking Points,” a YouTube show, he said he would not respond to the details, adding that he had a “rambunctious youth.” (Kennedy was in his 40s when the incidents are alleged to have occurred.) “Listen, I’ve said this from the beginning: I am not a church boy,” he told the interviewer Tuesday. “I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I — I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they all vote, I could run for king of the world.” He said the magazine was “recycling 30-year-old stories,” adding: “I’m not going to comment on the details of any of them, but it’s — you know, I am who I am.” When asked point-blank whether he was denying Cooney’s allegations, Kennedy repeated that he was not going to comment. A number of sensational details about Kennedy’s past have come to light in recent months as his campaign seeks to make its mark in the 2024 election. In May, The New York Times reported that he had disclosed a number of medical issues in a deposition during his divorce from his second wife, including that doctors found a worm that had eaten part of his brain. In the interview Tuesday, Kennedy not only seemed to dismiss the allegation of sexual assault, but he also denied that he had eaten a barbecued dog. Vanity Fair reported that he sent his friend a photo last year suggesting that he had sampled dog meat. Kennedy reportedly told the friend, who was traveling to Asia, that he might like a restaurant in Korea that had dog on its menu. “The picture that they said is of me eating a dog is actually me eating a goat,” he insisted, “in Patagonia.”"
The Karen Read trial was fascinating. Get ready to do it all over again.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/karen-read-verdict-mistrial-rcna160037,"After five days of deliberations following a nine-week murder trial for Massachusetts woman Karen Read, a mistrial was declared and the jury was excused by the judge, Beverly Cannone. The jurors indicated that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on Read’s charges of second-degree murder of her boyfriend, John O’Keefe, vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene of an accident causing a fatality.  On two occasions since deliberations began, the jury notified the court that it was unable to find unanimity. The second time, which was just this past Monday, the jury’s letter stated that “the divergence in our views are not rooted in a lack of understanding or effort but deeply held convictions that each of us carry, ultimately leading to a point where consensus is unobtainable.” Upon receipt of this note, Judge Cannone read instructions to the jury to force them to continue to deliberate. Called “Tuey-Rodriguez instructions” in Massachusetts, these explained that the verdict must not be “merely an acquiescence in the conclusion of the other jurors,” and that the preference is to obtain a verdict. Despite these Tuey-Rodriguez instructions, the jury of six men and six women ultimately admitted that they were deadlocked on whether the prosecution had met its burden of proof to convict. The prosecution immediately announced that it intended to retry Read. Her defense team responded, “We will not stop fighting.” As I previously wrote, Read alleged that there was a conspiracy to cover up O’Keefe’s murder by his fellow law enforcement officers and the defense argued that the forensic evidence as explained by their experts corroborated this theory. During the trial, Read also pointed the finger at a possible suspect: an ATF agent with whom she had been exchanging flirtatious texts prior to O’Keefe’s death. Considering the prosecution’s intent to retry Read, the landscape of a second trial will be decidedly different, and more refined. There will be a transcript of that first trial, which will include the testimony from all of the witnesses, both fact and expert, legal arguments made in court by both sides, jury selection issues, and other nuances that are now officially the record of the first trial. This kind of insight into the entirety of the theories and themes on both sides of the case is priceless. As a trial lawyer, you want to be able not only to repeat the good, but to anticipate the bad/what didn’t work in the first iteration of the trial so you can avoid those pitfalls the second time around. Having that transcript and knowledge going into the second trial will expedite and enhance your trial prep considerably. The retrial may not happen quickly, though. According to a local CBS affiliate in Boston, the Norfolk Superior Court trial calendar is full and a second trial may not be scheduled for several months. A status hearing is teed up for July 22 and at that time, some clarity should be provided by the judge as to a new trial date.  Of course, the jury will be an entirely different group of people in the re-trial, meaning the dynamics will not be the same. And seating a jury might pose an issue: During the first trial, more than 400 potential jurors were called for jury duty. Only 17 people qualified to serve and 12 were ultimately selected. Seating jurors for high-profile cases can be difficult due to pre-trial publicity and a number of other challenges. Media coverage of Read’s trial, especially in the Boston area, has been extensive and will surely further narrow the potential jury pool for the second trial. Despite the prosecution’s hasty announcement of a retrial, these difficulties of securing a jury may end up factoring into the DA’s Office’s decision of how to approach the second trial. One especially noteworthy development since the mistrial announcement Monday is the fact that the case’s lead investigator, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, has now been “relieved of duty” and will be transferred out of the detective unit. This move is separate from an ongoing internal investigation into Proctor’s “serious misconduct.” During the trial, Proctor testified for the prosecution and was then cross-examined about inappropriate and crude texts about Read that he sent to friends, family and fellow law enforcement officers. These texts revealed that he called her several names, like “whack-job c---” and “re------,” mocked her medical conditions, and said to his supervisors that he did not find any nude photos of Read while searching her phone. He also texted his sister that he hoped Read would “kill herself” and revealed investigative details to friends and family on a text thread. Read’s defense highlighted Proctor’s egregious misconduct during the trial and alleged that Proctor planted evidence as a part of the cover-up conspiracy. Even the governor of Massachusetts said she was “disgusted” by Proctor’s conduct and that it could tarnish the integrity of law enforcement in her state. Proctor being relieved of duty will be a huge obstacle to the prosecution’s strategy in any retrial of Read. As the lead investigator on the case, this latest development will be an even bigger part of Read’s defense. After the mistrial was declared, one of the alternate jurors spoke with the media, stating that if she had deliberated, she would have found Read not guilty: “I believe the Commonwealth did not do their job to convince me beyond a reasonable doubt that Karen Read was guilty of the charges.” When asked about the influence of Proctor’s testimony on her feelings about the case, she responded: “Even if his testimony had not been included in this case, I still believe there would not have been enough.”  Given all we learned during the first trial, the prosecution should take a beat to decide whether retrying Karen Read actually makes sense. Sometimes, even if it seems like it doesn’t make sense, the prosecution will pursue another trial because they still believe that the facts and the evidence align with the charges and that it serves the interests of justice to do so — even if the verdict ends up being an acquittal. We shall soon see whether the prosecution rethinks its plan, or chooses to push forward with a new trial, challenges and all."

U.S., former White House counsel John Dean wrote that the court had “affirmed” the claim of Dean’s former boss, President Richard Nixon: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” As a member of the Watergate special prosecution team that brought Nixon to accountability, and won the Supreme Court’s U.S. v. Nixon ruling that the president is not above the law, I agree. And I add: Rest in peace, democracy and the rule of law. Monday’s 6-3 ruling creates an imperial presidency Nixon would have loved. The opinion means he would not have been forced to resign and would have served out his full term. His use of the Justice Department, CIA, FBI and his White House and campaign staffs as part of a conspiracy to obstruct justice through perjury, hush money and other crimes — all to cover up his role and theirs in a criminal break-in while he was in office — would no longer be a crime. Worse, Monday’s ruling means that former President Donald Trump cannot be held fully accountable now, and maybe ever, for using his presidential powers in a conspiracy to attempt to overturn a free and fair election. True, the court does withhold immunity for a president’s purely personal, unofficial conduct while in office. It does not immunize him for conduct before or after he was in office. But it does grant absolute immunity for one category of conduct and presumptive immunity for another category. It requires the prosecution to rebut the presumption of immunity before the charges can be tried by a jury, and it limits the evidence the prosecution can use to do that. The court grants absolute immunity to conduct it says falls within the president’s “core” constitutional responsibilities. That severely limits what the court held 50 years ago in U.S. v. Nixon, and is unlike anything in our history. That case held a president is not above the law and must be treated as any other citizen. Yet on Monday, the current Supreme Court tossed that reasoning out the window. Instead, the Trump decision created a subjective standard vulnerable to the court’s whims and ideologies. It held that “Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.” It did so even though those discussions concerned sending letters to states falsely claiming fraud in the 2020 election and urging them to overturn the results. It did so even though special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment lays out how those conversations were part of an overall conspiracy to obstruct a peaceful transfer of power, conduct that was intended to and would have denied all citizens’ votes being counted. The court did not categorize the other acts alleged in the Jan. 6 special counsel’s indictment, such as the fraudulent slates of electors, as part of the president’s core powers. But the majority declares those actions “at least” presumptively immune, and that the prosecution must rebut that presumption.   Common sense tells us all these actions were clearly the acts of a candidate, not legitimate uses of presidential authority. If this conspiracy is an “official” act, what isn’t? If the Supreme Court can conclude that Trump’s alleged pressuring of the Justice Department is immune, why don’t they also say whether Trump’s calls to Georgia’s secretary of state or his pressuring of Vice President Mike Pence and others are also immune? Why is it necessary to hand the issue to the lower courts when those acts seem to almost everyone definitively unofficial and prosecutable? These should not be open questions. If former President Trump gets a second term, he and his administration will feel safe in acting with abandon. There will be no guardrails. A maliciously inclined president will not be constrained by the possibility that a future court might consider his conduct unofficial. Nixon would be delighted. This court seems to have found a way to interpret the law and facts here to support the concept espoused by Nixon and his top aides that the ends justify the means and if the president does it, it is not illegal. Worse yet, unlike the opinion in U.S. v Nixon, the court hobbles the prosecutor by limiting the evidence that can be used to rebut the presumption of immunity at a hearing on what allegations remain for trial, as well as limiting the evidence that can be used at trial. That ruling is a gift to Trump’s defense and wholly unnecessary. Federal Rules of Evidence 403 would allow the trial court to make that determination in context of whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial harm. Monday’s ruling makes it harder to prosecute the most overt of actions even after the prosecution successfully rebuts the presumption of immunity. Finally, Monday’s ruling denies voters a timely ruling on the charges against Trump. Any decision on classifying an act will be appealed to the Circuit Court and then back up to the Supreme Court, leading to delay, delay, delay. The result is, to borrow from Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent, “immune, immune, immune.” As Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson wrote in her dissent, the majority opinion is a “five alarm fire.”  Once again the conservative justices, who claim to be originalists and textualists, blatantly ignore what our Founders said. “The President of the United States,” Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist No. 69, “would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.” But the majority has discarded such guidance, because it does not serve their purpose here. Earlier this year, Justice Sotomayor admitted that “there are days that I’ve come to my office … and closed my door and cried. There have been those days. And there are likely to be more.” No one would begrudge her if Monday was one of “those days.” As Sotomayor concluded her powerful rebuttal to the majority, “with fear for our democracy, I dissent.” And so should we all."
"With immunity, another Trump administration would be a surveillance nightmare",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 2:58 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/presidential-immunity-trump-surveillance-civil-rights-rcna160062,"Happy Tuesday. Here's your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week's top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. The frightening consequences of Monday’s conservative Supreme Court decision granting Donald Trump and future presidents partial immunity for crimes committed as part of “official acts” are far-reaching. My first thought was about how this ruling concerning Trump’s assault on our democratic system appears to have legalized similar attacks in the future.  My second thought — and one I’d love to see more discussion about — concerns the potential surveillance implications. University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq is one of the few sources I’ve seen discussing this. He’s quoted in Politico saying the ruling “licenses the misuse of … the surveillance and intrusive powers of the national security state.” Over the past couple of years here on the ReidOut Blog, I’ve been writing about emerging technologies and their potential uses by bad actors who could deploy them to infringe on civil rights — everything from geofence warrants and other tools that can track potential abortion-seekers to robot police dogs that can surveil and attack at a moment’s notice.  Presidents have already been given broad latitude to snoop on Americans without the new concept of presidential immunity that conservatives on the Supreme Court just invented. If Trump is elected in November and conservatives execute their plan to pack the government with pro-Trump loyalists, he will be armed with the most powerful surveillance technologies ever invented. It’s easy to see his Department of Justice devising purportedly “official” reasons to use them with impunity.  Here are some other stories I've had on my mind: OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot, two generative AI chatbots frequently used to surface information from the internet, were found to have fed their users right-wing propaganda about CNN’s debate setup last week. It’s yet another example of generative AI tools like ChatGPT being used to spread misinformation or propaganda.  Read more at NBC News.

New campaign ad ties Matt Gaetz to a convicted sex offender,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 2:28 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/matt-gaetz-florida-ad-greenberg-mccarthy-rcna159990,"A new political ad on Florida airwaves is targeting Rep. Matt Gaetz over his ties to a convicted sex offender. The ad — a boon for the Florida Republican’s primary challenger, Aaron Dimmock — might just be the latest chess move in Kevin McCarthy’s revenge tour, which has sought to oust the GOP lawmakers who voted to remove him as House speaker last year. The spot is funded by an organization called Florida Patriots PAC, which bears resemblance to similarly named PACs that were used to target other McCarthy foes during primary races in South Carolina and Virginia. The revenge tour sputtered out of the gate last month, as McCarthy’s pick in South Carolina failed to oust Rep. Nancy Mace in her primary. And in Virginia, a McCarthy-backed candidate is leading Rep. Bob Good in his primary, but only after former President Donald Trump bashed Good and also endorsed the challenger. Gaetz won his primary comfortably in 2022, so ousting him seems like an uphill climb. But the ad targeting him (which you can watch here) is cutting, without question. It highlights Gaetz’s “close friendship” with Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax official who pleaded guilty to several federal charges in 2021, including child sex trafficking. Gaetz once referred to Greenberg as his “wingman.” Greenberg cooperated with a federal sex trafficking probe into Gaetz that ultimately resulted in no charges being brought against the House Republican. Greenberg reportedly has cooperated with the House Ethics Committee’s probe into Gaetz as well. Two weeks ago, the committee said in a news release that it was reviewing allegations that the Florida representative may have “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.” McCarthy has argued that Gaetz fueled the effort to oust him after the then-speaker declined to interfere in the ethics probe. During an event at Georgetown University in April, McCarthy claimed that he was no longer speaker because “one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old, an ethics complaint that started before I ever became speaker. And that’s illegal, and I’m not going to get in the middle. Did he do it or not? I don’t know.” It was a clear reference to Gaetz, who has denied the allegation and any wrongdoing. And now this new ad is continuing to hit him on the same front."
Judge postpones Trump's sentencing hearing after Supreme Court immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 11:54 AM PDT / Updated July 2, 2024, 2:01 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-sentencing-delayed-hush-money-supreme-court-rcna159969,"A judge on Tuesday postponed Donald Trump’s sentencing in his New York hush money case as the former president seeks to have his conviction overturned following a Supreme Court ruling that granted him some immunity in a separate criminal case. In a letter on Tuesday afternoon, Judge Juan Merchan said he would resolve Trump's motion to set aside the verdict on Sept. 6 and postponed his sentencing, ""if such is still necessary,"" until Sept. 18. Trump's lawyers launched their effort to get the verdict tossed out just hours after the Supreme Court's Monday ruling, which said Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for some official acts in his federal election interference case in Washington. Trump’s lawyers argued on Monday that Manhattan prosecutors built their case in part based on evidence from Trump’s time in office, as The New York Times pointed out. Such evidence, they claimed, is therefore inadmissible. The Manhattan district attorney's office said Tuesday that it doesn't oppose a delay in sentencing while the court works through Trump's motion. Trump’s New York case was likely the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial before the November election. He had been due for sentencing on July 11, four days before he is expected to be nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. Instead, Merchan has now set up a scenario in which Trump's guilty verdict might be tossed just two months before the November election.  How the judge might rule on the defense's motion is unclear. Trump's hush money conviction is largely centered on acts that he took as a presidential candidate, not as president. The presumptive GOP nominee cheered the postponement of his sentencing hearing on Tuesday. In a post on Truth Social, he falsely declared it a “total exoneration."""
How the Supreme Court broke its own most important rule,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT / Updated July 2, 2024, 12:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-immunity-decision-john-roberts-rcna159884,"The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that former President Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for official acts made while president. This partial immunity decision — presidents do not enjoy absolute immunity for unofficial actions taken while in office — is a stunning example of institutional hubris and reckless judicial activism. Instead of deciding specifically whether special counsel Jack Smith’s election interference criminal indictment against Trump is negated by presidential immunity, the court acknowledged a broader purpose. As majority author Chief Judge John Roberts pontificated: “[W]e cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on the present exigencies.” In plain English, the court refused to answer the question at the heart of Trump’s indictment, instead returning the case to the district court for further wrangling and debate. That’s a far cry from Roberts’ statement in his Senate confirmation hearing comparing his role to that of an umpire calling balls and strikes. The point of Roberts’ analogy was that justices don’t make rules, they are simply arbiters. But in this case, the court ignored the time-tested principle of judicial restraint. Instead, the court expanded the case’s scope beyond what either party had proposed. On the other hand, we already knew this was likely going to be the outcome. When the court converted Trump’s motion for a stay into a petition for certiorari, the justices drafted an overly broad question to decide, writing: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” During the oral argument on April 25, Trump’s lawyer D. John Sauer acknowledged that the court had “expanded the question presented from what either of the parties submitted to discuss here.” This expansion directly led to the court’s inconclusive holding that a former president may be immune for some actions and not for others. In addition to prolonging the delay in Trump’s D.C. federal trial, the opinion now pushes the case back to Judge Tanya Chutkan. If the district court rules again that Trump is not immune, his lawyers will appeal again. And the seemingly endless loop of legal delays will continue. The court’s self-important drive to announce an all-encompassing principle was underscored by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh during oral argument.  The issue before the court was bigger than just one case, Alito intoned, because “whatever we decide is going to apply to all future presidents.” When Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben referred to the specific allegations of Trump’s case, Alito doubled down, saying, “As I said, this case will have effects that go far beyond this particular prosecution.” Gorsuch appeared to be coming from the same viewpoint, stating, “I’m not concerned about this case so much as future ones too.” And Kavanaugh, in dialogue with the Justice Department lawyer, said, “As you have indicated, this case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency for the future of the country, in my view.”  But deciding the scope of any potential presidential immunity in circumstances different from those alleged in Trump’s indictment was not part of this case. The court can and should be deciding constitutional questions using the specific facts presented to them. For example, in its 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling shutting down the Florida recount of votes and, practically, giving the presidential election to George Bush, the court wrote: “Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.” Earlier in Roberts’ tenure as chief justice, according to a Congressional Research Service 2014 report, the Supreme Court in a “host of recent cases” employed rules “to avoid having the Supreme Court issue broad rulings on the Constitution.” That report recounted Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein’s advice that “in deciding cases, judges should say no more than necessary to justify an outcome and leave as much as possible undecided.”   The court knows how to decide an appeal on narrow grounds, leaving further issues for a future case. Last month, the court in Chiaverini v. City of Napoleon, Ohio, upheld the legal validity of an arrestee’s Fourth Amendment constitutional claim, but Justice Elena Kagan wrote, “we leave for another day” how that rule would be applied at trial. It chose not to adhere to this principle in Trump’s case, to the detriment of both the law and American democracy. Not only did the majority sabotage the timely prosecution of Trump for his alleged role in attempting to stay in power after he lost the 2020 election, but it also revealed the court’s own sense of its self-importance."
The Supreme Court just gave Trump some very bad news,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 12:35 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/supreme-court-trump-backfire-january-6th-rcna159943,"There was very bad news for Donald Trump in Monday’s Supreme Court decision, and arguably even worse news for candidate Trump. That’s because Mike Pence is going to walk into a federal courtroom, raise his right hand, take an oath to tell the truth, and testify against Trump in this case in September for an evidentiary hearing. What Monday’s decision did was give Trump absolute immunity applying to one paragraph of the indictment. The rest of the indictment goes back to Judge Tanya Chutkan’s courtroom, where the Supreme Court has ordered her to have a hearing about the evidence in the case to determine whether Trump’s actions were “official acts,” meaning they may be protected by immunity, or not. That goes for everything in the case, except for one conversation that Trump had with the acting attorney general. In this hearing, basically there’ll be some briefs on each side. And then the judge will schedule a day and say, “OK, we start today, Mr. Smith. Who’s your first witness?” It’s exactly like a prosecution. Sometimes, pretrial, in the evidentiary process, prosecutors don’t want to turn over all their cards. But Jack Smith is going to have to turn over every single one of them. Because the Supreme Court has said to him, in effect, ""We need to see every single one of your cards."" So every witness he has, he’s going to bring them into that courtroom. They’re all going to be under oath and the defense is going to be able to cross-examine them. The defense probably won’t bring in any witnesses at all. So you’re going to see this incredible Jan. 6 hearing on steroids possibly for six to eight weeks in September to October. This is an adapted excerpt from MSNBC's special coverage of the presidential immunity Supreme Court ruling on July 1."

U.S. At issue was whether the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding could be applied to Capitol rioters in the wake of their actions on January 6th. Despite the ruling in favor of the defendant, their guest Ryan Goodman of Just Security confirms the limited impact this decision will have on those charged for their role in the chaos of January 6th, and for Donald Trump’s election interference case in DC. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome back to Prosecuting Donald Trump. It’s Tuesday, July 2nd and I’m Andrew Weissman, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Mary McCord: Good morning, Andrew. Seems like I just was on with you. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, well, guess what? That’s because we were. Mary McCord: Oh, we were! Okay. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, so this is going to be an episode where we talk to another NYU colleague, Ryan Goodman. And we’ll turn to that in a moment. I know that you just heard from us talking about the immunity decision. There are a couple of things we wanted to flag before we talk with Ryan about the case that came out. It feels like a year ago, but was just last week, which is the Fischer decision. But there are some things we wanted to flag in connection with the immunity decision. So, Mary, do you want to start us off on that? Mary McCord: Sure, because yesterday after we recorded, more things happened. Surprise, surprise. One of which is that Donald Trump, through his attorneys, sent a letter to Judge Merchan, that is the judge in the Manhattan trial for which he was found guilty a month ago, I don’t know, time is impossible now, of multiple felonies related to his payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels to keep her from talking about things that would have affected the election back in 2016. So as we await his sentencing, which is scheduled for next week, July 11th, as soon as this immunity decision came out, Mr. Trump’s attorney sent a letter to Judge Merchan asking permission to file a motion to set aside the verdict on the grounds that he is immune from that prosecution. Now, again, we have not seen this letter. This was reported by the “New York Times,” and we have not seen the substantive motion yet. Right now he’s saying, put off my sentencing. Let me file a motion to set aside these verdicts because I can’t be prosecuted because I’m immune. Now, Andrew, I don’t know about you, but if my recollection of us covering that trial every single day by reading the transcripts, or you in many cases going to it and us discussing it on the podcast twice a week, my recollection is that the payments to Stormy Daniels occurred before Mr. Trump was in the White House, and it’s kind of hard to imagine how reimbursement for those payments could be official acts. But what do you think? Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I think that if you’re the defense lawyer, you’re going to make this motion. Mary McCord: Of course. Andrew Weissmann: You should. You know, if there’s a 1% chance, you make it. There’s no question that the conduct at issue is unofficial. Yes, there is conduct that occurred while Donald Trump was president. There’s conduct that occurred before he was president that forms the basis of the scheme that was charged and for which he was convicted. But there was conduct while he was president, for instance, the reimbursements. Mary McCord: The signing of the checks. Andrew Weissmann: Many of those were signed in the Oval Office. But obviously, that reimbursement of payments to Stormy Daniels is the most quintessential personal material. However, this is where the Supreme Court immunity decision is particularly egregious because there’s a 5-4 split, not 6-3, 5-4 split on once something is considered an official act, it cannot be used, according to the majority in court and -- Mary McCord: As evidence. Andrew Weissmann: As evidence. And so the argument is going to be made that certain tweets, certain testimony about things that Donald Trump did while he was president constitute official acts and so that should be kept out. Mary McCord: So let’s break that down for a second, though, to make sure. So the case was about the payment, creating false business records to cover up these payments. The payments, of course, to Stormy Daniels were made before Mr. Trump was president. But as you just indicated, at trial, there was also evidence elicited that Mr. Trump signed checks reimbursing Michael Cohen, remember, falsely claiming this was for legal services by paying monthly payments over the course of basically his first year as president. So this means that evidence came in of things he did while he was in the Oval Office doesn’t necessarily mean those are official acts because just being in the Oval Office doesn’t make him an official act. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: So there will be an argument about that. But then there were other things that happened that came into evidence while he was president, including, as you just indicated, some of his social media posts kind of talking about this, right. Again, I think most of us would be like, you’re talking about a personal thing, not official act. But there’s something we’re in analysis his attorneys will argue has to happen. And then there was Hope Hicks, for example, as well as Madeleine. Help me out here, Wester -- Andrew Weissmann: Westerhout. Mary McCord: Westerhout. Andrew Weissmann: Westerhout. Mary McCord: Yes, who worked in the White House, who also testified about what they knew of this issue that I’m sure his attorneys will argue those are official acts. So before we get to the point of none of that can be admitted into evidence, we’ve got to determine if those are even official acts, right? Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. As well as so much of that, I think, will be viewed as not official. Second, even if it’s viewed as official, for instance, sending out a tweet, they’ll say, well, that’s part of my official acts is being president, is communicating with the citizenry that if it’s public and in the public domain, the idea that you can’t use it. And that’s actually even flagged in a footnote as something that should be allowed. Mary McCord: By the chief -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. Mary McCord: -- by the chief justice who wrote the majority opinion. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Because it’s like, how could that possibly in any way affect the functioning of the presidency in any sort of meaningful way? So, again, there’ll be arguments on this. The third issue is that the whole issue of immunity, there’s a really good argument that it was waived, that both the trial judge, Judge Merchan, but also when Donald Trump was trying to remove this case to federal court, the federal judge who handled the case said that the issue was waived. So then finally, by the way, even if Donald Trump were to win all of this, that it’s official, it should be kept out, it wasn’t waived, it also then has to be material. Meaning if you keep out something that is a grain of sand on the beach, the judge can say this wouldn’t have changed the result in any way. You’re entitled to a constitutionally valid trial. You’re not entitled to a perfect trial. And sometimes evidence is let in that shouldn’t have been, but it has to be material. Mary McCord: Right. That’s called harmless air, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. There can’t be something that’s just so extraneous that you say it has an effect on the result and the judge can say, no, it’s too minor. So there are lots and lots of arguments. We’re really just flagging the issue. Some of the things that Mary, you and I are talking about, we’ll wait and see sort of how it gets -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- played out. I have to say, I don’t fault the defense for raising it. I mean, it was kind of like a gift given to them by the majority that was shocking, given that Chief Justice Roberts in the oral argument of the immunity case was on the side of Amy Coney Barrett, that this should be allowed into evidence, that they sort of, as we talked about yesterday, that he really flipped. And so I understand why the defense is making this argument, but this is one of the, you know, I’d love to say unintended consequences, but I think I’m going to say intended consequences -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- is that you have this motion now. Mary McCord: Yeah. So the other thing that we wanted to flag is not something actually new that developed after our podcast yesterday, but something we just didn’t get a chance to talk about. And that was the Thomas concurrence. So Justice Thomas, not surprisingly, agreed with the majority in terms of their substantive ruling about immunity. But he wrote separately, and it’s fairly short, to say essentially that he also thinks that Jack Smith was not constitutionally appointed. And this is the argument that we have talked about recently when we’ve talked about some of the motions to dismiss pending before Judge Cannon. In fact, the motion that was argued, I guess, a week ago Friday, if I’m getting my dates right, where Mr. Trump and his attorneys had argued that Jack Smith was not constitutionally appointed under the appointments clause. And they also made a separate argument that he wasn’t funded appropriately under the appropriations clause. Justice Thomas here, somewhat gratuitously, in my opinion, because, of course, this was not at all part of the briefing or argument or question presented or question accepted by the completely separate. Yes? Andrew Weissmann: Mary, could we take out the word somewhat? Mary McCord: Yeah. Okay, because yes, because as you can tell, I’m being triggered here. I’m on trigger avenue. Let’s write about something totally not briefed. Yes. You know, it says, look, the appointments clause says that appointments have to be provided for either in the Constitution or be established by law appointments for people with the kind of authority that he thinks Jack Smith has. He says it’s difficult to see how the special counsel has an office established by law as required by the Constitution. And if Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the executive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fill that office. Given that the special counsel purports to wield the executive branch’s power to prosecute, the consequences are weighty. So he weighs in on something completely different to say Jack Smith’s appointment is unconstitutional. And in my opinion, this is almost like trying to lay a road map for Judge Cannon, who still has this motion pending before her. I kind of hate saying that, actually, but I doubt she’s listening to our podcast. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, notably what he’s put out there and in this gratuitous fashion. And by the way, you’re really supposed to address issues that are presented, not these other issues that are not brief. That’s just a straightforward proposition that all courts are supposed to follow. But what he’s saying would actually apply to other special counsels. So right now, David Weiss is a special counsel who is prosecuting Hunter Biden, I didn’t see that. Mary McCord: No, I didn’t see that in here. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, can you tell me, did you see Justice Thomas talk about how David Weiss shouldn’t be appointed? Yeah. Mary McCord: No. I’m looking. I’m scanning. I’m skimming. I’m scanning. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: I’m not seeing it. Andrew Weissmann: You’re not seeing any reference to that? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: What about Rob Hur? Did you see a reference to Rob Hur with that? Mary McCord: Not seeing that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, you know. Mary McCord: And I should say, I mean, just to correct myself, he doesn’t say is unconstitutional. He says there are serious questions whether the attorney general has violated the constitutional structure by creating this office. So I’m sure that’s the wiggle room he’s leaving for some of those other special counsels. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, that’s great. Mary, let’s preview. We’re about to have Ryan Goodman come on to talk to us about the Fischer case that happened a year ago, which means Friday. Mary McCord: Friday. Andrew Weissmann: So, can you remind us what the Fischer case is, and then we’ll get more into a deep dive with Ryan. Mary McCord: Sure. Fischer is one of the thousands of folks who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, more than 1,400 of whom have been prosecuted. He was -- Andrew Weissmann: Alleged. Alleged. Mary McCord: Alleged. Alleged. Andrew Weissmann: Because he hasn’t gone to trial yet. Mary McCord: That’s right. He has not. He was charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, as well as many other offenses, including assaulting law enforcement officers. He’s not yet been to trial. He challenged the government’s use of that obstruction charged against him. That is the issue that went up to the Supreme Court. That is the issue that the Supreme Court decided on Friday. It obviously has implications for other cases of the rioters and how they’ve been charged. It has implications, although I think almost none for Mr. Trump. And we’re going to dive into all of that after the break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, we are very pleased to have join us today, Ryan Goodman. Ryan is the founding co-editor-in-chief of Just Security. He is a law professor and co-director of the Reese Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law. You’ll see a theme here. Two days in a row, two NYU professors joining us. And he served as special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense from 2015 to 2016. So good to have you here with us this morning, Ryan. Ryan Goodman: Thanks so much for the invitation to be here with you guys. Andrew Weissmann: So Ryan and I teach national security law at NYU. And Ryan, I thought maybe -- Mary McCord: And I’ve actually guest taught with you, so there you go. Andrew Weissmann: Every year. Mary McCord: We just get the band back together. Andrew Weissmann: And I think I’ve told this story, but it hasn’t been told in a long time. And since we’re at the point where I only have so many anecdotes, even at my age. But when Mary teaches, my favorite student reaction was the week after Mary came and taught, a student came up to me and said, you know, I figured out what I want to do with the rest of my life. And I was like, okay, that’s pretty impressive. I mean, you know, this is a law student. So they’re really just beginning in their career. And I said, so what? What are you thinking of? And she said, I decided I want to be Mary McCord. Mary McCord: No, she doesn’t. Very flattering, but no. Andrew Weissmann: So Ryan, I thought maybe the first thing is one of the things that Mary said when she was introducing you was to talk about your being the co-editor in chief at something called Just Security. And we’re going to be talking about a piece that you were the primary author that I will say Mary and I -- Mary McCord: Kind of hung on, yeah, right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and yeah, we flagged minor issues, but it was your brainchild. But before we do that, do you want to just talk about what exactly is Just Security? And even though we’ll in the show notes have a link to the particular article that we’re going to talk about, there’s so much more on Just Security. So I thought maybe we’d first just talk about what is it? Ryan Goodman: Thanks so much and also thank you for being equal partners on our joint project. But so Just Security is an online forum, like a publication or magazine that one might think of that’s just purely online based here at NYU School of Law. And it primarily brings top level legal experts, but also policy experts to address issues at the intersection of security, rights, democracy, rule of law. And I think one of the things that we do, we do multiple things, but one of the things that we do quite well is by having those experts weigh in on tippy top pressing issues and to be able to do it at a rapid reaction. And then otherwise deep dives and highly researched pieces like the one we’ll be discussing today that is able to parse data in the ways that scholars and experts generally do. Andrew Weissmann: So the other thing I note that you do, Ryan, is that Just Security has a podcast. So we’ll plug that on our podcast. It’s really terrific. And it’s a very good companion piece to the articles that you put out. And it’s a different forum and format to be able to access them. So, Ryan, tell us what you were thinking of when you had the idea of doing this piece, because a lot of the work was while the Fischer case was pending, sort of how you saw the piece and how it related to the Fischer arguments and what you were trying to accomplish. Ryan Goodman: Sure. So tracking very closely all of the Department of Justice’s January 6 cases, of which there were over 1,400 individuals charged, the one issue that came all the way to the Supreme Court is this issue of whether or not individuals could be charged in a particular obstruction statute. And a lot seemed to hang in the balance, because at one point it even seemed to be the modal category, the number one charge that was being brought that individuals had engaged in obstructing the congressional proceedings. So it seems very high stakes. And that was the general understanding, I think, of most experts, myself included, I should even put it that way, when this came to the Supreme Court. So if the Supreme Court invalidated the Justice Department’s use of the statute and the ways in which they had employed it in these cases, it looked like a large portion of all of the Justice Department’s work could go away. And the question in my mind was, what would the reaction to that be? Because you could see the train coming. That seemed to be the direction the Supreme Court was going to take. And what would be the reaction? How might that feed into a lot of disinformation? And what could we anticipate ahead of time to preempt and ward off that disinformation? Like the way in which you could easily imagine something like that coming out of the Supreme Court could be deployed in a disinformation environment to make big arguments about, oh, see that? There’s the weaponization of the Department of Justice. See that? It’s all over-criminalization of politics. They’ve used a statute that’s completely invalid. It’s overreach. And so it was based on that that I thought, let’s do a deep dive into the project to see really how the department has used the statute. How many cases does this really affect and the like? Mary McCord: So before we get into that analysis, let’s make sure all listeners are understanding what statute we’re talking about. This is a statute that is, the actual citation to it is 18 United States Code §1512(c). And it has two parts, a part 1, (c)1, and a part 2, (c)2. Under (c)1, it is unlawful to alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal a record, document, or other object with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding. That is not the statute that the Department of Justice charged in most of these cases against those who attacked the Capitol on January 6. (c)2, however, prohibits otherwise, and that is a quote, otherwise obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding. So the government’s theory was that by violently attacking the Capitol and prohibiting Congress through that attack from engaging in the joint session on January 6, as required by law to count the Electoral College votes, those attackers were otherwise obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding. So that’s the issue that went to the Supreme Court. 14 out of 15 district court judges appointed by presidents, both Republican and Democratic, had said, yes, that otherwise clause, (c)2, applies to this type of conduct. One judge had said, no, I feel like because of (c)1, it needs to have something to do with impairing the integrity or availability of some sort of evidence. That’s the issue. And I should also say in the D.C. Circuit, the D.C. Circuit panel, a three-judge panel, agreed with the 14 judges and not with the one that this statute could apply to the conduct of the rioters with one dissenter. That’s the issue went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ended up ruling in a six-to-three decision, but the six-to-three is not the ideological split we’ve become accustomed to. We can talk about that. The (c)2 is informed by (c)1, so it’s not otherwise meaning in every other means possible, but that it has to be tethered to (c)1. However, it gave an expansive, to our minds, I think, Ryan and Andrew, an expansive reading of (c)2, saying that it encompasses more than obviously just altering a document record or other object, because that’s in (c)1, but it encompasses creating false evidence as well as impairing the availability or integrity of other things used in an official proceeding, and this is important, beyond records, documents or other objects, including witness testimony or intangible information. So that’s where we are on the law. Andrew Weissmann: So what’s really interesting about that is it was quite expansive in terms of, well, it does tether it (c)2 to (c)1. It basically says anything having to do with evidence. And evidence can be tangible, it can be intangible, it can be documents, it can be witnesses. Mary McCord: It can be information. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Now, what it doesn’t include is if you are just attacking the Capitol to obstruct the proceeding, but you’re not in any way, there’s no intent to affect information going to the proceeding. You’re not trying to destroy documents, alter the testimony of somebody, keep information from somebody. In other words, that’s not part of your intent or even effect. That would be carved out. But there is this ability within a fairly, I thought, expansive view. In other words, it could have been worse, is what I would say. Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: The other thing I just wanted to say about the 14 to 1, which I’m going to ask Ryan about that, but the interesting thing about the 14 to 1 at the district court level with 14 judges saying that the government was right and one judge saying, no, I think (c)2 should be cabined more closely to (c)1, is that three of the 14 judges were nominated by Donald Trump. So especially since we’ve talked so much about Judge Cannon and who appoints who, this is a case where, as you said, Mary, it’s not just Republican and Democratic, but even judges who are appointed by Donald Trump looked at this and said, this is a permissible use. And I think that just goes a long way, that hard data goes a long way to dispel this idea that this is the Department of Justice doing something novel that was politically motivated and outside the box, because you really don’t have that just in terms of how the district courts ruled on this. Ryan Goodman: Right. And just to add in a couple other data points on that, in addition to the three Trump appointed judges at the district level, there’s also a Reagan and George W. Bush appointees in the 14. And something that I have not seen remarked on publicly, when we’re talking about the question of was this a political use of the statute, what people miss is it is not the Biden Justice Department that is first to use the statute in this way. It is the Trump Justice Department before January 20th, 2021. The first charges that they bring include the very statute used for these kinds of conduct. So it’s actually it crosses over both administrations as well. Mary McCord: And that’s right, because people, I think, sometimes forget, right, January 6th obviously happened two weeks, almost two weeks before the inauguration and then transition. And there were multiple cases brought quickly in those couple of weeks. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, that’s what happens when you commit crimes in front of law enforcement, you would think. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, Ryan, turning back to the project in terms of you were saying that you wanted to sort of do this deep dive to sort of test out what would the effects be. So tell us what you did and what your statistics found and sort of how you, to use the crazy word, bucketized the groups. Ryan Goodman: Yeah. So NPR has a database of all of the January 6th defendants and they track it very closely. They update it every week. So that includes what are individuals charged for? What have they been convicted of? Did they plead guilty? Did they plead guilty to which charges? So we were already in conversation with NPR about their database, which we’re using for another big project. And along came the Supreme Court oral argument and then the decision was about to be handed down. And we went into the NPR database, thanks to their extraordinarily diligent work, to collect all of the cases that have been used for this charge. And it started to produce a very dramatic effect. So basically the idea is that the invalidation of this particular use of the statute for capital rioters does not affect that many cases. It’s actually very small. The way that the mainstream media had been covering it before the Supreme Court’s opinion is to say there are a huge number of cases, basically 350 people have been charged with this crime. Andrew Weissmann: So that’s about a quarter of the people. Ryan Goodman: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. Ryan Goodman: So that’s a quarter. That’s a sizable number of the January 6th defendants. Well, what that misses is, for example, individuals that are not affected whatsoever by the Supreme Court opinion. A good quarter of that quarter are individuals who, yes, they were charged for this obstruction statute, 1512 (c)2, but they pled to other crimes and not to the 1512 (c)2. Mary McCord: Right. Ryan Goodman: So their sentences, their pleadings, everything remains completely intact. That’s one part of it. That already whittles it down quite a lot. The other part is -- Mary McCord: And we should also remind people, I mean, we said a quarter, but let’s just put the big number out there, right? More than 1400 people have been charged. So when we’re at 350 a quarter, I mean, that’s already a huge number of people who were never even charged. Now you’re saying about a quarter of that quarter pled guilty to something else, has been sentenced, no impact. Andrew Weissmann: Three quarters for whom this is just entirely irrelevant because there’s not a 1512 (c)2 charge. Then of the 340 or so, a quarter of that, they pled to something completely unrelated. Ryan Goodman: Correct. So they’re completely unaffected. And then the next question is how many people are still materially unaffected? So there’s a majority of the individuals charged with this crime. If they were convicted, either based on a plea deal or by trial, super majority of them were convicted for other felonies as well. So there’s other felonies stay. And then thanks to y’all’s analysis from the vast experience that the two of you have, we also then analyze the database to show and to make the point that in the recharging of these individuals, so it might now go back for recharging, the judges can still use the underlying bad conduct, even though it’s no longer charged, because that would still be a legitimate part of the sentencing guidelines for the judges to determine what the sentence should be. So other ways in which it still remains highly relevant, the conduct of entering the Capitol to interrupt the certification of the election by Congress. Mary McCord: And could I just interject there? Because one of the things that people, a lot of people talk about is, oh, this offense carries a 20 year penalty. So even if you’re convicted of other felonies, this was the big one with 20 years. For the most part, people have not been getting sentenced to things like 20 years. I mean, most of the double digit sentences have involved people like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, which also carries a 20 year sentence. And a few others who had very violent assaults on police officers, for example, got double digit sentences. But to this point about those who may need to be resentenced, and the judges can still take into consideration the conduct underlying the obstruction offense, in many cases, their sentences, I suspect, will end up being the same as what they were because they weren’t getting 20 years. They were getting something less than that and something well within the maximum for the felonies for which they were convicted. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. One sort of pointer for our listeners is it’s so annoying, I think, for prosecutors and defense lawyers when the media and others just immediately jump to the maximum sentence. And a lot of times when you hear about somebody who’s been charged with something, the media says, and they could face 120 years in jail -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- because there’s six charges and each of them carries a 20 year maximum. And Mary and I both go, are you freaking kidding me? I mean, that’s absurd because there are guidelines and no judge is thinking 120 years. Just because there’s a maximum, you could cover that just as much if you want to cover the minimum. And so it’s just not in any way predictive of what the person is likely to get. And just the other point, just to underscore something you said, Mary, which is the people who’ve gotten high sentences have been charged with things like seditious conspiracy or assaulting an actual police officer. So the 1512(c)2 is not the charge that’s doing the work in terms of the sentencing. But Ryan, I think you look like there’s something you wanted to say, and then we thought we’d take a quick break and we have a lot more questions to ask you about the piece. Ryan Goodman: Sure. Just to piggyback on something that you just said, Andrew, which is just take Joseph Fischer himself, the lead plaintiff in the case. So he has not yet gone to trial. This was a pre-trial motion. It is possible that the obstruction statute now cannot be charged against him. We can discuss whether or not it actually still. Mary McCord: We’ll come back to that, yes. Ryan Goodman: Yes. But he, like the other two defendants that were consolidated in this case, all three of them have other felonies. Those felonies include assaulting law enforcement officers. So their fate as to whether or not they’re going to serve time in jail may be unaffected by the Supreme Court ruling, even though the Supreme Court ruling is in their favor. Andrew Weissmann: So why don’t we take a quick break and then let’s come back to this issue of whether Mr. Fischer could still be charged with the obstruction charge, the (c)2 charge because I think it also allows to talk a little bit about the split in the Supreme Court and Ketanji Brown-Jackson and where she ended up and -- Mary McCord: And Amy Coney Barrett and where she ended up. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Because she is such an interesting character, but this is the tease. Mary McCord: Yes. We’re going over the cliff. Okay. Let’s leave it hanging on the cliff. Okay. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Welcome back, Ryan. Why don’t we talk about under what circumstances do you think that Mr. Fischer could still be charged with an obstruction charge under (c)2 that’ll take us into some of the opinions. Ryan Goodman: So the roadmap is laid out by Ketanji Brown-Jackson’s concurring opinion. And the justice at the very end of her opinion, the very final passage, basically says there’s still a path here for the Justice Department to charge Mr. Fischer under the very same statute. You just have to apply the framework. And then the question is, as Mary had set out at the beginning, under the new test, did Mr. Fischer act with the intent to impair, let’s say, the availability of records, their proper certificates, or trying to facilitate the false certificates? But in this instance, I think it would be interrupting the electoral certificates from being used in the congressional proceedings. They very well might have the case against him, and that would be the charge. And just to add a little bit more to that, the reporting in the 24 hours since the Supreme Court opinion by CNN, New York Times, and others indicates that the Justice Department is poised to make these kinds of moves. Not necessarily Mr. Fischer’s case, though they might have that as well, but CNN, for example, said that in multiple cases, the Justice Department has provided evidence to the jury that shows the ways in which the clerks of Congress had to run with the certificates out of the building because of the incoming rioters. That provides you the kind of theory of the case that would fit the legal framework that the court just articulated. Mary McCord: And certificates, just to be sure everyone’s checking, this was the day that Congress, the joint session, was going to literally count the electoral ballots. And those are transmitted by the states with all of the electors in each state signing and a certification that these are valid. Now, of course, we know there were also several states that sent up false certificates. That’s not the point of this particular charge here. That has been the point of separate charges and separate cases. But those certificates is something that was a document that needed to be counted, opened by, I should say, envelopes opened by the vice president and counted on that day. And those were very much impaired by the riot. The other thing that I think is significant, you said concurrence, but just to be sure everyone’s clear, Justice Jackson’s concurrence was written separately because she agreed with the conclusion of the majority, again, a 6-3. She was one of the six who said that (c)2 does have to be tethered to (c)1 and it has to involve impairment of integrity or availability of something to be used in an official proceeding. So she wrote separately. It’s not like a dissent writing separately and people can sort of write that off as, oh, well, that’s a dissent. This was a concurrence. And this is saying, here’s how I, who agree with the majority, see this playing out. And she says quite clearly, and these are her words, it might well be that Fischer’s conduct, as alleged here, involved the impairment or the attempted impairment of the availability or integrity of things used during the January 6 proceeding in ways other than those specified in (c)1, and if so, his prosecution can and should proceed. This remains available for the lower courts to determine on remand. So I think that’s really important. Andrew Weissmann: Can I just say why there’s sort of an elephant in the room here? Because I think what she, although she addresses the Fischer case, and this is very factual, both what she’s saying and our earlier discussion about the broad definition of evidence that the court in the majority gives to (c)2, the looming issue is Donald Trump and his case. And maybe I can pose this to Ryan, how do you think this decision affects the (c)2 charge and the conspiracy (c)2 charge? Because these are charges that Donald Trump faces. We’ll leave aside the immunity decision, which we talked about yesterday with our colleague Trevor Morrison. But how do you think this decision affects the Trump case? Is it go forward on the sort of the Ketanji-Brown-Jackson theory, or is there some nuance that we’re missing? Ryan Goodman: So I think that the Jack Smith case goes forward without any real risk from Fischer. And that’s because the theory of the case for Donald Trump is the false slate of electors that he helped orchestrate across the seven different states, false documents or forgeries, as it has been charged in some of those states, to be submitted to Congress. And that is fully consistent with the majority opinion, as well as Justice Jackson’s opinion. The majority, I think, almost goes out of its way to give as an example, quote unquote, false evidence. Creating, yes, that’s a good point. Creating false evidence that fits like nearly like a hand in glove with the false certifications. And that’s obviously a record or a document. It’s such an easy application of the majority opinion, almost of (c)1, except it goes beyond it to include falsified documents. And so I don’t think Jack Smith should lose any sleep over it. Mary McCord: If it weren’t for the immunity opinion, but that’s another story. Ryan Goodman: Yes. Yeah, but would not lose any sleep over Fischer. Though, that said, it’ll introduce motions. It would be incumbent upon Trump’s attorneys to make the argument in the immunity opinion. They drop an early footnote that basically invites it as well as a possibility. But I can’t imagine as long as every one of the judges sticks to the majority opinion, let’s say, that it would trouble the theory of the case of the charges against Trump or I should say, and others. Mary McCord: Yes. Ryan Goodman: So if any others were ever tried at the federal level, including the co-conspirators, the unindicted co-conspirators in the federal indictment, they too, for the involvement in the false electors scheme, I think it would clearly apply to them. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, you mentioned that while this opinion is 6-3, at the outset, you noted that it is not the six and the three that one would expect because Ketanji Brown-Jackson, who is usually viewed as a, quote, unquote, “liberal justice,” joins the majority. She does write, as you said, separately. But the dissent, which is three justices, the dissent is written by Amy Coney Barrett. It’s not that she doesn’t just join it. She actually writes it. And the one thing I will say, I think I’ve said this before, is I find her in this term, you may disagree with her on lots of things, but she comes off as thoughtful and honest and also a beautiful writer. I think I may have mentioned this just on yesterday’s episode. Mary McCord: You mentioned it yesterday, right. Andrew Weissmann: And you know what? I still have the same view, which is surprising that it’s 24 hours later and I haven’t changed my mind. But I wanted to get your take on sort of what she said, what her criticism of the majority is, and what you sort of made of the fact that she was in dissent here. Mary McCord: Well, she is very pointed in her dissent. She says that, you know, the majority doesn’t dispute that the joint session qualifies as an official proceeding, that rioters delayed that proceeding, or even that Fischer’s alleged conduct was part of a successful effort to forcibly halt the certification of the election results. And she says, given all of that, the case that he can be tried for obstructing an official proceeding, and this is a quote, “seems open and shut.” So why does the court hold otherwise? She then says the court abandoning its normal approach to statutory interpretation does textual backflips, those are her words, to find some way, any way to narrow the reach of subsection (c)2. And she dissents. And then she basically says, look, the government’s interpretation is very straightforward. Otherwise means otherwise. The plain language means in a way other than the way in (c)1, and that way should not be limited by (c)1. Now, the majority had used these statutory interpretation canons that I would say don’t really apply here because the language is clear, which is when you have a list of things and there’s an otherwise clause at the end, sometimes that otherwise clause means, well, it does have to be tethered to that list of things. But usually in those cases, the list is one list. So let’s say -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- (c)1 itself said altering, mutilating, etcetera, a document or otherwise. In one clause, I would agree maybe with the majority, but it didn’t. It is two separate sections, (c)1 and (c)2. Andrew Weissmann: And she use great examples of that. She really takes them to task and goes through all of the textual analysis to point out why it just does not hold. Mary McCord: Yep. So I think it’s important reading because, you know, again, we’re starting to get a feel for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, just like we did in yesterday’s immunity decision, where I thought, you know, that was a partial concurrence and a partial dissent. And she dissented on some very important points. And even on the part with which she concurred, she would have gone farther. She made it clear she would have then applied what the majority was coming up with as its test about deciding what’s official and what is unofficial. And she made it very clear that the false elector scheme in her mind is clearly on the -- Andrew Weissmann: Unofficial. Mary McCord: -- unofficial side of the line. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Right. So, you know, like you said, Andrew, I think, you know, I’m really impressed with some of the things she’s doing, even when I substantively might disagree, because I think she’s clear about how she approaches sort of from a legal perspective issues and, you know, providing more guidance, frankly, than the majority. But anyway, I digress to immunity at this point. Andrew Weissmann: Ryan. Yeah, what do you think? Ryan Goodman: Just want to jump in with further laudatory words about Amy Coney Barrett’s work in these cases. In the oral arguments, I thought she played one of those pivotal roles. Mary McCord: Yes. Ryan Goodman: So in the immunity case, she is the one who gets Trump’s attorney to essentially concede that a list of allegations, including the false elector scheme, is on the private side of the line, not on the official conduct side of the line. It’s even a notable moment in the oral argument where I thought I detected Elena Kagan is asking the next question and is even taken by surprise that Amy Coney Barrett had asked Elena’s question, so that it’s a powerful, pivotal moment for how everybody even thinks of the case. Then in the Fischer case, she’s the one that takes the lead in the oral argument about asking the question as to whether or not the statute would apply to conduct that is acting upon the certificates themselves. So -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Ryan Goodman: -- it’s not just in the writing of these opinions, but also I think as an active justice in the oral arguments, she’s become something quite impressive. Mary McCord: Agree. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, I mean, it is something worth keeping an eye on. I think it’s too soon to say that she’s going to be the new justice suitor. But you do get the sense that she is, and again, I won’t go to say that’s definitive, but you get the sense that she is honestly wrestling with issues. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Again, you may disagree with where she comes out, but when you compare her to what I think is just thoroughly disingenuous outcome driven, you know, justices on the Supreme Court, she is not exhibiting any of that behavior. Mary McCord: So bottom line is Fischer, not so much impact, very little impact. One of the things we didn’t mention that is part of the article, Ryan, that I thought was so great that you dug up is that even in cases where defendants in the January 6th attack had pleaded guilty solely to a 1512(c)2 offense, the government had included a clause in that plea agreement that said, essentially, if that charge is ever vacated, they can actually re-bring one of the offenses that they dismissed as part of the plea agreement. So even in those cases where people pled guilty only to this, there’s still a potential remedy here. So, you know, I think at the end of the day, the impact is going to be very, very minimal. And that’s particularly the case if the government does go ahead, particularly for those who have not yet gone to trial or pleaded guilty and pursues these charges on, you know, consistent with the majority opinion. Ryan Goodman: Yes. And I think it also the punchline in terms of the bottom line is the number 5.9 percent. So only in 5.9 percent of all January 6th cases are those individuals materially benefited from the Fischer opinion. Those are the individuals for which the only backup appears to be a misdemeanor charge. And I would think in those cases, those are the ones that we’re the least troubled about. Mary McCord: That’s right. Absolutely. Ryan Goodman: They’re not the seditious conspiracy by the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys and all the folks who are attacking law enforcement officers and the like. These are the cases that I think on the outer edge on the margin. And those are the 6 percent that are affected. Andrew Weissmann: So one thing I think that 5.9 percent figure is really useful to understand that sort of seems to be the maximum of the number of people who might only face a misdemeanor now, not a felony. But I think it’s zero percent who actually, as a result of this decision, don’t face anything. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: In other words, I don’t think there’s anybody who doesn’t face any crime because of this decision. In other words, this sort of idea that, oh, wait a second, everyone goes free. Ryan Goodman: Right. Andrew Weissmann: I think the answer is no, because there’s nobody who isn’t facing either a felony, some other felony or a misdemeanor or might still even be able to be charged with the 1512(c)2 charge that everybody falls into some charge. But there is a bucket of people who might get sort of a sentencing reduction or only have a misdemeanor. But it’s a much smaller group than the sort of widely touted beforehand that this would be as some devastating loss for the government in terms of hundreds of people going free. Ryan Goodman: Right. And also not only the devastating loss, but it counteracts the disinformation or misinformation about government overreach, because the whole point is that it’s actually such a teeny, tiny, small percentage of the cases that are actually materially affected. Mary McCord: Ryan, it’s been so great having you join us. You also have such a calming voice. You know, Andrew and I just get each other like riled up faster and faster and faster. Triggered. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, I’m a really bad influence on Mary. Ryan Goodman is, you know, when you think, when people say, oh, that’s academic and sometimes people view that as a negative, Ryan Goodman is the platonic ideal of what you want somebody in the academy to be, which is completely dispassionate about facts and letting the facts govern how you should think about something. And this piece, which is said is in our show notes, is such a great example of that. And then being really thorough and there’s a deep dive. And just final word is that I know we went over a lot of numbers, but in the piece there actually are some pie charts said that there is -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: You don’t have to just do the math. There are some easy visuals so that you can sort of see what Ryan was talking about. And I think we’re all really indebted to you and to Just Security for doing this deep dive. Ryan Goodman: Well, thank you so much. And I did actually want to do a little bit of a shout out to my colleague Pooja Shah for creating the pie charts and the information graphics, because I think they’re so important for people’s understanding. But then to also say, to requit some of what you both said, all your listeners know this, but you both are national treasures and it’s just really a pleasure and a privilege to be in this conversation with you. Andrew Weissmann: Well, Ryan, that’s very nice of you to say. Mary McCord: Appreciate you, Ryan. Andrew Weissmann: Ryan, thanks so much. Ryan Goodman: Thank you.

"Texas’ Lloyd Doggett breaks new ground, urges Biden to withdraw",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-lloyd-doggett-breaks-new-ground-urges-biden-withdraw-rcna160002,"In the days following last week’s debate, President Joe Biden heard from a great many media figures calling him to abandon his re-election plans, but those weren’t the voices the Democratic incumbent was concerned about. There are also prominent party donors looking for alternatives, but they're not Biden's principal concern, either. Of far greater interest were the party’s elected officials. The Washington Post reported this week that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries “told his worried members to hold their fire for a few days to see how things shake out,” and for a while, they did exactly that. In fact, in the four days following the debate, the grand total of Democratic officials — in the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and gubernatorial offices nationwide — who publicly called on Biden to pass the torch was zero. Now, that number is one: Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, a veteran lawmaker first elected 30 years ago, issued a written statement today asking the president to stand down. The Texas Tribune reported on the congressman's unexpected written statement: “I represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson. Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw. President Biden should do the same,” Doggett continued. The statement went on to argue, ""President Biden saved our democracy by delivering us from Trump in 2020. He must not deliver us to Trump in 2024."" A spokesperson for the president's re-election campaign responded to the news by saying that Biden is ""staying in,"" and noting the supportive comments he's received from other congressional Democrats. And while that's true, those who watch Capitol Hill closely know that members are often reluctant to be the first to take a provocative position. What we don't yet know is whether Doggett will be an isolated voice, or whether he just opened a door others will soon walk through. Complicating matters, while Doggett is the first to take this bold step, it's probably fair to say that the party over the last 48 hours hasn't exactly shown the White House an unyielding and unbreakable wall of solid support. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, for example, appeared on MSNBC earlier today and said, “I think it’s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?"" Also today, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime Biden ally and former member of the House leadership, said during an MSNBC interview that Democrats should support Vice President Kamala Harris, ""whether she’s in second place or at the top of the ticket.” Yesterday, Andy Beshear, Kentucky's governor and a Democrat who's rumored to have national ambitions, also hedged on Biden's future, while Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said he was surprised and “pretty horrified” by the president's appearance at last week's debate. A day earlier, Rep. Jamie Raskin also appeared open to a change on his party's ticket. “We’re having a serious conversation about what to do,” the Maryland Democrat told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi. Raskin, an influential voice in Democratic politics, added, “One thing I can tell you is that regardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified. ... Whether he’s the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention. He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward and beat the forces of authoritarianism and reaction in the country.” The on-air comments, at a minimum, suggested that Raskin sees Biden's future as unresolved. Doggett's statement serves as a reminder that others in the party have arrived at the same conclusion."

The decision was made by the New York appeals court in Manhattan. According to the filing, the court determined Giuliani knowingly lied about the election, including claims about illegal voters being bused from out of state to vote in Pennsylvania’s election, and that a vote was cast by deceased boxer Joe Frazier. The filing also determined that Giuliani pushed a raft of other baseless claims — like his allegation that thousands of noncitizens cast ballots in Arizona — that lacked reputable evidence.  The court said Giuliani must “comply with the rules governing the conduct of disbarred or suspended attorneys.” It certainly marks a fall from grace for a man who was once billed as ""America's mayor."" Giuliani’s troubles don’t end there. He's also been recommended for disbarment in Washington, D.C.; he’s still facing a RICO indictment in Georgia and another election-related indictment in Arizona; and he’s filed for bankruptcy to liquidate his assets in order to pay nearly $150 million defamation judgments to creditors for false claims he made about Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, among others."

Gretchen Whitmer called a senior official with President Biden’s campaign on Friday night, and conveyed a clear message: The Democratic governor “hated the way her name was being floated as a replacement for Biden and she wasn’t behind the chatter.” * Speaking of Whitmer, there were reports that the governor told Team Biden that the incumbent president probably won’t win Michigan in the fall, but she pushed back against such talk yesterday. “I am proud to support Joe Biden as our nominee and I am behind him 100 percent in the fight to defeat Donald Trump,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Not only do I believe Joe can win Michigan, I know he can because he’s got the receipts: he’s lowered health care costs, brought back manufacturing jobs, and is committed to restoring the reproductive freedom women lost under Donald Trump.” * And speaking of Michigan, the latest EPIC-MRA poll found Donald Trump leading Biden by four points in the Wolverine State — three points with third-party candidates in the mix — in a survey that was conducted before last week’s presidential debate. * It was of interest to see reports that Biden has used teleprompters during some recent fundraising events. That’s not common among presidents and/or presidential candidates. * The incumbent president’s political operation announced that it raised $264 million in the second quarter of 2024 — including $127 million in June, which proved to be the Democratic campaign’s best month of the cycle. * A group of prominent conservative Trump critics agreed to meet with senior Biden campaign officials yesterday. Participants in the event — which was scheduled before last week’s debate — have been tight-lipped about how the discussion went. * And in Georgia, which Biden narrowly carried in 2020, the latest Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll showed Trump ahead, 43% to 38%.

Biden calls Supreme Court's Trump immunity ruling 'a terrible disservice' to the nation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 8:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-trump-immunity-supreme-court-rcna159933,"President Joe Biden on Monday sharply rebuked the Supreme Court's ruling on Donald Trump's presidential immunity claim, in remarks that departed from his relative silence on his election rival’s ongoing criminal cases. In a brief speech delivered from the White House, Biden said the court has done “a terrible disservice to the people of this nation” with its ruling that grants Trump some immunity from prosecution in his federal election interference case. “No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,” Biden said. “With today’s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed. For all — for all practical purposes, today’s decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what the president can do.” He called the Monday ruling a continuation of the Supreme Court’s assault “on a wide range of long-established legal principles in our nation,” including on voting rights and abortion rights. Biden framed the decision as one that increases the high stakes of this election. “The American people must decide if they want to entrust the president — once again, the presidency — to Donald Trump now, knowing he’ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants to do it,” he said. Biden’s brief remarks come as he faces intense pressure from some Democratic donors, strategists and lawmakers to step down after last week’s disastrous debate performance. The president has largely steered clear of commenting on Trump’s criminal indictments — though he has called Trump a “convicted felon” after the presumptive GOP nominee’s conviction in New York in May. Still, Trump attacked his Democratic rival in a series of Truth Social posts on Monday night, claiming that Biden's speech was an attempt to “deflect from his horrible campaign performance.”"
Why John Kelly remains one of Trump’s favorite political targets,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 8:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/john-kelly-remains-one-trumps-favorite-political-targets-rcna159962,"It was late last year when The Washington Post reported that Donald Trump had created an enemies list of sorts, with the hope that the Justice Department would investigate his targets if voters give him a second term. The list wasn’t exactly short, though one name stood out: former White House chief of staff John Kelly. In other words, the former president, eying a return to the Oval Office, wants to use the levers of federal power to go after his own former right-hand man — who also happens to be Trump’s former handpicked Homeland Security secretary and a retired four-star Marine general. But it appears the Republican isn’t prepared to wait until 2025 to go after Kelly rhetorically. Late last week, at his first post-debate rally, Trump told his followers: The crowd responded with predictable booing. This wasn’t the first time. Last October, by way of his social media platform, the former president said his former chief of staff was “by far the dumbest of my Military people.” He added, in reference to Kelly, “He was incapable of doing a good job, it was too much for him, and I couldn’t stand the guy, so I fired him like a ‘dog.’ He had no heart or respect for people, so I hit him hard.” In a follow-up missive, Trump went on to say that Kelly is “a Lowlife with a very small brain and a very big mouth.” But why is the presumptive GOP nominee still bringing up the retired general, unprompted? It might have something to do with the fact that Trump appears preoccupied with allegations that he denigrated American servicemembers as “suckers and losers” — a contentious point during last week’s debate — and Kelly is the one who’s confirmed that Trump really did use the ugly language. In fact, Trump’s longest-serving White House chief of staff confirmed the story with on-the-record comments to CNN last year. “What can I add that has not already been said?” Kelly said in October 2023. Referring to his former boss, Kelly added, “A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’ A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because ‘it doesn’t look good for me.’ A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family — for all Gold Star families — on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America’s defense are ‘losers’ and wouldn’t visit their graves in France. “A person who is not truthful regarding his position on the protection of unborn life, on women, on minorities, on evangelical Christians, on Jews, on working men and women,” Kelly continued. “A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason — in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. “There is nothing more that can be said,” Kelly concluded. “God help us.” Kelly has also accused Trump of, among other things, “poisoning” people’s minds, having “serious character issues,” and not being “a real man.” What’s more, Kelly told The New York Times in 2022 that Trump, during his presidency, told his chief of staff to use the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department to target his critics and perceived political foes. The Times’ report went on to note, “Mr. Kelly said he made clear to Mr. Trump that there were serious legal and ethical issues with what he wanted.” The then-president “regularly” made the demands anyway. Trump continues to push back, though the fact that he’s publicly feuding with his own former DHS secretary and chief of staff should probably be a bigger deal in the 2024 campaign."
Trump-appointed judge undermines Biden’s climate agenda (again),Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 7:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-judge-undermines-bidens-climate-agenda-rcna159944,"After the Biden administration took steps to raise the cost estimate of carbon emissions, Republican attorneys general filed suit and took their case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. There, they found Judge James Cain, tapped for the federal bench by Donald Trump, who predictably ruled in 2022 against the Democratic White House and its climate agenda. A year later, the same Louisiana judge sided with oil companies in a closely watched case related offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, Cain is again making headlines — and for similar reasons. The Washington Post reported that the conservative jurist blocked President Joe Biden’s pause on approving new facilities that export liquefied natural gas, “dealing another legal blow to the president’s ambitious climate agenda.” I’ll leave it to others to determine whether the conservative judge meant “epiphany” or “epitome.” Similarly, it’s not altogether clear in context whether Cain intended to use the word “ideocracy” — given its meaning, this seemed like a curious choice of words — or if he was trying to reference “Idiocracy.” Either way, there’s a larger pattern that’s worth appreciating: Biden has had some important and impressive successes on combatting the climate crisis, but Republican-appointed judges haven’t exactly made his job easier. On the contrary, Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices in 2022 curbed the Environmental Protection Agency’s options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, and as the Post’s report added, those same far-right jurists issued a pair of decisions last week “that sharply curtailed the power of federal agencies to address climate change, air pollution and other pressing environmental problems.” Earlier this year, meanwhile, U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of Texas, another Trump appointee, struck down a Biden administration climate policy that required states “to measure and set declining targets for greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles using the national highway system.” The New York Times reported two years ago on “a coordinated, multiyear strategy by Republican attorneys general, conservative legal activists and their funders, several with ties to the oil and coal industries, to use the judicial system to rewrite environmental law, weakening the executive branch’s ability to tackle global warming.” The article added, “Coming up through the federal courts are more climate cases, some featuring novel legal arguments, each carefully selected for its potential to block the government’s ability to regulate industries and businesses that produce greenhouse gases.” Those plans appear to be advancing apace, which is great news for the oil and coal industries, and bad news for life on Earth."
"Post-debate polls offer a mixed bag for Biden, Trump in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 6:36 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/post-debate-polls-offer-mixed-bag-biden-trump-2024-race-rcna159925,"Over the last half-century, first-term presidents seeking re-election nearly always flub their first debate. Ronald Reagan looked and sounded awful against Walter Mondale in 1984; George W. Bush was easily defeated by John Kerry in 2004; and Barack Obama struggled badly against Mitt Romney in 2012. When Democrats respond to last week’s developments by pointing to this recent history, they have a point. The difference is, Reagan, Bush and Obama were ahead at the time. When debate viewers tuned in and saw them stumble, the incumbents enjoyed a buffer of support that helped prevent panic among their respective parties and supporters. With President Joe Biden, it’s a bit more complicated. Ahead of last week’s debate, the Democratic incumbent was already trailing in most national and battleground state polling. What’s more, pre-debate surveys found that nearly seven in 10 Americans saw Biden as too old to effectively lead. The buffer the president’s modern predecessors enjoyed didn’t exist ahead of last week’s showdown. Indeed, it’s one of the reasons Biden and his team scheduled the debate in the first place: They thought it might help push the 2024 race in a new direction. Obviously, the Democrat’s performance in Atlanta didn’t go as planned, and as a result, there’s been intense interest in what the next round of polling would say. It’s against this backdrop that USA Today reported: Note, this national survey was conducted entirely after last week’s Biden/Trump debate. The poll’s results are not enough to send shockwaves through Democratic politics — if the same data showed the presumptive GOP nominee ahead by double digits, today would be a very different kind of day — though they are enough to keep the fire of anxiety alive among Biden’s backers. Similarly for Trump, the former president will be pleased to see himself ahead, but if he thought the debate would put him in a dominant position, the poll suggests that hasn't happened, at least not yet. Though the next big round of data hasn’t yet arrived, the USA Today/Suffolk poll wasn’t the only survey of note. In New Hampshire, for example, a St. Anselm College poll conducted a post-debate poll and found Trump leading Biden in the Granite State by a couple of points — which wouldn’t be that bad for Democrats except Biden won New Hampshire by seven points in the last election, and late last year, a St. Anselm College poll found Biden up by 10 points in the state. I continue to believe the polls will have an enormous impact on whether Democratic officials try to shake up their 2024 ticket. For now, the fact that the data isn’t showing an epic collapse for the incumbent should probably be seen as a good sign at Biden HQ, though the longer the polls show him trailing his felonious rival, the more the chatter will endure about the president passing the torch."
"AOC, fellow Dems explore recourses following Supreme Court ruling",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/aoc-fellow-dems-explore-recourses-supreme-court-ruling-rcna159919,"For as long as there have been Supreme Court rulings, there have been members of Congress dissatisfied with the justices’ opinions. Historically, this tends to lead to complaints and concerns, but little in the way of actual legislative actions. That said, for determined lawmakers, it would be an overstatement to argue that members have literally no options when sitting justices on the high court go too far. For example, as part of the Madisonian model of checks and balances, members of Congress have impeachment authority — and as The New Republic noted, one high-profile Democrat is eager to exercise that authority. The New York Democrat didn’t specify which justices she intends to target with articles of impeachment, though the congresswoman — who’s sometimes known by her “AOC” initials — did say in an online statement, “The Supreme Court has become consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control. Today’s ruling represents an assault on American democracy. It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture.” Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t alone in seeking legislative remedies. Rep. Joe Morelle, another New York Democrat, responded to the Trump v. U.S. ruling by vowing to introduce a constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Court’s “harmful immunity decision and ensure that no president is above the law.” Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, meanwhile, issued a written statement that read in part, “We must take all available measures to reign in the increasingly unfettered power of this radical court, including a binding code of ethics and expanding the number of justices. Six people who were never elected cannot be allowed to continue destroying our democracy.” There are a couple of ways to assess efforts like these. The first is on the merits, and on that front, it’s easy to be sympathetic to the Democratic proposals. The Supreme Court’s radicalized Republican majority has taken indefensible steps in recent years, but to elevate the presidency above the law is a uniquely pernicious act. The second, however, is more pragmatic. No sitting justice has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process, and the last time such a case even went to the Senate was 220 years ago. Relatedly, the Constitution has never been amended to reverse a misguided Supreme Court decision; and while Congress has expanded the Supreme Court before, it’s been 155 years, and the odds of such an effort clearing Capitol Hill anytime soon are extraordinarily remote. Or put another way, the Democratic responses to Trump v. U.S. might make sense, but those hoping to see such measures advance should lower their expectations. But if Congress can’t fix what Republican justices have broken, what is the remedy? There is “very little we can do except elect a Democrat [as president] who will appoint vacancies if Democrats hold [the] Senate,” Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee told Axios. In other words, those looking for a recourse shouldn’t look to Congress, they should look to voters, who now have an added reason to choose wisely."
Trump amplifies radical retaliatory message targeting Liz Cheney,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-amplifies-radical-retaliatory-message-targeting-liz-cheney-rcna159915,"The question of whether Donald Trump would try to prosecute his perceived political enemies in a second term has already been answered. As we’ve discussed, the former president has not only publicly acknowledged his intentions in multiple interviews, he’s also trailed by a record of already having made such attempts. What this realization leads to is related questions about which foes he’ll target, and how he intends to go after them. It’s against this backdrop that The New York Times reported: Of particular interest was a message that the former president amplified, which asserted that former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney is “guilty of treason.” The message — which someone else created, but which Trump promoted — encouraged other users of Trump’s social media platform to help get the word out “if you want televised military tribunals.” As the Times’ report added, military tribunals are a type of military court “reserved for enemy combatants and war criminals.” The presumptive GOP nominee’s political operation had an opportunity to clarify matters, and perhaps even walk the messages back. Instead, a Trump campaign spokesperson told the Times, “Liz Cheney and the sham January 6th committee banned key witnesses, shielded important evidence, and destroyed documents.” Or put another way, asked why the former president amplified a message that accused the former House GOP Conference chair of “treason,” Team Trump doubled down on its condemnation of the former congresswoman. There’s no shortage of problems here. First, in reality, the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee wasn’t a “sham”; it didn’t ban witnesses; it didn’t block evidence; and it didn’t destroy evidence. Second, the idea that Trump might prefer “military tribunals” for his political critics is every bit as unsettling as it seems. And third, it’s never been altogether clear whether Trump knows what “treason” means, though there’s little doubt that he loves to casually throw the word around — far more than he should. The former president has accused Barack Obama of treason. And Nancy Pelosi. And James Comey. He’s also eyed treason investigations into Adam Schiff, The New York Times, Google, and federal law enforcement officials. At one point, after one of his State of the Union addresses, Trump even suggested that congressional Democrats might have committed “treason” because they failed to applaud to his satisfaction. As the Republican eyes a second term, his “treason” list continues to grow. This can, and likely will, get ugly in a hurry. Axios reported overnight that Trump, if rewarded with a second term, “plans to immediately test the boundaries of presidential and governing power.” The article went on to note that the Republican “promises an unabashedly imperial presidency — one that would turn the Justice Department against critics.” What's more, all of this comes against a backdrop of a Supreme Court ruling that told Trump that the American presidency is effectively above the law. To not be concerned is to close one’s eyes."
The Supreme Court wrote an immunity test Trump can't help but pass,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 2, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-test-rcna159784,"It’s hard to see how the Supreme Court’s ruling on whether former President Donald Trump enjoys immunity from prosecution could be much worse. It’s true that the opinion in Trump v. United States doesn’t grant him the absolute immunity that he’d claimed. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts authored a majority opinion as close as possible to finding that absolute immunity without making a complete mockery of the findings of the lower courts. In the end, the chief justice and his GOP-appointed colleagues determined that presidents are immune for “official acts” but may still be prosecuted for “unofficial acts” once they’ve left office. With this decision, the six conservative justices left up in the air exactly what parts of the federal indictment against Trump are still constitutional. The opinion accordingly pats itself on the back for not making the determination straight away, leaving that to the lower courts to determine based on a test of the Supreme Court’s devising. But the caveats and examples that the court provides in its opinion makes it obvious that anything determined to be outside the shield it has erected around Trump will be at best a temporary setback for the former president. In this brave new world, a president’s actions can be divided into three categories. The first are those official acts that are “conclusive and preclusive” — authorized through a power granted solely to the president under the Constitution. Such acts are now totally protected from prosecution. All other official acts, including presidential communications, are granted “presumptive immunity.” In those cases, prosecutors can still argue that executive privilege doesn’t apply but it’s up to a judge to make that call. Finally, “unofficial acts,” or those taken beyond the scope of office, don’t fall under the aegis of this newfound immunity — but exactly what counts is left undefined. In setting this new precedent, Roberts draws heavily on the 1982 decision in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, which determined that the president enjoys immunity from civil cases even for acts that extend to the “outer perimeter” of their role. The same presumed immunity for those acts now applies to criminal cases, “so long as they are ‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.’” With that very unhelpful guidance, Roberts has ordered the lower courts to do the work now of figuring out what exactly that entails, including whether the Trump-led pressure campaign against former Vice President Mike Pence fits the bill. Accordingly, this ruling has wiped away entirely the assertion in special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment that Trump leaned on the Justice Department to pursue false election fraud cases to bolster his efforts to overturn the election. More damaging, Smith is now blocked from even using those supposedly “official acts” as evidence to prove criminality for unofficial acts, whichever those wind up being. The overall effect is to tie prosecutors’ hands, cutting them off from one of the key factors in determining whether to bring charges against a person. Importantly, Roberts also writes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” This new dictum applies even in instances of clear motive to act in their own personal interest, rather the national interest, putting such motivations beyond the reach of prosecutors. This determination also all but bars lower court judges from applying common sense to charges involving a president, as Monday’s ruling also blocks judges from deeming a president’s action unofficial “merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.” To top it all off, Roberts sanctimoniously forgoes driving the dagger into the heart of this case. After determining that criminal immunity exists for official presidential actions, he then writes that “the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute” for each of those given actions. No, those issues must be left for the future because, he writes, a single case “in more than ‘two centuries does not afford enough experience’ to definitively and comprehensively determine the President’s scope of immunity from criminal prosecution.” U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the federal case in question, is now tasked with adjudicating which of Trump’s actions are still subject to prosecution. What is left only implicit in the opinion, though, is that those decisions are subject to appeal by Trump or the prosecutors (though much more likely the former). So, too, are the decisions that the appeals court eventually makes, putting the final call right back where it started: in the hands of Roberts and his fellow conservatives. In sum, this decision is a Roberts special, projecting neutral impartiality while thoroughly skewed toward a predetermined outcome. The supposed tests that are meant to give the veneer of wide applicability beyond Trump should instead be seen in the same light as the decision to allow him onto the ballot despite the 14th Amendment’s language preventing it: a fig leaf over a standard that applies to only one man. It frankly would have been better if Roberts had adopted Justice Samuel Alito’s disdain for subtlety. It would be more honest for Roberts to not bother pretending that the court’s conservative wing won't eventually consider Trump’s attempts to steal the 2020 election entirely within the bounds of this newly created immunity. Instead, we are forced to watch as Trump, newly armed with the confidence that nothing can stop him, continues throwing rocks into the gears of justice, grinding proceedings against him to a halt once more."
The Immunity Decision,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-immunity-decision-rcna159868,"The consequential question before the Supreme Court on the limit and scope of presidential immunity has been decided, in three essential buckets. Veteran prosecutors Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord decipher the ramifications for the former president, for the January 6th case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, and for the broad constitutional authority of the presidency itself. And they are joined by Trevor Morrison, NYU law professor and Dean Emeritus, to discern the finer points of the decision and the warnings cast in dissents by both Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hello and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Monday, July 1st, the last day of the Supreme Court term, and I’m Andrew Weissman. I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Hey, Andrew. I was about to say good morning, but it’s not morning anymore. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, it’s 1:05. The two of us have been speed reading this morning because, as anyone who is listening to this knows, the Supreme Court has issued its decision in the presidential immunity case, and that is something we’re going to spend a whole episode talking about, going through the decision, the majority, the dissents. We also have a guest, somebody who people may remember. He is an expert on presidential immunity, Trevor Morrison. But first, Mary and I are going to talk about that decision. So, Mary, I’m going to turn it to you because this is one doozy of a decision. How do you want to start us off? Mary McCord: Yeah, I mean, you know, we could go through, you know, what the majority held, or we could have some observations, which is what I’m going to do, about sort of a open question, I think, in my mind about how narrow or how broad this ruling is, because the chief justice who wrote for the majority wants to try to tamp down any fear-mongering that this is really the end of democracy because it’s elevating presidents above the law.   And the dissent, to the contrast, are saying, oh, no, no, no, this is exceedingly broad. And it basically gives, I mean, Justice Sotomayor and also Justice Jackson, in a separate dissent, both go back to the examples that Florence Pan, a judge on the D.C. Circuit, raised with Mr. Trump’s attorney during oral argument on this case in the D.C. Circuit. Could a president order SEAL Team Six to assassinate his political opponent? And their fear is the answer, given the majority’s opinion, is yes. Andrew Weissmann: So why don’t we start with how do you read the holding here, the actual holding, and then we can talk a little bit more about where it might go. And then also, one way to think about this is big picture, what is it saying about the presidency? And the smaller picture is what does it say about this case? Like, where does it leave this case, the January 6 case? But why don’t we start with the bigger picture? Because in many ways, you know, that’s the thing that’s maybe more important to our country. And then we can sort of take it in like an onion and peel back the layers. Mary McCord: Yeah, well, that’s interesting, right? Because after we talked about the argument, one of the things I think you and I sort of criticized some of the justices for is making this a case for the ages, right? Where some of the justices indicated that they needed, you know, this lay down the law for the future. And certainly, Jack Smith and the government had argued, and I think you and I generally agreed with this point, but correct me if I’m wrong, that, you know, you actually don’t have to decide every possible permutation of when a president might be immune because the allegations in this case are what are in front of you and this doesn’t have to be a case for the ages. It’s never come up before. There’s no real reason it would come up again. But as you said, the majority’s approach was very much this is establishing sort of a rule for the ages. And just in terms of the basics, which listeners have probably heard by the time this podcast airs, you know, the three buckets of things the Supreme Court majority discussed were absolute immunity for acts that are within the president’s core constitutionally committed duties and responsibilities. Thing one, we’ll come back to that. Thing two, for other things that are within the outer perimeter of a president’s official acts, there would be at least presumptive immunity.   But that could be rebutted by the government upon a showing that prosecution, even for those things within the outer perimeter of official acts, would not impair or impede the executive functions, the power of the executive to do what he has a responsibility to do. We’ll come back to what that means. And then finally, unofficial acts, no immunity. So how this all works together, I think, is where the rubber meets the road in terms of applying it to this case and in any future case. Andrew Weissmann: Can I give a slightly different read that I definitely have the three-bucket view, but -- Mary McCord: But how you apply it involves far more questions than three. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And I think my concern about the middle bucket is that I think what the court is saying is that if it is ultimately determined that the conduct at issue is official conduct, it is immune. And so if you’ve got official conduct, it’s immune. If you’ve got unofficial conduct, it’s not immune. So, you know, personal conduct. So that’s really borrowing from the civil standard of presidential immunity. The reason I think they can focus on this issue of absolute immunity is they say, look, if its core functioning of like something that’s been exclusively delegated to the presidency, you don’t even have to sort of get into it. There’s not a lot of fact finding. So they actually give an example of that, which is the president’s communications with the attorney general, they say, is core and absolutely immune.   And that means all the allegations about Donald Trump’s communications with the Department of Justice, even though, by the way, they’re not with the attorney general himself.  They were actually with other people who were wanting to be the attorney general, but they basically seem to be kicking that out as part of saying absolutely immune and then they say -- Mary McCord: Hang on. I wouldn’t say basically or an example. I think they rule that is off limits. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You’re right. You’re right. Oh, yes. Mary McCord: That’s an official act. That’s off limits. No prosecution for that. Andrew Weissmann: Sorry. I shouldn’t have said basically. You’re absolutely right. And we can come back to that because that has such incredible, dire consequences when you’re dealing with Donald Trump talking about weaponizing the Department of Justice. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And you now have the Supreme Court saying, oh, yeah -- Mary McCord: They are new. Andrew Weissmann: -- there are certain core functions. Those are absolutely immune. I mean, that to me is just beyond shocking in terms of what they’re doing. You don’t need to worry about, oh, hypotheticals. And Chief Justice Roberts denigrates the hypotheticals that Justices Sotomayor and Jackson give. But these aren’t hypotheticals. You’ve got a former president and a person running for office saying this is what he wants to do and he’s -- Mary McCord: But before we move to the next bucket, if that’s what you were going to do -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- I do want to also mention that in this idea, this idea of what’s core constitutionally committed to the president, core constitutional functions, that wouldn’t include, I don’t think, in any typical reading of the Constitution, talking to your attorney general. Because what I think most of us think of when we think about constitutionally committed presidential functions, it’s things that are explicit in the Constitution. Things, for example, that Jack Smith argued were core constitutional functions, the pardon power, the power to appoint ambassadors, the power to recognize foreign governments. Those are the kind of things. Instead, the majority expands core to, well, the president has the power under the Take Care Clause to see that the laws be faithfully executed. Within that means, as part of the executive branch, he has discretion over what the Department of Justice investigates and what it does, and that’s part of his Take Care Clause functions. Therefore, that’s core. That is a very expansive reading of core. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. This is why it’s great doing this with you, because that was going to be my second point, plus you said it so much better than I would have, which is that we all thought, and I know Trevor had talked about this core piece being something that would be absolutely immune, but we didn’t think core was going to be expanded to be like Take Care Clause. If it’s Take Care Clause, I mean, that is so malleable. But anyway, so then you’ve got this second bucket, and the second bucket is where I do see what I’ll say is a slight silver lining in connection with -- Mary McCord: Same. Andrew Weissmann: -- this case -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- but a terrible precedent big picture. Mary McCord:  Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And the reason it’s a terrible precedent big picture is that the court goes out of its way to say there’s this presumption that what the president does is in his official capacity, and that it says, you know, even if you’re talking to state officials, that could be within your official capacity. Even if you’re tweeting, it just gives tons and tons of examples of why you would be able to view something as part of your official functions, and super expansive. And the only example they really give of something that might be unofficial is when they say, essentially, it says, perhaps as a candidate. Mary McCord: Right.  Andrew Weissmann: And so that very much goes back to something that Judge Pryor on the 11th Circuit focused on when he was dealing with Mark Meadows. And Mark Meadows said, I was doing all of my outreach to Georgia as part of my official functioning as chief of staff. And Judge Pryor said, no, you’re not, because there’s no function there. And that’s -- Mary McCord: And by that, just to take your no function, meaning there’s no federal government authority to direct how states send forth electoral ballots or choose their electors. And so he was looking at what I think is a logical legal way to analyze this, is something within the federal government or the executive branch authority. And if it’s not, because the Constitution commits to the states how to decide on who their electors will be for president, then you can’t say it’s official acts. But as you just were saying, this goes beyond that. Well, you know, he has a bully pulpit and he can certainly raise issues of election fraud with state officials. And so you have to parse it. Andrew Weissmann: Right. They basically say just because he has no role doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have an interest in talking about it to the public. I mean, it is the most expansive view, but they do say that it’s very fact intensive. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: There isn’t a factual record here. And so they do send it back to Judge Chutkan to have a factual hearing. And that means that she will be able, after briefing, which they also say is something that she needs to do, meaning slow, there needs to be briefing. And she, though, can have a factual hearing on this issue. And then finally, there is this third bucket, which is the personal, but as we’re talking about it, it’s really hard to imagine what personal is. Now, I would say the New York case where he is sending from the Oval Office signing checks in connection with a hush money scheme is going to be personal. They don’t say that. But I wanted to raise something that you noted, Mary, which is the dissents raise the Judge Pan issue of, can you order SEAL Team Six to kill somebody? And this would be, can you order the attorney general to prosecute somebody who’s a political rival? And what’s remarkable to me is the only response from the majority is to say those are fanciful.   Mary McCord: Yeah. Are they?   Andrew Weissmann: They don’t actually say -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- how will the test -- Mary McCord: Apply. Andrew Weissmann: -- deal with that. And the test, I hate to say this, because this is what’s so scary, outrageous. I know this has been a very difficult week. If you do not think that the Supreme Court is on the ballot, this decision, I think, leave aside the Trump trial, because I never thought that was going to go to trial before the election and this at least allows a hearing, which I also thought might be possible, but now we know is possible. But big picture, this fundamentally changes the role of the presidency in our democracy. We just had Chevron, which basically is a big blow to the administrative state, and clean water, health, clean air, basically the regulatory state, you know, from FDR on has a huge blow. But if you think that was a big blow, this to me means it is so important that you’re electing a president who has some internal sense of propriety and norms as to how you’re going to exercise power, in the same way that you want somebody who’s going to exercise the pardon power judiciously. Here, because of this decision, it is now, I think, beyond imperative that you are electing somebody like George Washington, who understands not running for office because of needing to have a peaceful transfer of power, because the Supreme Court, I think, in this majority decision has gone full MAGA. Mary McCord: Well, I’m speechless there. I hear all of these concerns. And part of the reason I started with the idea of let’s think about is this as broad as the dissent says it is or as narrow as the majority tries to send it is, is because I’m trying to think if I’m continuing to litigate here, what are my arguments against that broad reading, right?   Andrew Weissmann: I love this.   Mary McCord: What are my arguments against --  Andrew Weissmann: Tuck me off the ledge. Tuck me off the ledge. Mary McCord: Yeah. And so, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I just want to say on page 37 what Chief Justice Roberts says, because he tries to give a narrow reading. And he says, as for the dissents, they strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the court actually does today. Conclude that immunity extends to official discussions between the president and his attorney general and then remand to the lower courts to determine in the first instance whether and to what extent Trump’s remaining alleged conduct is entitled to immunity. So --  Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: -- that’s the description. Mary McCord: So that’s where the open door is, right? And so if I am Judge Chutkan and I am Jack Smith, I am thinking, how do I apply what the majority has told us and win? Of course, Judge Chutkan is not thinking, how do I win? She’s the judge. But if I’m Jack Smith, how do I apply that here and prove up to the satisfaction of Judge Chutkan and in a way that I think will eventually, if this case doesn’t go away, with a Trump win and a dismissal of the cases, a win in the election. If this case remains and there’s something to still be litigated, what arguments can I make that will fit into the analysis that the Supreme Court majority has said I have to engage in? Which goes back to that bucket, too, right, which is first, Judge Chutkan will have to see with the benefit of briefing. I think a lot of this will be legal briefing. Some will be factual development, particularly when it comes to some of these discussions with state legislators and use of the quote, unquote “bully pulpit” to speak to the members of the public.   She’ll be deciding are the acts official or unofficial acts, right. And official within the outer perimeter of official acts. And even if she were to determine that something is official acts, the majority has been clear that Jack Smith and the government get the opportunity to rebut that by showing that a prosecution for those official acts would not so interfere with executive functions that it would, you know, basically cause the type of separation of powers problem that the court says it’s trying to avoid. And so there’s a couple of steps there, right? Could be she would just determine on the legal analysis in the factual record. Not official. Could be. She says it is official. But let’s just take, for example, communications with Brad Raffensperger about finding 11,700 hundred votes, right? She could say, so under the Supreme Court’s guidance, I’m not suggesting this right answer. I’m just trying to put like some context, right.  Andrew Weissmann: Yeah.   Mary McCord: She could say, okay, the Supreme Court said, you know, there’s an interest in the presidency in speaking to legislators raising concerns about election integrity, et cetera. So I think that him having a conversation with Brad Raffensperger, expressing to Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state of Georgia, that there are anomalies in the counting of the votes in Georgia and that he should reconsider these or take this alleged fraud into consideration. I think that’s official acts. Jack Smith could come back and then make an argument. Yes. But here he went well beyond that. First of all, there was no proof of fraud. As the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger explained to him, they’d already done an investigation. They’d already done audits. They found no evidence of fraud. And the president, President Trump, went further than that and said, I just need you to find these and actually implicitly threatened the secretary of state, as you may recall from that very lengthy, I think, 102-minute phone call. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, I do. Mary McCord: And then Jack Smith’s argument would be prosecuting for that absolutely does not interfere with executive function, taking care that the laws be faithfully executed, because this is really just about trying to pressure, coerce someone into making up votes. Then Judge Chutkan could have in front of her then something to be the basis of saying, okay, that is something that is permissible for you to be prosecuted on. Two last points. Two of the other challenges with this ruling is that everything I just said, one of the other really bizarre points made by the majority is that you can’t look to the president’s motive for doing things if they’re once they’re within official acts, which means as corrupt as that motive may be, as bad as it may be, as criminal as it may be, that can’t be considered if the act itself is official. So to me, that’s a little bit in conflict with saying the government can rebut whether prosecution for this official act would infringe on core executive, because what part of that rebuttal, to my mind, would be to what we were just talking about. He’s corruptly trying to get Brad Raffensperger to make up 11,700 votes.   Andrew Weissmann: Yes, absolutely. Because if you just sit there and say you can take any action and describe it in a way that makes it sound like it would be within the outer perimeter, is there anything wrong with the president calling the Georgia secretary of state? Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: No, of course not. Is that criminal? Now, they are allowed under this decision, to put in the substance of the call. But if looking at his personal motive is so relevant. And by the way, I teach Fourth Amendment law. The court has allowed you to look at intent and motive in deciding what actions you took and how to evaluate what actions. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: And also, of course, motive and intent, because we’re talking about a criminal matter, is core. But anyway -- Mary McCord: It’s key, right? It’s key.   Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: Intent is required in almost every single criminal prosecution. Andrew Weissmann: So how they actually deal with sort of what motive is, what isn’t, what’s in and what’s out, but that’s like, to use your phrase, thing one, which is that the state is not allowed to use motive and the court cannot consider that so Judge Chutkan could not consider it. And by the way, whatever she rules at this hearing is clearly going to come back. Mary McCord: Can go back up. Right. Andrew Weissmann: Right. There is like are you going to get to thing two? Mary McCord: Thing two. Like yeah, thing two. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, because thing two is big and that’s where -- Mary McCord: Thing two is huge. Andrew Weissmann: -- that’s where Justice Amy Coney Barrett actually -- Mary McCord: Really differs. Andrew Weissmann: -- she differs and she joins the dissents. So it’s 5-4 on the issue that you’re about to go to, Mary. Mary McCord: Right. And, you know, it’s funny because you just said the call comes in. And that makes me think of thing two, because the call, of course, at any hearing that Judge Chutkan has, will be able to listen to the whole call and make some determinations about whether it’s official or unofficial. But if she were to determine that it is official and that it wasn’t rebutted, thing two is the majority says you cannot, government, you cannot introduce evidence of official acts even to prove up the criminality of the unofficial acts. So once you get down to this core of something that’s unofficial that you can still prosecute on, you can’t use official acts as evidence of motive, of knowledge, of intent for the unofficial acts. Now, this would mean, for example, like I just said, if she were to conclude that the call was an official act, the Jack Smith would not be able to play that call, that recording of the phone call at trial, even if he was permitted to prove up other unofficial acts as part of the scheme, right, to actually overrule the will of the voters on January 6th. And this one so surprises me because the chief at argument --  Andrew Weissmann: Was so strong the other way, yes. Mary McCord: Yes. I also think it’s utterly perplexing because he drops a footnote to take on this example of bribery, which is the very example that he used in oral argument. He incredulously said to counsel for Trump. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: So are you telling me if a president promises an ambassadorial appointment in return for a bribe that the government can only introduce evidence of the appointment, but not the motive, the reason for that appointment, the bribe? And he said that can’t be. So he deals with that in a footnote and says, well, of course the government could put on public records evidence of the ambassadorial appointment and the government could put on evidence of the demand for a payment or whatever the bribe is in return for that ambassadorial appointment. So I’m not sure how that is squaring -- Andrew Weissmann: I agree. Mary McCord: -- with what he says in the text.   Andrew Weissmann: I know exactly because I don’t know what it means to say they could put on the appointment. The appointment came from the president. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And that’s an official act. I don’t understand the flip there. Mary McCord: I don’t either. Andrew Weissmann: So we address this so much because we were sort of saying Alito was sort of really trying to do something outrageous. But that’s where the court goes.  Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And what’s so interesting to me is on that it’s 5-4 because Barrett goes with the dissents. But I’m so surprised that the chief justice flipped to go with the majority here because essentially, he’s doing it. Mary McCord: But did flip (ph)? I don’t understand what they’re doing.  Andrew Weissmann: I mean, I think he did. I mean, he says it. I mean, he absolutely says. Mary McCord: But then you have the footnote. And here’s what he says in the footnote. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: What the prosecutor may not do is admit testimony or private records of the president or his advisors probing the official act itself. So that is doing some limiting work. It’s just not entirely clear. And I tell you, I’ve read that footnote and the paragraphs that it drops from like four times. And I still got to think more about that. Andrew Weissmann: It just makes it, I think, very hard to prove up, because if you can’t get into those details, how do you really show that this was done as a result of the bribe? Otherwise, you end up with a bribe and an appointment. But there always can be some legitimate. You could get money coming in. Mary McCord: A payment of money and an appointment. That’s what you get to tell the jury. Andrew Weissmann: Great. And I guess and they’ll be saying, but the money had nothing to do with it.  Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: There were independent reasons to do it. And you can’t put on any of the connective tissue. I just don’t understand how the chief justice flipped on that. I mean, and he seemed so incredulous, as you said, at the oral argument. And this is, I think, by the way, listeners should know the reason that we’re so focused on this is because, Mary, you and I are trial lawyers at heart. And so we’re thinking of just how difficult this makes a prosecution. Mary McCord: Depending on, again, the results of hearings about what’s official and unofficial, which are going to cover anything, makes it hard also, and I know we’ll come back to this probably after we talk with Trevor or while we’re talking with Trevor, what could Jack Smith do now, right -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- in light of this ruling? Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Perfect segue. So, let’s take a break and then we’ll come back and we will have a discussion with Trevor Morrison, who I know you and I are both dying to talk to, to get his read on this as a subject matter expert.   Mary McCord: Yep. See you after the break.   (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, our friend and Andrew’s colleague Trevor Morrison joins us now. He’s a law professor and the Dean Emeritus at New York University Law School. He was previously a professor at Columbia Law School and Cornell Law School and an associate counsel to President Barack Obama. So, Trevor, we have been talking for the last half hour or so about this decision, kind of on the broad strokes of what it says in terms of what things the former president has immunity for and what things he does not. But I think a lot of the area is gray, right? Official act immunity for things that are part of his core constitutionally committed responsibilities. But as Andrew and I have been discussing, the court read that more broadly than I think we would have. And I’m curious your view of that. No immunity for unofficial acts, but the devil is really in the details in the middle there. What about the things that are not core constitutionally committed responsibilities, but are within what seems to be quite an expansive reading of outer perimeter official acts? So I guess I’d love to just hear your big picture on all of this, and then maybe we can get into some more details and maybe even what are the available options for Jack Smith and the government and the judges in the lower courts? Trevor Morrison: Sure. I’m glad to be back with you. Yeah, I think the sort of highest level of generality is the court hasn’t announced a categorical sweeping immunity that can’t possibly be overcome by any of the charges that Jack Smith is purporting to bring against Trump. It has announced a much broader conception of immunity than I think it should have. And maybe most tellingly, it has left immense amounts of work to be done by the lower courts on remand to the extent the court thought it important to provide any sort of clear definitive answers to questions that are pertinent to this case. So I read the court to be saying that it’s really not going to be possible to pursue any charge against Trump that focuses on communications between Trump and the Department of Justice, for example, whether that is, you know, threatening to remove an acting attorney general or just, you know, interacting with anyone in the Justice Department. That’s just going to be all conceived of as part of an unreviewable exercise of official capacity authority of the president to oversee the Justice Department and to be ultimately responsible for taking care that the laws are faithfully executed. So the big story there, I think, is that the court apparently felt it incumbent upon itself to take some of the things off the table altogether by saying, you know, there’s just no way that these elements of the case will be able to go forward. Andrew Weissmann: Could I ask you about that? Because I think the theory there was that part of the Take Care Clause makes this something that sort of exclusively within the province of the presidency. And Trevor, I know when we had talked about this before the decision, you sort of had this idea that in that there would be some core -- Trevor Morrison: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- presidential functions that could be absolutely immune. But if you put it in the Take Care Clause, just to be a nerd here for our audience, I mean, where are the limits on that? They didn’t really, to me, articulate why that is limited to the Department of Justice. And that’s scary enough to think that a president can use the Department of Justice in any way, shape or form, or at least those communications with the department in any shape or form for criminal purposes. And that’s absolutely immune. And then take care could include so much more than just conversations with the attorney general. Trevor Morrison: I agree with all of that. So just to step back one-half step, right, you’re right that going into the oral argument in the case, I was among those who said that, you know, I think there is a very good argument. The president does enjoy a modest scope of what I would call absolute immunity. And I don’t think actually anyone on the court explicitly disagreed with that proposition. Some thought it was relevant to the case as currently postured, others thought not. But I would never have thought that the take care authority fell within that bucket. We’re talking about these things like the veto power, the pardon power, the recognition power, those elements of presidential power that belong to the president and belong to him so exclusively that they are not subject to regulation whatsoever.   And that’s the first category that Roberts began with. But as Justice Sotomayor points out in her dissent, that category essentially becomes irrelevant because it gets swamped by the second category, which is just a very broad conception of immunity for anything the president does in his official capacity, subject only to the overcoming the presumption that you described, Mary, if the government can show that even though the president acted in his official capacity here, pursuing these charges would not pose any danger of intrusion on the authority and functions of the executive branch.  We don’t know what it looks like to apply that standard. That’s some language drawn from the Nixon versus Fitzgerald case, but we really don’t have any really textured sense of what application of that standard will look like. So there’s that. Then, Andrew, what you’re asking about is what are we to make of references by the court to the Take Care power? I don’t know that the majority has to be read as broadly as Justice Sotomayor worries about in dissent. She may be right that the court seems to be suggesting that any element of the Take Care power is beyond regulation by Congress. That just doesn’t make any sense to me insofar as what it means to take care that the laws are faithfully executed is you have to attend to the laws that are enacted by Congress. So I think what the majority opinion says about the president’s relationship to the Justice Department, at least on a first pass, I’m not justifying this. It seems like the court is just picking out that relationship between the president and the Justice Department as running especially to the core of presidential authority and just doubting that it will ever be possible to interpose a special counsel between the president and the Justice Department to pursue charges there. But the Take Care Clause doesn’t justify that move by itself. Or if it did, it would justify a whole lot more that I think goes beyond what even the court would be prepared to say.   Andrew Weissmann: So let’s just take a hypothetical. Let’s assume that there is a tape recording and video tape like the Brad Raffensperger call where the president says, I’m replacing the attorney general because I want to have a new attorney general who is going to institute a fraudulent case, and the person says that on tape. Now, the hypothetical is there’s no question. That’s what the conversation is.  Mary McCord: Let’s get more specific. I want my Justice Department to investigate all of my political enemies, including those who prosecuted me and I don’t care if there’s any validity or not. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. Mary McCord: That’s what I want him to do. Let’s say that’s explicit. Andrew Weissmann: And let’s assume that it’s actually worse than that. It’s like, I know that there’s no evidence, but I want to have them prosecuted. Trevor Morrison: Right. So I think this hypothetical is bringing us to some of the most shocking elements of today’s opinion. And they’re on two levels for me. One is what the court’s opinion says about presidential contacts with Justice Department leadership in general. I read the court to be saying that is always and in every case conduct in the president’s official capacity. We might agree with that because it’s going to be hard to imagine the president acting in a purely personal capacity when the attorney general takes his call and he’s only taking the call because it’s the president.   But then I think the court is also saying that it’s not prepared to accept that there would be any circumstance where a prosecutor could overcome the presumption of immunity in that case, that any charge would necessarily pose a danger of intrusion into the authority and function of the executive branch. And that’s shocking, but it’s more than that, right? The court also says in trying to figure out the boundaries of official conduct or not motive or purpose on the part of the president never matters.   And so all of the cases, Andrew, when you and I have talked about this in the past -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes.  Trevor Morrison: -- as a prosecutor, you rightly bring up that mens rea is often the whole thing that tells you about whether you’ve got a permissible purpose or a corrupt one. The court’s taking that off the table entirely for purposes of deciding whether the president has acted in his official capacity. And then it’s even worse because of somehow you could figure out that there was some aspect of what the president had done that was correctly understood to be him acting in his private capacity. The court has taken off the table the ability to rely on any official capacity acts to sort of inform our understanding there. I thought Justice Barrett had it exactly right in her concurrence when she says, well, then how could we ever under pursue, say, a bribery, you know, prosecution? You have to be able to talk about the quid and the quo. And all that the chief justice has to say in response to that as well, you can rely on public information, but suppose it’s a phone call between the president and the attorney general along the lines of what you’ve hypothesized. Mary McCord: Andrew and I were talking about this at the break, and this is one of the more surprising parts of the opinion, because the chief during oral arguments seemed to be exactly where Justice Barrett is. And so this seemed like a complete flip. And his footnote does seem to be a little bit in opposition to the broad brush of you can’t put on, you know, any evidence of official acts. And if the only difference, is you can only put on public record, not the only difference because it’s a big difference, but you can put on, you know, public record information, but not the reasons for it, I don’t see how you’re any less hamstrung than you would be if you couldn’t put on, you know, any of it.   Trevor Morrison: Yeah. I mean, I think there are multiple ways to think about that footnote, too. And I’ve been puzzling over it. Mary McCord: I’ve read it five times trying to say, is this actually pulling back on what’s in the text? Is there still an opening here? How do you apply this? Trevor Morrison: I mean, one question is, once Justice Barrett wrote what she wrote, why didn’t the chief just go along with it? I assume he was going to lose Alito and Thomas over this. And so, and might there have been a possibility of a different five at that point -- Mary McCord: So what? Lose them.  Trevor Morrison: Well, then you lose your court. Andrew Weissmann: I have a question. What is that in the context of this decision? What would that mean to lose them? In other words -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- like they were going to sign on to this. Maybe they wanted to be further. Mary McCord: They could dissent from that part, right? Andrew Weissmann: I don’t understand why it wasn’t 5-4 the other way, because it ended up being 5-4 on this issue. I don’t --  Trevor Morrison: Right. Mary McCord: I just couldn’t understand why he didn’t go along with Barrett. Trevor Morrison: I think it’s a great question. I’ve wondered, I mean, from the oral argument, I thought, okay, this is awfully a consequential case. Presumably the chief justice will want to write. But if, you know, remember the Halcyon days when we thought maybe the court would want to decide this case quickly, you know, the quickest path to that would have been to give it to Barrett based on her questions during oral arguments.  Mary McCord: Yes. Trevor Morrison: And her short concurrence is super smart. As you know, although I’ve thought it was fine to call it immunity in the space of exclusive responsibility, she said, I wouldn’t call it immunity, but I would let the president raise it on the front end, which is really the only thing that mattered to me. And then she kind of folds in the clear statement rule of sorts by deciding you have to figure out whether the statute applies. She wouldn’t quite use the clear statement rule. Mary McCord: Yeah, she wouldn’t say you have to. It has to clearly say it applies to the president. But yeah. Trevor Morrison: Right. But she said that the layers of protection here are first, does the statute even govern the president? And second, does it implicate? And so -- Mary McCord: The Constitution, yeah. Trevor Morrison: I wondered almost, was there the possibility of, say, the three dissenters joining Barrett? And then does it come down to this evidentiary thing as the reason the chief wouldn’t have gone along with that position? Because as troubling as the majority opinion is on a number of these points, the greatest trouble is just going to be in the difficulty and time it will take to sort out these questions. And if you thought that the questions that the lower court had to face were as described in Justice Barrett’s concurring opinion, the path going forward would look clearer. And Barrett, at least, says for most of them, except this evidentiary one, that’s what she thinks the court is saying. Mary McCord: Yeah.  Trevor Morrison: And so there was a more minimalist thing here. Mary McCord: That’s a perfect segue. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Let’s take a quick break. And when we come back, Trevor, maybe talk to us a little bit more for people who haven’t read or are in the weeds on Barrett’s decision. Maybe we can go over just a broad brush what it says. But then let’s talk about sort of for this particular case, even though this case is so huge for America writ large, let’s try and talk about what we think is going to happen now with this decision. But let’s take a quick break. Trevor Morrison: Sure. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Welcome back. Trevor, for those of us who have not read Chapter and Verse on Justice Barrett, who I have to say this term has really sort of been really interesting to watch, and is definitely an active mind. And not that everyone’s going to agree with her on everything, but has proved to be an independent thinker. Also, by the way, just a note, beautiful writer. But can you walk us through sort of what you think is sort of the key parts of her? Like, how does she come out? What’s her reasoning? Trevor Morrison: Sure. Let me just agree with what you said in general about her. I’ll go further with no real offense intended to the other two Trump nominees. I think in the course of this term, Justice Barrett has showed herself to be by far the most nuanced and careful and insightful thinker of the Trump nominees, not even close. Mary McCord: Agree. Trevor Morrison: So in this case, she first of all sort of resists the idea that we would be talking about this as immunity at all, but she thinks there are constitutionally and statutorily based limits on the prosecutability of a president. And she would think about it in two steps. And she thinks that both of these steps need to be addressed pre-trial, not simply as defenses in trial. And she thinks that both of them should be able to be pursued on appeal pre-trial. So that’s functionally operating kind of like an immunity doctrine, though she wouldn’t call it that. The first she says is, look, you can imagine things that presidents might do that are deeply objectionable to people, but that doesn’t mean always that it violates the law. And so she gives examples, an interesting one from the Obama administration that was raised by the Trump people, was Obama’s ordering of a targeted drone attack on a United States citizen. And there is a federal statute that prohibits murder when done by U.S. personnel.  There’s also an office of legal counsel opinion that’s been made public in the years since then that took up this very question, but didn’t decide it in terms of constitutional doctrine of presidential immunity or anything like that. It said there is a background principle of statutory interpretation that says the general homicide statutes don’t apply to public authorities like law enforcement or the military when they’re operating within the scope of their authority. And so the public authority exception, she says, look, I’m not saying this has anything to do with this case, but that’s an example of how just figuring out whether the statute even applies to presidential action that we would otherwise think is unlawful in other circumstances not involving the president, that’s a real limit on the extent to which the president is prosecutable. And then she would say, okay, if the statute by its terms does govern the president, and she’s not using a clear statement rule here, to be clear. She’s not saying the statute would have to call out the president by office in order for it to apply. If it as ordinarily interpreted, including using rules like the public authority exception, should be understood to apply the president’s actions, would application of it in this case implicate some core constitutional concern? And I would call it immunity, but she would say the constitutional defense, if you want, that she would recognize for the president are where the president is exercising powers that he has been given by the Constitution exclusively and closely adjacent actions. She doesn’t define what that is, but she’s imagining things that maybe it’s not literally within the president’s exclusive power, but it’s very close to something that is exclusively the president’s. And she would give him a kind of buffer. I’ve been wondering if the way to think about that is something like a qualified immunity buffer around exclusive presidential authority. Andrew Weissmann: To take a term that I don’t think people use anymore, a penumbra. Mary McCord: Yeah. Trevor Morrison: An emanation on a penumbra? Yeah, possibly. And she says, if we think about it that way, there will be lots of times when even though the conduct in question is official, it’s official conduct, there’s no reason to think that there’s any constitutional problem with pursuing the prosecution because it doesn’t implicate any core presidential power or any closely adjacent activity.   Now, she says this in the course of concurring in the majority opinion, not concurring in the judgment, but concurring in it. So, one way to read this is that her more straightforward, I think, simpler, more concise, easier to understand standard, she thinks is compatible with what the majority has said. I think there’s going to be a lot of play in the joints. I mean, one possibility on remand is that the law will end up looking, if we ever apply any of this, will end up looking like what Justice Barrett has said. But I think there are also opportunities to read the immunity much more broadly, given language that Roberts used in different parts of his opinion. Mary McCord: For example, she goes further than the majority. You know, what the majority does is says some things, the communications with the Department of Justice that are absolutely immune, doesn’t carve out anything that is definitely only unofficial conduct. But she would, in a footnote, she makes clear. She says, take the president’s alleged attempt to organize alternate slates of electors. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. And so, even though she said sometimes it might be hard to sort official conduct from unofficial conduct, she says, it’s not always going to be difficult. And this is a place where it’s not difficult. The majority didn’t go that far. They basically said, we’re going to send this back to Judge Chutkan to figure out in the first instance after briefing and factual development, but even suggested with respect to that scheme that, you know, there’s parts of the president’s communications with state legislators and others that might be official. Trevor Morrison: Yeah, I agree with you. I think so in principle and maybe in practice, it will be possible, I think, for the lower court to come out on the fake elector scheme where Justice Barrett would come out. But just as a matter of, you know, exercising the judicial power in an institutionally minded way, I think it’s quite unsettling that the Chief Justice saw no need to provide even one illustration of something that would fall --  Mary McCord: Yes. Trevor Morrison: -- on the not immune side of the ledger. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Trevor Morrison: He took some things categorically off the table, like interaction with the Justice Department. Mary McCord: That’s right. Trevor Morrison: Why not say that on the allegations in the complaint, of course, they have to be proved, but on the allegations in the complaint, the interaction with the fake slates of electors is obviously not official conduct. Or for that matter, why not tell us how the SEAL Team 6 hypothetical comes out? Mary McCord: Right. Trevor Morrison: Now, I understand that’s just a hypothetical, but Justice Sotomayor is left to say in dissent that it looks like the majority opinion would treat that as immune. Mary McCord: That’s right. Trevor Morrison: Now, I don’t know if that has to be the way to read the majority opinion. I think it’s clearly official capacity conduct. So it’s just the question of whether the prosecution could overcome the presumption there. But the fact that the majority didn’t even feel the need to speak to that issue. Mary McCord: That’s right. Trevor Morrison: There’s this one sidedness to the issues that did resolve that Justice Sotomayor points out, and I think in a very convincing way. Andrew Weissmann: Well, to me, I think that’s a really key part of this, which is to the extent that you saw this sort of policy debate as to what are you more worried about? Are you worried about prosecutors run amok? Are you worried about presidents run amok? And you saw that at the oral argument. The idea that you’re going to come out on the, we’re worried about prosecutors run amok, but we’re not going to do even a brushback pitch to say in the oral argument, don’t start thinking about this because that’s a problem.   Mary McCord: Right. Trevor Morrison: Right. Andrew Weissmann: There wasn’t any attempt to give those kinds of categories, even the claim about what would be personal conduct. They say perhaps not even saying it’s sure, but perhaps when you’re acting as a candidate, that would be personal. And I was like, what do you mean, perhaps? It’s like --  Trevor Morrison: They walk back Trump’s lawyer’s own concession on that point.   Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. Trevor Morrison: Yeah. Mary McCord: That’s what I was just going to say. They didn’t even accept the concessions. They sort of said, ah, that’s what one lawyer says, you know, at argument, but you still have to look at it independently. So that did feel very one-sided. Trevor Morrison: Yeah. I mean, I recall Justice Gorsuch’s comment during oral argument, which was pilloried a bit by some commentators afterwards that, look, when we decide this case, he’s admonishing, I think, Michael Dreeben at that point, we’re writing for the ages. Well, then to decide to write for the ages, and I don’t know, it’s like writing only for the odd number of years in the ages -- Mary McCord: Right. Trevor Morrison: -- or something like that. I mean, it’s a very one-sided approach to the kinds of issues that needed to be resolved and then that were going to be left unresolved. Mary McCord: So what do you do? What do you do if you’re Jack Smith and if you’re Judge Chutkan? Andrew Weissmann: I mean, I take it you think that there can be and there will be a hearing before Judge Chutkan. Obviously, there isn’t going to be a trial because all of her conclusions can be appealed. Trevor Morrison: Right. Andrew Weissmann: But I take it there can be, upon briefing, which the Supreme Court pointedly said she should have, meaning it can’t be immediate, there’ll be briefing. Trevor Morrison: Right. Andrew Weissmann: But it sounds like there will be a hearing. And so, you know, the small picture is I think there will be an opportunity for Jack Smith to call witnesses and witnesses that have not necessarily been heard from before the January 6th hearing to wit the former vice president of the United States, various lawyers for the White House who testified in part but not fully before the January 6th committee. Those may be part of what’s allowed, but they will run up with a lot of objections as to what they can say. Trevor Morrison: Yeah. I think it’s into that set of weeds that Jack Smith must now venture. I agree with you that, you know, unless the prosecution is going to be abandoned, and I assume it won’t be in the near term, the next thing is briefing and a hearing to try and go allegation by allegation. But whether the vice president could be called, who within the White House could be called without running afoul of this evidentiary limitation, which is the other big disagreement between, as we were discussing, between the chief justice and Justice Barrett.   Justice Barrett is with Justice Sotomayor and the other dissenters on the unwisdom of having an evidentiary bar there. So I think evidentiary hearings on communications with the fake slates of electors and with state level officials is easier to imagine happening over any objection, whereas I think just the act of objecting to trying to put on the former vice president or high-ranking White House officials itself may need to go up on appeal before the hearing even happens. I don’t know. But it seems to be a dimension of the immunity, according to the chief justice.   Mary McCord: I think there’ll be that argument. But I didn’t read the majority to be saying for purposes of pretrial motions where you’re trying to decide what’s official and unofficial, because how would you even know what’s official and can’t come in as evidence when you’re still trying to figure out what’s official and what’s unofficial? I read it to be once those decisions are made, the things that fall on the official side of the lever can’t be introduced as evidence at trial. But all of that said, that doesn’t mean Trump’s attorneys won’t make the very argument you just teed up. Trevor Morrison: I think it would make sense for the rule to be as you’ve described, but dinner is on me, Mary -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Right  Trevor Morrison: -- if Trump’s lawyers don’t raise the argument. Andrew Weissmann: Trevor, do you have any last thoughts on sort of either small picture or just big picture in terms of what you think this means? I mean, I sort of went off the deep end before you came on about big picture because I thought this decision was so much worse than I anticipated. I had read what you had written about this and I’d listened to you speak about it. And so I was all in on the Trevor Morrison approach. But I think this is about as close to applying the civil standard with some aspects that are even worse though, as we talked about in terms of the evidentiary components. And I just wondered what you thought sort of big picture, how people should be thinking about this in terms of the presidency in our democracy. Trevor Morrison: Yeah, it’s a shocking decision to me. As you said, I’m among those who have said that just under some standard separation of powers principles, there is a core of presidential conduct that I would say is properly recognized as immune from prosecution or that the Constitution bars prosecution of. And that’s like the first subsection of the chief justice’s opinion. But Justice Sotomayor is right that readers can just ignore that section because it is swamped by the rest of what the chief justice says. And the rest of what he says is an incredibly broad articulation of the theory of the immunity. I think an even more surprisingly broad semi-application of that theory in the context where he would apply it and an extension of the idea on this evidentiary privilege piece. And so, you know, the court kind of bats away objections from the dissent and from punditry and others that this would place the president above the law.   I think it’s Justice Thomas and his concurrence. He says, no, no, no, presidential immunity is part of our law. So the president isn’t above the law. But frankly, those are just word games. If the answer to the president’s not supposed to be above the law is that, well, the doctrine of absolute presidential immunity is part of our law, so he’s not above it. Well, that would just be like saying that the monarch’s immunity is not placing the monarch above the law as long as the law recognizes it. The long-term implications here are to suggest that the circumstances in which the president can be held to account in the courts for even blatant illegality are far fewer than I think any of us supposed. And the court today said that in the name of, it said, protecting the presidency without, to my mind, nearly enough attention to what it takes to protect the rule of law and our constitutional democracy. The country is much worse today than it was yesterday. Andrew Weissmann: And if you think of our history, the examples of presidential abuse are much more legion and worrisome than the examples of prosecutorial abuse when it comes to the president, where, you know, the only thing you could really point to is either Nixon, which everyone agrees happened, or this, where we just had a conviction on the first of the charges. And there’s no reason to think that this didn’t happen. Certainly, the Mar-a-Lago case is totally open and shut. So that the concern for abuse is one I was really surprised about how this read in terms of we’re so concerned about the tit-for-tat, which was the Donald Trump argument when we have no history of that. Whereas you have had concerns about the misuse of the powers of the presidency, not just with Donald Trump. Trevor Morrison: Indeed. And the court, I think, is going to make it harder for the legal system to hold that kind of abuse to account in the future. Mary McCord: Well, Trevor, I, for one, I’m going to try to take what the majority said about this ruling is not as broad as the defense argued it is and see that as the opening here to salvage something. We are so grateful to you for joining us. Andrew and I will be back tomorrow on Tuesday, our normal recording time. We’ll, you know, give listeners any further thoughts we’ve had overnight after we sleep on this, assuming we sleep. But we will also discuss tomorrow something that we haven’t had a chance to talk about yet, which is the Supreme Court’s decision on the obstruction of an official proceeding.  And I’d like to say that has no impact on the Trump case. And I think it doesn’t, except this immunity decision has far more impact on the Trump January 6 case than that decision would. At any rate, we will be joined with Ryan Goodman, New York University law professor and our co-author in a piece we wrote, Andrew and I and Ryan for “Just Security,” that really establishes with the statistics and the numbers that the effect of that ruling is going to be extremely minimal, even as to the rioters who were charged with this. So please tune in tomorrow for more on that. And thanks again, Trevor. Andrew Weissmann: Thanks, Trevor. Trevor Morrison: Thanks for having me. Mary McCord: Thanks so much for listening.

Simone Biles is the best to ever do it. Here’s an overlooked reason why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/simone-biles-olympics-trial-stumble-reminds-us-great-rcna159875,"On Sunday night, Simone Biles made history once again, defying physics, gravity and precedent by becoming the oldest female gymnast to make an Olympic team in 72 years. In the first tumbling pass of her floor routine, the 27-year-old launched herself 12 feet in the air, a superhuman spectacle that sent fans and commentators into raptures, including NBC Olympics reporters who gushed on X that Biles was “LITERALLY LAUNCHING INTO SPACE.” With its unique blend of high-stakes drama, gravity-defying physical feats, and chase-your-dream story arcs, it’s no mystery why women’s artistic gymnastics is among the most watched Olympic sporting events. The audience is held captive by two distinct emotions: the breathless tension of waiting for an athlete to land a skill and the utter astonishment at their superhuman capabilities if they do. Biles’ gobsmacking performance and spectacular career also serve as a reminder that the sport is still grappling with the darker side of ambition and the determination to constantly push one’s limits. One historic moment in particular captured the sport’s high stakes and even higher expectations: gymnast Kerri Strug’s second vault at the 1996 Olympic Games.  As the legend goes, the hotly contested team final was drawing to a close, with Russia right on Team USA’s tail, and one event to go. After injuring her ankle on the first vault, 19-year-old Strug limps away, visibly stricken with pain and terror. The stadium is breathless with anticipation and pre-emptive heartbreak. Then, in one of the most made-for-television scenes in Olympic history, she returns to the mat and takes off for her second vault, sticking the landing on one foot. Her face shrivels in agony as the crowd goes wild, and she is carried off in the arms of her coach, Bela Karolyi. The heroic vault not only helped Team USA clinch their first-ever gold medal, but also landed Strug talk show appearances, a Sports Illustrated cover, a meeting with President Bill Clinton and the inevitable feature on a Wheaties cereal box. Less than a year after Strug’s triumphant vault, Biles was born. Today, there isn’t a single aspect of the sport of gymnastics that she hasn’t impacted in some way. As the most decorated gymnast of all time, the 30-time world medal winner currently has five skills named after her in the sport’s Code of Points. In 2021, after Biles decided to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympic Games citing her mental health, some members of the gymnastics community revisited Strug’s legendary vault. The verdict was nearly unanimous: It did not age well. Biles’ decision sparked an ongoing conversation about the safety and well-being of athletes in a sport where pushing your body to the physical limits of human potential tends to be the norm, rather than the exception.  “I’ve already seen comments and posts about how Biles ‘failed her country,’ ‘quit on us,’ or ‘can’t be the greatest if she can’t handle the pressure,’” one viral Facebook post read at the time. “Those statements are no different than Coach Karolyi telling an injured teen with wide, frightened eyes: ‘We got to go one more time. Shake it out.’ The subtext here is: ‘Our gold medal is more important than your well-being.’” The renewed debate signaled that the culture of women’s gymnastics had changed dramatically in the last 27 years. First, there’s the unprecedented dominance of the United States women’s team. Since 1996, they’ve earned an astonishing seven consecutive team medals at the Olympic Games and nine gold medals at world championships. The sport has also endured massive scandals, including the conviction of disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nasser, and the major shakeup to the sport’s leadership that followed.  The revelations about gymnastics’ toxic culture, coupled with the most dominant athlete in U.S. gymnastics history deciding to step aside to prioritize her mental health, seem to at least suggest a more positive and safe environment for athletes.  But watching this year’s U.S. Olympic Team trials, the shadow of Strug’s pain-enduring grimace seemed to be everywhere. On Day 1, dozens of competitors suffered wobbles, falls and injuries. It’s not because they’re lousy athletes — they’re unquestionably the best of the best. It’s because gymnastics is a mental battlefield, and all its players are in the line of fire. Commentators often describe this phenomenon as a competition “curse.” Once one athlete goes down, the spell becomes contagious.  Even Biles isn’t immune. Although her spot on Team USA is all but guaranteed, the 27-year-old nearly fell off the balance beam at the start of her routine on Day 1, despite being a four-time world champion in the event. She made no secret of how she felt about this. Fortunately, Biles has such a comfortable lead over her competitors that she could have completely fallen off the beam — and did, in fact, during Sunday’s finals — and still earned a spot on the team. Some of her fellow Olympic hopefuls weren’t as lucky. In the first 30 minutes of NBC’s broadcast, Kayla DiCello was taken away in a wheelchair in tears. Another fan favorite, Shilese Jones, struggled through her bars routine before pulling out of the trials altogether. With insurmountable pain written on her face, the camera emphatically cut away to her mother, who was sitting in the audience, also in tears. The abundant display of emotions underscores just how young the athletes are; many have yet to graduate high school. For most of them, going to the Olympics has been their dream since the time they learned to walk. Nearly all of their families made enormous sacrifices for them to be here. The pressure they’re feeling is about more than gaining Instagram followers or endorsement deals.  With the help of role models like Biles, gymnasts trying out for the Olympics today are given more space to push back against unrealistic pressure from a toxic culture that puts the team’s success over their individual well-being. These young athletes are claiming more ownership over their dreams and doing it for themselves. And somehow, that makes it all the more heartbreaking when we witness a fall, a missed step, a painful injury. Ironically, it’s this very pressure each athlete puts on themselves that makes women’s gymnastics so compelling to watch. The gut-wrenching agony of falls, slips and injuries reflects a crucial paradox about gymnastics: It makes the sport patently unwatchable, and at the same time, impossible to turn away from. While a certain amount of injuries and hardship is expected in any sport, it doesn’t make it any easier to watch athletes grimace through the pain of pushing their bodies to the outer limits of human capability. But 27 years after Strug’s heroic vault turned a toxic precedent into an immortal legacy, we can only hope that Biles’ unparalleled influence on the sport will help convey the message that your well-being is worth much more than a gold medal — or your face on a box of Wheaties."
DeSantis’ latest veto could have Floridians swimming in poop,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 3:14 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-veto-florida-beaches-sewage-rcna159849,"When conservative justices on the Supreme Court overturned the Chevron precedent last week — and essentially hampered federal agencies, or their experts, from instituting regulations as they see fit — it was a devastating attack in the GOP’s war on fact-based governance. Donald Trump’s Republican Party is a cult of personality that rejects empirical data when it’s inconvenient and crusades against institutions that impede its political goals. And at both the national level and state level, this movement is moving in sync. A new veto by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is proof positive. Among four vetoes announced by DeSantis last week, one of the bills — the bipartisan Senate Bill 165 — involved beach closures over water quality. According to the Tallahassee Democrat: In a letter justifying his decision, DeSantis claimed that the Florida Department of Health “should not be vested with the power to supersede local jurisdictions regarding the operation of beaches.” That sentence doesn’t really complete the thought, though, does it? What he’s really saying is that the department shouldn’t be vested with the power to close beaches even if it determines those beaches are rife with hazardous materials that could harm beachgoers. It shouldn’t surprise you that this is the same guy who cut funding for stormwater drainage while residents in his state were being battered by a tropical storm. Cruel and unusual lawmaking is DeSantis’ modus operandi. And he’s been on a veto tear this legislative session in particular, with many of his other vetoes exhibiting his far-right ideology. The SB 165 veto is arguably the most dangerous one for Floridians. A recent study listed two of the state’s beaches as being among the most polluted in the U.S., after their waters were found to have loads of harmful chemicals, stormwater runoff and raw sewage. You read that right: raw sewage. On that note, the Florida Department of Health recently issued a warning about other beaches due to potential fecal pollution, after finding high traces of a literally sickening bacteria — Enterococcus — that’s often found in human stool. Just another day in the life of Ron DeSantis: Florida’s anti-“woke” crusader.

Why I’m not ready to count President Joe Biden out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 3:03 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/biden-age-debate-disaster-trump-rcna159743,"This morning, we woke up to a sea of headlines and opinion pieces from major news organizations, former party leaders and loud whispers — mostly behind the scenes — from present leading Democrats who say it’s over for President Joe Biden. The New York Times editorial board says Biden is not the man he was four years ago, calling his candidacy a “reckless gamble.” Editors at Georgia’s largest newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, echoed that take, demanding that the president “pass the torch.” “Biden deserves a better exit from public life than the one he endured when he shuffled off the stage Thursday night,""  the board wrote. More than three days later, it is still hard to comprehend what we saw from the president on the debate stage. His performance was an unmitigated disaster by any measure. The weak, raspy voice, the inability to complete basic thoughts, and, most importantly, the failure to call out Donald Trump on his endless lies. And yet, the very next day in North Carolina, there was Biden, back to form, finding his voice, his winning smile, and the vintage sparkle back in his eyes. The two appearances were as different as, well, night and day.  On debate night, Biden was fresh off back-to-back trips to Europe. First, to Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day and a state dinner with President Emmanuel Macron. And then to Italy for the G7, followed by a flight across the globe to L.A. for a fundraiser with former President Barack Obama. Just 33 hours later, he was headed back to the East Coast. I question his schedule. It makes me angry that he was moving across the world in four different time zones. This is a lack of discipline. These were important events, but the stakes could not be any higher. Like many, I want to know: Was this a one-off episode, or a sign of what’s to come? Can his team — and the president himself — move forward with more discipline and also manage the fact that he is 81 years old? So let's talk about his age. Age is wisdom and experience that in the case of Biden leads to more bipartisan legislation passed than any president over the past few generations and the largest expansion of NATO’s alliance in history. Under Joe Biden, despite his age, America is stronger economically and militarily than at any time in a half-century. And while facts may not matter to Trump and his friends in far-right media, those are the objective facts and that is the undeniable truth.  But here's another truth: Age also needs to be managed.  With my 50 Over 50 lists, I celebrate women who are reaching their highest power well over 50, 60, 70, 80, even 90 years old. And every one of those women are managing their fabulous age. I don’t think it’s over. This moment in the race fits the entire narrative of Biden’s life. In his personal and professional life, Biden has repeatedly risen up from rock bottom. It’s what we love about him. So many draw hope from his ability to have perspective and to persevere when he is completely counted out. His list of losses and failures is long and would be unbearable for most. In 1972, his first wife and baby daughter were killed in a car accident. He had just been elected to the Senate and took his oath of office in his surviving sons’ hospital room to remain by their bedsides. In 1987, his first campaign for president came to an end, and so nearly did his life, when a few months later, he suffered a brain aneurysm. It was so severe that his doctor told him his chance of survival was less than half, and even if he lived, a long list of physical and mental limitations were likely. At his bedside before the surgery, he told his sons he was proud of them.  Joe Biden survived the surgery. Rehabilitated. And didn’t look back. In 2008, his second bid for the presidency came to another early end, after a poor showing in Iowa. He finished near the bottom with less than 1% of the vote, his campaign bottoming out — another low blow. And yet, that summer, Biden would be on the Democratic ticket as Obama’s running mate. Five years later, a year into his second term as vice president, Biden’s son Beau was diagnosed with brain cancer, believed to have been caused by his exposure to burn pits while serving in Iraq as a captain in the Army National Guard. Beau would die two years later, the second child Joe Biden would have to bury — the lowest of lows in his life. In 2015, there was another political failure when Obama chose to support Hillary Clinton as his heir apparent and not his own vice president. After numerous political and personal setbacks, Joe Biden may have questioned whether he would ever return to presidential politics again. And then came Charlottesville and the vile racist march by white supremacists and Neo-nazis across the University of Virginia campus. As a direct response to what he saw as a threat to our nation’s core values, Biden announced his third try for the White House. And just like his first two presidential campaigns, he was staring at an early exit in the race, stumbling in the first Democratic debate after a broadside by Kamala Harris. He finished a distant fourth in Iowa and an even worse fifth in New Hampshire. All experts, just like right now, said it was over for the man from Scranton. It was quite an awkward interview on the set of ""Morning Joe"" in New Hampshire. Awkward for everyone but Joe Biden. As his political obituary was being written, Biden was joyful and ready to keep fighting. “Our” Joe, Joe Scarborough, wrote a piece for The Washington Post at the time, titled “No matter how this race ends, I’m proud of Joe Biden."" “Whether his campaign can survive the body blows delivered by Iowa and New Hampshire remains to be seen, but Joe Biden has endured worse,"" he wrote. And yet once again, Biden found a way up from rock bottom. South Carolina gave his campaign new life, he secured the Democratic nomination, and the rest is historic — literally. As president, his legislative wins are unmatched: The American Rescue Plan, The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — the first legislative action on guns in decades — and the CHIPS and Science Act. Biden expanded health care for veterans through the PACT Act, signed marriage equality into law, and got the Inflation Reduction Act passed to address rising costs of living and deliver historic action on the climate. He appointed and got confirmation of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. He protected the Affordable Care Act and provided billions in student debt relief. He negotiated the toughest, most conservative border control bill in decades, only to see it get torpedoed by Trump, who cynically didn’t want a solution to the problem, only an issue to demagogue and campaign on. All the while, Biden solidified key international alliances, expanded NATO, and rallied the world in support of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. And right now, he is managing not one but two hot wars. Days after the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, Biden got on Air Force One to attend an Israeli war Cabinet meeting in person. This, after going to Kiev, Ukraine, by train via Poland, despite the tremendous risk and difficult conditions. Through it all, he delivered the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years, the strongest dollar in 50 years, and the most successful stock market of all time. So now, after Thursday’s abysmal debate performance, Biden finds himself at rock bottom again. And again, a chorus of Biden doubters has emerged. But my family and I have known this man and his family for decades, and I still believe in Joe. I’ve learned that counting him out is always a mistake and doing that now could be catastrophic for our country.  Do there need to be changes? Yes — both to his schedule and maybe even to those around him. And I’ll also say America needs an explanation and reassurance that the other night was a one-time event, not part of a larger problem. Biden likes to tell people, “Don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative."" So let’s take a quick look at the current alternative. Not a hypothetical, imagined new Democratic candidate, but the actual current alternative who was across from Biden at Thursday’s debate: Donald Trump.  The man who incited a political coup against our government and who indicates he won’t accept the results of the 2024 election if he loses again. The convicted felon, who faces three more indictments. The man who was found liable for sexual assault. The man who was found liable for business fraud. The man who brags about having ended a woman’s constitutional right to abortion — a decision that is killing women and babies and causing immeasurable and preventable agony for women across the country. The man whose tax proposals could cripple the economy, according to over a dozen Nobel prize economists. The man who would end key global alliances. The man who has promised retribution against his perceived political enemies. The man who, on a regular basis, makes no sense at all. Why aren’t there calls for Trump to drop out? Where are they? The Philadelphia Inquirer’s editorial board took a stand, writing, “To serve his country, Donald Trump should leave the race."" But where are the other editorial heads — leaders who see Trump as so unfit — saying that he should leave the race? Too many have become desensitized, misinformed and inured to Trump. His firehose of falsehoods has blinded some to what is right in front of you every day. Last week, ""our"" Joe said it may be time for Biden to consider stepping aside. He also said we should wait a few days to see how the president responds. We are shoulder to shoulder on that. I do agree that Biden has work to do. He has to do better. His team has to do a lot better. But I’m just not ready to count Biden out — not even close. Just as Joe and I were stunned by the president’s poor performance on the debate stage, we have also been surprised all weekend by the level of animosity toward Trump from people who once supported him. The debate acted as a wake-up call that was a loss for Biden, but not a win for Trump. The choice is one terribly bad night, versus a decade of destruction to our core beliefs, our democratic values and, yes, our Constitution. Someone who stumbled over his words for 90 minutes, versus someone who lied to the American people over and over. A man slowed by a cold, versus a man with a cold, vile and merciless heart. I think in the days and weeks ahead as we move away from this debate, clarity will hopefully set in. For me, Joe Biden is still the man for the moment. This is an adapted excerpt from the July 1 episode of “Morning Joe.”"

The far-right swept to victory in the first round of legislative elections after President Emmanuel Macron’s almighty gamble backfired.

Red states’ religious mandates for schools ignore basic history,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 2:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/oklahoma-louisiana-bible-ten-commandments-history-rcna159798,"In recent weeks, red-state Republican officials have revived a long-running conflict over religion in the public schools. In doing so, they have created an ahistorical justification for the Supreme Court to immolate long-settled precedents. First, Louisiana adopted a state law requiring that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted in every public school classroom. Not to be outdone, Oklahoma’s Superintendent of Public Instruction then announced that the state’s Board of Education would require public school teachers to use not just the Ten Commandments in their instruction, but also the Bible. Normally, we could state with confidence that both measures would be struck down by the courts, simply because the Supreme Court already struck them down decades ago. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms was unconstitutional. The court’s ruling against state-mandated Bible reading is even older than that, a 1963 decision striking down a Pennsylvania program.  But we no longer live in normal times. The current Supreme Court, one of the most radical in American history, has shown staggering contempt for long-established precedents and a willingness to fabricate new constitutional rationales out of thin air. Republican-led states, recognizing that the old rules no longer apply, have resurrected divisive culture wars issues that were once assumed to be settled. In an apparent effort to provide the court’s conservative majority with enough pretense to cast aside precedent, the new requirements in Louisiana and Oklahoma have been framed in an unusual way. The previous rulings by the Supreme Court naturally deemed mandates to promote the Ten Commandments and the Bible as “plainly religious in nature” and therefore clear violations of the First Amendment’s ban on the establishment of religion by the government. The new requirements coming out of Louisiana and Oklahoma, in contrast, have been crudely disguised as “secular” efforts to teach children key aspects of American history, rather than fundamental tenets of the Christian faith. When Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the Louisiana measure, for instance, he argued that posting the Ten Commandments would promote civics to public school students. “If you want to respect the rule of law,” he said, “you’ve got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.” The law’s language likewise argues that religious texts are somehow essentially secular, claiming that the Ten Commandments were “foundational documents of our state and national government.” Oklahoma lawmakers have employed similar justifications. “The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters. “Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation.” Such claims, however, are not borne out by actual history. Moses was not, in fact, “the original lawgiver.” The Code of Ur-Nammu and the Code of Hammurabi, to name two examples, were composed centuries before Moses lived. Even within the Bible’s own chronology, Noah advanced a set of moral laws long before Moses. The Ten Commandments were not, in fact, “foundational documents” for the government of the United States of America. There are aspects of the criminal code, of course, that overlap with some of the Ten Commandments. We have laws against murder and theft, and in some locales there are still laws against adultery, too. But just as many commandments have no counterpart in our criminal code, such as those against coveting your neighbor’s goods or “taking the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.” Most important, several of the Ten Commandments come into conflict with the Constitution. They contain specific mandates about exactly which specific God to worship, how to worship him, and when. These are direct religious instructions and they clash directly with the Constitution’s guarantee that individual citizens are free to worship — or not worship — any god, any way, anywhere. Likewise, the Bible was not, in fact, an “indispensable historical … touchstone” that now must be taught to students if they are to understand the founding of the United States. The founding generation was quite diverse in its thinking on countless subjects, including religion. Some were deeply influenced by it; others, not at all. Thomas Jefferson famously took a razor to his Bible to cut out anything remotely supernatural. What the founders did agree on, they set down in the Constitution, which is the actual “foundational document” for our government. Notably, there are only three references to religion in the Constitution, and every single one makes clear that the founders wanted religion kept at arm’s length from the government, and vice versa. Article VI bans all “religious tests” for office, a revolutionary change and a clear rejection of the theocratic crises that had rocked Europe for centuries. The First Amendment, meanwhile, bans the establishment of a national religion and the interference of the national government in the freedom of citizens to worship however they see fit. The founding generation believed that this arrangement was necessary for the protection of individual religions as well as the national state. The concept of a “wall of separation between church and state” came from Jefferson’s letter to the Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut, who worried that state-level laws there would impinge on their right to worship freely. Religion and government, Jefferson noted, could thrive only if they occupied separate spheres. If the Republican leaders of Oklahoma and Louisiana were sincere in their desire to teach students about the “foundational documents” of America and the proper role of religion in public life, they would post the Constitution on our classroom walls. Or, if they want a list of 10 items, the Bill of Rights."
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent is a clarion call against corruption,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 2:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/justice-jackson-dissent-supreme-court-grifters-rcna159828,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is calling out her fellow justices for enabling grifters.  At the end of last week, the Supreme Court continued its assault on public corruption laws with a Thursday ruling that provides a roadmap to graft. Interpreting a federal statute that prohibits public officials from accepting bribes, the majority held in Snyder v. United States that, so long as a gift is given as a reward after the official performs the corrupt act, no crime occurs. Snyder is just the latest in a long line of cases issued by Chief Justice John Roberts’ court that have gutted public corruption cases. In recent years, the court has also cut back on the application of corruption statutes in several cases. As Jackson noted in her Snyder dissent, this “absurd and atextual reading of the statute is one only today’s Court could love.” At issue in Snyder is a federal statute we used frequently to prosecute corrupt government officials when I served as a federal prosecutor. Section 666 prohibits state and local officials from corruptly soliciting, demanding or accepting anything of value “intending to be influenced or rewarded” in connection with government business. The case involved James Snyder, a former mayor of Portage, Indiana. Snyder was convicted of accepting a $13,000 payout from Great Lakes Peterbilt after steering the city to buy trash trucks from the company at a cost of $1.1 million. But because the payment came after he bought the trucks, the Supreme Court concluded Snyder did not violate Section 666 and overturned his conviction. Writing for the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh concluded that while the statute prohibits bribes that are paid before the commission of a corrupt official act, it does not cover “gratuities,” which are paid afterwards. Among the reasons for its holding, the court noted that the statute would otherwise fail to provide fair notice as to whether conduct was criminal. “Is a $100 Dunkin’ Donuts gift card for a trash collector wrongful?” Kavanaugh wrote. “What about a $200 Nike gift card for a county commissioner who voted to fund new school athletic facilities? Could students take their college professor out to Chipotle for an end-of-term celebration? And if so, would it somehow become criminal to take the professor for a steak dinner? Or to treat her to a Hoosiers game?” The majority’s lamenting the criminalization of gifts to public officials, who, after all, receive a salary for their work, is a bad look. This is especially true given the recent ethics challenges plaguing some of the justices. Jackson, joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, forcefully pointed out the flaws in the court’s logic. First, the language of the statute itself includes the word “reward.” What happened to textualism? Jackson blasted the majority for elevating “nonexistent federalism concerns over the plain text of this statute.” She also criticized the majority for taking the view that applying Section 666 to gratuities would give too much power to federal prosecutors for crimes that should be handled at the state level. “But woulds, coulds, and shoulds of this nature must be addressed across the street with Congress, not in the pages of the U. S. Reports.” In other words, she argued, the court is legislating from the bench by making policy instead of staying in its lane of interpreting the laws passed by Congress. Second, Jackson noted that limiting language in Section 666 already provides fair notice of the statute’s reach, which negates the majority’s concerns about the “prosecution of the gift cards, burrito bowls, and steak dinners that derail [the] decision.”  One such limitation of the statute is that it only covers officials of entities that receive more than $10,000 per year from the federal government. Jackson noted that ""when Congress has appropriated federal money, it does not have to sit by and accept the risk of operations thwarted by local and state improbity.” Suggesting that the majority’s real concern was its hostility to federal regulation over the states, Jackson defended the federal government’s duty to safeguard federal funds. Congress had every right to enact laws, she wrote, “to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.” The statute also only applies to conduct that is committed “corruptly.” The court, she wrote, has previously defined corruptly to mean “wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil” conduct, requiring “consciousness of wrongdoing.” That language would require proof that an official not only acted wrongfully in accepting a gift, but that the official knew they were acting wrongfully. This wording should prevent the prosecution of an official who accepts a small gift as a token of appreciation, a far cry from the $13,000 reward Snyder received for delivering a $1.1 million contract. Jackson’s opinion states what should be obvious: “Officials who use their public positions for private gain threaten the integrity of our most important institutions. Greed makes governments — at every level — less responsive, less efficient, and less trustworthy from the perspective of the communities they serve.” The majority should take the hint. "
Why RFK Jr.'s campaign is peddling the idea that the government may be 'satanically possessed',Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 12:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rfk-shanahan-conspiracy-2024-election-satanic-trump-rcna159473,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy’s campaign is best known for fringe conspiracy theories tied to vaccines and other medical interventions, such as the belief that antidepressants cause school shootings. But his running mate, Silicon Valley lawyer and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan, now appears to be dabbling in a wider and, well, more fantastical range of paranoid thinking about the world. Among other things, she has proposed that she and Kennedy are not just fighting against bad policies, but against “demonic” forces — a disconcerting phenomenon, for sure. But there is a potential silver lining: The claims are also more likely to be bought by voters who might otherwise vote for former President Donald Trump. A new report in Rolling Stone lays out how Shanahan’s rhetoric about the two party-system has taken a dark turn. In her pitch to the Libertarian Party in May, she argued that Kennedy could win because he “understands the deeply troubling, almost demonic forces that have overtaken our agencies, and our culture.” The hedge with “almost” does nothing to alleviate my concern that Shanahan seems to think Washington may need a literal exorcism. And in a post on X last week, she published a list of 12 things she believes that the “uniparty hates” and “most Americans love.” (“Uniparty” is a shorthand for the idea that the Democrats and Republicans are merely two faces of the same establishment party.) The list included “democracy,” “parents raising their kids,” “humanity,” and, at No. 7, “questioning if the government might be satanically possessed.” OK! Third parties often try to run on policy ideas that neither of the two major parties have an interest in. The Green Party historically contends that neither Democrats nor Republicans do enough to take care of the environment or attend to consumer safety. Libertarians argue that neither Democrats nor Republicans are willing to adquately shrink the size of government or make tax policies fairer. Shanahan apparently thinks that neither party is willing to reckon with an evil spirit’s possession of Uncle Sam.  Shanahan’s belief that the two-party system hates “humanity” also speaks to the belief that she and Kennedy are locked in a Manichean struggle between light and darkness. Yes, we live in a very politically polarized nation, but it’s still highly unusual to hear political leaders refer to their opponents as literally diabolical. Talk of the government as devilish does not just imply a certain kind of religiosity or paranoia — it has specific political valences in contemporary American life. Rolling Stone’s Tim Dickinson writes: It would be naive to think that Shanahan is stumbling into this rhetoric by accident. Like Kennedy, she has swiftly embedded herself in the far-right media ecosystem. At a recent event Shanahan said that she and former Fox News host and conspiracy theorist extraordinaire Tucker Carlson are “on the same page in every single way.” On social media she boosted an InfoWars host who was sentenced to prison for his role in sparking the Jan. 6 insurrection. Regardless of where Shanahan's privately held beliefs lie, there is no reason to assume she doesn’t know exactly what she’s tapping into with this speech.  Considering that Kennedy is consistently garnering around 10% in national polls, it’s unpleasant to contemplate how his campaign is potentially further mainstreaming QAnon conspiracy theories and corroding our social fabric. It is not good for influential political leaders to encourage people to believe that the mainstream political class can’t be trusted because it is hostage to satanic forces. It limits the possibility for dialogue across political boundaries; it’s one thing to be cynical about the ability of the government to get things done; it’s another thing to think that it compromised by the devil. This strain of mistrust can also intensify the likelihood of extremist violence, such as when a man fired a gun in Comet Pizza in Washington, D.C., in 2016 based on disinformation that it served as the base for a satanic child sex abuse ring. But if this kind of rhetoric continues and intensifies, it could be good news for Biden. Believers in theories of a demonic cabal in the government skew to the right, and it’s possible that voters who otherwise might be part of Trump’s base defect to Kennedy. In a narrow race, that could make a difference for Biden in some key states. "
Taraji P. Henson made Project 2025 the talk of the BET Awards,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 11:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/bet-awards-taraji-henson-project-2025-rcna159770,"Project 2025, the draconian plan supported by conservative groups to dismantle the government if Donald Trump is elected in November, was the talk of the Black Entertainment Television Awards on Sunday. The plan, which includes everything from rolling back civil rights legislation to restricting contraception and abortion access, would effectively place the United States under authoritarian Christian nationalist rule and purge people from the government if they’re seen as disloyal to Trump. And despite all its horrors, recent reports suggest many people still don’t know about the plan.  So it was noteworthy that Project 2025 and its role in the conservative movement’s plans to unravel civil rights protections received ample attention Sunday. Host Taraji P. Henson made multiple references to it. One came at the show's end when she encouraged viewers to research it, and another came during a midshow public service announcement. She said: Henson went on to reference Project 2025's proposals to require mandatory national service, which could include compulsory military service and has many people concerned about the reinstitution of the draft. She also talked about the potential for the next president to seat three Supreme Court justices. ""We need those seats, or we have no protection,"" she warned. During the show, she appeared in an ad with Vice President Kamala Harris, in which the two Howard University alums discussed the election and the civil rights at stake. The ad didn't explicitly mention Project 2025, but it did address the democratic principles — like bodily autonomy and voting rights — threatened by it. These kinds of messages struck me as significant. I’ve written at length about celebrities and pop culture figures using their platforms to promote Trump and his fascistic MAGA movement. It was promising to see the BET Awards effectively used to do the opposite — at least when Henson was onstage. Henson's messaging — and more like it — may go a long way in closing the existing information gap for many voters and Project 2025. Her words rang especially true Monday, when the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Trump's federal election interference case deeming presidents partially immune from prosecution over a wide range of actions. If Trump is elected and Project 2025 is put into action under these terms, Americans will all be living under an imperial presidency — authoritarian rule with no guaranteed end."
The fascinating defense theory in Karen Read’s murder trial,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"June 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 1, 2024, 11:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/karen-read-trial-jury-verdict-defense-rcna159344,"UPDATE (July 1, 2024, 2:50 p.m. ET): On Monday afternoon, Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial after the jury was not able to reach a verdict. My job is to follow legal stories in the news. Apparently, I’m not so great at my job. A month ago, when a nonjournalist friend messaged me to ask about my thoughts on the Karen Read murder trial. My response was: “Who’s Karen Read?” I didn’t know what they were talking about. Weeks later, and after many messages from other friends, I know who Karen Read is. I can’t avoid knowing who Karen Read is. This feels like the rare trial that has transcended the already-popular true crime realm and launched into the mainstream.  And as a Boston jury continues its dayslong deliberations, speculation is rampant. On Friday, the jury said it was struggling to reach a verdict. The judge told them to keep trying. And so we wait. Karen Read is a 44-year-old finance professor in Massachusetts accused of intentionally backing her Lexus SUV into her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer, and leaving him to die, unconscious outside a house party in a blizzard. There was damage to her vehicle, and Read allegedly made a number of incriminating statements at the scene of the crime, including: “I hit him. I hit him. Oh my God. I hit him.” Case closed, right? The prosecution’s case seemed pretty straightforward: a classic lovers’ quarrel turned deadly. Or maybe another common scenario: drunken-driver-didn’t-realize-she-had-hit-someone. So at first I didn’t understand why this case had sparked so much interest. Prosecutors had evidence of damage to the back of Read’s vehicle, evidence she was driving drunk, evidence that she had a “rough” relationship with the victim, expletive-laced voicemails from Read to the victim’s phone, and what seemed to be voluntary admissions by the defendant that she had hit the victim. But that was before I dug into the evidence, watched closing arguments and immersed myself in the defense’s theory of the case. Now, if I were on the jury, I’d vote not guilty.  I want to be clear here: I’m not so sure Read is innocent. Instead, I think there’s reasonable doubt of her guilt. And that means she’s not guilty. Read’s defense team has pulled off a rare miracle in criminal defense: They have constructed an alternate theory of police cover-up that actually has some evidence to support it. The defense doesn’t need to put out an alternate theory of the case. They have no obligation to prove someone else committed the crime. The defense has no burden. They can rest and just argue that the prosecution didn’t meet their own burden to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. But ideally, the defense would want an alternate theory of the case, so jurors have something to believe in. Jurors like to feel that they solved a mystery. But putting forward an alternate theory is much harder than simply pointing at flaws in the prosecution, or claiming “some other dude did it” (the “SODDI” defense). What Read’s defense did is even more difficult. Her lawyers are claiming the police did it — that the “other dude” in this case is law enforcement, framing their client.  Criminal defense attorneys will tell you, in moments of candor, that their clients often want to pursue this sort of defense. (“The cops planted those drugs on me!”) But most of the time, there’s no actual hard evidence of police planting evidence or a cover-up, and defense counsel wisely declines this strategy. But “the frame” can work. The O.J. Simpson defense team tried this tactic. It was a bold move. But the defense team pulled it off, despite the seemingly overwhelming evidence of Simpson’s guilt. Read’s defense team has done a similarly magnificent job of uncovering critical inconsistencies, and sloppy police work. They employed top expert witnesses. They crunched the data. The defense used the health app on victim O’Keefe’s phone to suggest that he went downstairs into the basement at the house party — despite the prosecution, and the party hosts, arguing he never made it inside. Read’s lawyers developed a theory that Read did drop off O’Keefe at the party, after which O’Keefe got into a fight with someone and was attacked by the family dog. Read’s defense brought in experts to say O’Keefe’s wounds were consistent with a dog bite, from a dog the size of the one in the house, who had a history of biting people. And, even if the police didn’t engage in a cover-up, they seemed to engage in questionable behavior. The lead investigator texted inappropriate comments about Read to others. Three different prosecution witnesses testified that at critical times, including the night of the killing, their calls back and forth to each other were inadvertent “butt dials.” But the “butt dial” itself is an anachronism. Phones don’t have buttons anymore that call people when you sit on them. It’s not a believable explanation for some suspicious phone calls. Certainly, the defense theory still has some holes in it. The most notable is why the police would engage in such a sophisticated cover-up, requiring a number of co-conspirators, but just leave the victim’s body outside of the house where the true crime was committed. Police officers should know better than anyone: If you’re going to “dump” a body somewhere, the worst place to do it is in your own front yard. Even as a criminal defense attorney myself, I find that I am frequently skeptical of defense theories. It’s fair to say that a lot of the time, the prosecution has put the right guy in the defendant’s chair. But I also know that police can be lazy, sloppy and, at their worst, willing to bend the truth to protect themselves and each other. In this case, I think the evidence at the very least suggests some degree of police self-interest and dishonesty. Most of this supposed cover-up required a lot of things to go right — not just the night of O’Keefe’s killing, but in the days that followed. The defense suggests that in the moments after an alleged fight, with a grievously wounded but still-alive victim, the best plan this group of friends could come up with was to just throw the man onto the house’s lawn. Sure, people make stupid decisions when they are drunk and panicked, but that’s a terrible plan. The prosecution pointed this out during their closing, while methodically marching through a lot of damning evidence against the defendant — much of it coming from the defendant’s mouth herself.  And still, I wouldn’t vote “innocent.” But I’d vote “not guilty.”"
Trump and Rubio try — and fail — to defend ‘Black jobs’ comment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-rubio-black-jobs-presidential-debate-rcna159765,"Quick observation from over the weekend: If our country’s pundit class weren’t overwhelmingly white, the framing of Thursday’s debate would have revolved around Donald Trump’s overt racism and not Joe Biden’s speech pattern. Because Trump’s false and bigoted claim about immigrants taking “Black jobs” instantly sparked widespread backlash — and it has arguably been the most talked about moment from the debate. Trump and his campaign have sought to pit Black people against immigrants (despite some Black people being immigrants themselves) to promote xenophobia, in hopes of aiding his election. His “Black jobs” claim was a tortured attempt to do that, despite the Black unemployment rate reaching a record low under the Biden administration. And, for the record, experts have since done what CNN failed to do during the debate itself: debunk Trump’s claim. So it’s remarkable that Team Trump is doubling down on the claim. Sen. Marco Rubio, who has effectively taken it upon himself to be Trump’s racism translator, tried to clean up the comments in the spin room on debate night. It didn’t go well. “When you flood a country with millions of people,” the Florida Republican claimed, “you’re going to have more competition for work. You are. And those workers are willing to do it at a lower wage.” Here, Rubio used racist and dehumanizing language to suggest that “Black jobs” are ... low-wage jobs. As an example, he mentioned construction jobs. I feel confident saying the majority of Black folks aren’t eager to work what are often backbreaking construction jobs, but that’s almost beside the point, which is that the senator is simply wrong. Evidence shows that immigrants actually drive job creation. Nonetheless, Trump repeated the claim himself at a rally in Virginia on Saturday, saying immigration is “the worst thing that’s happening” to Black people because immigrants are “taking the Black jobs.” Trump is taking one of the ugliest lines from his debate and turning it into a mantra."
The courts are not going to protect us,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 11:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/sotomayor-trump-immunity-dissent-election-rcna159769,"Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent in the Trump immunity ruling contained language unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Supreme Court opinion: What Sotomayor is signaling here is that it’s not just about the Trump Jan. 6 case. It’s about every president going forward, indeed possibly Trump next year, and being immune from criminal law — to be able to use the Justice Department in ways the court today calls ""absolutely immune"" to undermine elections, to go after individuals. This is as grave a shift in our constitutional system as any in our lifetime. If you ever thought about the stakes in November and what they were, this opinion makes them very clear. The stakes are now astronomical in a way they might not have been before. You have to have someone in power you can trust to execute the laws faithfully and to comply with the Constitution. But after this ruling, it's clear the law and the courts are not going to be a check against the next president. This is a clarion call for the American public to understand the courts are not going to protect us against a president who wants to violate the law.

Biden’s bid for term limits on the Supreme Court faces some tricky obstacles,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 1:24 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/biden-supreme-court-term-limits-reforms-rcna164073,"Among President Joe Biden’s three proposed Supreme Court reforms is term limits for justices. Biden wrote that he supports a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in “active service” on the court. The other two measures he mentioned are a constitutional amendment removing criminal immunity for presidents and legislation for an enforceable Supreme Court ethics code. The president’s Washington Post op-ed and White House fact sheet Monday are more ambiguous about the mechanism for term limits — that is, whether they’d come by legislation or amendment. As precedent for judicial term limits, both his op-ed and fact sheet cite presidential term limits, which were achieved by constitutional amendment.  The amendment vs. legislation distinction matters because any term-limit legislation that passes could be challenged on the rationale that the Constitution provides life tenure for justices. Not that such a challenge would necessarily succeed, and that’s why legislation might not kick justices off the court exactly but rather adjust their duties so that they’re still judges under the Constitution. Biden’s reference to 18 years of “active service” may be an acknowledgment of that consideration. So while any reforms are currently hypothetical with congressional Republicans opposing them, the success of term-limits legislation depends on its details (ethics code legislation would likewise face scrutiny from not only this Congress but also this Supreme Court, which jealously guards its power). Given the potential constitutional hurdles and constraints, a term-limit amendment could provide more flexibility to bring the court in line with other major constitutional democracies where justices don’t serve for life. On that note, Biden is correct to point out Monday that term limits would, among other things, “reduce the chance that any single presidency radically alters the makeup of the court for generations to come.” And like with the immunity amendment proposal, there’s value in keeping the court in the national conversation among the three branches of government. But when it comes to implementing term limits, the details and mechanism by which that reform is attempted will matter.

Excitement over Kamala Harris dims GOP's post-convention glow,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 12:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/harris-trump-enthusiasm-battleground-2024-rcna164057,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""Morning Joe."" President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race completely shook up what should have been the Republican Party’s post-convention glow. While Donald Trump did see a polling bump, as you would expect following a party’s convention, that wasn’t the story making headlines last week. No one was talking about what was discussed at the Republican National Convention.  Instead, the national conversation quickly moved past the convention and the focus shifted to the future: Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy.  Last week, for the first installment of Morning Joe’s 2024 presidential election focus groups, we visited the purple state of Wisconsin, where less than 30,000 votes determined the winner of around a dozen elections since 2000.  Campaigns use focus groups to test candidates, policy positions, and political messages. Focus groups are crucial because in order to win elections, you have to understand the voters. During my conversations, I noticed how different the energy was among voters last week, compared to when I was in Wisconsin just six weeks earlier.   Six weeks ago, Democratic voters were depressed. Now they’re energized. They might have some qualms about Harris, and she may not have been their first choice — but she is now. Democrats are in and they’re activated.  That isn’t to say Trump doesn’t also have enthusiastic supporters. We saw that fervor on full display at the RNC. But now, the test will be whether Democrats can match and sustain that enthusiasm this time around."
Trump and Vance’s terrible week was brought to you by TPUSA,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 12:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/turning-point-usa-trump-vance-tpusa-rcna164113,"For all the talk over the past few years about Donald Trump making the Republican Party in his image, it seems increasingly clear to me that he is merely the useful figurehead of a right-wing movement led by activists like Charlie Kirk and others in his well-heeled organization, Turning Point USA. I’ve written a lot about the GOP’s deference to Kirk and his extremist-friendly organization, which has maintained its conservative clout despite repeatedly backing failed candidates. The past week has underscored TPUSA’s power over Republicans as well as the organization’s inseparable bond with Trump and his inner circle, as two controversies surrounding Trump’s campaign had connections to TPUSA. In a speech Friday, Trump claimed that if he’s elected, Christian voters won’t need to vote in 2028 because everything will be “fixed.” These illiberal remarks give the clear impression that Trump is forecasting the end of democracy. And notably, he made these comments at a TPUSA-sponsored event for Christians known as “The Believers’ Summit.” And this came mere days after it was revealed that Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, had written a glowing review for a book written by far-right commentator Jack Posobiec — a Turning Point contributor who is known for his promotion of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory. Posobiec’s book portrays liberals as “unhumans.” As HuffPost reported: These connections between Turning Point USA and the GOP ticket speak to the extremism undergirding the MAGA movement — and TPUSA’s stranglehold on the Republican Party."

"As Biden unveils Supreme Court reform plan, what happens now?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 11:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-unveils-supreme-court-reform-plan-happens-now-rcna164135,"When President Joe Biden delivered an Oval Office address last week, announcing his decision to end his re-election campaign, the Democratic incumbent briefly touched on some of the priorities he’d pursue in his remaining months in office. Though he didn’t go into any details at the time, Biden told the public, “I’m going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy.” Evidently, he meant it. NBC News reported: In addition to the Post op-ed, the White House issued a fact-sheet overview of Biden’s plan, which has three key provisions: In the recent past, this list might’ve been seen as surprising. After all, Biden has earned a reputation as a longtime institutionalist. But he addressed this point directly in his Post piece, explaining, “I served as a U.S. senator for 36 years, including as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today. I have great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers. “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.” So, what happens now? For those hoping to see rapid reforms, it’s best to lower expectations. It would be up to Congress to pass legislation creating term limits for justices and a binding code of conduct, and that won’t happen anytime soon. Indeed, House Speaker Mike Johnson has already said the White House’s plan is “dead on arrival” in the GOP-led chamber. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained, adding a “No One Is Above the Law Amendment” to the U.S. Constitution is even more difficult. That said, it’s important to appreciate the fact that Biden has jolted a broader conversation. There are some Democrats on Capitol Hill who’ve proposed related reforms, but when it comes to moving an issue into the national spotlight, there’s no substitute for presidential influence. What’s more, Biden has created an intraparty dynamic in which Supreme Court reforms are likely to become an immediate staple of the Democratic agenda. Indeed, it wasn’t long after the president unveiled his reform plan when Vice President Kamala Harris endorsed the same agenda, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone when other Democratic leaders follow suit. Reforming the Supreme Court was on the periphery of the political discourse. Biden has changed that in a hurry, making meaningful changes more likely — eventually. Watch this space."
"Brazenly flip-flopping, Trump adds crypto to his MAGA agenda",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 10:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/brazenly-flip-flopping-trump-adds-crypto-maga-agenda-rcna164108,"Donald Trump tends to use vague language when talking about things he doesn’t understand, but when talking about cryptocurrencies, the Republican was willing to be specific. As regular readers know, the former president has called them a “disaster waiting to happen,” adding that as far as he was concerned, Bitcoin seemed “like a scam.” When it came to crypto, Trump said he was “not a fan,” adding, “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” While in office, he insisted that Bitcoin is “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” And then the evolution started. Ahead of an appearance at the Libertarian Party’s national convention, the GOP nominee declared online in May that he was suddenly “VERY POSITIVE AND OPEN MINDED” on the issue. Around the same time, the former president’s 2024 campaign announced that it would accept donations in cryptocurrency. Last month, one day after Trump met with leaders of several Bitcoin mining companies at Mar-a-Lago, he published a pro-Bitcoin message to his social media platform that he almost certainly didn’t write. In case the flip-flop weren’t quite obvious enough, the Republican removed all doubt over the weekend. The New York Times reported: At times, the audience heard a disjointed message. As he wrapped up his remarks at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, for example, Trump said, “Have a good time with your Bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you’re playing with.” The words of a man who’s given the subject considerable thought, to be sure. Earlier in his remarks, the candidate also asked event attendees to thank him for stopping the Biden administration from doing terrible things to the crypto industry. How, exactly, is Trump standing in the Biden administration’s way? I have no idea, and Trump didn’t say. Perhaps most notably from a policy perspective, the GOP nominee also vowed to create a “national bitcoin stockpile“ for reasons unknown. But with the election in mind, Trump also told his audience that Vice President Kamala Harris intends to wage an “anti-crypto crusade,” as part of an attack against the industry from “left-wing fascists.” What he neglected to say was, “Can you believe Harris is critical of crypto the same way I was before some wealthy donors encouraged me to change my mind?” Indeed, Politico recently published a report with a memorable headline: “Trump keeps flip-flopping his policy positions after meeting with rich people.” Unfortunately, it’s happened quite a bit. For example, Trump supported banning TikTok, only to reverse course after chatting with Jeff Yass, a billionaire hedge fund manager — and prospective campaign donor — who has a multibillion-dollar stake in ByteDance, TikTok’s parent corporation. Something similar appears to have happened with the cryptocurrency industry. Trump also started hedging on some of his immigration policies around the time he met with wealthy corporate executives at a Business Roundtable meeting. A few months earlier, Trump publicly suggested that conservatives should give up on their opposition to Anheuser-Busch shortly before he attended a fundraiser hosted by an Anheuser-Busch lobbyist. It’s tempting to see this as corruption, but it’s worth being more specific about what’s happened. Trump isn’t saying, “I’ll change my position in exchange for money,” he’s instead effectively saying, “Since I don’t care about governing or public policy anyway, I’ll just align my beliefs with my wealthy donors’ preferences.” If recent history is any guide, it’s only a matter of time before this list grows.

What needs to happen for Biden's presidential immunity amendment to pass,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 7:58 AM PDT / Updated July 29, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-reform-biden-constitutional-amendment-immunity-rcna164042,"It’s official: President Joe Biden is calling for Supreme Court reform. Among his three proposals is a constitutional amendment barring criminal immunity for presidents. Following the Supreme Court’s ruling bestowing broad immunity in Trump v. United States, Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Monday: As opposed to his term limits and enforceable ethics code proposals, this one specifically pushes for a constitutional amendment, which “will state that the Constitution does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President,” according to a White House fact sheet. So, how could an amendment happen? Article V of the Constitution states:  There have been 27 amendments, with the most recent one, regarding congressional pay, taking effect in 1992. And while there are different procedural ways to amend the Constitution, a National Constitution Center analysis notes that the method used for every amendment so far is that: So it’s not an easy process — nor should it be. And as long as Republican politicians are positioned to oppose diluting the Republican supermajority court’s power, then any proposed reform, no matter how reasonable, faces challenges. But Biden’s proposal, which he wrote in his op-ed “are supported by a majority of Americans” when it comes to all three proposed reforms, has started that national conversation.

How Kamala Harris is using Republicans' favorite rhetorical tricks against them,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 9:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-speech-freedom-trump-republicans-rcna163823,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign message is clear: She loves freedom and Donald Trump is weird. In the week since President Joe Biden dropped out and the vice president became the front-runner, she has upended the Democrats' campaign messaging, adding a sharp-edged contrast that borrows a lot from typically Republican rhetoric. Instead of Biden's more earnest approach, her campaign has leaned heavily into simple words with powerful emotional appeals. In her first campaign ad, she recast the Democratic agenda as centered on ""freedom,"" saying the word four times to highlight her support for workers (""the freedom not just to get by, but get ahead""), gun safety laws (""the freedom to be safe from gun violence"") and access to abortion (""the freedom to make decisions about your own body""). In case you somehow missed the message, the minute-long ad is set to Beyoncé's 2016 song ""Freedom,"" which repeats the word another 10 times. She also used the word a dozen times in her short speech at the Democratic campaign headquarters in Delaware, tying it into a broader historical narrative that included bolstering the ""sacred freedom to vote"" on her agenda. ""Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedom,"" she told the gathering of campaign staffers and volunteers. ""Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom from our founders to our framers, to the abolitionists and the suffragettes, to the freedom riders and farmworkers. And now I say team, the baton is in our hands."" In Harris' current campaign, ""freedom"" is favored instead of the more typical Democratic rhetoric about ""reproductive rights"" or ""the right to vote."" She's even recast labor rights as ""the freedom to join a union."" In doing so, she's reclaiming a word that the right has so dominated in recent years that an arch-conservative group in the House simply calls itself the Freedom Caucus. At the same time, the Harris campaign and its Democratic allies have made a sharp turn away from Biden’s serious approach in describing Trump world, adopting a more mocking tone. In a news release, the Harris campaign trolled the former president by saying that “Trump is old and quite weird.” After Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a potential running mate, posted a viral tweet calling Trump ""weird"" for a campaign speech riff on the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, he repeated the word multiple times in an MSNBC interview. For good measure, the Harris campaign also called Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, ""weird and creepy"" over old remarks in which he proposed stopping women from traveling across state lines to get an abortion. In both cases, the strategy is reminiscent of Trump's messaging: pick a simple theme and repeat it over and over and over, like his nicknames ""Crooked Hillary"" Clinton, ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi"" and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden or his promise to ""build the wall"" and ""make America great again."" It's also reminiscent of an approach pioneered by former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich. In 1990, a political organization with ties to him sent a memo to Republican candidates who wanted to ""speak like Newt,"" urging them to describe themselves with positive words like ""freedom,"" ""courage"" and ""strength"" and their opponents with negative words like ""bizarre,"" ""pathetic"" and ""sick."" (The memo even suggested calling rivals ""traitors,"" although in a moment that now feels quaint, the group's head told The New York Times that was a mistake.) The words underscored Gingrich's scorched-earth approach to politics by clearly marking out tribal lines: Your campaign represented all that was good and normal, while your opponents were weirdos who would destroy society if given power. It also made sense, given the starkly different demographics of the two major parties. With a base of college-educated voters, young people and minorities, Democrats are much less judgmental and even embrace being a little offbeat, as shown by things like the famous slogan ""Keep Austin Weird."" With a more homogenous base of voters, Republicans found it easy to single out a Democratic-leaning demographic for ridicule, casting random people like a pro-LGBTQ teacher or Black Lives Matter activist as being outside of the mainstream. Trump regularly called Democrats ""crazy,"" ""pathetic,"" ""sick,"" ""weird"" and ""ridiculous."" But in an ironic twist, all that tribalism made Republicans vulnerable to the same attack. Over the last three decades, many conservatives have become increasingly skeptical of mainstream media, burrowing deeper into alternatives peddled by the likes of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. With little pushback in these echo chambers and gerrymandered House districts, their ideas became increasingly extreme. Vance is a case study in this. His proposal to give parents more votes than adults who don't have children came from a speech at a conservative organization, and his attack on ""childless cat ladies"" on Carlson's now-canceled Fox News show. His idea of stopping women from crossing state lines for an abortion was aired on a far-right podcast and later followed up by a lobbying effort to allow police to access women’s health records. In a telling moment on that podcast, Vance described a bizarre hypothetical in which conservative bogeyman George Soros would send 747s full of Black women seeking abortions from Ohio to California. ""That’s kind of creepy, right?"" he told the host. Of course, Vance meant that his outlandish scenario would be creepy if it came to pass, but since nothing remotely like it is happening, he's the one who ends up seeming outside the mainstream. And with its new focus on calling Republicans ""weird,"" the Harris campaign is determined to let the rest of America know that, too."

"Despite his recent track record, Trump pushes bizarre predictions",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 8:29 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/recent-track-record-donald-trump-bizarre-predictions-election-2024-rcna164080,"Ahead of Election Day 2020, Donald Trump told supporters that a Joe Biden presidency would “unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions” and force the country “into depression.” We now know, of course, that the predictions were spectacularly wrong; the United States under Biden has seen a dramatic economic recovery, and Americans are now benefiting from the strongest economy on the planet. In theory, this would be around the time that the former president offered some kind of explanation for being wrong. In practice, Trump is simply recycling the same false predictions. At an event over the weekend, for example, the GOP presidential nominee, pointing to a claim no credible observers have actually made, argued that some believe “if Trump isn’t elected, this country is going to go into a depression the likes of which you had in 1929.” This is, of course, effectively identical to what the Republican predicted four years ago. He was wrong then, and there’s obviously no reason to believe the absurd claim has improved with age. But it’s not just the economy. Trump said crime rates would get worse under Biden, and instead they’ve improved dramatically. On energy policy, in late October 2020, the then-incumbent president declared at a rally that a Biden presidency would mean “no heating in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer, no electricity during peak hours.” Around the same time, Trump told voters: “Under Biden, there will no be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmases, and no Fourth of July.” How’d that one turn out? In August 2020, he also predicted that if Biden were to win, “we will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell.” Four years later, capitalism remains intact, there’s nothing boring about the United States, and I’m pleased to report that the country isn’t going to hell. I don’t doubt that Trump will continue to make ridiculous predictions in the coming months, but sensible observers should take note: This guy’s crystal ball clearly doesn’t work."

Axios added: “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words.

The GOP nominee effectively told a Minnesota audience on Saturday night that his partisan foes were right to question the reporting. The New York Times reported: “I want to be nice,” Mr. Trump said. “They all say, ‘I think he’s changed. I think he’s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him.’” But to a cheering crowd of thousands, Mr. Trump quickly conceded the point. “No, I haven’t changed,” he said. “Maybe I’ve gotten worse.” Let’s not forget that the morning after the attempt on his life, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United.” Hours later, the Republican was even more succinct, adding, “UNITE AMERICA!” This attitude has obviously been thrown out the window, as Trump effectively conceded over the weekend with his “maybe I’ve gotten worse” acknowledgement. On ABC News’ “This Week,” Martha Raddatz asked New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu yesterday about whether Trump is missing an opportunity by abandoning a “unity” focus. “He’s missing it now,” the Republican governor replied, “but hopefully they can get back on track.” What Sununu neglected to mention is that Trump, by all appearances, has absolutely no interest in getting a “unity” focus “back on track.” Consider what happened just two weeks before the 2018 midterm elections. Ten Democratic officials and/or veterans of the Obama administration were targeted with packages containing explosive devices, and soon after, Trump complained that media coverage of “bomb stuff” was interfering with the Republican Party’s election season strategies. Asked whether the mail bombs might lead to a shift in his political tone, the then-president replied: “Tone down? No. Could tone up.” Common sense might’ve suggested a more responsible course. Democrats were targeted with explosives, at which point Trump could’ve at least pretended to care about vitriolic rhetoric. He instead told reporters in the wake of the attempted violence that he was prepared to possibly make the toxic political atmosphere worse — on purpose. Nearly six years later, it seems very little has changed."

Joseph McCarthy facing the most serious challenge of his political life-- a looming censure vote in the U.S. Senate-- McCarthy’s most fervent supporters raise up an army to fight in his defense. The effort, which draws together mainstream Republicans and McCarthy’s most radical followers on the ultra right, will involve threats of violence, harassment, and an armed show of force on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rachel Maddow: They don’t appear to be policemen, not really. They carry themselves sort of like policemen, and they are wearing uniforms. But their uniforms are plain black. And there is a shield on their caps, but it’s a generic shield. If you squint, it kind of seems like a police thing. But it’s not. They’re not cops. One reason you can be sure they’re not cops is that when the real cops show up, the real cops kind of freak out. It’s December 1st, 1954, and no one is supposed to be holding loaded revolvers at the doors of the United States Capitol. But these men are. And they have orders. They are there acting on behalf of a new group that is mobilizing and now for some reason brandishing weapons in defense of their political hero. Reporter: One of the most controversial figures ever to appear on this nation’s political stage... Maddow: These men at the Capitol have unholstered their guns. They are holding them at their sides, as heavy cardboard boxes are loaded out of an armored truck. The presence of an unexpected, uninvited armored truck at the doors to the U.S. Senate, the presence of these men with their weapons drawn, it creates some alarm on the Senate floor, especially when senators learn that one of the armed men has actually come inside, has entered the Capitol. The sergeant at arms is called to investigate. And the Washington police. David Austin Walsh: It’s a very deliberately choreographed moment. Maddow: That’s author and historian David Austin Walsh. Walsh: It was an attempt to show political strength. Maddow: The boxes that are being unloaded from the truck are full of petitions. A new group that didn’t even exist a month earlier has hastily gathered these petitions from all over the country. And now their leader, a controversial right-wing retired Navy admiral, has ordered a handful of these guards for the truck to draw their weapons as the petitions are hand-delivered into the Senate. Walsh: They were trying to sell this as almost a Hollywood moment, showing that the real Americans, what Nixon would later call the “Silent Majority,” were behind Joe McCarthy, contrary to what you would read in the press. Maddow: Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin is facing a censure in the United States Senate. It’s only the third one in Senate history. Just hours before the vote, diehard McCarthy supporters have marched to the U.S. Capitol to show the Senators inside that they’ll be going up against an army of real Americans if they move ahead with that vote. And there are counter-protesters too. There are worries about what might happen if the two sides come up against each other in the streets... Reporter: It’ll be violent and bitter, I’m sorry to say. Maddow: Violent and bitter. The armored truck and the men holding their guns do not lessen the tension. Reporter: The pro-McCarthy marchers say they want a peaceful and dignified operation down here, but if the anti-McCarthy marchers come in, I wonder just how peaceful it will be if they all tangle together up there on the Hill. Maddow: Joe McCarthy has made a very profitable political sport out of dramatizing the threat of an enemy within, an America beset by shadowy, powerful, internal conspirators who McCarthy alone is willing to expose and willing to fight. It creates an intense and emotional following for him, built on cathartic anger and grievance and fear and loyalty only to him. He’s done it by singling out relatively powerless individuals for public destruction. Humiliating, threatening, legitimately ruining the lives of regular Americans who he has targeted. But McCarthy has also left a body count among the powerful, among his Senate peers, who one after another have been destroyed by McCarthy and his allies, McCarthy and his movement, as punishment, as retribution, for any act of opposition to him. Members of the opposition party, members of his own party have feared challenging him in public, and for good reason. But by this point -- by the end of 1954 -- Joe McCarthy’s own actions are finally starting to catch up to him. What began all the way back in the Malmedy investigation has landed him here. Drew Pearson: Will Senator McCarthy finally be censured? The Senate is now split for and against McCarthy. Maddow: The Malmedy hearings had seen McCarthy pushing Nazi propaganda to the public, attacking Jewish U.S. Army investigators with false claims that came from unrepentant Nazis in Germany and from the convicted Nazi perpetrators of a massacre of American POWs. By the start of this year, 1954, Joe McCarthy was doing it again. This time it was about the Fort Monmouth Army Base in New Jersey. McCarthy made false, totally baseless accusations that dozens of predominantly Jewish scientists and engineers at that Army base were secret Communist spies. Sen. Joe McCarthy: Some of them will be recommended for indictment for perjury. I assume some of them will go to jail. The important thing, however is exposing, getting them out of the places where they can do the most damage. Maddow: Those false accusations destroyed the careers of many of those scientists, tore apart their lives. But they also helped bring about hearings. The Army-McCarthy hearings that millions of people all across the country watched on live TV. Sen. John McClellan: This committee therefore has the responsibility and the duty in the course of these hearings to develop the facts and to establish the truth or the falsity of the accusations that have been made. Maddow: These televised hearings go on for weeks. And they famously do not go well for Joe McCarthy. His tactics and his temperament don’t play as well on TV as they used to. And his case against the Army is just factually incoherent. It’s clear to everyone in the hearing room. It’s also clear to millions of Americans who are watching at home. Army Secretary Robert Stevens: The United States Army does not coddle communists. This committee knows that. The American people know that. Maddow: And then by the end of that year, by the end of 1954, there is another factor in play for McCarthy, which is that members of the U.S. Senate have just been forced to bury one of their own. One of the most popular men in the Senate. Wyoming Senator Lester Hunt had confronted Joe McCarthy. He’d been rewarded for that with an escalating and personal blackmail campaign by McCarthy and two other Republican senators, a blackmail campaign that culminated in Hunt taking his own life. Here’s Wyoming author Rodger McDaniel. Rodger McDaniel: The suicide of one of their own, because of the behavior of Senator McCarthy, was seen by many in the Senate as the time that they had to draw the line. Something had to be done. Maddow: Something had to be done. No previous effort to hold Joe McCarthy accountable, to punish McCarthy for anything he had done had ever worked. But they would at least have to try. Walsh: It’s a way for the Senate to kind of wash their hands of a guy that nobody ever liked in the first place. Reporter: Senator Watkins will present appropriate resolutions to make the recommendations effective, and that is a censure on two counts, and ask for a vote. Then will come the avalanche. Maddow: When the censure resolution is officially put up for debate, it’s not at all clear that it will have the votes to pass. After those messy, televised hearings where McCarthy came off so poorly, the broad public might have been cooling on McCarthy and his tactics, but his supporters still are legion. And their support for him, if anything, is becoming more fervent, maybe even more radical. McCarthy’s colleagues in the Senate are made well aware of that. Walsh: Members of Congress say they’ve never gotten the volume of hate mail they’ve gotten in ‘54 because of the McCarthy censure. Maddow: Senators who support the censure of Joe McCarthy are inundated with hate mail. Senator William Fulbright, he had been derided by Joe McCarthy as “Half-bright,” he entered some of his hate mail into the Congressional record. “Red skunk: I will not dignify you with the title of Senator. You are a disgrace to the United States Senate. A dirty Red rat like you should be kicked out. You’re not fit to clean Senator McCarthy’s shoes. Hope you are struck by God.” Another Senator described the summer of 1954 as a “hot summer of hysteria,” due to McCarthy’s, quote, “highly charged, emotional, and inflammable personal following.” That senator neatly filed the hate mail he received with a local university. Quote, “For the good of the country, my only prayer is that Communist Eisenhower will soon be impeached or assassinated.” Quote, “God has judged you. McCarthy will be avenged, if not by the courts then by God’s own people.” Some of the mail fantasized that the avenging had already started, in which this evil cabal that McCarthy had started to expose was secretly being rounded up and imprisoned. Quote, “I can understand now why you demanded a closed-door session, the Roosevelt and Truman gutter trash officials demanded closed doors, too. They are now in prison for their secret work.” Walsh: You’re smearing a great American patriot. You’re -- you know, you’re being duped by the communists. Are you -- are you a communist yourself, Senator? That is such a constant theme in these hate mail letters. Maddow: Some senators resorted to disconnecting their phones because of McCarthy supporters’ late night screaming phone calls to their homes. And they came in person too. When the censure debate formally began in the Senate, McCarthy supporters come by bus, by carload from Wisconsin, from Texas, from Florida. They chartered their own train from New York City. Gerald L. K. Smith, the rabidly antisemitic preacher from the America First Party and the Christian Nationalist Crusade, he came to Washington himself to help lead the grassroots opposition. He set up a makeshift war room inside a hotel room right near the Capitol, a detail reported with characteristic punch by the journalist Drew Pearson. Pearson: The Mayflower Hotel. Gerald L. K. Smith, the rabble-rouser, is registered in room 1017 at the Mayflower in order to be with Joe McCarthy in his time of crisis. Smith and his wife are registered under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Goodyear, room 1017, in case anyone wants to call him. Maddow: From his headquarters inside the Mayflower Hotel, Gerald L.K. Smith and others advise the angry McCarthy army on what they should do. Walsh: Among that element of the electorate, that, you know, 20 percent hardcore, you know, American right movement, he is a saint, he’s a martyr figure. Maddow: A saint and a martyr. He’s their hero. As far as his supporters are concerned, he’s the only one they can trust. He’s the only real patriot. And now he’s going to be punished? He’s going to be censured? How dare they. No, if they have anything to say about it, he’s not going to be punished. He’s going to be president. This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” McCarthy: This fight to expose those who would destroy this nation will go on and on! Reporter: Would his strategy be to put himself in a position before the country of being a martyr? Crowd Singing: Nobody’s for McCarthy, but the people! Lawyer: Senator McCarthy will vigorously defend himself against these three charges. ******************************** Maddow: Episode 7: Mobilized. The place is packed to the rafters. Turnout is so good that organizers have gotten permission from the police to mount a loudspeaker outside so the overflow crowd that can’t get in can still hear what’s being said inside. Even though the crowds have been organizing at the Capitol since sunrise, packing the Senate Gallery, cramming into Senate offices and hallways, they’ve showed no signs of slowing down all day. And now that night they’re at Constitution Hall in Washington to show the strength in their numbers and in their anger. The Senator who introduced the censure resolution against Joe McCarthy is Ralph Flanders of Vermont. Radio Anchor: One man said today his group never will forgive Senator Flanders, who started the censure. Maddow: He has already had to have a police guard assigned to his home. After McCarthy attacked Flanders by saying, “I think they should get a net and take him to a good quiet place,” McCarthy supporters have brought big nets with them to this rally at Constitution Hall. They are holding signs that say they are looking for Senator Flanders. And there are other homemade signs. “Senator McCarthy Deserves a Citation Instead of Censure,” and “Give McCarthy What He Deserves: The Congressional Medal of Honor.” This is a raucous crowd at Constitution Hall, an emotional one. The rally is deep into its third hour of pro-McCarthy speeches and songs when there’s a surprise appearance that absolutely brings down the house. Sen. Herman Welker: One of the greatest living foes of communist slavery, that man is Joe McCarthy. (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Senator Joe McCarthy isn’t supposed to be at that rally at Constitution Hall in Washington. But then he is, a surprise to the crowd. Police surround him and his wife as they walk through the crowd of thousands of supporters, people pressing in on them on every side, trying to touch him, trying to shake his hand. An AP reporter describes the crowd as going, quote, “wild” when they realized McCarthy is in the room. A Scripps-Howard reporter says when McCarthy appeared, quote, “That did it. Everyone was on his feet in an instant and the deafening roar was like nothing that the screaming, foot-stamping assemblage had produced before.” McCarthy takes the stage. He says he’s “sick deep down inside” because of the, quote, “double-crossing” and the “double-dealing” that he says is behind the censure effort against him. McCarthy: Take my word for it, my good friends, regardless, and I make you this solemn promise, regardless of what this Senate may do about a censure, this fight to expose those who would destroy this nation will go on and on, regardless! (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Senator McCarthy, at several points in his speech, is so overcome with emotion that he is moved to tears. Photos of McCarthy will run in newspapers all across the country, photos showing him weeping and wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. People in the audience are weeping as well. They start to sing for him. (CROWD SINGING FOR MCCARTHY) (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Despite the passion and the rage of his supporters, despite his track record of destroying anyone who opposed him, senators had finally mustered the courage to consider a censure vote against McCarthy. But still they were wary. Reporter: This thing, of course, has a lot of unpredictable elements. Maddow: They decided in 1954 to delay the vote on his censure until after the midterm elections that year. They were fearful of how the electorate would react. Reporter: Well, the elections will be over when the Senate does come back, but meantime, out there now are the voters. Maddow: By the time the vote is finally getting near in November, McCarthy’s supporters are fully mobilized. Two days after that huge Constitutional Hall rally in Washington, there’s a dinner in his honor in his home state in Milwaukee. Fifteen hundred people show up in another raucous, foot-stomping show of support. Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona is there to support him at that dinner. He tells the crowd that McCarthy is a great American who is seeking the truth. McCarthy condemns the senators who support his censure as a, quote, “movement of people not loyal to our country.” And then there’s the rally in New York, Madison Square Garden. Thirteen thousand people. Roy Cohn: If the United States Senate should take a vote of censure against this man who has led us, the Senate will have been committing the blackest act in its entire history. Maddow: That’s Joe McCarthy’s chief attack dog in the Senate, his counsel Roy Cohn. This huge rally at Madison Square Garden, like the one in Washington, it is emotional. It’s raucous. Walsh: When Joe McCarthy, who is facing, you know, political ruin, is able to pack Madison Square Garden with thousands of fervent supporters who are convinced that he is America’s savior against subversion, that tells you something. That tells you something about the depth of -- not the breadth -- but the depth of his political support. Maddow: The crowd here shouts its approval when speakers denounce -- quote -- “the leftist press.” At the mention of the words “New York Times,” they boo and scream. There’s a female photographer here from TIME magazine. She has to be escorted out of the event for her own safety when the crowd turns against her. They’re screaming at her: “Hang the communist bitch!” Here, at the rally, up on the dais, is a former congressman, Hamilton Fish. Rep. Hamilton Fish: I have no patience with those Americans who tremble every time Hitler sneezes or get jittery every time he opens his mouth. Maddow: After a long career in the U.S. House, Hamilton Fish had finally been voted out of office once his dealings with the Nazi agent George Sylvester Viereck were exposed to the public. Radio Announcer: And over on the House side, Ham Fish of New York winds up a 22-year record. Maddow: Former Congressman Hamilton Fish had been there in Washington at the emotional Constitution Hall event for McCarthy. And now, at Madison Square Garden, here’s Fish again, with pride of place, up on stage. Here, in the audience is Gerald L.K. Smith, whose magazine, “The Cross and the Flag,” just last month included pronouncements like: “The international Jew machine resolved to destroy the German race.” This month’s edition has a full-page cover photo, “The Fearless Fighting Patriot: U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.” A large contingent of the crowd here has been organized by the neo-Nazi National Renaissance Party. Ross: They considered him as -- they would say at meetings, “Saint Joe.” And he was a true American patriot. Maddow: The National Renaissance Party leader who helped organize this rally is the same guy who led that pro-German Holocaust denial rally in Yorkville, New York, that had scheduled Joe McCarthy as its headline speaker in 1952. The year after that, the same guy had toured Germany at the invitation of Nazi lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer. He gave speeches to unrepentant Nazi groups. He called for Germany to return to Nazi rule. The German government was not having it. They had his passport seized and deported him back to the United States, just in time for him to become a key organizer for the movement to support Senator Joseph McCarthy and to organize this event. It was a pretty rich blend there that night.  At “The New York Times,” William S. White described it this way. He said: “The anti-censure forces have drawn up a cadre that clearly represents the largest reemergence and coming together of essentially right-wing groups since before the United States entered the Second World War.” Like in the lead-up to World War II, the key dynamic at work was not just the presence of an American ultra-right, but the mix of the ultra right and mainstream electoral power. Here, after all, at Madison Square Garden was an event organized by a man just kicked out of Germany for being too much of a Nazi. At the same event, attendees are also hearing a stirring speech from the sitting governor of Utah. Here’s an event attended by Gerald L.K. Smith, who advocates the forced sterilization and deportation of all American Jews. But it’s also attended by a polite contingent of supporters of the late Senator Robert Taft, AKA Mr. Republican. Here in the crowd at Madison Square Garden is William F. Buckley Jr., a man of growing influence on the right. He has just published “God and Man at Yale.” And he’s here alongside James Madole, the National Renaissance Party leader. He’s just published something, too. Something titled “Adolf Hitler: The George Washington of Europe.” Walsh: McCarthy operated as a sort of linchpin for, you know, laundering far-right influence into the political mainstream in American politics. Maddow: FBI files show that the bureau had started staking out pro-McCarthy events in 1954, like a Roy Cohn speech in Baltimore, expecting that these were the kinds of events where fugitive fascist Francis Parker Yockey might be likely to turn up. They might be able to apprehend him, to question him about his Nazi ties, about his spying inside the Nazi war crimes trials, about his travels to the Middle East to try to sell plans for a cobalt bomb. Here was a powerful, transgressive, menacing, but also ascendant American political movement built from the start on surprisingly porous border ground between the unthinkably extremist edge and mainstream electoral politics. Now, as their leader fights for his political life, as his opponents finally are summoning the courage to confront him with the kind of sanction that’s intended to knock him out of politics, who will hold their nerve, as the radical movement he’s marshaled makes its show of force, and he presents himself to them as their martyr? Reporter: Wouldn’t you think that a man in Senator McCarthy’s position, and facing this likely censure, would -- would -- would his strategy be to put himself in a position before the country of being a martyr, and that his friends would play along that strategy line? Maddow: That’s next. ******************************** (CROWD SINGING FOR MCCARTHY) (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) Maddow: Joe McCarthy is defending himself against censure by the U.S. Senate. At a string of large and intense rallies supporting him, crowds are singing his name. They’re weeping when he speaks, reaching out to try to touch him. Now McCarthy wants more time, more time to demonstrate to his Senate colleagues just how big a mistake it would be for them to take him on in this way. Lawyer: All I can say is that Senator McCarthy will vigorously defend himself against these three charges when a full hearing is held on the floor of the Senate. Maddow: Even after Senate leaders decide to delay the censure vote until after the election, McCarthy’s still pressing for even more of a delay. Of course, he’d like to delay it indefinitely, if possible, but at this point, he’ll take anything he can get. After the election, he comes up with an unexpected way to buy himself even more time. Reporter: His right arm still in a sling because of an injured elbow, the legislator from Wisconsin... Maddow: An injured elbow? McCarthy informs the Senate that there cannot be a censure vote against him, because he has come down with traumatic bursitis of the elbow. He says it happened while he was receiving an overenthusiastic handshake from an overenthusiastic supporter too near a glass tabletop. And it has left him so laid up that the censure proceedings must stop. Now, the exact nature of this injury is never clear, but McCarthy produced a doctor’s note claiming that he needed not just hospitalization, but full uninterrupted bed rest in order to recover from this traumatic bursitis of the elbow. That pesky Drew Pearson reported that McCarthy was regularly taking breaks from his hospitalization and his bed rest to go have dinner and drinks with friends. Drew Pearson, Journalist: McCarthy, according to Senate colleagues, is now pleading the Bethesda Hospital Amendment in order to drag out the censure debate as long as possible. Maddow: Pleading the Bethesda Hospital Amendment. People also called this Joe McCarthy’s elbow filibuster. But it did work. The Republican Senate Majority Leader was more than happy to treat the elbow story with all the seriousness he could muster. He announced that the McCarthy censure debate and vote would be delayed a further ten days. Pearson: McCarthy is stalling for time to permit the rolling up of 10 million signatures. Maddow: If McCarthy has bought himself ten whole days with this elbow gambit, well, his supporters are going to make the most of it. In those 10 days, they decide they’ll collect 10 million signatures in support of McCarthy. 10 million signatures in 10 days to stop the censure. Newspapers all over the country front-page this lightning petition drive. “LIFE” Magazine does a photo spread of housewives signing people up on street corners, people lining up to sign and to volunteer. “The Orlando Sentinel” publishes the actual petition itself in a handy clip-out form. They say it is “a service to the thousands of Central Florida citizens who believe in the principles for which Senator McCarthy stands and who are eager to do their part for the preservation of our American way of life.” The group that forms to collect the signatures announces plans for offices from coast to coast. John G. Crommelin, Senator Joseph McCarthy Supporter: We’ve had requests from people all over the country to set up auxiliary headquarters. I remember one from Basin, Wyoming, Yakima, Washington, all the way to the west coast. This particular petition has been mushrooming at such a tremendous rate that it’s beginning to look like that, not 10 million, but we could probably get 20 million signatures if we just had the time. Maddow: Twenty million signatures if only we had a few more days. A member of the neo-Nazi militia group, the National Renaissance Party, takes over as the New Jersey co-chair of the Ten Million Americans effort for McCarthy. The group’s leader, James Madole, starts urging New Yorkers to sign those McCarthy petitions. Ross: Madole found Joe McCarthy the only American politician really worth listening to and supporting. Maddow: The National Renaissance Party even starts using a new name. The group starts holding meetings under the name “Patriots for McCarthy.” A Washington reporter, Robert L. Riggs, writes that McCarthy is -- quote -- “appealing over the heads of the senators to the people of the country. He is drawing a picture of himself as the crucified enemy of traitors within our gates.” If your political hero, your saint, is being crucified, how much is too much when it comes to showing your support for him, when it comes to backing him up? Walsh: The day before the censure vote, an armored car pulls up to the Capitol Building with armed guards. Maddow: Armed guards at the entrance to the Senate with their pistols drawn the day before the censure vote. That same day, as that unfolds outside the Senate, that literal show of force to the senators inside, the Republican Senate Majority Leader announces that he’s made his decision on censure. His vote will be no. He’s standing with McCarthy. The pressure campaign that has been building for weeks with the pro-McCarthy rallies and the petitions and this weird threatening spectacle of how the petitions were brought to the Capitol, McCarthy supporters harassing senators with hate mail and late-night phone calls to their homes, threats of violence, death threats, that kind of stuff isn’t just for fun. It’s for effect. And there are Republicans in the Senate who initially supported censuring McCarthy, who now change their minds. Pearson: Here is the backstage reason why Senator Case of South Dakota suddenly went into reverse and without telling... Maddow: On top of everything else they’re doing, McCarthy and his allies start hunting for dirt on individual senators to use as leverage to get them to vote no. Pearson: McCarthy has a secret bombshell to explode against Senator Flanders. Maddow: McCarthy insists publicly that he’s going to win this fight either way. Pearson: McCarthy has admitted to friends privately that he wants to be censured and go down as a martyr. Friends have begged him to make a public apology. But McCarthy stubbornly refused and snorted that he would rather be censured than apologize. Maddow: That idea, that McCarthy wanted to be able to claim martyrdom, that, even as he fought it, he might welcome censure because it would allow him to portray himself as the victim of political persecution, the fact that that was increasingly clear as his political strategy, it didn’t make it any easier to combat. Reporter: Would -- would his strategy be to put himself in a position before the country of being a martyr and that his friends would -- would -- would play along that strategy line? Reporter: Well, Dick, I have thought of that. I have never -- I have never thought of it in exactly the words that you put it up. Would that be his strategy? But I have thought that events could turn around so that the public would accept him as -- a large part of the public would accept him as a martyr. It seems to be their stock-in-trade or their battle cry. Maddow: McCarthy and his allies also mounted another defense as well. In addition to the political persecution claim, they also said that McCarthy and those on his side, people who could vouch for him inside the government, who could contribute to his defense, they were being gagged. They were somehow not being allowed to speak. Reporter: I think there was an indication today that McCarthy and Williams, his lawyer, were going to try to stress this gag idea. If McCarthy can cry gag, then he moves the battle more to his -- his own sort of approach. This is what he likes to do. He likes to go on the offensive to take the attack. And he says: Look, I have got a witness here, but you won’t let him talk. Maddow: After all the posturing, and the delays, and the elbow filibuster, and the rallies, and the brandishing of guns on the steps of the Capitol, it’s finally time for the Senate to vote. Newsreel: Spectators converge on the Senate chamber, where the upper house in heated parliamentary debate votes a public rebuke of one of its members, Senator Joseph McCarthy. Maddow: This is a very, very rare thing in U.S. history. There were two senators who were censured in 1902, another one in 1929, but that’s it, and it hasn’t happened since then. Newsreel: Joseph McCarthy is the fourth Senator in history to be so disciplined by his colleagues in the Capitol -- 67-to-22, it condemns him for his conduct. Maddow: Among Democrats in the Senate that day, the vote is 44-0 in favor of censuring Joe McCarthy. On the Republican side, half of the Republicans in the Senate vote in his favor. McCarthy biographer Richard Rovere said the half of Senate Republicans who voted with McCarthy were -- quote -- “by and large, the more influential half.” Joe McCarthy is ultimately censured, but his grip on his own party substantially remains. Walsh: It’s important that he still has support. It’s not a universal censure. Maddow: It’s not universal. In the end, it’s not even technically a censure. By the time the Senate actually takes the vote, the censure resolution has been watered down to the point where it no longer even includes the word censure. Officially, it’s a condemnation of Senator McCarthy. McCarthy: They went right straight down the party line. Every Democrat voted against us in this condemnation -- call it what you may -- even though they proclaimed over and over that this was a judicial proceeding. Reporter: How does it feel to be a condemned senator? McCarthy: I feel no different tonight than I did last night. I am very happy to have this circus ended, so that we can get back to the work of digging out communism, corruption, treason in government. Reporter: Senator, do you feel that you have not been censured in this action? McCarthy: I wouldn’t say that today was a vote of confidence. Reporter: Senator, at the beginning, you called this the lynching bee. Do you feel now you’ve been lynched? Maddow: When Senator McCarthy was finally censured, or condemned, by a vote of his own Senate colleagues, the resolution they passed against him did not criticize McCarthy’s lies about his enemies and his targets, his promotion of false Nazi propaganda, his blackmail against Senator Lester Hunt. The resolution they passed against him called him out instead for his discourteousness toward his fellow senators, for violating Senate rules and traditions in his interactions with two Senate committees. They basically criticized him for being rude to his co-workers on a couple of occasions. And that was it. And even that was a bridge too far for half of the Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Walsh: There are people who are taking a stand in the Senate, saying McCarthy did nothing wrong. And that’s because of the intensity of the support on the right for McCarthy. Maddow: For the most intense McCarthy supporters out there this censure fight, this condemnation not only is it effectively toothless against him; it’s proof of the evil of McCarthy’s enemies. It’s proof that our system of government, the American system of government, maybe is broken. Maybe it should be cast aside entirely. The day after the Senate vote, the very next day, the National Renaissance Party gathers in New York under its new meant-to-be-less-Nazi-seeming banner, calling themselves “Patriots for McCarthy.” According to FBI records, at that meeting, the group’s leader, James Madole -- quote -- “advocated a break with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,” which he said were “completely outmoded and no longer filled the country’s needs.” The group then starts to discuss what it would take to make Joe McCarthy president of the United States in the next election. Walsh: They wanted to turn McCarthy from a martyr back into a hero. It is a moment of broad grassroots mobilization by American conservatives that provides a sort of template -- a blueprint -- for future action. Maddow: The organizing, the petition drives, the protests, the mass rallies, the new organizations that sprung up in his name, the old organizations that changed their names to support him explicitly, it could all now be put to a new use, not just to try to stop the censure of McCarthy, but to promote McCarthy to the peak of American power. Senator Arthur Watkins, who chaired the committee that handled the McCarthy censure, he said that McCarthy was on course to -- quote -- “become the political leader, the nationalist hero of a cross-party-lines faction.” He said McCarthy would be “the man on a white horse” for what he called “the right-wing, know-nothing element of American politics.” If that movement succeeded in elevating him on those terms, Watkins said he believed McCarthy could -- quote -- “be carried to unbelievable, even unthinkable, power.” Reporter: He followed the full-throated blast with a long pause, and then quiet tones, tones of shock and sadness. Then, in another moment, the full blast again, the documents waved in air, at the end, a wild burst of applause and cries. Anyone present would have thought this man cannot miss the White House. Maddow: The accepted common wisdom today when it comes to Joe McCarthy is that the Senate censure vote spelled the end for him; it started a quick and then uninterrupted descent into irrelevance. In reality, for a large part of the Republican Party and its base, and for the American ultra-right, which supported him to the hilt, and which he had never disavowed, McCarthy remained as popular as ever. Walsh: The people who loved Joe McCarthy at the beginning of 1954 still loved Joe McCarthy at the end of 1954, and they loved McCarthy, you know, in all caps. Maddow: He was their champion, the only one they believed in. He’d taken that Senate censure vote for them to show them that the so-called system, the American system that could allow this to happen to their hero, it was corrupt and rotten and ripe to be overthrown. For all the slings and arrows that he had borne on their behalf, they were going to repay McCarthy by elevating him to the highest office in the country. Walsh: Drafting McCarthy for President was a way -- it was a way for right-wingers to assert, in a sense, their own dignity in the face of what they perceived to be this horrific and anti-American smear campaign. Maddow: Just two months after that censure vote, there was Joe McCarthy being greeted by a minute-long standing ovation from a crowd of 2,000 Republicans in Chicago. As the 1956 presidential election hit high gear, there was Joe McCarthy speaking before a capacity crowd of 4,000 people at Carnegie Hall in New York City. A month after that, it was a pro-McCarthy rally of another 4,000 people in Washington, D.C., and a specific plan of action. As the censure of McCarthy enraged the right, as their arguments turned angrily to the idea that normal electoral American politics could not be trusted anymore that there would have to be some new way to save the country, a group founded and funded by Robert McCormick, publisher of “The Chicago Tribune,” started promoting a plan, a new plan to basically monkey-wrench the next presidential election. Radio commentator: The inevitable, chanted response was: “How? Tell us how.” The final recommendation for popular action was so simple and so practical that it startled the assembled patriots. Maddow: The plan would not be to compete in politics in the normal sense, to try to win the most votes. Instead, the plan would be to grab hold of the fragile, arcane system of counting the votes. Radio commentator: The nationwide popular vote that is apparently cast for a presidential candidate in the November election has nothing at all to do with his victory or defeat. Maddow: They would gin up new slates, surprise slates of electors in enough states to mess with the electoral vote count in Washington, which is, after all, what actually decides the presidency. Radio commentator: Every American voter is qualified under state statutes, rather than by national laws. Each state may select these electors in any manner that the state legislature desires. I am more than ever convinced that not one American in 10,000 completely understands the constitutional power of the 531 presidential electors all told. Maddow: Robert McCormick’s group, which was called For America, they might not be able to field a candidate who could win the presidency in the normal sense of the word. But with a plan like this, a plan focused on messing up the Electoral College count, well, they might be able to get it anyway. Radio commentator: We can get our wish by qualifying a slate of American presidential elector candidates in our respective states. In some jurisdictions, the process is more difficult than in others. In a number of states, patriots are already far advanced on these necessary prerequisites. Maddow: If you could just inject enough chaos into the counting of the Electoral College vote, that the election could be thrown to Congress, to a vote in the U. S. House of Representatives, well, maybe, at that point, you could get a real patriot over the top and into the White House, no matter how the country had voted in the election. Radio commentator: Some of my wise and trusted friends in certain states of the Union are confident that their existing local political organizations can be trusted to protect the voters of those states against the dreaded possibility of two one-world socialist tickets in November. Maddow: It would come to a head not in November, not during the vote, but afterwards in the first week of January, when Congress would gather in special session to count the electoral vote. Radio commentator: This is the master key to any plan for pro-American electors in 1956. Maddow: The master key to unlock an America where a real patriot can win, or where he doesn’t need to win, but he’ll take power anyway. That is next time on the final episode of “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Radio commentator: Between these contending viewpoints, my friends, lies a long stick of political dynamite with fuses now burning at both ends.

And it was -- you were an irritant to McCarthy and to his people just by doing your job. Murrey Marder, Reporter: I would often be in the office until 10:00, 11:00 at night. My colleague Phil Potter, he would say: “Well, what do you think we’re accomplishing?” I said: “We have to operate on the premise, the only premise I know of, that if you keep putting enough light on the situation, that you will hopefully have some consequence. Something will happen as a result of it.” He said: “What the hell do you think is going to happen out of this?” I said: “Well, eventually, people are going to see what this is like and you will be repelled by it, if they understand what is happening.” “Well, what’s that going to do?” I said: “Well, that makes him a subject of ridicule.” “Well, who the hell -- he doesn’t care if anybody ridicules him or not.” I said: “Yes, he will.” You know, you can only operate on the only journalistic premise that I know is that it has some effect. And if it doesn’t -- doesn’t have an effect, we should be, all be in the -- in the bottling business or something. (LAUGHTER) Interviewer: That’s right."
Why Trump’s dual endorsement in a key Republican primary matters,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 6:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-dual-endorsement-key-republican-primary-matters-rcna164038,"Once in a great while, Donald Trump will look at a primary, size up the Republican candidates, struggle to settle on a favorite, and end up endorsing more than one contender. Two years ago this week, for example, the former president endorsed two leading contenders in a Senate primary in Missouri. As NBC News reported, the GOP’s presidential nominee has done the same thing in a closely watched congressional primary in Arizona, though the circumstances in this race are worth a closer look. “We have a very important Republican Primary Election on Tuesday for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, with two spectacular America First Candidates,” Trump wrote in a message published to his social media platform. “Both Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh have my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Congressman of Arizona’s 8th Congressional District.” At first blush, this might look like a replay of the Missouri race: Trump liked both candidates, so he endorsed both candidates. But in this specific primary, it’s not that simple. This Arizona district, just north of Phoenix, is a Republican stronghold, and it’s generally understood that the winner of the GOP primary is all but certain to win the House seat. It was against this backdrop that Trump publicly endorsed Hamadeh eight months ago, choosing him over Masters, despite the fact that the former president endorsed Masters’ ill-fated Senate candidacy two years ago. Nevertheless, as the local congressional primary has unfolded, Masters has repeatedly suggested that he enjoyed Trump’s support, pointing to the former president’s 2022 backing. In one campaign ad, for example, viewers were told “TRUMP ENDORSED MASTERS” in bold letters — while a smaller font added, “IN SENATE CAMPAIGN.” It reached the point at which Susie Wiles, Trump’s campaign manager, reportedly called Masters directly about this. Politico reported earlier this month that Wiles urged the Arizonan “to pull or change ads” that falsely implied that he had Trump’s support in his congressional campaign. Three weeks later, Trump extended his support to Masters’ congressional campaign. For Hamadeh, the news was likely a punch to the gut. Hamadeh, who narrowly lost a state attorney general race in the Grand Canyon State in 2022, has based much of his candidacy on the fact that he was the Trump-backed candidate in the primary. And while that’s still the case, as the race approaches the finish line, the former president has apparently decided that Hamadeh is no longer the only Trump-backed candidate in the primary. It’s difficult to speculate as to why, exactly, the Republican made this surprise announcement, but The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump’s relationship with Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel is starting to “thaw,” and Masters is a close Thiel ally. I have a hunch that won’t make Hamadeh feel any better about having to share the former president’s support. Primary Day in Arizona is just 24 hours away."
"Elon Musk’s 2024 electioneering reaches a new, unsettling level",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 5:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/elon-musks-2024-electioneering-reaches-new-unsettling-level-rcna164030,"In July 2019, Donald Trump and his White House team held an odd, official event, which was labeled a “Social Media Summit.” For all intents and purposes, “summit” vastly overstated matters: The then-president hung out with a group of right-wing media gadflies, all of whom whined for hours about a made-up conspiracy that, they believed, prevented their social-media content from becoming even more popular. A Washington Post analysis described it as a gathering in which Trump “invited some buds over to complain about how Twitter is mean to them.” As we discussed soon after, the Republican and his allies presented no evidence to substantiate their theories, but he nevertheless complained incessantly about tech CEOs and their “terrible bias“ against those on the right. At the same event, a variety of GOP lawmakers — Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Josh Hawley of Missouri, among others — talked up assorted bills and task forces that would uncover the conspiracy and require political “neutrality” from the tech giants. Not surprisingly, nothing ever came of such efforts, largely because the entire idea of the tech industry trying to undermine conservatives was ridiculous. Five years later, however, if Republicans are still looking for powerful tech executives displaying a partisan “bias,” I have some news they’ll be eager to see. The New York Times reported: The video — which Musk promoted, but does not appear to have created — took an actual Harris ad, removed images that were critical of Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance, and mimicked the Democratic vice president’s voice, making it seem as if Harris said things she neither said nor believes. The Times report added that the manipulated video did not contain any disclaimers; Musk did not disclose it as some kind of parody; and the video “would seem to run afoul of X’s policies, which prohibit sharing ‘synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.’” A day later, Musk, using the platform he now owns, described the likely Democratic presidential nominee as “an extinctionist,” adding that the effects of Harris’ political philosophy would lead to “a de facto holocaust for all of humanity!” What’s more, the Times reported a couple of weeks ago that Musk was “likely” to offer “significant” support for a new pro-Trump super PAC created by Musk’s closest friends. The Wall Street Journal had a related report, noting that the conspiratorial billionaire is prepared to spend “around $45 million a month” in the hopes of putting the Republican back in power. Musk later denied the accuracy of the reporting, though Trump personally suggested that Musk is, in fact, investing $45 million a month in support of his candidacy. And did I mention that Trump recently told an audience that he intends to “make life good” for Musk and people like him in a prospective second term? Because the Republican said exactly that nine days ago. The Trump White House’s “Social Media Summit” might’ve been more compelling if it had this kind of material to work with."
Trump tells supporters they ‘won’t have to vote’ again if he wins,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-tells-supporters-wont-vote-wins-rcna164019,"Democratic arguments that Donald Trump represents a threat to American democracy appears to be the one criticism that the former president considers intolerable. In fact, the Republican has claimed without evidence that this Democratic talking point — which is rooted in fact — might very well have contributed to the recent assassination attempt. But if the GOP candidate doesn’t want to be seen as a threat to American democracy, he probably ought to stop taking public stances that make it seem as he’s a threat to American democracy. The New York Times reported: This might sound hyperbolic. It’s not. “Christians, get out and vote — just this time,” the Republican said at the Turning Point USA Believers Summit. “You won’t have to do it anymore! Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” For good measure, he went on say, “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” To be sure, the former president has made similar comments in the very recent past. Just last week, for example, Trump told a far-right audience, “In four years you don’t have to vote, ok? In four years don’t vote, I don’t care.” But his remarks from late Friday were even less subtle — and even more unsettling. If we’re being charitable, there is a potentially benign interpretation of the candidate’s comments, though even this is far from reassuring. Perhaps Trump meant that, at the end of his prospective second term, his far-right vision will be so entrenched in the American system that it will be effectively election-proof. MAGA world will endure for the indefinite future, the argument goes, so whether the Republican’s followers vote or not in 2028 will be irrelevant — because there will be nothing Democrats can do to reverse what’s been done. The less charitable interpretation is that Trump envisions a future without elections. Or as Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman put it, “The only way ‘you won’t have to vote anymore’ is if Donald Trump becomes a dictator.” The New York congressman’s choice of words was especially notable given that Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating what he’s pitched as a temporary American “dictatorship.” The former president has also talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, rejecting election results he doesn’t like, creating militarized camps, issuing pardons for politically aligned criminals, strengthening his friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, pursuing mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions, and arguing that his rivals shouldn't be ""allowed"" to run against him. On ABC News’ “This Week,” Martha Raddatz asked Gov. Chris Sununu — a former critic of the former president who’s now a cheerleader for his party’s ticket — about the former president’s “won’t have to vote anymore” comments. The New Hampshire Republican chuckled before responding, “I think that was a classic Trumpism.” Perhaps. But isn’t that precisely the problem?"

Kamala Harris ought to take the long view on her VP pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-vice-president-vp-choice-rcna163723,"Vice President Kamala Harris has rapidly emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now, the party is consumed with the next big question: Who should be her running mate? The prevailing wisdom in these debates, as articulated by countless pundits and political junkies, is that a presidential candidate must snag a VP who can “balance out the ticket” and ideally help secure a battleground state. In countless columns and social media posts, candidates are chiefly assessed — often through reference to brief cable news clips — on how they could help Harris edge out former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance on Election Day. I hope that the Harris camp does not succumb to such shallow and shortsighted thinking. Data gathered by political scientists indicates that VP picks have a very limited impact on the appeal of a presidential ticket. What matters most in the long term is recognizing how likely it is that a vice president could become a presidential candidate or president one day — and what this person might do with that power. The veepstakes is perhaps the ultimate catnip for pundits and political junkies in every presidential cycle, spurring innumerable takes on how a specific VP’s home state, rhetorical style, race, gender and vibe might complement the presidential candidate and help win over key constituencies. But political scientists have found that VP picks don't make much of a difference when it comes to elections. Take the claim that selecting a vice president can help a president secure the state they hail from in the election, which is central to the argument that a VP should come from a battleground state. The political scientists Kyle Kopko and Christopher Devine, who specialize in the electoral impact of vice presidential picks, studied over a century of election and voter data and found “a vice presidential candidate’s state of residence generally has no effect on how a presidential candidate performs in that state. The vice presidential home state advantage is, essentially, zero.” The one exception they found was that a VP pick from a state with a small population and who has established an exceptional reputation as “an institution in state politics” could confer some home-state advantage to the presidential ticket. But a small state is, by definition, rarely going to be a game changer in the Electoral College. (Moreover, most battleground states today are not small.) Kopko and Devine have also pointed out that there is little evidence that vice presidents deliver specific demographic groups. “We didn’t find evidence, for example, that Geraldine Ferraro or Sarah Palin attracted more women voters to their party’s ticket,” Kopko recently told The New Republic. “Nor did Mike Pence attract more evangelical voters.” They have found one exception to that trend: Harris, as Biden’s running mate, did have a measurable impact on the vote choice of Black, women and Black women voters. But that being said, the effect was very small, and may have been amplified by a perception of Biden as unusually old and/or a potential one-term president meant to take down then-President Trump. While data suggests that people’s vote choice or likelihood is rarely affected by a VP pick, Kopko and Devine have found that the nature of the choice does, to some extent, affect voter perception of the presidential candidate. So while Palin did not win women for Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008, she did dampen voter perception of his age and judgment. To be fair, there is an argument to be made that Harris’ VP pick matters more in this cycle than most because of the exceptional nature of her candidacy. Assuming she secures the nomination, she will have a strikingly short period of time to introduce herself as a presidential candidate, and perhaps her running mate will play a larger role in defining her campaign as a result. But while we cannot rule out the electoral significance of a VP pick at the margins in a tight race, those considerations must be weighed against something we know matters: A vice president is unusually likely to become a viable presidential candidate or president in the future. Close to one-third of U.S. presidents have served as vice presidents before. That's not including the vice presidents who have become a nominee and failed. The last and current election cycles alone are a reminder of how much vice presidents matter as potential future leaders. In the 2020 Democratic primaries, Biden’s name recognition and background as Barack Obama’s vice president were indispensable to his performance in national polls and securing key endorsements, which is why he became the establishment candidate that moderates consolidated behind and he won the nomination. And Harris is now the front-runner to win the nomination because she is effectively fulfilling her vice presidential duty as a backup president, and because she represents the simplest route to party unity. This is why Harris should take the long view in her selection. Asking “What kind of potential presidential candidate or president would this person be?” helps train the eye on qualities such as a running mate’s demonstrable competence and their ideological positions. Does a governor or lawmaker have a track record of getting things done legislatively or changing the way people think about policy? Do they know how to lead and generate a mandate? Do they have dexterity with coalition-building? Do their values and their attitudes toward American politics and economics match the direction of the party and the country? Do they have an instinct and a vision for how to push the country forward? Their charisma matters, but it should not be viewed purely through the prism of their serving as a perfect “attack dog” VP. This person could one day be an attack dog for the entire party. I prefer vice presidential picks who understand the Democratic Party is becoming more progressive and exhibit ambition toward that end. Politicians who can think not just technocratically but also about systems, and recognize we live in a populist moment where many people are craving sweeping change. It is all the more imperative as the next generation of MAGA politicians takes up somewhat more left-leaning economic positions which sporadically show openness to regulation and quasi-labor-friendly policy. Democrats should elevate leaders who can vigorously identify capitalist exploitation, elucidate the meaning of social democracy and can call out the ruse of right-wing populism. Incidentally, these kinds of politicians are often the kinds of people who give off good vibes on television — because they have their finger on the pulse of the country. A serious party would seek to elevate them."
Sean Grayson had a history full of red flags. Then he appeared at Sonya Massey’s door.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 29, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sonya-massey-sean-grayson-red-flags-rcna163551,"Sonya Massey, 36, called 911 at 12:50 a.m. July 6 to report noises outside her Springfield, Illinois, home. Within 15 minutes, two Sangamon County deputies arrived. According to bodycam video recorded by his partner, Deputy Sean Grayson rang the doorbell, knocked on the door and repeatedly identified himself as a deputy from the sheriff’s office, “the one you called.” After some delay, Massey opened the door. “Please don’t hurt me,” she said. He replied, “I won’t hurt you. You called us.” But within minutes, Grayson, who has now been fired and charged by a grand jury with first-degree murder, shot Massey dead. While bodycam video recorded how the deputies mishandled their interaction with Massey, Grayson’s work history suggests that the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office mishandled its hiring process and either ignored or didn’t see the red flags that warned against bringing him onto the force. He joined the Army in 2014 but left in 2016 for an unspecified “serious offense.” Court records show that Grayson twice pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, once while he was enlisted in the Army and once after he was out.  A spokesperson for Sangamon County said the sheriff’s office knew about both DUIs Grayson had pleaded guilty to. In addition, the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office position was his sixth law enforcement job since 2020. That’s not the work history of a law enforcement official I’d ever want to hire. Video shows that it was a calm scene after the two deputies entered Massey’s home and she sat on a sofa fumbling through her purse for the driver’s license they'd asked her for. Then he pointed toward a pot of water boiling in the kitchen and said, “We don’t need a fire while we’re here.” Grayson was right to recognize the danger there. But a marginally well-trained officer — or a cop with common sense — would never send a potential suspect away from him and toward a potentially dangerous object. This is especially relevant because video had previously captured her being asked, “Are you doing all right, mentally?” And she answered, “Yes, I took my medicine.” Her family says she’d had recent mental health struggles. Given her response to the question about her mental well-being, deputies knew — or they should have known — that she was being treated for a mental illness. By sending her away from him and toward the boiling pot, Grayson relinquished control of the situation and put himself, his partner and, obviously, Massey in harm’s way. “Right,” Massey said when Grayson said, “We don’t need a fire.” After she turned off the stove and started moving the pot to an adjacent sink, the deputies, still in the living room area, instinctively backed away. “Where are you going?” Massey asked. Laughing, Grayson responded: “Away from your hot, steaming water.” “Away from the hot, steaming water?” Massey replied in a light tone that reflected Grayson’s laughter. “Oh,” she continued, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Again, the tone strikes me as light, not threatening. “Huh?” “I rebuke you,” she repeated, “in the name of Jesus.” “You better f---in’ not,” Grayson snapped as he put his hand on his holstered weapon and threatened to shoot her and ordered her to “Drop the f---in’ pot!” “OK,” Massey said. “I’m sorry.” The living room was separated from the kitchen by a counter. Grayson moved around the counter to see her. Bodycam video shows her crouching lower, raising both hands to her head in disbelief or panic, then rising up slightly while holding up the pot in one hand. At this point, Grayson fired three times. His partner, who also drew his weapon, did not fire. “Yeah, I’m not taking f---ing boiling water to the f---ing head,” Grayson said after he’d shot Massey. When he called for EMS and backup, Grayson asked whether law enforcement had previously been called to Massey’s home over any mental health issues. Again, Grayson was released from the Army in 2016 for unspecified but serious misconduct. On his application for the Logan County, Illinois, Sheriff’s Office, where he worked from May 2022 to April 2023, he said he’d been intoxicated “a lot” in his life. A supervisor at the Virden, Illinois, Police Department reported that Grayson never resigned but one day just stopped showing up for his shifts. Auburn, Illinois, Police Department officials reported that he wrongly described his military discharge from the Army as “honorable” and that the department never sought to verify it. In Kincaid, Illinois, where he'd worked for the police department, a member of the Kincaid Board of Trustees described him as a “loose cannon … arrogant and cocky.” Sonya Massey was killed by an officer who drifted from one law enforcement job to another after leaving the Army after a serious offense. It doesn’t appear that any of the departments that hired him thoroughly vetted him. How could they have hired him if they had? Grayson killed Massey. But she was also the victim of a deeply flawed approach to human resources in the law enforcement agencies that employed him. I wish I could say this is an aberration in American law enforcement, but I can’t. Police agencies are generally understaffed and very often poorly staffed, which puts pressure on them to hire applicants they should turn away.   Then there’s the issue of training. A licensed plumber must have thousands of hours of training. The same for a licensed cosmetologist. A police officer? On average, fewer than 700. Indeed, the U.S. has among the lowest police training requirements in the world. It’s unclear what they were taught, but the way the deputies performed inside Massey’s home doesn’t reflect good training. We demand excellence in surgeons, nurses, airline pilots and others who have our lives in their hands, and in pursuit of that we require that they be vetted and trained. But when it comes to law enforcement, we make no such demands, and we seem unwilling to make the necessary investments. Standing at her door, all Massey asked was that Grayson not hurt her. Turns out, that was too much to ask."
"Why Vance’s ‘childless, cat ladies’ comment could come back to haunt him",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 5:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/vances-childless-cat-ladies-comment-come-back-haunt-rcna163864,"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is facing renewed criticism for saying the United States is run by ‘childless cat ladies.’ And political experts say such rhetoric could have disastrous effects on a demographic the GOP desperately needs to win in November: women. In a recently resurfaced interview with Fox News from 2021,  Vance, who at the time was running for Ohio’s Senate, let his feelings about childless women be known. “We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it’s just a basic fact if you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it.”  Women, however, will undoubtedly wield enormous influence in this year’s U.S. election. Yet, part of earning their vote is understanding their changing lifestyle choices. For example, in the U.S. there are more single women than ever before. Over half of women in the country are unmarried or separated, and a growing number of women are skipping motherhood entirely. By the age of 40, one in six women have never given birth. Unmarried women, turned out to be a key electorate for President Joe Biden in 2020. The majority -- 63 percent -- of unmarried women voted for Biden, compared to the 36 percent of those who voted for Trump. But instead of engaging this growing electorate of women, political experts said the right has decided to pose a sort of war with the exact demographic that could have a strong impact in November. Lauren Leader, co-founder and CEO of All In Together — a nonpartisan organization focused on engaging women voters — said the right has been at war with women on many fronts. From holding outdated beliefs of women and what their roles should be at home and at work, the far right has long thought of women as inferior, she argued. “…It’s always been a huge weakness for Republicans and part of why they have lost every election since 2016. But Trump has embraced the groups that push this.” What might not be evident to Vance is that the so-called ‘childless cat lady’ remark might be more aspirational than disparaging. From viral trends like the “cool aunt,” which celebrates the financial freedom and personal independence reaped by women without children of their own, to the data that shows women without children or spouses are the happiest subgroup in the population. Indeed, many single, childless women are flourishing. And contrary to Vance’s argument that these women having “no stake in America,” single women in the U.S. are contributing in a big way. Lauren Napier, founder of the SP1NSTER — a lifestyle brand that harnesses the collective spending power of single women — said “child-free women have money and time. There are trillions of dollars circulating the U.S. economy completely powered by single women. There’s even is a movement called “S.I.N.K.”, single income no kids.” Napier, who is child-free by choice, said she wouldn’t have it any other way. “It is no different than bachelorhood — which is revered. I have a very full life and I go to bed and wake up at my own pace. This weekend I am taking a French lesson and floral design class with a group of girlfriends. I have a date tomorrow night and I am headed out to a mixer this evening. If I decide to make a night of it, I can because I am my only obligation,” she shared. Vance’s “cat lady” comment, however, shows  a real disconnect with some women’s ability to have children in the first place, said political analyst and Republican consultant, Elise Jordan. “It’s a cruel, insensitive comment reflective of a judgmental worldview steeped in male ignorance. To ignore the intense grief of desiring a child and being unable to conceive shows a basic gap in one’s humanity. Women lucky enough not to suffer infertility have a friend or sister in their life who has struggled to conceive. Vance managed to throw salt in a universal wound for women and the men who love them,” said Jordan. Experts also pointed out the very real political and economic factors that influence a woman’s ability to have children: skyrocketing child care costs, cost of living, health care, abortion rights, and even maternal mortality rates. Vance’s unearthed comment was criticized by women who are child-free, often not by choice. For Ashley Reece, a 33-year-old writer in New York, having a child is something she wants. Reece — who also happens to be a proud cat owner — planned to have a child with her husband. But in 2022, he passed away from cancer. “For someone who has kind of made so much of their brand as being this well-rounded person going from rural beginnings to Harvard Law, you would think that this person would have a pretty diverse view of the world and the people within it,” said Reece who is a Democrat. “And for him to just kind of paint everyone who’s childless as some like miserable cat owner, who has no stake in the future... his views are a little more stunted than he he’d like to believe.”  Actress Jennifer Aniston, who doesn’t have biological children of her own, recently criticized Vance on her Instagram Stories, “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States. All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Jordan said Vance’s recent remarks and the Republican party’s continued efforts to restrict reproductive rights, will only hurt them politically come November. “Democrats should welcome a continued barrage of cruel comments as a political gift and easy cannon fodder. Access to life-saving medical care without government interference is an issue of basic human freedom. Any time Democrats can remind voters that elected Republicans inserted the government into the privacy and sanctity of personal healthcare decisions, they win politically.” Vance, however, defended his remarks about Democratic women during an interview with Megyn Kelly on Friday. “I know the media wants to attack me and wants me to back down on this, Megyn, but the simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way,” he said. “It’s not a criticism of people who don’t have children. I explicitly said in my remarks, despite the fact the media has lied about this, that this is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic party for becoming anti-family and anti-child,” he said.

"Stop being a Debbie Downer. Democrats need to lock in support for Harris, not step on it.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 7:16 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/democrats-harris-enthusiasm-carville-100-days-rcna163848,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 26 episode of “Morning Joe.” During an appearance on “The Beat,” veteran Democratic strategist James Carville told Ari Melber that members of his party were too enthusiastic about the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris: Gee, why such a Debbie Downer? The overwhelmingly positive response to the Harris candidacy is its own cause for celebration among Democrats who have been concerned by the state of the race for months. A strong campaign team can make great television ads or build a great field organization, but it can’t manufacture enthusiasm for your candidate. A fired-up base of supporters is the fuel that propels the most successful campaigns and — as one of the most heralded political strategists of the last three decades — Carville certainly knows this. I guess he’s just nervous about the onslaught of attacks that await the vice president.   You can be both enthusiastic about the Democrats’ new ticket and clear-eyed about the challenges Harris and her running mate will face. As someone who was on the front lines of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, I know I am. It’s going to get ugly and it’s going to be a slog, which is all the more reason why the vice president needs joyful warriors who will have her back during the brutal days ahead. So don’t be a buzzkill. We all need some positive vibes. Knowing of Carville’s anxiety about “preachy females” in the Democratic Party, I also have to wonder if his lamentations about Harris supporters being “giddy” and feeling “liberated” are directed at voters he assumes are elated by the notion of electing the first woman president. That’s not my motivation, nor was it during the 2016 campaign. I just thought Clinton was the best person for the job — which is how I feel this time with Harris. And I think women are extremely motivated to help the vice president now because our lives and those of our daughters and granddaughters are the most threatened by Donald Trump’s extreme agenda. I know firsthand the despair and disempowerment women have felt as we watched polls slip away toward a Trump landslide win. They had left us wondering if we had any agency in this country at all. Was it too late to save democracy or protect the young women and girls in this country? Now, we have a fighting chance to win. I think it’s that hope, that belief that it’s not too late and that there is something each of us can do to ward off a Trump win and secure victory for Harris that accounts for the massive show of support from women and men. Less than a week into her campaign, women and men both have undertaken historic organizing efforts and raised millions of dollars for her. The vice president has shown she’s more than ready for this fight, and that’s inspired us to rally behind her in a very big way. We feel a responsibility to get her elected and empowered to get the job done. Given the dark weeks that preceded this moment, it feels liberating."
Why Trump’s attacks on Kamala Harris will be much nastier than usual,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-attacks-racism-sexism-rcna163313,"We’re 100 days out from the general election, and if you think Kamala Harris’ candidacy as the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee is unprecedented, wait until you see the unprecedentedly vicious and ugly attacks against her. Of course, former President Donald Trump’s campaigns are always nasty work; that’s to be expected from a loud-mouthed, racist, sexist, petty, congenital liar of a candidate. But Trump has always singled out Black women for his most denigrating abuse. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of misogynoir, which describes the coupled misogyny and racism thrown at Black women, please familiarize yourself, stat, because this election season will be lousy with it. Now that the felonious ex-president must face off against Harris — a biracial Black woman and erstwhile prosecutor nearly 20 years his junior — we’re already seeing disgusting assaults on the vice president’s character that aren’t remotely based in fact. Remember those vile T-shirts, popular with Trump’s supporters earlier in the campaign, that read, “Joe and the Ho Gotta Go”? Expect even more hypersexualization toward Harris by Trump, his surrogates and his MAGA followers. They’re alleging Harris “slept her way to the top” — as Megyn Kelly claimed — referencing her relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who had been separated from his wife for over a decade when he and Harris dated 30 years ago. Those falsehoods are also being paired with claims that Harris is a “DEI hire,” a repurposing of “diversity, equity and inclusion” favored by conservatives who are too media-savvy to use overt slurs. Before becoming multiple firsts as vice president and in Congress, Harris was elected the first woman, first African American and first South Asian attorney general in California history, and served as San Francisco’s first woman and nonwhite district attorney. Her track record easily beats the allegations, but when she proves her rhetorical and intellectual competence against Trump, which will be fun to watch, they’ll try to portray her as a “typical angry Black lady.” These bad-faith allegations will be lodged by people who believe Blackness and womanness, regardless of resume, are inherent markers of unfitness. The terms “militant,” “radical,” “California socialist” and “Marxist” will be in heavy rotation, and Trump’s team will claim Harris, as president, will defund every police department and encourage mass migration to let undocumented immigrants vote in elections for Democrats. Just this week, in fact, Trump advisers boasted to The Bulwark of their strategic plan to “Willie Horton” Harris, a reference to racist campaign ads during the 1988 presidential campaign appealing to white panic over perceptions of Black criminality, which portrayed then-Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as lenient on violent offenders. That messaging will go hand in hand with fearmongering about immigration, with the GOP repeatedly claiming Harris failed as the Biden administration’s “border czar” — a title she never held, which the GOP made up and a complicit media helped proliferate. Numerous Republicans have filed impeachment articles against Harris since she became the presumptive nominee, and they’ll continue in this vein because their base loves a good show, however performative. Their own party thwarted a border security bill early this year because Trump wanted to run on immigration chaos. In any case, border crossings have fallen hugely in recent months, and currently stand near where they were in the final months under Trump’s watch. The Republican Party’s boundless hypocrisy means they’ll contradict themselves at every turn. The same partisans who wanted you to believe Harris slept her way to the top of a major-party ticket will also portray her as a childless, careerist feminazi whose hatred for America’s family model is surpassed only by her passion for funding post-birth abortions. Regardless of how she handles the Israel-Hamas war, some of the same Republicans known to dabble in antisemitism will claim Harris — the first Biden administration official to call for a cease-fire, but also a consistent defender of Israel’s “right to defend itself” — is stridently anti-Jewish. While using a super-racist nickname like, say, “Kamala X,” they’ll insist her Jamaican and Indian immigrant parentage makes her neither Black nor American — a reconfiguring of the racist “birtherism” directed at President Barack Obama. (Misogynoir being what it is, they may also falsely suggest, as they do with former first lady Michelle Obama, that she isn’t really a woman.) She’ll be cast as lax on crime, but also labeled “Kamala the cop,” and since they think Black people are gullible, criminal morons, Trump will trot out rappers while surrogates celebrate his felonies as proof he’s Blacker than Harris. Vivek Ramaswamy and every Black Republican will obligingly repeat these lines to defang any racism accusations. But the most insidious claim of all will be that Harris cannot win. Not only will this messaging come from Trump and Co., but also from lots of other sources. Paid disinformation agents in Russia, which targeted Black voters most intensely in 2016. Red-pilled American trolls clad in digital blackface. And it’ll come from mainstream reporters concern-trolling about her campaign’s divisiveness, or a New York Times article where rural diner patrons are polled on the “scariest” things about Kamala Harris. The result will be a lot of people saying they want to vote for Harris, but they worry that no one else will. But the stats are currently on Harris’ side. In the 48 hours after Harris became the Dems’ presidential nominee, ActBlue raised $81 million, one of its highest one-day tallies in history. Politico reported that during the first 48 hours of her candidacy, Vote.org saw a 700% spike in voter registrations, which outpaces the increase that resulted from a Taylor Swift social media post. Calls organized for Black women, South Asian women, white women, Latinas, Black men and Black LGBTQ men have raised funds and helped galvanize those communities. Harris’ support among Black and Hispanic voters has bested that of Biden’s, by 8% and 6%, respectively. Polls can be fickle things, but the first Reuters/Ipsos poll since Harris became the candidate has her leading Trump, 44% to 42%. The point is, she can absolutely win. Over the next 100 days, we’re going to see horrifying levels of racism and sexism — misogynoir, that is — and it will be terrifyingly mainstream. But don’t give up hope. Vice President Harris has what it takes to beat back those representing the worst instincts of America. She just needs our votes to make it happen."
Biden’s exit is a boost for congressional Democrats’ chances,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-house-democrats-election-brighter-chances-rcna163311,"President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race was precipitated by a number of factors, but perhaps most strongly by waning support from Capitol Hill Democrats. From Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to senior House Democrats and those in competitive districts, Biden’s support from party insiders collapsed. Their thinly veiled fears were that Biden would not only lose to former President Donald Trump, but would potentially deliver historic losses for Democrats in Congress. As MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki observed about the president’s standing in national polls upon his withdrawal, these were polling theories that will never be tested. But what we do know is congressional Democrats have now been untethered from one of the great questions that had been facing them in November. No longer are House Democrats forced off message by having to defend the personal fitness of their presidential candidate. They can now clearly run on their agenda for the American people and can prosecute the political case against congressional Republicans. That opportunity has House Democrats excited, and rightfully so. Consider the Republicans’ chaotic term in the congressional majority. They started this 118th Congress unable to elect a speaker of the House. They failed at the basic functions of funding the government, addressing the nation’s debt ceiling and supporting our international alliance opposing Vladimir Putin and Russian aggression. At each of these most critical junctures, it was House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and House Democrats who stepped up and governed, delivering the majority of votes for Congress to function and execute its constitutional responsibilities. The Republican response to these episodes of responsible Democratic leadership was to then topple their own House speaker and plunge the House into renewed leadership chaos before finally arriving at the hard-right Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republicans have also governed this Congress largely devoid of any real agenda for the American people. They spent a year flirting with impeaching Biden and chasing his son Hunter Biden time and again — embarrassing themselves with deflated conspiracy theories. They formed a government weaponization committee to attack federal and state prosecutors otherwise lawfully executing their duties to seek indictments of Trump. In fact, many Republican members skipped out on their official duties in Congress in humiliating fashion, donning blue suits and red ties and rushing to the Manhattan courtroom where their political leader was eventually convicted of 34 felony counts. Voters would be right to wonder what congressional Republicans have done for them these past two years. Democrats, by contrast, are anxious to offer their vision to the American people — protect Social Security and Medicare, defend reproductive freedom, and fight growing economic inequality made worse by Republican tax and tariff proposals. Democrats want to share their vision for lowering prescription drug costs, securing access to health care and education for more Americans and continuing investments in infrastructure and technology. And on foreign policy, Democrats accept responsibility for defending our interests abroad just as strongly as they defend them here at home. House Democrats now go into November on a very firm foundation, and the polls show it. In a recent memo from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Democratic House candidates continue to strongly outperform their Republican opponents in fundraising and polling, and these trends are most importantly seen in their most critical races — the most competitive majority-making congressional seats, what Democrats call their “Frontline” races. Incumbent Democratic House members in Frontline districts now lead their Republican opponents by an average of 8 points, and these Democratic members enjoy a net favorability rating of 10 points. For Democratic candidates trying to flip currently held Republican seats in competitive districts, they are polling ahead or tied in virtually every district targeted by House Democrats, and their net favorability is a strong 7 points. Democrats are on message, Republicans are out of touch, and the American people are paying attention. House Democrats are poised to regain control of Congress. The last month of Democratic hand-wringing over Biden’s disastrous debate performance understandably distracted the nation, and it consumed the president’s party. Although polling showed no statistical change to Democrats’ standing in Congress following the debate in Atlanta, the national conversation certainly changed. It was the reason Pelosi, Schumer and others expressed such panic. That chapter is now over. House Democrats are back, and their message is clear: Vote blue to secure your fundamental rights and ensure an economy and America for all people. Democrats believe the choice is a clear one for voters. They would be right to feel enthusiastic about their prospects in November."
Why Democrats feel confident about holding the Senate in November,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-senate-election-2024-rcna163877,"In Montana, a third-generation dirt farmer will face a dishonest, rich out-of-stater that real Montanans call a “wannabe cowboy.” In Ohio, a lifelong champion for workers is running against a deceitful car salesman who was successfully taken to court for wage theft, while media outlets have reported he’s playing fast and loose with his own biography on the campaign trail. In Arizona, the choice will be between a Marine who has defended our country and Kari Lake, who seems only interested in defending her power-mad lie that she won an election the courts said she lost. Matches like these are playing out in every Senate race in states across the country. It doesn’t seem like Senate Republicans are sending their best. As chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during our history-defying and victorious 2022 campaign cycle, and as the winner of tough elections in Michigan, I know that voters view Senate races as a battle between candidates. And one thing Mitch McConnell and I agree on is that candidate quality matters. Each of our races will be close. We have a big map this year. But 100 days out, I have never been more confident that Democrats are in the strongest possible position to defend our Senate majority thanks to the strength of our candidates, the power of their campaigns and the weakness of Republican recruits. In each of our races, I believe our Democratic candidate will win because they can attract a diverse coalition of voters. For months, they’ve been communicating with voters about their values, accomplishments and plans to continue fighting for the priorities that matter most to the people in their states. But the most important reason I believe Senate Democrats will win is because voters recognize the stakes of this election and that Senate Democrats are on their side when it comes to the issues that matter most to their lives: protecting women’s freedom to make their own decisions about their health care, cracking down on big corporations that get rich by keeping prices high, keeping good-paying jobs in America, securing the border and standing against the attacks Republicans have pledged to mount against Medicare, Social Security and the Affordable Care Act. We have a lot of work to do between now and November. It will require resources and grassroots energy. And when we do this work, in 100 days I am confident that Senate Democrats will have successfully defended our majority, because we have better candidates, stronger campaigns and a winning message."
The history I share with Sonya Massey makes me grieve her death even more,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 28, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sonya-massey-william-donnegan-lynched-rcna163511,"According to the family of Sonya Massey, the 36-year-old mother of two shot dead by an Illinois sheriff’s deputy July 6, she was a descendant of William K. Donnegan, who’d been a shoemaker and conductor on the Underground Railroad before he was lynched by a white mob during the Springfield Race Riot in 1908. Massey, they say, died at the same hospital, St. John’s, where Donnegan died after his white attackers slit his throat and hanged him from a tree outside his home. Like Massey, I am the descendant of a Black man who was lynched. My great-grandfather, Burt Bridges, was hanged from a tree in Mississippi in 1904. His son, Houston Buckley, whom I called Papa, never knew his father, as he was born after that murder. In the 1980s, when I was a child and Papa was in his early 80s, I saw him sitting in his old, green recliner in the living room, his head in his hands and sobbing: “Them white folks lynched my daddy.” Grandmama couldn’t have known when she married the young Houston that he would be mourning his murdered father even in his final years. From the doorway of the kitchen that day, she urged him to pull himself together and to “leave the past in the past.” Yet the past has an ugly way of refusing to stay in its place. It took 20 years for me to publish “We Are Bridges,” a memoir I wrote to examine how this violent part of our past had impacted my family through the generations, to attempt to heal the fractured parts of me and to pass on the stories of our ancestors — including their beauty, laughter and talents — to my son and generations not yet born. It is, admittedly, a lofty attempt at bridging the past, present and future. It is my personal contribution to an ongoing battle against racism and patriarchy. And yet, as I wrote and revised the manuscript over the years, the ugliest parts of the past kept trying to outpace whatever progress there was. With one eye on the news and one on my developing manuscript, I tried to make sense of the unjust killings of Black people — Sean Bell, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, Philando Castile, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd — happening in real time. On my way home from work last week, a craving for homemade nachos hit me like a head-on collision. It wasn’t until I was standing over my cutting board, chopping up onion and garlic for beans, that the source of the sudden longing dawned on me:  Sonya Massey. I had watched Massey’s son, Malachi, tell a CBS News reporter how much he loved his mother’s food and describe her as a loving “ball of energy.” And I’d read an article that mentioned one of her cousins praising her shredded chicken nachos. As I ate the food I made, I felt an ache that seemed to stretch across time and space. This craving, I realized, represented an insatiable demand for law enforcement to stop carrying out this country’s legacy of lynching. After responding to Massey’s 911 call about a possible prowler outside her home in Springfield, Illinois, Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy Sean Grayson shot and killed Massey while she was in her kitchen. Her kitchen. That place from which she created culinary joy for herself and her loved ones. Bodycam footage shows that Grayson, who has been fired and is charged with first-degree murder, sent her to the kitchen to turn off a pot of boiling water. My ears burned at his profanity-laced threats to shoot her in the face and the popping of his pistol as he did just that. He shot her as she held the pot. She was a 36-year-old Black mother whose family loved her, but Grayson killing her shows he could not see her humanity. Maybe it’s just a coincidence that incidents such as these keep happening in presidential election years. George Floyd, 2020; Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, 2016. Trayvon Martin, 2012. Massey, 2024. Her ancestor, Donnegan, and my great-grandfather, Burt Bridges, were lynched in presidential election years, too. I’m not saying there is a connection — only that these are not unprecedented times and that these crimes have often happened in the years we’re spending the most time thinking about the future of our country. As a survivor of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow (we are here, after all), I am disgusted and dismayed, but never shocked by the domestic and racial terrorism that continues to pervade the “free world.” I have grown weary of writing about and talking about these injustices, but with each fatal shooting, beating and chokehold, my great-grandfather’s name rings out to me. This problem is not one for Black people to fix. We are done. The work of understanding the complexities of systemic violence, and eradicating it, sits squarely on the shoulders of people like Grayson and the institutions that empower them. After watching the footage of Massey being killed, the volcanic buildup of a deep, long and ugly cry surged from my belly to my chest. I planted my face down into a bath towel I was holding and howled as loud as I could. My tears were not just my own. I was crying for and with Donna Massey, who broke down in tears in that CBS News interview, under the unbearable grief of losing her daughter. I was crying with and for my papa, too."
The polls send a clear message about Kamala Harris. But that’s not the full story.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 27, 2024, 9:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/can-kamala-harris-beat-donald-trump-polls-rcna163225,"When President Joe Biden announced that he had chosen to drop out of the race after a messy debate performance followed by an equally chaotic month, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee in his stead, Harris quickly racked up endorsements from major party figures and a majority of delegates. Barring any major development, she will be the Democratic nominee this fall. Many Democrats saw this passing of the baton as a key moment to redefine a campaign in which the president had been lagging behind. For months, former President Donald Trump had led Biden in polling, both nationally and especially in critical swing states needed to win the presidency. Now an important question arises: Is Harris a stronger candidate than Biden? Ever since Harris’ kickoff of her 2020 presidential campaign, there have been a number of concerns that she would not be a particularly strong candidate. In fact, her campaign ended before the Iowa caucuses, which critics point to as an example of her weakness as a candidate. And her performance in polls against Trump often trailed behind other Democrats’, including Biden’s. But as the 2024 campaign ramped up, there were signs of Harris’ increasing strength — or perhaps Biden’s growing vulnerabilities. Last fall, a New York Times/Siena College poll found Harris slightly outpolled Biden in swing states, thanks to her relative strength with Democratic-leaning groups with whom Biden had shown unprecedented weaknesses. These voters, often young and nonwhite, backed Democratic candidates for Congress and Harris, but not Biden. In the 2020 primary, Biden often outperformed all of his rival Democrats in polls against Trump. But after Biden’s June debate performance, a flurry of polls that measured both Biden and Harris have been decidedly more mixed. For our analysis, we will examine seven post-debate national polls that were conducted by “select pollsters” that meet The New York Times’ standard  for high-quality analysis, plus an additional national poll conducted by Split Ticket/Data for Progress. Of these eight, Harris outperformed Biden in two, ran even with him in two, but performed worse than him in four. Only one poll found the difference between the candidates to be greater than 2 points in either direction. On the state level, what limited evidence we have is similarly mixed. The New York Times and Siena College conducted a poll in Pennsylvania and Virginia that found Harris outrunning Biden by 2 points in both states. An Emerson College poll of Virginia, however, found no difference between the candidates. Unfortunately, those three polls are the extent of high-quality state polls since the June 27 debate. From the polls reviewed, it can be concluded that Harris performs better than Biden, particularly due to strength with young voters and nonwhite voters, two Democratic-leaning groups that have been hesitant in supporting the president but not in their support for the vice president (and some other Democrats). Despite this small polled overperformance, Harris, like Biden, still polls behind Trump. In the past few weeks, Trump led Biden in polls of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, albeit narrowly, while in Sun Belt states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, Trump’s advantage ballooned out into the upper single digits, thanks to his newfound polled strength with previously Democratic nonwhite voters. Even if Harris gained a point or two over Biden in all six states, she would still be reliant on a narrow path to the presidency that is conditional on sweeping the three Midwest swing states. But Harris gaining equally in all six states is not likely; in fact she is more likely to gain in the Sun Belt, where disaffected Democrats are younger and less white than in the Rust Belt. This makes any coalitional gains for her even less efficient than they might appear. More specifically, even if Harris’ strength with these disengaged voters is real, she would have an outsize impact only in the states where Biden’s numbers have already put Democrats in a very weak position. A surge in nonwhite support would, by contrast, have a far more limited effect in Michigan or Wisconsin, meaning Harris may be put in a position where she narrowly falls short of victory in the the Sun Belt despite considerable gains, while the Rust Belt result versus Biden’s hypothetical November performance remains almost unchanged. There’s also a case to be made that the president is the stronger candidate. Although Biden has since bowed out of the race, and almost certainly will not return to the ticket, we shouldn’t ignore some of his unique strengths that Harris may not share. He had already demonstrated his ability to defeat Trump once in 2020; and his poll numbers among white voters and the elderly were on par with those from his 2020 victory — at times, better than what Harris saw. In fact, the groups he had slipped the most with were core Democratic groups, ones that would be most easily goaded back into the coalition as November drew nearer, and the possibility of a second Trump presidency could have been an effective rallying cry for the incumbent president. It is entirely possible that the advantages enjoyed by Harris are simply through winning a greater share of voters who would have “come home” to either candidate. We may never know the answer, but July came to a close with little evidence that these voters had begun the process of returning to Biden — which is why Harris would occasionally outperform him in polls. The strongest case for Biden, then, was that he had already established a “good” baseline among voters least friendly to Democrats, and that his catastrophic numbers with young and nonwhite voters was something of a mirage that would disappear by Election Day. In polling so far, Harris’ strengths relative to Biden’s mostly come from the latter group. Biden also demonstrated regional strength in Northeastern states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Maine, where many counties swung toward Trump in 2016, but then back toward Democrats when Biden was on the ticket in 2020. This helped deliver a decisive win for Biden in states where Hillary Clinton lost or came close to losing in 2016. As a former senator from California, Harris is much less likely to enjoy the same regional advantages Biden did in a part of the country with more swing states. But the case for Harris is less about existing polls, which were asking an entirely hypothetical question of voters up until the Sunday Biden resigned. Instead, Harris gives Democrats an opportunity rarely afforded to a party at this point in the year: a chance to reset the campaign. In fact, Harris’ potential to re-energize disaffected Democrats could also go undetected by polls. Because polls depend on a representative model of the electorate, a poll based on a Biden-Trump model could miss disengaged Democrats who would vote for Harris, but not Biden, potentially understating her true strength with the electorate. These demoralized Democrats could be skipping out on Biden for a number of reasons ranging from his age, which is broadly a concern for all voters, to his handling of the conflict in the Middle East, which is criticized by progressive Democrats, or his association by the electorate with double-digit percentage price increases since his inauguration, which is generally under scrutiny from moderate Democrats. Harris is not fully burdened by these factors, and as a breakout candidate, can more freely define herself to voters across the political spectrum dissatisfied with the Biden presidency. Biden’s campaign had hoped that its poll numbers would turn around as public awareness of Trump’s many liabilities, ranging from election denialism to his dozens of convictions, increased. Instead, the past month has largely revolved around Biden’s age and fitness for office. Harris, at 59, is unlikely to be dogged by this particular issue, and may even be successful in making Trump’s age, at 78, an issue for the former president. But most importantly, Harris can clearly and cogently prosecute the Democrats’ case against Trump, unburdened by Biden’s personal liabilities. She may have a number of her own, and as vice president has already inherited the Biden administration’s unpopularity. It is also possible that she ends up becoming an even less popular figure than Biden, and her strength relative to him revealed to be a mirage. This does not invalidate previous conclusions made from polling top lines, but instead means that Harris may offer Democrats a better chance than Biden to change the party’s polling woes, and to fulfill their original goal of making the election a choice between themselves and Trump — instead of a referendum on Biden. Although a Harris candidacy may introduce more uncertainties to the Democratic ticket, including a yet-unknown vice presidential nominee, when one is falling behind in a contest, the greater variability a fresh face can bring is exactly what’s needed to secure a win."
Trump lost his immunity battle — but won the war,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 7:35 AM PDT / Updated July 1, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-immunity-ruling-alito-thomas-rcna158005,"After the Supreme Court rejected the full sweep of Donald Trump’s presidential immunity argument on Monday, we can say the former president lost the battle — but won the war. Conservative justices like Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas may not have let Trump off the hook by proclaiming him immune to all prosecution. But they tossed out portions of Jack Smith’s indictment and delayed the case as much as they could in the hope that Trump can avoid more guilty verdicts, get elected and carry out the un-American, authoritarian agenda they share, which includes packing the courts with even more MAGA judges.  That’s why Trump hailed the opinion as a “big win.” Fortunately there are steps that the lower courts and the American people can take to respond. To start, let’s look at how we got here. All six Republican-appointed justices reached the court with the backing of groups like the billionaire-funded Federalist Society. Trump’s three nominees for the court came from a list written by Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo. The conservative legal movement’s aim is no secret: to take us back to the America of the 1920s. They want to return to a country when the excesses of unregulated capitalism went unrestrained (before plunging the nation into the Great Depression), and systemic sexism and racism went uncontested. This plan has been in place for many years. Recently, however, the justices, foremost among them Alito and Thomas, have stopped trying at all to hide their participation. Witness, for example, Alito and Thomas’ refusal to recuse themselves from this case, even though the actions of both justices’ spouses clearly created an appearance of partiality. With this in mind, we need to divorce ourselves from the idea that the Supreme Court majority was undertaking a legitimate, nuanced internal legal argument over presidential immunity. They were not. Had that been the case, they would have decided this case in a timely fashion that would have allowed a trial in 2024. But their approach to this case was always about delay, delay, delay. It certainly wasn’t about the law. If the justices had genuine concerns about the nuances of presidential immunity, they had a chance to take the issue up in a timely manner in December, when special counsel Jack Smith presented them with the option. Taking up the issue then would have allowed the Supreme Court to make a decision in plenty of time for Trump’s Jan. 6 trial to start, and conclude, before this year’s presidential election. They refused. Only after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled against Trump’s claims of immunity in February did the Supreme Court decide to revisit the issue. They set the oral argument for April 25, making their intent even more obvious with a hearing at the very last sitting in the court’s term. And rather than issue a decision with all due speed, as has happened in other momentous cases like Bush v. Gore, not to mention the alacrity with which they rejected the challenge to Trump appearing on the Colorado ballot just a few months ago, they delayed a decision until the last possible day this term. That is no accident. It is a deliberate attempt by the MAGA justices to slow down the process and shield Trump from the repercussions of the criminal conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 election. Contrast the court’s timeline with what happened when Trump faced a jury of everyday Americans. In a trial that took less than two months, Trump faced 34 charges in a court of law and was convicted by a jury on every single one of them. When Americans are presented with evidence of Trump’s crimes, they are not fooled by his lies — they choose to hold him accountable. The MAGA justices have done everything in their power to prevent Trump from receiving another fair trial before the election, because the thing most capable of stopping Trump’s agenda has been the commitment of the American people to holding the former president accountable for his actions. Too many commentators on this case have been thinking about a battle while the Supreme Court has been focusing on the wider war. Presidential immunity isn’t the objective. Even the most pro-MAGA justices know that unlimited presidential immunity sets a terrible precedent. That is clear from the test they have promulgated, limiting such immunity — while making the completion of a 2024 trial an impossibility. Those justices are intent not on completely absolving Trump through an official ruling, but on creating the circumstances that will allow Trump to win the presidential election and make the whole Jan. 6 case against Trump moot. If they are successful, the nightmarish results that would follow were on stark display in the first presidential debate, such as Trump’s threat to weaponize the Justice Department against his political rivals. But there is still a path to stopping the pro-Trump agenda on the court now, before the former president and his allies can get their hooks into the White House for the second time. The Court has given Judge Chutkan the ability to hold an evidentiary hearing to apply its test.  That will allow her to rebut the presumption that Trump’s pressure campaign against Pence is entitled to immunity and also to decide whether Trump’s interactions with parties outside of the executive branch fall within the outer perimeter of official duties. She should do so expeditiously, demonstrating that his conduct was not shielded by the Constitution.  While that is no substitute for a full trial, it is better than nothing and will at least call attention to Trump’s propensity for breaking the law — a companion piece to the Manhattan conviction.  The ultimate recourse is now at the ballot box. As in 2018, 2020 and 2022, the antidote to the MAGA agenda is an American public that is animated by a need to preserve our laws, justice and values. We recognize that the stakes — and the risk — are even higher after the presidential debate, but also that ample time remains to make the case to the American people that accountability is up to them. If Trump loses, there is no obstacle to his being tried in this and the other remaining criminal cases. Justice is now ultimately in the hands of the voters."
"With immunity ruling, Supreme Court raises the stakes in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/immunity-ruling-supreme-court-raises-stakes-2024-race-rcna159781,"On May 19, 1977, millions of Americans tuned in to watch an installment of David Frost’s multipart interview with former President Richard Nixon. This was nearly three years after the Republican was forced to resign in disgrace, and public interest in Nixon and the Watergate scandal remained high. Viewers to the third part of the Frost/Nixon Q&A saw the former president deliver one of the most memorable political claims of the generation: “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” For nearly a half-century, Nixon’s claim has stood as a classic example of political and legal radicalism. In the United States, no one is above the law, and the idea that a president’s official actions, by definition, are legal — even when they’re not — represented obvious madness. Indeed, it’s not as if there was a spirited public conversation in 1977 about whether or not Nixon was correct. He plainly was not. The former president’s assertion, nearly five decades later, still seems shocking, dangerous, and in a rather literal sense, un-American. Alas, Republican Supreme Court justices have come to the conclusion that Nixon was onto to something. In a 6-3 ruling in Trump v. U.S. — an oddly fitting case name, given the circumstances — the high court’s dominant far-right majority concluded that some of Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat are immune from criminal prosecution. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained: It’s notable that the court’s GOP-appointed members chose to issue the decision the same week as the Fourth of July holiday — an occasion in which Americans have traditionally celebrated the time when we forcefully rejected the idea that we would be ruled by an unaccountable king. In terms of the practical implications, special counsel Jack Smith’s election-related case now returns to the district court, which as Rubin’s report explained, will begin trying to determine whether Trump’s alleged misconduct included official or unofficial acts, “which will likely add further delay to the case, making it even more unlikely to go to trial before the November election.” To put it mildly, few saw this coming. In fact, it was widely assumed that Trump would lose the case, but the defeat would be inconsequential because the Supreme Court ran out the clock, ensuring that the presumptive GOP nominee’s case wouldn’t go to trial before Election Day 2024. This, many observers assumed, was the real scandal. As regular readers might recall, it was easy to argue that the litigation was hardly a real case to begin with. Trump’s lawyers, desperate to delay the legal proceedings, appeared to concoct a bizarre legal claim as a transparent stalling tactic. To the extent that this ever was a legitimate question, it was answered emphatically by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued a unanimous ruling in February. “It would be a striking paradox if the president, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity,” the judges concluded, adding, “We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.” The D.C. Circuit went on to describe Trump’s position as “irrational,” adding that under the Republican’s preferred approach, presidents would be “free to commit all manner of crimes with impunity.” As hard as it is to believe, six sitting justices disagreed. “Today’s decision to grant former Presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the Presidency,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. “It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law. Relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about the need for ‘bold and unhesitating action’ by the President ... the Court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.” The progressive jurist added, “The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune. “Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority’s message today.” Sotomayor concluded, “Never in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law. Moving forward, however, all former Presidents will be cloaked in such immunity. If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop. With fear for our democracy, I dissent.” The stakes were already high in the 2024 presidential race. The Supreme Court just upped the ante: Donald Trump — a man who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions — learned today that he enjoys at least some immunity from prosecution, no matter how obvious his alleged crimes might be. What a terrifying day this is."

Why I joined other former military leaders in rejecting Trump’s immunity claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"April 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 1, 2024, 8:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-military-national-security-rcna147049,"UPDATE (July 1, 2024, 11:15 a.m. ET): On Monday morning, the Supreme Court ruled that on Trump’s presidential immunity claim, finding some of the former president’s alleged efforts to overturn the election are immune from criminal prosecution, and likely delayed a trial date in the federal election interference case. Imagine a large group of activists assembled outside the White House, peacefully protesting a recent decision by the president. They are waving signs denouncing the new policy, holding banners demanding change and chanting slogans about that president. As their numbers begin to swell, as their voices grow louder, the president issues an order to military commanders: Take them out. Our military leadership would then be faced with an impossible choice. They’d either have to follow the clearly unlawful order of their commander in chief, and commit crimes for which they could be prosecuted, or openly defy that order. This is not a far removed hypothetical, but a very real choice service members could face if the president of the United States is immune from criminal prosecution. It could become the reality for our men and women in uniform if the commander in chief is found not to be restrained by the law. These are the incredibly big, country-defining — possibly democracy-ending — stakes before the Supreme Court this week as it considers former President Donald Trump’s argument that he is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for any ""official acts."" The two bedrocks of the United States military are the principle of civilian control and the rule of law. Civilian control is enshrined in our Constitution and has guided us through centuries of conflict. The military does not operate outside our democratic system, but instead answers to our elected representatives and appointed civilian leaders. At the same time, the military and the civilians who control it have a duty to operate within the rule of law. These two principles function together because of trust. The military trusts that the orders they receive are lawful, and the president and the American people trust that the military will follow and obey the chain of command. Coupled with this is the military’s affirmative duty to disobey unlawful orders. If the president is above the law and can issue illegal orders at will and without accountability, then members of our military can be thrust into a nightmare scenario where they’re forced to choose between obeying an unlawful order or following their duty to disobey. Taking this one step further, how do service members throughout the chain of command respond if there is an order coming from the commander in chief demanding that they do something illegal and another coming from the top of the military leadership telling them to disobey? There would be chaos as each unit commander and each individual service member decided which to follow. This would inevitably destroy the United States military as a fighting force and as a defender of democracy. This threat to our military and national security is why I joined the amicus brief in Trump v. United States with 18 former service secretaries and retired four-star admirals and generals. I have served my country both in uniform and as a civilian leader, and I believe in the critical role the military plays in upholding our democracy. We cannot stay silent about the risks to our nation and our national security if the president is placed above the law. Such is a belief held by dictators, not democratically elected representatives. Notably, no other president or former president in our history has argued, as Trump has, that he must break the law to be effective. The signers of this amicus brief served in every presidential administration from President John F. Kennedy to Trump. All those in uniform served for decades and attained four stars, the highest military rank. Among them are former chiefs of staff for the Army and Air Force and a former commandant of the Marines, a combatant commander, fleet commanders, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, and myriad other posts at the very top of our military. Signers include former service secretaries from all the branches — Navy, Army and Air Force. Every signer has devoted much of their life to serving and defending our country and understands the profound risk to our military if a president is not held to the rule of law. One of the great strengths of our military, and one of the reasons it is held in such high esteem by Americans, is that it is not political. Our military and civilian leaders take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and not to any person, regardless of the office that person holds. Having a military loyal to a person or party is the antithesis of a democracy and the definition of a dictatorship.  The questions in this case are monumental yet clear: Will we continue to hold to the belief that no person is above the law? Will we continue to have the greatest military force of all time dedicated to preserving the very idea of this country as first laid out by the founders? Will we continue to be a beacon of democracy and hope for the world? Will we preserve the nearly 2 1/2-century-old democracy that was bought and defended by blood, brought through fiery trials and bequeathed to us? As President Abraham Lincoln articulated in his second inaugural address, “fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray” that all the answers are yes."
"Why Dems, for now, are keeping their powder dry on Biden’s future",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 7:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-now-are-keeping-powder-dry-bidens-future-rcna159745,"If it were up to many of the nation’s leading political pundits, President Joe Biden would be spending the day working on the details of his retirement plan. I started putting together a list over the weekend of the prominent media voices calling on the incumbent Democrat to pass the torch, but I eventually gave up — because it was difficult to keep up with the deluge. The editorial board of The New York Times was arguably the most prominent voice to urge Biden to stand down, and the editorial board of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution soon followed with a front-page argument of its own. The Atlantic published a half-dozen pieces in the aftermath of last week’s debate calling on Biden to end his candidacy. They were joined by Thomas Friedman, Paul Krugman, Maureen Dowd, David Remnick, David Ignatius, and many, many others. Complicating matters, anxiety among many leading Democratic donors has reached the point at which some aren’t just looking for alternatives to the incumbent, some are also looking for refunds. There’s no reason to assume that this chatter will end anytime soon. Indeed, once this conversation starts, it’s hard to make it stop. It’s reminiscent of the point in presidential primaries when candidates start facing questions — at every appearance and in every interview — about what it’d take for them to exit the race. The lines of inquiry themselves signal to voters that these candidates have bleak futures. Every hour that Team Biden spends trying to reassure party officials, insiders, donors, voters, and pundits that his re-election plans remain on track is another hour in which it’s not making a case against Trump, drawing attention to the incumbent Democrat’s accomplishments, and presenting a vision for the future. And yet, the grand total of Democratic officials — in the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and gubernatorial offices nationwide — who’ve publicly called on Biden to step aside is zero. The Washington Post reported that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries “has told his worried members to hold their fire for a few days to see how things shake out,” and to date, they have. This is no small detail: The more Biden can keep leading Democratic officials on his side, the more he can focus on the general election. If those officials turned on him, the political challenge would go from bad to worse. So, perhaps the president can breathe a little easier, satisfied that officials from his own party haven’t called for him to step aside? It’s not quite that simple. NBC News reported on an important interview: “We’re having a serious conversation about what to do,” the Maryland Democrat told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi. Raskin, an influential voice in Democratic politics, added, “One thing I can tell you is that regardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified. ... Whether he’s the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention. He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward and beat the forces of authoritarianism and reaction in the country.” These were not the words of a congressman who believes the underlying question has been resolved. So what should the public expect from this serious intra-party conversation? As unsatisfying as this seems, polling will likely have an enormous impact. If, for example, surveys in the coming days show a relatively unchanged race, Biden and his political operation will find it far easier to address Democratic anxieties. If, on the other hand, polls from the near future show Trump’s advantage reaching new heights, that will lead to a qualitatively different Democratic discussion. Remember, for Democrats, there is nothing but affection for Biden. Those who want to see him replaced on the ticket don’t do so because they dislike or disapprove of him; they’re motivated solely by electoral considerations. If the president isn’t going to win in November, the argument goes, then he’ll need to step aside. The Democratic conversation will almost certainly be data-driven, and to the frustration of the impatient, that data is not yet available."
Why Biden and Trump are facing asymmetric post-debate pressures,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 6:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-trump-are-facing-asymmetric-post-debate-pressures-rcna159730,"It would be an overstatement to argue that no prominent voices have urged Donald Trump to end his 2024 campaign. The editorial board of The Philadelphia Inquirer, for example, made a compelling case over the weekend that the former president should drop out of the race. After the Republican’s criminal conviction in May, The Washington Monthly published a similarly persuasive piece. But by any fair measure, those are the exceptions that prove the rule. In the wake of last week’s debate, incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden has faced, and continues to face, intense pressure to end his candidacy and pass the torch. His GOP rival is confronting nothing comparable. It’s worth asking why. In fact, attorney Luppe Luppen (known online as “southpaw”) summarized the dynamic this way the morning after the debate: I think there’s real merit to the observation, though the explanation for the asymmetry isn’t immediately obvious. Part of this is likely the result of pragmatism: Those hoping to persuade Biden to forgo his re-election bid appear to believe, sincerely, that he might listen to their arguments. Love him or hate him, the Democratic incumbent is a reasonable, patriotic leader, open to hearing people out. Those making the case that the president should stand down are working from the assumption that their pleas might very well have a meaningful impact. Few bother to make a comparable case to Trump, regardless of merit, because they know full well that he’d never listen to their arguments. Love him or hate him, the presumptive Republican nominee is neither a reasonable nor patriotic leader, and when confronted by those who tell him what he doesn’t want to hear, he makes up conversations in his imagination to soothe his fragile ego. Those who might be inclined to argue that Trump should stand down tend not to bother — because they know their arguments wouldn’t have any kind of impact whatsoever. But there’s another dimension to this. By and large, Biden’s admirers aren’t urging him to step aside because they’ve turned on him; they’re pressing him because they assume others will turn on him, making it more likely that Trump will prevail and put the future of the American experiment in severe jeopardy. It’s not about animus; it’s about an electoral calculation. If the Democratic incumbent is likely to lose public support, the argument goes, then he has a responsibility — to his country, to the world, to the future — to stand down in the hopes of keeping a dangerous, felonious, and undemocratic madman from reentering the White House. Trump’s admirers, meanwhile, see no need to urge him to step aside because they assume his crimes and many scandals will prove inconsequential: Some voters won’t know the truth about the presumptive GOP nominee; others won’t care; and others still will be conned into believing a counternarrative about everything being “rigged.” There was no palpable panic in Republican circles — even after he was convicted of 34 felonies, even after a jury held him liable for sexual assault, even after his business was found guilty of fraud, even after he was indicted for trying to overturn an election defeat without cause, even after he participated in a debate and was caught lying repeatedly about matters large and small — because they’ve long assumed, and continue to assume, that the facts are irrelevant. Much of the public — which is to say, enough of the public — can be convinced to believe what the party tells them to believe. Biden’s backers fear voters will turn on him; Trump’s backers are confident they won’t."
"Eyeing the 2024 ticket, Burgum joins the GOP’s race to the bottom",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/eyeing-2024-ticket-burgum-joins-gops-race-bottom-rcna159720,"Partway through his latest “Meet the Press” appearance, Gov. Doug Burgum tried to impress one viewer in particular with a bizarre claim. “Donald Trump, at the end of his term on January 20th, left the White House,” the North Dakota Republican claimed. “We had a smooth transition.” We did not have a smooth transition. Soon after, in the same interview, NBC News’ Kristen Welker noted that the former president spent much of last week’s debate brazenly lying. “As someone who is on Donald Trump’s short list to be his vice presidential nominee, do you think he should stop saying things that are not true?” the host asked. “[E]verything that he said on Thursday night, he’s been saying before,” the governor replied. “So this is not news.” It’s a defense rooted in the idea that deliberately deceiving the public is acceptable, just so long as the politician peddling the lies repeats the same false claims more than once. But perhaps most importantly, Welker asked Burgum whether he’ll accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. The guest said he would — just so long as Burgum considers the race to be “free and fair.” As regular readers know, those eager to become Trump’s running mate have come to an unfortunate conclusion: They almost certainly won’t make the Republican ticket if they say categorically that they’ll accept the 2024 election results. After all, the former president is refusing to commit to honoring the results — the same posture he adopted four years ago — so the GOP’s prospective vice presidents are sticking to the same script. Months ago, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik helped get the ball rolling, refusing to say whether she’d vote to certify the results of the 2024 election. More recently, Sen. Tim Scott appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where host Kristen Welker repeatedly pressed the South Carolinian to simply say, “yes or no,” whether he was prepared to accept the results of the upcoming presidential election. Scott refused. In May, Sen. J.D. Vance told CNN that he “plans“ to accept the election results, but only if they meet the Ohio Republican’s undefined standards, and soon after, Sen. Marco Rubio dodged the question entirely. Burgum appears to have joined an unfortunate club, no doubt aware of the fact that his national ambitions would come to an immediate halt if he failed to toe the line. As we’ve discussed, in the not-too-distant past, prominent American politicians were not asked whether they were prepared to accept their own country’s election results. The line of inquiry seemed wholly unnecessary: Our political system was stable and healthy enough to make the answer to such a question obvious. But as the radicalization of Republican politics intensifies, leading officials from the party aren’t just confronting the question, they’re also struggling to answer it. Indeed, at least so far, among the top contenders for the GOP’s 2024 ticket, none has simply replied, “Yes, win or lose, I’ll accept the results.” As for the “free and fair” phrasing, this continues to look like a rather clumsy shell game. Burgum likely knows all of this. He stuck to the partisan script anyway. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Two years ago this month, a jury in the nation’s capital found Steve Bannon guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress. In the 24 months that followed, the right-wing operative/podcaster explored every possible legal avenue in the hopes of avoiding incarceration. But when the Supreme Court rejected his last-minute bid late last week, Bannon ran out of options. The Associated Press reported overnight: It was way back in September 2021 when the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack first sent Bannon a subpoena. Even at the time, the seriousness was obvious: The podcaster was told that this was a legal summons — not a suggestion — and that failure to comply opened the door to meaningful legal consequences. Bannon nevertheless refused to cooperate. The House then approved a resolution finding the GOP operative in contempt of Congress and referred the matter to the Justice Department, which indicted the former White House strategist. A jury later convicted Bannon — his lawyers struggled to present much of a defense — ultimately leading to his prison sentence, which was imposed by a Trump-appointed judge. Congressional Republicans launched an 11th-hour bid to rescue him from legal accountability, but it proved inconsequential. It’s against this backdrop that a recent memorable quote comes to mind. “With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told USA Today in May. “With Trump, you have a team of felons.” In fact, now seems like a good time to update the big list. And did I mention that former president’s business was itself found guilty of tax fraud? Because it was. This does not include the fact that a jury held Trump liable for sexual abuse in a civil case. It also doesn’t include the fake electors who’ve been charged in jurisdictions across the country, or the Republican National Committee’s “election integrity” lawyer, who was recently indicted on election-related crimes. To be sure, some of the aforementioned men were ultimately pardoned by Trump, who doled out pardons as if they were party favors before exiting the Oval Office, but this doesn’t change the scope of the broader picture. The number of people in the Republican’s orbit who’ve been convicted of crimes in recent years is so great, The Washington Post once described it as the “remarkable universe of criminality” surrounding the former president. That was five years ago. It’s even more remarkable now. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Biden couldn’t fight history at the first debate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-debate-trump-obama-clinton-rcna159511,"There’s one word that best describes Democrats’ reaction to President Joe Biden’s performance in Thursday’s debate: panic. His faltering appearance alongside former President Donald Trump has been enough to prompt calls for his swift exit from the race in favor of another candidate. It wasn’t ideal, to put it mildly — but looking back at recent history, Biden’s poor showing was hardly unprecedented. As the incumbent, the one who’s fighting to keep the job, most sitting presidents are inherently on the defensive. It’s their records over the last four years that are in the spotlight, and they are the ones making pitches to have another chance to maintain the status quo. Challengers, on the other hand, get to go on the offensive from the jump, putting their opponents on the back foot. Biden had hoped to break that trend, as NBC News reported before the debate — which clearly didn’t go according to plan. Meanwhile, it feels absurd to consider Trump as the change candidate in this race, given that the candidates’ roles were reversed just four years ago, with him in office and Biden the one offering a return to normalcy. But Trump has benefited from the strange form of public amnesia that the intervening period has engendered, as the immediacy of Biden’s administration is foremost in voters’ minds over the chaos of his. This may be part of the reason Biden’s attempts to call out his predecessor’s record fell flat Thursday, though his scattershot delivery certainly didn’t help. Biden and his aides can take cold comfort in the fact that his former boss, President Barack Obama, didn’t fare much better during his first debate outing as an incumbent. Obama tanked hard during his first debate against GOP nominee Mitt Romney, coming across as hyper-aloof and professorial, more focused on wonking out over his record than on contrasting himself with the challenger. Romney, on the other hand, had toned down his “severe conservative” persona from the primaries and came across as more affable compared to the stern and lecturing Obama. The last two Republican incumbents faced their own difficulties when they took the debate stage. As I noted last week, Trump was a hot mess during his September 2020 showdown with Biden, seeming to spend as much time fighting with the moderator as actually engaging with the former vice president. Former President George W. Bush didn’t flame out spectacularly in 2004 against Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. But Kerry was said to have won the debate by a 2-to-1 ratio among viewers, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Biden’s camp could also look to President Ronald Reagan’s trainwreck debate in 1984. Reagan, then the oldest sitting president in history, had been faring much better in the polls than his rival, Democrat Walter Mondale, throughout the campaign. But when the two of them faced off in their first debate, Reagan was woefully unprepared and rambling and occasionally appeared confused onstage. The performance set off a flurry of questions about whether he was too old to hold the presidency and triggered a 7-point drop in the polls. It was deeply ironic, considering how severely Reagan had trounced Democratic President Jimmy Carter four years earlier. Carter had refused to take part in the earlier of the two planned debates, as it would have included Rep. John Anderson, R-Ill., who was running as an independent. The decision left Carter only one chance to defend himself and his administration with only a week before Election Day. The chance evaporated when Reagan delivered his now-iconic closing statement, asking Americans to consider “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Reagan’s successor, President George H.W. Bush, didn’t fare much better than Carter, despite having more bites at the apple. He shared the stage in October 1992 with Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton and eccentric billionaire Ross Perot, whose third-party candidacy was pulling a rare amount of attention and support. And while Bush had no major flubs, a CNN/USA Today poll conducted over the next few days found that only 16% of respondents thought the incumbent was the winner. (Notably, it was in the second debate, the first to use the now-familiar town hall format, where Clinton really shone — and Bush famously was caught on camera checking his watch). Clinton was the rare exception to this trend in the first 1996 debate against former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. The incumbent easily handled his challenger, offering up a defense of his record while still managing to land attacks of his own against the former Senate GOP leader. It definitely helped that Dole refused to focus on the “character issues” that the president would spend the next several years combatting. Even that performance from Clinton “was not his finest moment by any stretch of the imagination,” Alan Schroeder, a presidential debate historian, told NBC News. It still left Clinton in a good position to offer advice to the shaken Obama camp after the train wreck against Romney in 2012. “No one’s ever won the second debate by winning the first,” Clinton said at a fundraiser between the two debates, former aide Jon Favreau later recounted. It was clear that his team listened, delivering a pair of follow-up performances that helped enable Obama’s landslide electoral victory in November. It’s worth remembering that Reagan, Bush and even Trump also managed to make adjustments and hold their own much better in subsequent debates. Unlike his predecessors, Biden has a lot longer to recover from the missteps of last week. The next debate between the two candidates is months away instead of the usual weeks (or even days), which one imagines would be plenty of time to course-correct if it's a matter of preparedness at issue. It’s going to be up to his team this summer to draw what lessons it can from history in hopes of tacking more toward Reagan, who managed to turn his age from a point of weakness into an all-timer laugh line, and away from Carter when Biden and Trump meet again this September."
Why Americans shouldn’t buy Trump and Vance’s free speech warrior acts,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-vance-free-speech-phonies-first-amendment-rcna163102,"Republicans, conservatives and MAGA fellow travelers love to beat their chests about their commitment to free speech. But when it comes to the current leadership of the party, it’s an absurd claim.  Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, got into the free speech act during his July 17 speech at the Republican National Convention when he accepted former President Donald Trump’s nomination to be his 2024 running mate. “Shouldn’t we be governed by a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution? That’s the Republican Party of the next four years, united in our love for this country and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas,” the senator intoned in Milwaukee. Those words would sound great to my civil libertarian ears if I hadn’t already heard them all before.  For all the MAGA posturing about free speech, few political figures are more hostile to free expression than Trump, who every day continues to pad his lengthy resume of trying to silence his critics. And Vance supports some disturbing carveouts to the First Amendment. To cite just a few examples of Vance’s free speech tourism: He told Tucker Carlson that the government ought to seize the assets of nonprofit groups that advocate for political initiatives he doesn’t like; he called for raising taxes to punish corporations that engage in political activities he doesn’t like; as a senator he sent a menacing letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding a federal investigation of a Washington Post writer who penned an op-ed he didn’t like; he expressed the hope that the U.S. would emulate Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s move to take government control of universities and purge them of teachers and ideas he doesn’t like. In 2021, Vance told a reporter for a Catholic magazine that he supports a ban on pornography, a proposal that’s also included in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 policy document. (Incidentally, Project 2025’s lead writer, Kevin Roberts, has a book coming out in September with a foreword written by Vance, making the Trump campaign’s feigned ignorance of Project 2025 even less plausible.) That’s about as “free speech for me, not thee” as it gets. When it comes to the GOP’s boss, Trump, free speech hypocrisy is one of the only consistent political principles he’s ever held. Just this week, he reiterated his long-held support for criminalizing flag burning. And he’s called for using the government to strip TV stations of their licenses for running content of which he disapproves; banning vaguely defined “woke ideologies” from classrooms; and has used his wealth to file an endless stream of bogus lawsuits against media outlets and journalists as a means of making their lives “miserable.” He’s also repeatedly called for lowering the bar for journalists to be sued for libel and defamation. While a president can’t do such a thing, a MAGA-dominated Supreme Court could by overturning the landmark Sullivan v. New York Times decision — something that Justice Clarence Thomas indicated he’s open to doing. Thomas called the 1964 decision and subsequent judicial affirmations of it “policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law” and having “no relation to the text, history or structure of the Constitution.” Now, to be sure, Democrats have not cloaked themselves in glory and honor when it comes to protecting Americans’ rights to free expression. Support for rigid, punitive and selectively enforced campus speech codes, poorly thought-out policy proposals to clamp down on free expression in the name of fighting disinformation and the government’s “jawboning” of private companies to intimidate them into policing certain speech … all that stuff’s really bad for freedom of speech. But it’s been a long time since Democrats writ large have made vocal and robust support for free speech a major part of their branding. It’s Republicans like Trump, Vance and allies like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who talk a big game about standing tall for free speech in the face of the tyranny of the “woke mind virus” — while also deciding that they should be the arbiters of acceptable speech, for the good of society. Don’t let them get away with calling themselves free speech warriors. They’d absolutely curb Americans’ rights if given the power. We know this because they’re saying it — right to our faces."
How Kamala Harris should pick her 2024 running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-pick-vice-president-rcna163892,"There’s no question the Kamala Harris campaign is off to an incredible start. She’s broken fundraising records, already earned nearly every key endorsement from Democratic leadership and launched a fantastic new ad to set the tone. Her next major task? Picking a vice presidential candidate.  There are a lot of names being thrown around as potential running mates, with pundits debating whether she should pick a midwestern governor or border state Democrat to help her campaign in key battleground states.  But beyond all of the whiteboard strategizing, Harris has to ask herself a series of questions: Who does she want to be the first in the room and the last to leave for every major political discussion of her presidency? Who does she want to call from the Oval Office when stuck with a thorny issue? And with just a few months until Election Day, who has their own following, their own ability to fundraise, and their own ability to draw crowds for events?   There is no time for on-the-job training. Whoever Harris picks has to be ready to champion the Democratic ticket from Day Ane. Remember, Donald Trump picked someone who looked great on paper. But as soon as Sen. JD Vance opened his mouth on the campaign trail, things started to go downhill. The Trump campaign has spent this entire election cycle attacking the wrong opponent. And those attacks may now backfire.  The 78-year-old Trump spent a lot of time attempting to portray the 81-year-old President Joe Biden as “too old” to be president. (The maxim, “you only have to be the second-slowest swimmer in the ocean to escape a shark attack” comes to mind.) Harris is 59, meaning the tables have quite literally turned, and all the questions about Biden’s mental acuity will be naturally redirected to Trump. The Trump campaign seems clueless as to how they should go after Harris. So far, Republicans have tried mocking her laugh and clipping her speeches out of context, a strategy which has completely boomeranged. Even Trump is aware he can’t criticize her record as a prosecutor without giving Harris the obvious rebuttal that he was recently convicted by a jury of his peers. Other Republicans have referred to Harris as a “DEI hire,” suggesting she only became the presumptive Democratic nominee because of her race and gender. This racist, sexist dog whistle is so obvious even Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized it. This woman was a prosecutor for two decades before being elected the attorney general of California. She became a United States senator in 2016, gaining notoriety for her tough questioning of judicial nominees and other witnesses in contentious congressional hearings. And for the last three and a half years, she has been vice president of the United States. Contrast that with Trump, who became president after a career spent losing money on real estate and fake firing people on TV.  The “DEI” attacks are also designed to disillusion would-be supporters. As one woman of color told The New York Times this week, “America is just not ready for a woman president — especially not a Black woman president.” But that’s the thing about firsts. They’ve never happened before. Believe me, when I joined the Obama campaign in 2007, plenty of friends and family assumed I would be off the campaign trail within months. Because — and this may sound familiar — the country wasn’t ready to elect a Black president.  In a new op-ed for the Times, Hillary Clinton — herself no stranger to firsts — laid out the challenge for Harris, writing, “While it still pains me that I couldn’t break that highest, hardest glass ceiling, I’m proud that my two presidential campaigns made it seem normal to have a woman at the top of the ticket.” She continued, “Ms. Harris will face unique additional challenges as the first Black and South Asian woman to be at the top of a major party’s ticket…That’s real, but we shouldn’t be afraid. It is a trap to believe that progress is impossible.” Hillary is right. Fear is a trap. And it’s a trap that needs to be called out. There is no time for wallowing. Because even if Mike Johnson and Republican leaders could get their caucus to stop saying the quiet parts out loud and stop taking cheap shots at Harris qualifications, right-wing media pundits aren’t going to get the memo. And neither is the guy at the top of the ticket. As one adviser to Trump told the Bulwark this week, “Trump leads this campaign. So we’re ready for him to call her a DEI hire by Biden.” Republicans are ready, and Democrats should be too. In his Oval Office address Wednesday night, Biden further discussed his vision for the remaining six months of his presidency and promised to “call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy.” While the president has yet to announce any specifics, such a plan may include an enforceable code of ethics, term limits, and perhaps even expanding the number of justices. Additionally, Biden may be considering calling for a constitutional amendment to eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other constitutional officeholders. Of course, those plans face long odds in the Republican-controlled House, and Democrats only hold a slim majority in the Senate. (Although to be clear, roughly two in three Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices.) A constitutional amendment would pose even more challenges, requiring two-thirds support in both chambers and ratification by three fourths of state legislatures.  Biden spent eight years as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and nearly a decade as ranking minority member. It’s safe to say he takes these proposed measures of Supreme Court reform seriously. Clearly, Biden does not intend to have a “lame duck” presidency. NBC News Washington correspondent Yamiche Alcindor has featured prominently in our U.S. Supreme Court this May and June. Now she turns her focus to the Harris campaign. Few journalists are as attuned to the stakes of this election as Alcindor. With her deep understanding of issues like the Supreme Court’s recent presidential immunity ruling and the broader implications of court decisions, she’s uniquely equipped to address the proposed reforms that will be central to the 2024 campaign. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz put it best this week when he posted the following in response to Donald Trump: “Say it with me… Weird.”  I had the pleasure of interviewing Walz this week, and he didn’t hold back."

White women fuel yet another fundraising surge for Harris as virtual meetups spread,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 2:45 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-women-fundraising-democrats-zoom-rcna163871,"In the days since President Joe Biden announced his plans not to seek re-election and Vice President Kamala Harris announced her campaign, a multiracial, multigenerational and gender-diverse coalition of voters have come together for virtual meetups that have fueled a fundraising boom for the Democrats. To me, it has had the feel of an Avengers-like assemblage of all the coalitions Harris will need for a chance to win in November. No, this isn’t the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is Kamala’s Democratic Universe. The fundraising hauls speak to a palpable enthusiasm surrounding the Democratic Party’s de facto presidential nominee. All of the calls have featured a variety of community organizers, celebrities and politicians mobilizing voters to cast ballots for Harris’ ticket this fall. It started Sunday, when Win With Black Women hosted a Zoom call that the group said attracted 44,000 attendees and raised more than $1.5 million. The next day, a group of Black men under a similar banner, Win With Black Men, hosted a call that an organizer said attracted nearly 54,000 attendees and raised $1.3 million. Several more virtual meetups have followed. A Latinas for Harris call on Wednesday reportedly attracted 5,000 attendees and raised $110,000. The same night, a call hosted by South Asian Women for Harris drew 10,000 attendees and raised $285,000, according to an organizer. The latest whopping fundraising haul came Thursday night during a Zoom call intended for white women who support Harris, which an organizer said drew 164,000 participants and raised $2 million. (NBC News hasn’t confirmed these fundraising numbers independently.) And the trend continues. A call was held Thursday for Black gay and queer men supporting Harris, and a similar call was organized for white men. And a national, coalition-wide Women for Harris call has been scheduled for Monday. What a difference a week makes. Democrats had been enduring a storm of defections from Biden, their presumptive presidential nominee. But with Harris, there has been energy surrounding her, interest in her and investment in her — like no other Democrat in recent memory, perhaps other than Barack Obama."

But having good rules is not enough, she said.” * The demise of DeSantis’ so-called Stop WOKE Act: “A judge issued a final order Friday to overturn a Florida law pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that attempted to limit diversity and race-based discussions in private workplaces. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker previously ruled the law is unconstitutional. That decision was upheld by an appeals court in March. Walker’s latest order makes his temporary injunction permanent.” * A societal scourge: “New data on threats and harassment toward public officials in the United States show a 15 percent rise in such incidents during the first half of 2024 compared with 2023. Fully 42 percent of the reported events were death threats, according to the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which has been conducting the rolling study since January 2022. Its authors noted that racially motivated threats were reported at higher rates so far this year than those focused on gender, sexual orientation and identity.” * Kudos to The Washington Post for taking a deep dive (so to speak) into this strange story: “Over the past 10 months, former president Donald Trump has periodically unspooled a nonsensical tale involving a sinking electric boat, a potential electrocution and a ferocious shark attack.” Have a safe weekend."
"JD Vance tries, fails to clean up his ‘childless cat ladies’ mess",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 12:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-tries-fails-clean-childless-cat-ladies-mess-rcna163862,"Sen. JD Vance has been a candidate for national office for 11 days now, and during that time, Americans have learned quite a bit about the Ohio Republican. The unaccomplished senator, however, hasn’t made an especially good first impression. Many officials in his own party believe Donald Trump made the wrong choice when picking a new running mate, and Vance is the first vice presidential hopeful in the modern era to have a negative favorability rating the week after his party’s convention. But amid the avalanche of information voters have received about the 39-year-old lawmaker, three words have come to define his worldview. Three years ago, during his first campaign for elected office, the then-Senate candidate appeared on Fox News and diagnosed what he saw as a crisis plaguing the United States. The country, Vance told a national television audience, was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It’s just a basic fact.” The future senator specifically included Vice President Kamala Harris — who has step-children, but no biological children of her own — in his societal condemnation. He’s quite the charmer. The ugliness of Vance’s rhetoric — rooted in the idea that those without biological children are somehow lesser, unreliable and undeserving of positions of leadership — has not gone unnoticed. On the contrary, it seems to have spread with extraordinary speed this week, drawing sharp rebukes from those who are generally detached from the political discourse. The GOP’s vice presidential nominee has made plenty of similar comments during his brief tenure in the political arena, but as CNN’s Andy Kaczynski noted this week, the “childless cat ladies” comment was “permeating the culture,” while simultaneously “defining Vance to a lot of people.” As part of an apparent attempt to put things right, the Ohioan sat down with SiriusXM's Megyn Kelly today and addressed the controversy, arguing: I have a hunch this won’t make matters better. For one thing, for Vance to say he has “nothing against cats” suggests he’s under the impression that the controversy is feline-related. It’s not. The underlying question is about whether he has something against women, not something against cats. For another, his 2021 comments were many things, but they weren’t “sarcastic.” On the contrary, he appears to have doubled down on the comments that sparked the controversy in the first place. Finally, if Vance has credible evidence of liberals being “anti-child,” he’s kept it well hidden. I can appreciate why the vice presidential hopeful is trying to clean up his mess, but Vance has had plenty of time to work out a defense, and if “nothing against cats” is the best he can come up with, the Republican’s problem is likely to linger for a while."
Justice Elena Kagan says what's plain to see on ethics code enforcement,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 11:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/elena-kagan-supreme-court-ethics-code-rcna163830,"Facing criticism amid last year's scandals, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct in November. From the start, one glaring problem with that code was its lack of an enforcement mechanism. Justice Elena Kagan acknowledged that shortcoming Thursday at a legal conference in California. The Barack Obama appointee noted that rules usually have enforcement mechanisms — and this one doesn’t. She said that it’s hard to figure out who should do the enforcing and how, but that there should be a mechanism. She proposed that the justices shouldn’t do it amongst themselves but that lower federal court judges would probably be the best choice. How that arrangement would work and what penalties would be available are still open questions. And Kagan is just one voice among nine justices, at least some of whom likely disagree, including, perhaps, the justices at the center of recent controversies: Republican appointees Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. But just like it’s important for President Joe Biden to press court reforms even if they won’t come soon, it’s important for Kagan to inform the public of her preference for accountability, even if her ideas don’t catch on with all the other justices. One of the reforms that Biden reportedly supports is an enforceable code — something that likely wouldn’t pass a Republican-controlled House and that the Republican-majority court might strike down as unconstitutional, anyway. The court’s composition raises a larger issue in need of reform — whether by term limits, expanding the number of justices or both — something that was also evident from Kagan’s public appearance Thursday. She highlighted the importance of respecting precedent, in the wake of yet another term in which the majority overturned a big one, this time Chevron deference. That decision led to Kagan's dissent in which she wrote that “a longstanding precedent at the crux of administrative governance thus falls victim to a bald assertion of judicial authority. The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.”  Even for something simple, like ethics rules with consequences for violating them, it’s clear that the court will cling to power as long as it can, both in its rulings and operations.

Trump wants to criminalize flag-burning. Here’s why that’s un-American.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 11:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-flag-burning-ban-palestine-protesters-rcna163736,"Images of protesters burning American flags are always divisive. But the scenes emerging from demonstrations in Washington during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress were especially so, given some protesters’ open support of Hamas. Equally predictable? The immediate calls to ban and punish flag burning that arose as criticism of the protests snowballed.  It is a question Americans continue to spar over, even though it is one the Supreme Court settled 35 years ago in Texas v. Johnson. In that case, the court affirmed that the government cannot punish offensive expression in service of protecting national symbols. Put simply, our anthem and our flag are not weighted more heavily than our rights.  But supporters of a ban got a boost from former President Donald Trump this week when, appearing on “Fox & Friends,” he advocated for congressional action and “a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American flag.” “Now, people will say, ‘Oh, it’s unconstitutional,’” the Republican presidential nominee added. “Those are stupid people that say that.”  Vice President Kamala Harris — the likely Democratic nominee — released a statement, as well. Unlike Trump, she did not call for a ban on flag burning, instead stating that the flag should “never be desecrated.” Let’s get a few things out of the way: Yes, you have the right to burn the American flag, but with some caveats.  You do not, of course, have the right to steal and vandalize a flag you do not own, and you may not be able to burn a flag in protest in any and all public spaces because of safety regulations. Police reportedly made arrests connected to protesters’ alleged theft and destruction of flags in the park outside Union Station, as well as other acts of vandalism. The conversations spurred by Trump and other advocates of a flag burning ban, however, extend far beyond criminal acts and well into purely expressive conduct. At its core, what’s at stake here is the right of people across the political spectrum to express deeply unpopular political views and be free of retaliation from the government they are criticizing.  Flag burners are rarely sympathetic free speech test cases for many Americans, but distaste for the incendiary way they express their opposition to the government should not lull us into accepting censorship rules that would be more at home in China or Russia than in a free country. Similar issues were recently raised in a court thousands of miles away that should illustrate to Americans the peril of allowing the government to erode the right to criticize or mock national symbols. In Hong Kong, the center of an ongoing crackdown on dissent, a man was found guilty last week of insulting China’s anthem after covering his ears while it played at a volleyball game.  That conviction should serve as a warning bell for Americans, not a playbook to follow.  Flag burning may be a deeply unpopular form of political expression, but it is nevertheless protected. That’s actually a sign of the wisdom of our First Amendment, not its stupidity. It suggests a confidence that critics of the U.S. and its symbols can be moved to change their minds through persuasion, a hallmark of a free and healthy society, rather than force.  Confining people to jail cells for burning the flag is far more likely to validate that they were right to oppose and mistrust the U.S. than to prove to them the sanctity of its symbols. “The way to preserve the flag’s special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters,” Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority of the Court in Texas v. Johnson. “It is to persuade them that they are wrong.”  His words are as true today as they were decades ago. Our speech rights may not be as tangible as a flag, but they are in far greater need of protection than our symbols. New flags can and will be sewn and raised, but a desecrated First Amendment would be much more difficult to repair."

According to a new court filing from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, it has “no bearing on this prosecution.” That may turn out to be so. But let’s consider how the Roberts Court’s ruling, which came after the New York trial, could work mischief on the already secured guilty verdicts in the so-called hush money case. Recall that the high court’s Republican-appointed majority laid out a new, vague test for distinguishing between official acts that are (or can be) immune from prosecution, as opposed to unofficial acts that can be charged. That’s not the issue in this New York state case, where Trump wasn’t charged with official conduct. Rather, the issue stems from a strange part of the immunity ruling that curbs the government’s use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of private conduct. That raises the question of whether any such official evidence was improperly used to secure the Manhattan verdict — and what to do about it if so. First, what supposed official evidence from the trial are we talking about here? Prosecutors noted that Trump claimed six types: Prosecutors contend that the evidence didn’t run afoul of the immunity ruling and that “even if some of this evidence were improperly admitted, any error was harmless in light of other overwhelming evidence” of Trump’s guilt and shouldn’t lead to overturning the guilty verdict. Legal errors at criminal trials don’t automatically lead to reversal when there’s otherwise overwhelming evidence of guilt, and prosecutors say that’s the case here (while maintaining that there was no legal problem to begin with). Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyers argue that they should prevail in any harmless-error analysis but that such analysis can’t even apply here because, they say, presidential immunity errors are never harmless. In a normal case, the prosecution would be on solid footing. And it may yet prevail in defending the Trump verdict despite the immunity ruling. But we’re in a new world after that decision, one in which the Supreme Court majority’s guiding light can seemingly be boiled down to suspicion of prosecutions against former presidents — at least this former president. In their motion, which was made public Thursday, prosecutors wrote that none of the evidence that Trump objects to “said anything whatsoever about defendant’s presidential policies or political positions.” They further noted that the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, “not only allowed extensive individualized questioning during voir dire to ensure that the jurors were not politically biased, but also carefully instructed the jury not to let their personal or political opinions of defendant affect their consideration of the evidence.” That’s true. But in the immunity ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts was dismissive of the safeguards that are apparently sufficient to protect any other criminal defendant, writing that tools like evidentiary rulings and jury instructions “are unlikely to protect adequately the President’s constitutional prerogatives.” Again, perhaps the ruling has “no bearing” on this case, which has already gone to trial and wasn’t premised on Trump’s official conduct. It’s laughable to contemplate that the president’s constitutional prerogatives are at stake in the context of covering up a personal hush money scheme. But if it’s decided in retrospect that any official-type evidence improperly seeped into Trump’s trial, then prosecutors may be forced to try him all over again. Merchan is expected to rule Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects the defendant’s immunity motion. The judge already had a heavy task in weighing how to sentence the Republican presidential nominee. Now the immunity ruling has added another vague hurdle to get to that point.

What’s next for Biden? with Jamelle Bouie: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/talking-s-biden-jamelle-bouie-podcast-transcript-rcna163845,"The Democratic Party coalition is a complicated one to say the least. A growing number of Democrats have called on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election in recent weeks. Those encouraging him to step aside have cited concerns about his fitness for office and ability to win reelection. Jamelle Bouie is a New York Times opinion columnist and is a co-host of the Unclear and Present Danger podcast. He joins WITHpod to discuss the lack of mechanisms to force an incumbent president to withdraw from the race, the mostly unprecedented set of circumstances surrounding all of this, the case for and against Vice President Kamala Harris as a replacement Democratic nominee. Note that this conversation was recorded on Friday, July 12th before the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign event in Pennsylvania and before President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection. Jamelle Bouie: The thing I keep coming to is that maybe really it’s just as simple as people want someone younger on the ballot. That’s it. And if you put someone younger on the ballot, they’ll be like, I want to vote for that person because they seem younger. And if that is the situation we’re in, then like, I kind of think the case for just Biden stepping down is a pretty strong one. And to my mind, it’s easy to imagine the thing Joe Biden could say, right? Sort of like, the reason I got back into politics in a real way was just to keep Donald Trump away from power. And I did it four years. I’m not sure I can do it for another four years. I think my vice president can. Chris Hayes: Hello, and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. So, I am speaking to you on Monday, July 15th, mid-afternoon, which is one day before this episode should hit your podcast feeds. And the reason I’m starting with that time marker is because we tried to do something last week that we basically never do, which was a sort of on the news cycle WITHpod. You know, WITHpod tends to be a podcast that’s sort of a step removed from the news cycle intentionally. Obviously, I have a nightly TV show on MSNBC at 8:00 p.m., where we’re relentlessly on the news cycle, but WITHpod allows a step back and we could do topics that are esoteric or even topics that are sort of on what’s in the news, like the campaign, but with a sort of step removed to look and say the policy records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden in immigration. Anyway, long way of saying, last week, I was like, let’s just do something about this conversation happening about the Democratic Party and who its nominee should be and whether that should be Joe Biden, who, of course, won the primary going away, or he should step down and endorse Kamala Harris or someone else at an open convention. This was a conversation that had sort of enveloped and consumed the large coalition of the Democratic Party in the wake of the debate performance. And so on Friday, Jamelle Bouie, who’s one of my favorite columnists, writers, thinkers, one of the wisest people, I think, writing and thinking about politics, one of the most deeply read, got together for a conversation on that topic and more or less like, well, who should be the nominee, more about the sort of nature of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party coalition and why it was in the position it found itself in. So that was on Friday, July 12th. Of course, one day later, on Saturday, July 13th, during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, an assassin attempted to kill former President Trump about six minutes into his remarks there. The former president was, it appears, grazed by a bullet that hasn’t been hard confirmed yet, seen bleeding from his ear. Secret Service shot the shooter, the 20-year-old, and several other people were injured. One man was killed, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Compatore. There were several others who were injured. We’re hoping to get status checks on them. Obviously, a completely and utterly horrifying event sent, I think, everyone I know into a kind of spinning black circle just because it’s just about the worst thing that can happen in politics. It’s the thing that you don’t want at all. It’s a refutation of the sort of shared civic enterprise of democracy, the nonviolent resolution of social conflict through the processes we have. It’s a repudiation of that. It’s also toxic and morally repugnant and also just upsetting. So that happened on Saturday. I’m speaking to you now on Monday, July 15th, and we have two things that have happened today. J.D. Vance, a senator from Ohio who’s been senator less than two years, was just named as the vice presidential nominee on the Republican ticket by Donald Trump on the first day of the RNC. Aileen Cannon, who’s the federal judge appointed by Donald Trump in a lame duck session in 2020 while he was trying to overturn the results of the November election, she has dismissed the case against Donald Trump in her court on the secret documents case, saying that Jack Smith’s appointment does not fit with the appointments clause and he was sort of improperly appointed and therefore the case has to be dismissed. This is a totally shocking ruling, I think, largely out of completely out of line with precedent and largely lawless. But we’ll see what happens, whether it gets overturned or not. All this to say the last three days have been a wildly intense news cycle. And so I say all that because, first of all, I think the conversation Jamelle and I had is still relevant because it’s really descriptively about the nature of the Democratic Party and why it’s a complicated coalition, what it means to talk about the Democratic Party, who is the they when you say they and the Democratic Party. And also, I don’t necessarily think this conversation is completely died down. I think it’s died down considerably since Friday. But there’s new polling out today by “The New York Times” that shows Vice President Harris polling ahead of President Biden in Virginia and Pennsylvania by a few points. But there and we’ve seen polling look like that. There’s reporting today that Nancy Pelosi continues to make calls behind the scenes, trying to figure out a way to marshal enough people to try to get President Biden to announce that he’s stepping down. So all of this relevant. Obviously, I want to just acknowledge all the things that have happened since we recorded this conversation. But I do think it’s a good conversation. I learned a lot from it. And so it was really great to have an opportunity to have Jamelle Bouie on the program. (MUSIC PLAYING) Chris Hayes: Jamelle, welcome to the program. Jamelle Bouie: Thank you for having me. Chris Hayes: Okay, to start out, you had a conversation with Ezra like a week ago, but that was before the George Stephanopoulos interview and the president’s press conference, which happened last night. And I’m talking to you the day after that press conference. By the time our listeners are hearing this, the interview with the president and NBC’s Lester Holt has aired. Have the developments of the past week changed how you think about this at all? Jamelle Bouie: So, my initial thought about all of this was that I’m not sure that any of this pressure is going to make a huge difference because the decision is ultimately up to Biden. And there’s just not very many mechanisms to force an incumbent president to not run for reelection. And to the extent that that could happen, I always thought that he’d have to really kind of, you know, repeat the performance of the debate again and again and again in these various forums. And there’d also have to be definitive evidence that some other candidate would be more viable in the general election. And I guess fortunately for Joe Biden, unfortunately for those who want to remove Joe Biden, his subsequent performances have not been so bad as to, you know, push people to demand him to get off the ticket even more than they already have. And the polling has been kind of like inconclusive. Like it’s not been good for Biden, but it’s not like a slam dunk for anyone else either. So I think I still am where I’ve always been, which is that like, it’s just unclear what could happen and it’s unclear whether or not this is like dispositive for the election. Chris Hayes: Yeah. I mean, I agree with basically all that. I think the polling, as I read it, got really bad about a week out and then has sort of now plateaued a little bit again. But at a level where Joe Biden was behind, I think going into the debate, I think that his own people recognize that and part of the gamble of having this early debate in June was to kind of reset the structural forces underneath the election to get people to pay attention, to understand that Donald Trump was running again. I want to stay with something that you said that I think is a very important part of this that is both central to what’s happening and also maddening, which is what is the Democratic Party? Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And I think there is some sense, and you see this even in pretty like informed political reporters about like some they, there’s a they there. Jamelle Bouie: Right.  Chris Hayes: And at some level there is. Jamie Harrison, who I talked to last night, is the chairperson of the National Democratic Committee. But functionally, the way politics works in my lifetime is when a party holds the White House, the president is the head of the party. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: You know, it’s like that’s the way it works. And so part of the issue here is the fact that that is the reality, just as an almost institutional, organizational and political level that you have to figure out. You basically have to bootstrap some new set of processes, forms of coordination outside of the institutional nature of the party precisely because that party is kind of de facto run by the president. Jamelle Bouie: I think that’s exactly right. This is something that I have found really interesting to observe, which is, as you say, that the sense that there must be some day (ph), that there is an institutional Democratic Party that looks something like it did maybe in like 1950, right? There are the party bosses and high level, you know, strategist and maybe some elected officials who they get together and they decide what the Democratic Party does.  And if they decide the Democratic Party doesn’t want Joe Biden as a nominee, then all you have to do is pressure those people in some way. And they can tell Joe Biden to like, you know, take a hike, retire early, enjoy the rest of your life. But that’s just not how American political parties are and have not been for quite some time. And they kind of the fact of the matter is that in the modern era of American political parties, which generally refers to the party system after the McGovern Frazier reforms of 1970, 1972 -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- which basically got rid of the old conventions, got rid of kind of a lot of the backroom dealing and democratized the party system a bit more, made it more open to outside actors. But like one consequence of that, right, is that first, it’s no longer party elders or bosses or machines or anyone determining who the candidates going to be. You know, in the 1924 Democratic National Convention, it was like literal bosses from like, you know, representing various cities across the country getting together in like a convention hall and saying, you know, I can deliver these votes, you can deliver those votes. My guy, you know, does well with these. That’s how it went. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: But now, right, it’s very candidate centered. The candidate decides they’re going to run. The candidate builds up a campaign and they don’t appeal to institutional actors. I mean, they do to an extent they have to get endorsements and such, but they appeal as much to a voting public and a voting public that ultimately gives legitimacy to whoever is going to be the nominee. And that critical element of like the legitimacy obtained by winning primaries is what makes it so difficult to dislodge an incumbent president from a re-election campaign because they got the prize as it was defined, right? They had the legitimacy that no one else does. And so, as you said, in order to even begin to think of a situation in which you do get rid of an incumbent president running for re-election, you kind of have to create an entirely new structure for how parties make these sorts of decisions.   Chris Hayes: Well, certainly when you’re outside the primary system, like when you’re in the primary system, it’s like, you know, there are models there, all of which have been unsuccessful. So in 1980, Ted Kennedy challenged incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter unsuccessfully. In 1992, Pat Buchanan challenged the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, again, unsuccessfully. Scored some victories, definitely like wounded him. And in ‘68, of course, famously, LBJ was challenged and then he announced he would not run after New Hampshire. But first of all, none of those were successful. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And second of all, these were in the primary process. What you’re talking about doing now is just at an organizational, institutional level, utterly unprecedented in the modern age and hasn’t really been done in a real way since like 1924, and even that was more orderly because it wasn’t a person four months before saying, I’m not going to be the nominee. Jamelle Bouie: Right, exactly. I mean, it’s actually hard to think of a precedent. I mean, again, in the modern era, there is none. And even in the, you know, throughout the 20th century, you’d have to really go back to like the 19th century when it was a little more common, right, for incumbent presidents to be challenged for the nomination at the convention. That is a thing that used to happen. But again, the conventions, there was no presumption of like a nominee needed democratic legitimacy of any kind. It really was the party decides the people representing the party will decide if the nominee is going to be. And in our moment, you know, the convention isn’t set up to do that. The people who attend the conventions, like the delegates, they don’t represent constituencies in that way like it’s -- Chris Hayes: Right. They’re not going there with the like either institutional knowledge and practice of like, okay, I run this machine in Columbus, Ohio. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And like I’m really connected to like the Irish dock workers, you know, in the New York Harbor. That’s not what we’re dealing with when we’re talking about the delegates. I mean, the delegates are connected politicians and political entities and, you know, donors, volunteers, like they are sort of the fabric of the party, but it’s just a very different thing.   You said the party decides, which I think it’s worth laying around a little political science here. That’s the title of a fairly famous book that came out -- Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: -- after the 2008 primary by four different political scientists, which basically makes the argument that the broad contrary to the argument was, even though these reforms happened in the ‘70s to change it from this sort of party centric system to the ostensibly democratic institution of primaries, it was still the case the party retained a kind of veto and these informal mechanisms through donors and through coordination to will who the party wanted to be the nominee. And one of the things I think we’ve seen is the breakdown of that. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: I mean, 2016 is a big test of the party decides thesis for the Republicans and for the Democrats to a certain extent. I mean, you know, it is true in 2020 would look like Bernie Sanders was going to be the nominee. There was a coordinated action by high level Democrats to stop him from being the nominee.   So when you don’t have the incumbent presidency, I think, it’s a little easier to coordinate. And they definitely did coordinate in an effective way. But ultimately, they coordinate effective way. And then that vote was ratified by the voters, you know, in Super Tuesday in the states afterwards. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. Chris Hayes: Right. So first, you’re just dealing at an institutional level with like, how would this even work? The muscles aren’t there. The process is under there. But then the other sort of political science thing I keep thinking about is this idea of sort of strong polarization, weak parties as a defining attribute of our current politics. There’s a book called “The Hollow Parties” by Danny Schultzman and Sam Rosenfeld who sort of writes about this. And I remember back in 2016, I would go around when everyone was like Trump can’t win and I would be at a party or I’d be at a bar or something, people like, can Trump win? I say, yeah, of course, he can win. And what I would say to them is, if you, the person I’m talking to, were the nominee for a major party, you’d be sitting at 42, 43 percent of the vote. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chris Hayes: You like you’d have maybe not exactly a coin flip, but like you’d have a shot like no one’s winning 49 states. We don’t have the structural conditions for that. So you just take someone, anyone off the street, my interlocutor, person at a bar, you put them on the ticket. They’re hovering at 40, 41, 42. It’s going to be a battle over those last four or five points, particularly in the swing states. And you might get your clock cleaned in a narrow sense, like the 2008 election, but the polarization is so strong. So when you combine that with weak parties, I feel like we really saw that in 2016 with Trump and we’re seeing a different version. It’s not symmetrical with the Democrats right now of strong polarization, weak parties. Jamelle Bouie: Right. I mean, the Democratic Party, in this political science, it’s a weak party. And I think what we’re witnessing now is the extent to which the weakness of the institutional party, the weakness of these informal mechanisms to try to coerce an incumbent off the ballot and the extent to which the party does emanate from whoever can claim leadership at the top. In this case, it’s Biden. For the Republicans, it’s Trump, right? Kind of the other side of this, I mean, I would say very much like a similar situation is although there was a primary to try to choose a new Republican nominee. From the jump, it was clear that this wasn’t going to be particularly competitive, that by virtue of Trump refusing to let go of his claim to leadership over the Republican Party, which itself was unusual, usually a defeated incumbent president. Chris Hayes: Yeah, man. They’re like, get lost. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, that’s a get out of here. You’re done. Jimmy Carter went to go, you know -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- you know, go do his thing. George H.W. Bush went to go do his thing. It doesn’t happen. Even right like a two term president, once they’re out, they’re out. You choose a new leader. So Trump deciding not to leave to hold on to his claim to power, which is very unusual, it was path dependency from there. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: That more or less said that he was going to be the nominee, that he still was a leader of the party. And in the absence of any kind of strong institution that can, you know, push that kind of personalist figure away, you’re left with, you know, they are at the top. And likewise, Biden, he’s the president. He won that primary four years ago. And in the absence of any kind of institutional configuration that can push him aside, he is going to be the nominee unless he decides not to be. Chris Hayes: Yeah. I mean, the question is, can that choice be forced? And you are seeing like a kind of ad hoc attempt to do that, right. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: Today, you know, you’ve got George Clooney’s op ed. You’ve got Nancy Pelosi on “Morning Joe” saying very pointedly he has to decide. You have a stream of members of Congress coming out and saying they think that he should step aside. You’ve got $90 million in super PAC donations being held. I mean, all these different parts of the sort of higher echelons of the party are attempting right now to do this.   Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: There’s really a question of, you know, whether they can. I think it’s a very volatile situation. I don’t know what’s going to happen, honestly. Jamelle Bouie: No, I think it’s very hard to say. You know, it’s interesting, you know, donors, elected officials, and I think this underscores the point we’ve been making that the response, I mean, this is Biden’s response, right. That’s sort of like, well, they didn’t elect me, right? Chris Hayes: Right. Jamelle Bouie: The voters elected me. And that gets to this this reality that the currency of the realm is where is like a democratic legitimacy. And that’s why I think it’s also why, as people begin to actually think seriously about what this would look like, because one of the other parts of this is that, you know, there’s been this push to get Biden to resign. But then there’s also, I think, been a lot of like fantasizing about how you would choose new nominee. Chris Hayes: Yeah, like a parlor game. Like I’m feeling Whitmer-Shapiro. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: No, no. I’m like in Newsom, you know, whatever. It’s like, yeah. Jamelle Bouie: But the reality is that like there’s only one other person who has any legitimate claim to that kind of democratic legitimacy. Chris Hayes: Yeah.  Jamelle Bouie: And it’s Kamala Harris -- Chris Hayes: Vice President of the United States, yeah. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: Yeah. So here’s a metaphor I’ve been using and we haven’t even gotten to like whether he should or not, which I do want to sort of engage in that normative question. But I actually think some of the descriptive features are important here because the conversation is so taken up with this normative question about like what to do. But like understanding actually the dynamics of play to me are pretty interesting. And the way I’ve been describing this is people’s like and I don’t know if you’re a baseball fan, but, you know, you name your starter for the seventh game of the World Series. He pitches a good game and he’s at 120 pitches, which if you don’t pay attention, baseball is like very high, like pitchers at a certain point their arm gives out. There’s only so many pitches the body can throw because it puts an incredible strain on an arm. Jamelle Bouie: I’ve seen it “For the Love of the Game.” Chris Hayes: Yeah, great. So at 120 pitches and there’s four outs to go and he’s just loaded the bases, so it’s not looking good. And what happens in that moment in a baseball game is the manager comes and gets the starter and takes him out and replaces him with a new pitcher. Now, when that happens, the starter hates it always. In fact, you could watch videos on YouTube of them cursing out the manager into their glove or like shaking their head or be like, don’t come and get me. And they’re not doing that because they’re like pigheaded idiots necessarily. They’re doing it because the nature of the psychology that gets someone to the position in which they’re starting a World Series game seven is a psychology that says I can get the last four outs. I can do it. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: I can will myself through. That it is almost definitionally the case to have like the level of confidence and steel you have to get yourself in that position. And so every time the manager comes out in that situation, the guy on the mound is pissed. But there’s a manager to make the call. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And what is the situation here is there is no manager. So it’s like he’s on the mound. People are watching him throw these pitches and being like he is not throwing as hard as he was before. And the other aspect of this sort of extended analogy is that when the manager makes a call, sometimes a relief pitcher comes in and gives up a homer and everyone calls in the sports radio the next day and says, why’d you pull him? Which is totally possible here. Like the same sense of like an uncertain future outcome, the same sense in which when you pull the starter, you’re often pulling them for someone who is an inferior pitcher almost by definition because the starters in there because they’re the better pitcher. They’re not in the pen. Like all of those features are present here to me in this conversation, but there’s no manager to come make the call, which is why the whole thing is so angst ridden.  Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And it’s why it’s so angst ridden. It’s why the pressure from, you know, from a variety of sources, from politicians, from the media seems to be almost like repetitive at this point. Sort of like everyone’s kind of saying the same thing again and again out of, I think, a belief that if we just say it enough, we can kind of become the manager. We can become the captain here, but that’s just not -- Chris Hayes: No, he’s the manager. He has to take himself out of the game.   Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: You have to convince him to take himself out of the game. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And this is a point I made before I wrote last year, maybe when there was lots of dread over a Trump-Biden rematch. And I said, you know, listen, there are there basically structural reasons why Trump’s to be the nominee again. But there are psychological reasons why Biden’s going to run again and be the nominee. And that’s like to your point, Chris. The kind of human being who doesn’t just like become president, but devotes their entire adult life to trying to be president, it’s not the kind of person who’s going to like hang it up, like he’s not. Chris Hayes: You know what, you’re right.  You’re right. No, I mean, that’s true. So let’s talk a little bit about, I think it’s useful in this conversation to separate out two things, which is a question about who is best positioned to defeat Trump, which I think three or four months ago, I thought it was Biden. And now, I don’t necessarily think that, like particularly the binary choice of Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, which I agree with you is the most likely path forward, although, again, we’re in sort of uncertain and volatile times. So the question of who is best to make this sort of to run the homestretch of this campaign in this incredibly high stakes election. And then the substantive question of like, should this man, Joe Biden, the man that you’ve seen and the man who clearly has aged, you know, I think considerably in the last four years. Again, it’s the most stressful job in the world and he came in at 77. The job ages everyone who enters into it. We’ve all seen the pictures of Barack Obama before and after, Abraham Lincoln before and after, Bill Clinton before and after, like we know this. It’s almost a cliche. So the substantive question, independent of who’s best to take the fight to Trump and to win over persuadable voters so as to forestall a Donald Trump second term is like, should this guy be president when he’s 85? Like, should the man that you saw last night, for instance, where I thought he did fairly well, should that man have the world’s most stressful job at the age of 85? And I got to say that when I put it in those terms, like the answer is just clear as day. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Yeah. No, you’re right. Chris Hayes: And when you ask people, there was an ABC/Washington Post poll. Do you think he’s too old to serve out a second term? Eighty five percent of people say yes. And I can’t tell those people like there are things that poll where I’m like, well, the majority is just wrong. There’s all sorts of things where I disagree with the majority people’s perception of the economy I’ve been banging on about. On that question, it’s like, I can’t, no, yes, correct, like I do not think not for anything, any character flaw, not for any reason other than the demands of the job and the reality of this mortal coil, that that man should be the president when he’s 85. Jamelle Bouie: I think that’s right. Yes. So, I myself go back and forth on are there more viable people to actually win an election than Joe Biden? I go back and forth on this, but that was my takeaway from the debate, just like irrespective of sort of like electoral considerations. I don’t think I would feel comfortable with like 84-year-old Joe Biden as president of the United States when there could be crises. And the thing about the job, right, is that it fundamentally is a crisis management job. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: That’s how we typically judge presidents. We’re not really judging one former president on the basis of its ability to handle a crisis. But generally speaking, we judge presidents based on their ability to handle crises because that’s what the job is, right? In John Dickerson’s great book, “The Hardest Job in the World,” about just the presidency, he shares Dwight Eisenhower’s kind of like matrix for decision making. And basically there’s like four boxes. One is like urgent and important, like a crisis. The other is important, but not urgent. The other is not important, not urgent. The other is urgent and not important. And most of the job of being president is kind of deciding what goes in what box. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: That’s the job. And I don’t know if I think an 84-year-old, any 84-year-old, not even Joe Biden, any 84-year-old -- Chris Hayes: Correct. Yes. Yeah. I just want to interject when you said like the other guy is going to be 82 or 83 in the fourth -- Jamelle Bouie: Exactly. Exactly. Chris Hayes: And obviously I don’t think that guy should be within a thousand feet of the White House from the time he was 30 on. But also just on the question of age, it’s 100 percent as relevant with the other choice, just to be clear on this. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. Chris Hayes: Like I thought he did a catastrophic job managing a crisis in 2020. The thought of, you know, China invading Taiwan with Donald Trump sitting in the White House at age 82 is like just absolutely horrifying to me. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. I don’t think any 84-year-old would be appropriate in that kind of job, both because of the physical demands and the mental demands, but also because I do think that the job requires a certain amount of nimbleness and flexibility. And at that age, those are also qualities that are like diminishing. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: Like it’s hard to intellectually budge yourself off of an approach you’ve decided on that’s like served you well for decades when a situation might demand it. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One of the things that I’ve been so pleasantly surprised by on the first three years, particularly of Joe Biden’s administration, was his flexibility, was his supplements, was the fact that he seemed open and reacting in real time. Like, I really think he did an amazing job in many ways, particularly on domestic legislative accomplishments and domestic economic management, where I think he was able to kind of reassess his priors and he was able to like, and that was to me one of the great sort of pleasant surprises of the Biden presidency so far. But I also agree with you that that ability diminishes. The other thing I keep thinking about is that people say, well, right, but there’s a vice president for a reason if something happens, and that’s true. But there’s also a huge gray area between the president dying and the president declining.  Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And the closest we’ve come, I think, to managing that was the end of Reagan, which, again, wasn’t great. Like once you read all the accounts of it afterwards. But given how difficult this is now and how anguishing, and again, people say, well, that can happen to anyone.  You can have a stroke at 65. Totally true. But there’s an actuarial logic here that I think we’re all up against.  And the last thing I’ll say is, I think ultimately there’s a connection between the substance and the politics, which is this. If I understand why people are like, I don’t think that guy should be president at 85, then I understand why it’s a little bit of an uphill battle to win over persuadable voters -- Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- when most of them think that because you can say, well, look, you still got the coalition, all this stuff, but you’re still pushing that rock up the hill. It doesn’t mean he can’t win, but like when I go through this a million times, I just sort of keep coming back to that home base, which is like, I don’t think the objections are unreasonable. I do think they’re unreasonable in the sense that the choice is stark and obviously I would personally prefer to have Donald Trump not be president than Joe Biden at any age, basically. But you’re talking about some set of people that don’t feel that way. Otherwise, they’d be decided. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. And really, I mean, there’s some recent polling from “The Washington Post,” and it showed Biden, you know, tied with Trump, 46, 46. And then it showed Harris like 49, 47 with Trump. And the thing I keep coming to is that maybe really it’s just as simple as people want someone younger on the ballot. That’s it. And if you put someone younger on the ballot, they’ll be like, I want to vote for that person because they seem younger. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: And if that is the situation we’re in, then like, I kind of think the case for just Biden stepping down is a pretty strong one. And to my mind, you know, it’s easy to imagine the thing Joe Biden could say, right? Sort of like -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- you know, my priority, the reason I got back into politics in a real way was just to keep Donald Trump away from power. And I did it four years. I’m not sure I can do it for another four years. I think my vice president can. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: I care about American democracy so much -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- that I’m going to set aside my personal ambition. I’m going to be a Cincinnatus and move on. Chris Hayes: Yeah, which brings us to the next part of this conversation, which I think is actually an important one, which is there’s a bunch of different ways that race is shot through this whole thing on a few different levels. So one of them is Kamala Harris is a black woman. I think polling suggests that people perceive her as further to the left than she is substantively. And I think that has to do with the way that race and gender are coded. That might be a political liability in terms of winning over people who, by definition, are not particularly, you know, ideologically orthodox. Also, you know, she’s a black woman. There’s going to be racism and sexism directed at her. There already has been. So that’s part of the conversation to me and what those sort of liabilities are. And there’s always something sort of like dicey and gross about the slide between some descriptive anticipation of a penalty a candidate will play for being a black woman and then being like, oh, we shouldn’t go with the black woman, which is always like a really dangerous part of this conversation. So that’s one part of it. The other part of it, which I want to do first before we get to Kamala Harris and those dynamics, is just the dynamics of race within the Democratic coalition now. And one of the things I think that has been fairly obvious is an attempt, given the fact that James Clyburn’s endorsement in 2020 in South Carolina and Joe Biden’s convincing win in South Carolina in a primary electorate dominated by black voters, was the kind of turning point in his 2020 campaign, a sort of attempt to shore up what is the kind of base of the Democratic Party, which is black voters. And you’ve seen this in a few things they’ve done. One, the two of the interviews he gave after the debate were to black radio stations. Subsequently, it was revealed that they had sent them questions in advance, which they had selected. When that got out, both hosts were fired by their stations and also subsequently got out that they had called back to get them to edit parts out of the interview, including at one point, I think Biden saying, I have more blacks in my administration than anyone else, which is like it’s just like, well, that’s of course the way he talks.   I mean, again, it’s like if you’re a staffer for Biden and you’re cringing like I don’t know what to tell you, man, like that is that’s the way an 81-year-old white guy talks like -- Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, yeah. Chris Hayes: I too find it like not great, not at all the language I would use, but also like that kind of is what it is at this point, can’t protect him from that. But I did find something. I’m curious what you think about this, because I’m speaking about this as a white guy watching this. I actually found something kind of offensive and condescending about that whole episode of like going to black radio and then like giving them the questions and like it gave me a really bad feeling. Of all the things that have happened in the debate, that’s the thing that I’ve been most like, I don’t like that at all. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, it’s just sort of like, oh, of course you’re going to give me an easy time.  Chris Hayes: Right. Exactly. Jamelle Bouie: It’s a version of taking those people -- Chris Hayes: For granted. Jamelle Bouie: -- for granted. Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- which I kind of think is an undercurrent of like so much fizz (ph) -- Chris Hayes: Yeah, I know. Jamelle Bouie: -- across the board. Chris Hayes: Say more. Jamelle Bouie: So it’s a clear undercurrent of like the Biden team’s immediate response. I’m going to go black radio and they’ll treat us well. And it’s like that’s kind of offensive to like the professional integrity of these people, of the radio host of these stations. But also in the conversations about, oh, if you could replace Biden, who would it be?   I mean, there have been some voices were like, yeah, Harris should be considered, but there have been quite a few that sort of kind of on their face no Harris, kind of dismissing Harris, immediately jumping to, you know, can we find the blandest seeming Midwestern whites to lead the ticket and everyone else will fall in line? And it’s like, will they, though? Like -- Chris Hayes: Yeah.  Jamelle Bouie: -- you know, because again, there’s this Democratic legitimacy question, as you know, like Biden became the nominee on the support of black voters. So it really seems like you want to listen to what they think to an extent before you begin, like, you know, wish casting who you think ought to be the nominee. And just the extent to which it seems on both ends, the assumption is, well, black voters will just like fall in line. It’s not great. And it’s the kind of assumption that may play into sort of, you know, among younger black voters, it’s like it’s a real discontent with the Democratic Party -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Showing up in polling. Jamelle Bouie: Right. It’s showing up in polling. It may not necessarily translate to support for Republicans, but it will translate to like certainly less solid support for Democrats and like just voters being up for grabs in the way that they weren’t before. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And this is one of those places, again, where like it’s so hard to predict because it would be so unprecedented. Like let’s say Joe Biden were to announce and he gave a Cincinnati speech and I think he would endorse Kamala Harris, you know, but then the actual bylaws of the DNC are that they’re not really transferable delegates as far as I understand them. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And so she would have to win, win those delegates over in which maybe there’s just sort of a rush of acclimation, but maybe there’s not. Maybe other people proclaim and then you have like a genuinely open convention. And I mean, again, this is all out past the frontier of what we’ve dealt with. And in terms of what the fallout from that would be, I think also hard to predict, though your point, I think, is important one. But to me, the point you made before about democratic legitimacy is actually pretty important. Like she is the Vice President of the United States. She was chosen by the guy that won the primary the last time. She has served. She was on the ticket this time that, again, did win a primary. You can say, well, it wasn’t a real primary, which, yeah, it wasn’t, but that is the process we have, you know. I mean, like -- Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And if this were January, we’re talking about an open primary, totally different situation. Chris Hayes: Oh, totally, yeah. I mean -- Jamelle Bouie: Of course, the vice president competes with everyone else. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: But in this weird situation -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- you got to you know, it’s not so straightforward. Chris Hayes: It’s not so straightforward, yeah. And again, I’ve come to think that the best of all worlds would be him giving that speech in 2023 and saying, I’ve looked hard at this and I just don’t, you know, we don’t know what the future holds. I feel great in the job right now, but I just can’t definitively say I’m going to be able to do it for more years. And there’s an open primary. There’s a contested primary, blah, blah, blah. That didn’t happen. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: We can’t linger on that. But yes, in that circumstance, the vice president competes along with everyone else. And this is just a very different circumstance. And again, this sort of question of there is a little bit of like, you know, underpants gnome reasoning dot, dot, dot, then X happens. The other thing I will say to go back to where we started is and I did this on the show the other night where we looked at the polling average on July 9th, whatever the date was, you know, going back. And there’s never been in the time I’m covering politics professionally, a Republican leading in the polling average in July 9th, which is stark, but also, as I said in that program, like John Kerry was up and Hillary Clinton were up and like everyone remembers President Hillary Clinton and President John Kerry, right? Jamelle Bouie: Right. Exactly. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Like things do change. And last night when Biden was asked at the press conference, he basically said, look, we haven’t even started the campaign and people don’t start paying attention till after Labor Day. And I do think that that’s sort of the best answer they have. I don’t think it’s particularly satisfying about how they overcome the deficit they’re in. But all of which to say one thing I’ve learned not to do is to too radically draw a line from the present to the future. Jamelle Bouie: Yes. Chris Hayes: Because there’s been a bunch of moments from the aftermath of “Access Hollywood” to Donald Trump getting COVID when it was like Donald Trump was down by 10 points when he had COVID and the Democrats have 60 seats in the Senate. Now, he did lose that race, but the polling during that moment was not at all reflective of what happened in the end. And I think it just is also important reminder that like polling under conditions of volatility and the necessary fact that things change mean that like just because something’s happening now doesn’t mean it’s going to be the same in four months. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, I think that’s right. So, first of all, I find this election cycle incredibly strange. And, you know, one of my big takeaways from 2016 was just to sort of like relieve myself of like any certainty about like what could possibly happen. And that lesson should be applied to any election. It’s this, it’s this one, both because of the unusual circumstance of having, you know, an incumbent and a former incumbent on the ballot together, the unusual circumstance of Trump being Trump, Biden’s age. The extent to which like the media environment is like fractured in a way that it’s like it’s hard to know what actually breaks through to ordinary people. Like one example, last year, maybe earlier this year, I know I wrote about the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. I know I did. And when I wrote about it, I was like, oh, this is this thing that probably no one’s going to pay attention to, but it’s like it’s very significant. It’s like this plan for the next Republican executive branch. Pay attention to it. And I would have never anticipated whatsoever that I could go on TikTok and flip through 20 consecutive videos -- Chris Hayes: It’s wild. Jamelle Bouie: -- of just like total normal people talking about Project 2025. And I don’t know what explains that. Is it just that it sounds sinister? Maybe. I don’t know. I don’t know what explains what’s happening there. But it’s clear that something is happening that’s significant enough that sort of the Republican presumptive nominee has to basically give a statement saying, oh, I’ve never heard about it. Chris Hayes: Which is obviously a lie, just to be clear. Jamelle Bouie: Obviously a lie. But like it’s significant. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Oh, hugely significant. Jamelle Bouie: That he feels the need to lie about it. And so that to me is just an example of how we actually do not know what is significant to ordinary people. What is going to be salient to ordinary people? How voters are going to make their decisions. And at this moment, the polling does strongly suggest that voters are saying Biden’s too old and I guess we’re going to support Trump at least in swing states. But I honestly don’t know what to make of that beyond it being a snapshot of the moment. Chris Hayes: Yeah, I agree with you. I had you on the program the other night with Dave Roberts, one of the things that’s been driving me crazy about this debate is the certainty that people seem to have in both directions. I mean, it’s all very uncertain. I mean, and again, a huge part of life in high stakes situations is making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. So you got to do the best you can. But yes, I think it’s important to just constantly be taking that humble pill about what is and isn’t going to happen and what’s going to be relevant. I agree with you on Project ‘25. I was riding my bike to work. I was pulled over at the intersection in the Lower East Side. This couple saw me. This guy kind of recognized me. He’s like, are you on YouTube? And I was like, no. He’s like, where I know you from? I’m like, I actually have a news show. He’s like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Then he goes, I haven’t checked out politics for like four or five years. What’s been going on? I was like, oh, man. Well, at this red light, I can’t. And then he said, he said that pause. I was like, well, I got to get to work. And then he goes, what’s this Project 2025 I keep hearing about? And I was like, of all the things. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. Chris Hayes: I’ve been checked out of politics for five years. I was like, oh, my God. Talk about penetration. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And again, that’s just sort of Biden being old, clearly is like a thing that people talk about as well. Chris Hayes: It as a thing. It is a meme, yes. Jamelle Bouie: Right. But I just can’t figure out what the significance of it all is going to be like, I just don’t know. And you’re right that like the part of high stakes politics, this is making part of our job, right --  Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- is to try to, if not provide certainty, to grapple with uncertainty and try to make some sort of analysis, offer some kind of thing that people can better help understand their world. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: So just kind of grapple with it. Nonetheless, I think the overlapping unprecedented -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- that we’re experiencing just makes that task all the more difficult. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One last thing I want to talk to you about Kamala Harris we didn’t quite touch on, you know, in addition to what would be the fallout for the Democratic Coalition, were she to be somehow sidelined in succeeding Joe Biden, were he to choose to not be the nominee slash how she would fare as a political candidate. There is one thing like you’re already seeing it and I’m going to have a commentary about this tonight, linking together Kamala Harris and this utterly despicable lawsuit against Northwestern University Law School, where, you know, this sort of anti-DEI crusade, I think, has been motivated from the beginning by a desire to purge black people from institutions of elite institutions and power in American life. Quite clearly, I think.  Now, I think some people who have been along for the ride on that don’t want that. They view it as a sort of meritocratic situation. There’s interesting polling on affirmative action across racial groups. There’s even a significant number of black and brown folks who don’t like affirmative action. So I don’t want to say that all the people that have this view or have the support feel that way. But the vanguard of the right wing that is pursuing it as their project, I think it’s clear that’s what they want. Jamelle Bouie: I mean, just on that Northwestern lawsuit -- Chris Hayes: It’s so disgusting. Jamelle Bouie: -- the clear implication of that lawsuit is just that, like, there is no such thing as a qualified black person that could hold the job. Chris Hayes: Correct. Jamelle Bouie: Like, it’s a fact, though. Chris Hayes: Here are the black faculty. And by definition, because they are black, they are not qualified is essentially the argument. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: Despite the fact that these are brilliant women and faculty. Anyway, what I do think Kamala as a presidential candidate would unleash a truly despicable avalanche of ugliness, which I don’t wish on anyone. But I also do think could backfire just when we’re thinking through the political implications of what it would mean, like the sort of embedded sexism and racism in, you know, American civic culture where that’s been the case for a long time. We’ve never had a woman president. We’ve had one black president. But I also do think, like, there is a real risk for that in how ugly they will get about Kamala Harris. Jamelle Bouie: I very much agree with this. One of the most formative political science books I read when I was in college was a book called “The Race Card” by scholar Tali Mendelberg. And it’s about the 1988 election and it’s about the Willie Horton -- Chris Hayes: Yup. Jamelle Bouie: -- ad campaign. It’s about all that. And one of the observations made is that to the extent that that was neutralized among the public, it was only when it was confronted directly. It’s only when you said, this is what they’re doing. This is why they’re doing what they’re doing. And that neutralized it for a public, which once they heard that countervailing message, was like, I don’t want to be associated with that, right. This is 1988, which is much less enlightened -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- along a lot of ways than we are today. And the other thing I have in my head, and this is just sort of just like counterfactual. But the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election was like fought on this like CRT, you know, parent’s rights ground. And the current governor, then candidate Glenn Youngkin, they leaned into the CRT stuff. And I always thought it would have been interesting to see in the Democratic primary, Tara McAuliffe, the former governor, is running. And then his nearest competitor was a Petersburg, Virginia based legislator, Jennifer Carroll Foy, who is African-American. And I always thought it would have been interesting, at least to see how a black woman -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- nominee would have handled the CRT stuff, because my intuition is that it actually would have been much less effective because it would have been too explicit. Right. Chris Hayes: That’s very interesting. Jamelle Bouie: It’s maybe an easier play to run -- Chris Hayes: Against a white against a white man, yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- against a white man. And in the same way, I do wonder if, you know, as you suggested, we’ve already kind of seen it like the “New York Post” ran was a guy, you know --  Chris Hayes: Charles Gasparino. Jamelle Bouie: -- like op-ed or something. Chris Hayes: Referred to as a DEI presidential candidate. Jamelle Bouie: A DEI president. I do wonder if that would be for Republicans, whether that would be the absolutely wrong tact to take with Harris, right. That actually gives her an opportunity to directly deflect it, to make the stakes of the election even more clear, right. To sort of like pull this out in the open and it would be effective. It’s how race and racism interacts in American elections is like much more complicated -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- than I think people recognize. Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: And there’s often a tension among the voting public between whatever latent prejudices they have and their internal conception of who they imagine themselves to be and what issues are just salient in the world. Chris Hayes: Absolutely. Yup. Jamelle Bouie: And kind of the trick of the 2016 campaign, Trump’s 2016 campaign was kind of by virtue of his own celebrity persona, he’s kind of able to negotiate all those things. Like you could plausibly say if you were like one of these Obama to Trump voters, like, oh, it’s nothing about race for me, even if it’s clear that like the explicitness of the racial message did like influence your vote. But it’s a tough line to walk. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: And it becomes all the more tougher when the candidate themselves is of like the -- Chris Hayes: Is a raving racist. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: I mean, like to every last cell in his body, I mean. Jamelle Bouie: And against a non-white candidate. I mean, I honestly do keep thinking of like other races in American history. I mean, there haven’t been a ton of like black candidates running like statewide or whatever. But like you’ll see that it’s tricky to deploy that stuff directly. Chris Hayes: Yes. Great point. Jamelle Bouie: Like even one of the most infamously prejudiced political ads in like recent memory and recent history, which is the hand ad -- Chris Hayes: Hands, hands ad. Jamelle Bouie: -- from the 1990 Jesse Helms, Harvey Gantt, North Carolina Senate race. Like it’s explicit -- Chris Hayes: But it’s actually weirdly deft, which is why it’s called the hands ad -- Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Right. Chris Hayes: -- because they never actually say it. You see one shot of the guy who got the job and not you. And all you see is his hands. And it’s clearly a black man. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. And that race was still very close. Chris Hayes: It was close. Jamelle Bouie: That race was still very close. Chris Hayes: Very close in again, decades ago in the South.  Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: Like, yeah, exactly. That’s a great point. And I think, again, I don’t really wish that on anyone or on the civic culture. You know, I mean, but I do think like I know who Donald Trump is. I know the people around him and like he really is. He doesn’t believe in a lot of things.  But like racism, like genuine racism and sort of racial hierarchy, not liking democracy and thinking some form of authoritarian is like better. And like Donald Trump is the best are, I think, basically the three core ideological commitments he has and are genuinely held, like genuinely held. Like none of those are an act like the fact that he likes autocrats is not some performative thing. Like he really, truly thinks democracy sucks, I think that’s a better system. And he really, truly thinks that like there’s a hierarchy of races like he does not believe in human equality. Jamelle Bouie: And yeah, if Kamala Harris were the nominee, they would just lose their minds. I mean, I think it’d be very explicit and very ugly. But like you like you suggested, Chris, at the beginning of this, I’m not sure that that would be particularly electorally successful, both in terms of how they turn off people --  Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- who don’t imagine themselves that way. And one last point on this, people don’t imagine themselves this way. If you’re not plugged into it, it may be hard to see. But there’s like an entire like infrastructure designed to get evangelical white people to be able to vote for Donald Trump without jeopardizing their self-conception of themselves.  Chris Hayes: Yes. Yes. Jamelle Bouie: Like it’s a whole edifice that exists. Chris Hayes: Yes. It’s enormous. I mean, we’ve done a podcast on precisely that edifice by a guy who tries to chip away at it, but it’s yes. Jamelle Bouie: And so I don’t think one should underestimate the effect that explicitness may have on how people make that kind of calculation. Chris Hayes: This is, to me, one of the most undercover voting groups in American politics is just the partisan Republican, because we cover the MAGA base, right? Like the people that go to the rallies and people who wear Trump hat. And then we cover like the never Trumpers and the people. But like a huge chunk of the coalition are just partisan Republicans who vote for him because he’s a Republican nominee and like -- Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And there was a poll yesterday, I think about something like 35% of Trump voters want him to drop out. It’s like they’re going to vote for him. I don’t think those 35 are necessarily swing voters, but there’s just a bunch of people that are just going to vote for the Republican in the ticket and Donald Trump’s Republican, and in some ways the question of which of those are pryable or gettable, I mean, I think not a ton of them are, some of them might be. But to your point about that edifice that’s been built, you know, we’re talking about such a narrow band of voters that are going to decide this election. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: That who knows? I will also note, because we’re recording this on this Friday, like by the time this is in your podcast feed, like Lord knows what’s happened. It’s like a very quick moving story. But Jamelle Bouie is, I think, one of the sort of sharpest, wisest, levelheaded, most like rigorously historically informed political thinkers and writers that we have in America today. He’s like, really, for me, just one of those people that I just, I want to know what he has to say about things, about everything. And so, Jamelle, it’s great to have you in the program. Jamelle Bouie: Thank you so much for the kind words. It’s a real pleasure to be on the show.   Chris Hayes: Once again, great thanks to Jamelle Bouie.

Discussing SCOTUS doing its worst — Strict Scrutiny Crossover: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/discussing-scotus-worst-strict-scrutiny-crossover-podcast-transcript-rcna163828,"Another year, another pretty wild Supreme Court term. SCOTUS recently ended its term with a number of big decisions including ruling that former president Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for his “official acts” in office. And it also overturned the Chevron doctrine, reversing a 40-year-old precedent that afforded federal agencies a degree of discretion in interpreting ambiguous laws. As always, there’s a lot to unpack and we’re excited to share our third crossover episode with the hosts of the ""Strict Scrutiny"" podcast, Chris’ wife Kate Shaw, and her co-hosts Melissa Murray and Leah Litman. They join to discuss some of the most alarming actions from the super conservative majority of the Court, attacks on government agencies and more. Note: This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Leah Litman: The idea that these people are so satisfied and are so convinced by what they are doing, it’s grotesque because you think about, for example, you know, the court’s inability to imagine a post-Roe versus Wade future where you have justices confidently predicting that the federal courts will be out of abortion cases once they overrule Roe, that was nuts. And similarly, when the court overrules Chevron, they’re just like, yeah, here’s some random thoughts about what the post-Chevron world will look like, but gosh knows we haven’t decided to actually hammer them out because we’ve just drank the Kool-Aid. Kate Shaw: The court has just, it seems to me, given a permission structure for Trump to do everything in his wildest imagination he might want to do but might have been somewhat constrained by the prospect of legal accountability from doing. All of that is now gone. And so it seems to me, not only a wildly wrong, but just an unfathomably dangerous decision. Melissa Murray: If you think about the whole system of constitutional design, the point of the Constitution and the separation of powers is that you don’t want any one of these branches to consolidate power in a way that allows them to dwarf any of the others. And you have this court essentially creating a king and creating within itself kind of would-be kings. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Very quick intro today because things are dire and we got to get to the point, but we are reprising what is quickly becoming an annual tradition, which is when the Supreme Court finishes doing its worst in June and this year into July, we do a term review with the hosts of by far my favorite legal podcast, really my favorite podcast with three of my favorite people, one who is particularly my favorite. The podcast is called “Strict Scrutiny.” You can find it wherever you get your podcasts. It is hosted by three women law professors, Melissa Murray, who’s at NYU, Leah Litman, who’s at Michigan, and my wife, Kate Shaw, who is at Penn. So we have just seen a crazy term. It ended with the bomb being dropped at this immunity decision, but there’s a whole bunch of other bombs they’ve planted. Then also some landmines that maybe haven’t gone off yet, but probably will in the future. And I follow this, you know, relatively closely for a civilian, pretty closely by listening to “Strict Scrutiny” and talking to Kate, but I thought this is a great opportunity. There’s so much to kind of get through. So Melissa Murray, Leah Litman, Kate Shaw, it’s great to have you on the program. Kate Shaw: It’s great to be here. Leah Litman: Thank you for having us. Melissa Murray: Always great to be back on a conjugal pod. Chris Hayes: Another conjugal pod. Yes, Melissa dubbed this a conjugal pod last time because I think marital pod is the adjective that they’ll scan more to people and sounds slightly less PG-13 than conjugal pod. Kate Shaw: Less spicy. Chris Hayes: Yeah, a little less spicy. Okay. So there’s a lot to sift through and I thought I basically, I had kind of three buckets in my mind, three categories of sort of term themes, because obviously there’s a bunch of cases, those cases go in a bunch of different directions. I thought I would start with like, it’s not the good news at all, but maybe the least bleak, which is a dynamic that was pretty interesting having to do with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. And maybe I did something on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and I got a great e-mail from someone I dearly love who’s like an incredibly with it, extremely high information news consumer who’s not a lawyer, who was like, I literally don’t understand what the Fifth Circuit is. And then I felt bad because I was like, yeah, like people literally don’t understand like how federal courts work. So I wondered if first like, Leah, maybe you can just give a like, what are circuit courts and what is the Fifth Circuit and why is it special to use a euphemism? Leah Litman: Yeah. So the Courts of Appeals are the intermediate appellate courts. And what that means is in the federal system, you start out in the federal trial courts, which are called district courts, and then the parties go up on appeal to the courts of appeal. And if they don’t prevail there, then they can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. And so the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is the court of appeals that oversees some states that include Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. And that court, why is it special? Where to begin? It is staffed with some of the most unhinged, deranged, lawless judges on the face of the earth. And these people are literally so out there, they occasionally lose the votes of both Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Chris Hayes: Just to clarify on the sort of how the federal courts work, and Kate, maybe you could just back me up here, because I do think it’s important for people to understand, you know, you go into a district court, whether it’s a criminal trial and it’s a lawsuit, and as long as you can show that you should be in there, you can get in there. And then you have an appeal by right, like you can appeal up to the next court. So those next courts, those appellate courts, they hear a ton of cases. Things go to them. And then after them, the vast majority of what they do ends there. Like only a tiny little bit gets to the Supreme Court. So most of the stuff that’s happening at the appellate, right? Is that right, Kate? Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Most appellate stuff -- Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- that’s it. That’s where you go. Kate Shaw: Everybody who loses and wants to pursue their case further in the federal system can go up to the Court of Appeals. So there’s an enormous number of cases those courts decide. And that obviously dwarfs the very small number of cases that the U.S. Supreme Court decides, which, you know, at its high watermark was a couple of hundred cases a year. In recent terms, it’s been more like 70 or 80 or even down to 60 or less a year. So that’s an infinitesimally small number of cases compared to the vast, you know, number of cases that the federal appeals courts decide. Chris Hayes: So these courts, all the circuits in the Fifth Circuit in particular, the Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, they’re hearing a lot of cases. Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And what they’re supposed to be doing, Melissa, is they’re supposed to be applying precedent, Supreme Court precedent. Like they’re not supposed to be making up the law. I mean, no one’s supposed to be making up the law, but basically, if anyone’s going to make up the law, the Supreme Court is like, we’re going to be the ones to make up the law. And the Fifth Circuit has just kind of been doing a lot of, I think, for lack of a better word, making up a lot of law and ending up with their cases and decisions before the Supreme Court. And there were there were a bunch this term, right? Melissa Murray: Yeah, I think that’s a really good point, Chris. So the Fifth Circuit is getting a lot of cases. I will note that there are a number of cases that start out in the Fifth Circuit in Texas in particular because of the practice of judge shopping. A lot of litigants have realized that if they go to certain courts in the Fifth Circuit, like Amarillo, for example, where there’s only one judge in one courthouse, you can pretty much be assured of a conservative outcome or a conservative friendly outcome. And so they file their cases there and then those cases go on to the Fifth Circuit. And the Fifth Circuit often endorses whatever wackadoodle theory that conservatives advance in the district court and then the other litigants appeal to the Fifth Circuit. I will also note one of the dynamics of the Fifth Circuit is not simply that they’re just kind of rubber stamping crazy conservative theories. And again, to be very clear on our podcast, we refer to the Fifth Circuit as the meth lab of conservative grievance -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Melissa Murray: -- where they literally cook this stuff up. There are a number of Fifth Circuit judges who I think understand themselves to be part of this milieu that is being looked at as potential Supreme Court nominees in the future. So, for example, if Donald Trump wins in November 2024, I think it’s pretty likely that Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who are in their 70s, will step down and they will be replaced by more extreme movement conservatives. And there are a bunch of guys on the Fifth Circuit who are like, pick me, choose me, love me. And they’re basically auditioning. So one of the dynamics isn’t just that the Fifth Circuit is crazy and cooking up all of this conservative meth. They’re also auditioning. And part of the audition is being as outlandish and outrageous as possible. So it’s not only just a majority decision that’s nuts. There will also be separate concurrences that would go even further to, you know, again, garner the attention of the powers that be. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And I think that’s such an important point and partly why I wanted to start with this because in some ways, even though it’s a weird thing to say in the current context where things feel pretty dark in a lot of ways, just to remember things can get worse. Kate Shaw: It could be worse. The Supreme Court could have, yeah. Chris Hayes: It’s actually genuinely important because the only difference, and Kate, tell me if this is an overstatement, but like the only difference between the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit is personnel. Like, there’s no reason, there’s nothing binding other than who you have that you couldn’t have a Supreme Court as nutty, as proximate to the meth as the Fifth Circuit if you were to get, you know, Donald Trump, say, for an office and he got a bunch of people on the court. Kate Shaw: And you had a Republican-controlled Senate. I mean, I think that absolutely Melissa’s right that you would have two relatively quick retirements. I mean, Thomas, at least, is really enjoying this. So I don’t know that he’s going to want to go. Leah Litman: Not as much as he enjoys parking his RV and going to Walmart. He likes that. Kate Shaw: The question, though, is all of the kind of largesse you’re talking about, the RV, which is, of course, you know, heavily subsidized, as were many aspects of Thomas’ lifestyle, as we have recently come to know. But would all of that dissipate if he stepped down from the court? Leah Litman: I don’t think so, right? Kate Shaw: No. Leah Litman: Because it’s a way of locking in -- Chris Hayes: Oh, yeah. Leah Litman: -- more deregulatory corporate power in the court. And replacing Clarence Thomas with some 30-year-old person who’s just going to continue voting his same way. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kate Shaw: He’d continue to get gratuities after leaving the court. Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: Here’s a retirement gift, sir, for this year and every year after. Kate Shaw: Which one of the court’s cases this term, the Snyder case that invalidated a corruption prosecution precisely on the theory that gratuities, right, like gifts given as a thank you, as opposed to bribes given in advance, are not a violation of a really important anti-corruption statute. Chris Hayes: Yes. It’s like when you’re done with your term as mayor of Portage, Indiana, you have that little iPad, you flip it around to the contractors that you steered municipal contracts to, and then they write in the tip for that. And then they flip it back around, and that’s fine. Kate Shaw: All completely fine. Chris Hayes: Now, if up front you had been like, bro, I’ll steer some contracts to you if you give me $13,000, that’s not good. But if you give -- Melissa Murray: Well, it’s not good right now. Give me more time. Chris Hayes: Who knows? Yes, exactly. Melissa Murray: That might be fine as well. Chris Hayes: All right. Wait, but I want to talk about Snyder, but I want to steer back to Fifth Circuit because — Melissa Murray: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- so I think we’ve set up this framework that’s important just in terms of what the Fifth Circuit is, why it’s kind of at the avant-garde. It’s an avant-garde court of sort of right-wing grievance and right-wing jurisprudence. And one of the remarkable things is a lot of cases, because they were cooking up these sorts of cockamamie theories, SCOTUS took them, partly because it was like, whoa. And in a lot of places, we’re like, nah, dude, this is nuts. Sorry. Like, there’s four or five maybe times they got reversed. Kate Shaw: It’s more than that. So to take off the most important one. So you had the Mifepristone case, FDA versus Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine. The court unanimously reversed the Fifth Circuit, which had allowed this crazy, unhinged case to proceed against the FDA, arguing that some of these restrictions on Mifepristone should be reimposed and that the FDA had been wrong to loosen restrictions. They got reversed. The Fifth Circuit got reversed 8-1 in the Rahimi case, the case in which the lower court had said that someone under a domestic violence order of protection had a Second Amendment right to have a gun, regardless of a federal statute that says no, they don’t. The Fifth Circuit got reversed 7-2 in a case involving the funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Reverse 6-3 in a case involving federal agencies and officials communicating with social media companies. An then there was a malicious prosecution case and the NetChoice case involving also the First Amendment and social media and a takings case. So it’s actually a kind of shockingly long list for a term -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- in which the court decided less than 60 cases. Chris Hayes: I’m not going to ask. I mean, someone keeps the numbers like the version of, you know, the sports statisticians. Kate Shaw: It’s like a 90. It’s north of it. It’s almost a 90 percent reversal rate on the cases the court took from the Fifth this term. Chris Hayes: And to be clear, to go back to your point, Melissa, which I think is actually really interesting. I love the line in the beginning. You say it’s about the Supreme Court and the legal culture that surrounds it. And the legal culture that surrounds it what I find so fascinating is in the old legal culture, it would be shameful for those judges on the Fifth Circuit, their clerks, everyone involved to be sending these up and getting reversed, like getting reversed is kind of a badge of dishonor. You screwed up in some way. I think the sort of status of this used to be like, whoa, yikes, like I got reversed as a judge. And I wonder if you think that still holds. It is pretty remarkable. And some of the opinions were quite scathing about the Fifth Circuit in terms of the way that they do their analysis, the way that like what they’re doing. Like, it wasn’t just getting reversed. It’s like you guys are sort of out of control was the message being sent to some of the text of the opinions. Melissa Murray: No, that’s definitely true. So there were a couple of opinions where, you know, for example, the court called out Jim Ho, who is one of the worst offenders on the America’s next top appellate Judge/SCOTUS prospect market. He’s kind of doing -- Chris Hayes: Trump-appointee. Melissa Murray: -- Yes. Trump-appointee, was sworn in at the home of Harlan Crow. Super weird. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: I know. But the court publicly rebuked him in an opinion. So, you know, that’s important. It’s also important, I think, to understand that when the court tacks back from what the Fifth Circuit is doing, they get the benefit of looking moderate, even though -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- the Fifth Circuit is so extreme that when the court pulls back from that extremity, they’re still pretty much on the right. It just looks way better -- Chris Hayes: Right. Melissa Murray: -- than whatever craziness the Fifth Circuit originally offered. So, you know, in a way, the Fifth Circuit is kind of a PR arm for the court. Like, you know, they look insane so this court looks kind of normal, but it’s not normal, and it is moving to the right. It’s just the Fifth Circuit really pulls the average and mass a lot of what the court is doing in terms of ideological drift. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Let’s just talk. There are two cases that in particular I think are worth just diving into. Obviously, Kate, you just ran through them. But one of them, because they go in two different directions about this. My read on this, my little amateur reading, so you tell me if I’m wrong. I think if you look at the Mifepristone case and Rahimi, let’s start with Rahimi. And the thing I think is Rahimi, and it’s a joke that Melissa told, I think, in the live show in D.C., which has stuck with me because it’s 8-1 and Thomas writes a dissent. And Melissa’s joke was like, it was like you were showing up for the all you can eat shrimp at Red Lobster and all your all your friends are like on Ozempic. And you’re like, wait, I thought we were doing this. That Thomas basically writes this decision in Bruin, which is another gun case having to do with New York gun laws, basically being like, look, if a gun restriction isn’t there at the founding, essentially is the test, it’s no good. This case comes before the court in the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court where a domestic violence, someone with a restraining order gets a gun. He has unlawful possession of them because he has this order. It’s in violation. And the Fifth Circuit, Leah, what does the Fifth Circuit say? What do they do with this case? Leah Litman: They take it literally and they say, you asked us to find an analog for any modern-day gun restriction. And there actually isn’t an analog for laws that disarm people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. And the Fifth Circuit apply that test. And then the Supreme Court says, actually, no, that can’t be what we meant in Bruin. You know, if there’s any decision that kind of confirms that originalism is just about like what gives the Republican justices heebie-jeebies, right? It is Rahimi because the Fifth Circuit -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: -- I think, faithfully applied Rahimi. And then you have 8-1, the Supreme Court saying, actually, you misunderstood what we said. Chris Hayes: The reason that I brought Rahimi first and the reason that I invoked Melissa’s funny joke is that to me, this isn’t a case. What’s interesting about Rahimi is them taking the court literally and then the court having to be like, well, this can’t be right. I mean, literally, like the analysis that we had, like, yeah, domestic violence didn’t exist as a category at the country’s founding. So we can’t possibly be applying this test. And then all these very funny, Kate, ways, different opinions in that case of the court trying to basically run away from and a little bit gaslight their own previous, you know, jurisprudential logic to find some way to be like, yes, it is okay to take a gun away from a guy who is a menace and menacing, you know, the woman that he had child with. Kate Shaw: Yeah, I mean, all these different opinions are just like such obvious illustrations of the courts, you know, both inconsistent approach to originalism and deflection of responsibility because, right, each of these opinions says like, no, no, like it’s not our fault or the Bruin opinion’s fault that the Fifth Circuit decided to strike down — Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- this domestic violence law. It’s an unfaithful or improper interpretation or understanding of the level of generality at which a judge is supposed to conduct the inquiry about whether there is a founding era analog. But if we’re talking generally speaking about the disarmament of dangerous people. Yeah, we have laws like that. And so that supplies the requisite historical analog. So they’re both trying to reaffirm Bruin. They’re not really distancing themselves from Bruin, but they’re also redefining in a way that is fundamentally bad faith. I think it is right. The Fifth Circuit did literally apply what the court said about how to justify contemporary gun laws. And this was just an example, I think, of a spectacularly unappealing criminal defendant, right? So Rahimi was not only under domestic violence restraining order, but had discharged his weapon repeatedly at the mother of his child, went on a shooting spree where he shot at five other individuals in the course of, you know, a couple of days. Then his -- Melissa Murray: At a Whataburger. Kate Shaw: Right. There was a Whataburger involved. Then his house was searched. Melissa Murray: Do not defile the Whataburger. Kate Shaw: And the guns were found. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kate Shaw: And so I think the court, just as a PR matter, could not imagine -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- countenancing logic that let this person retain possession of their guns under the court’s cases. Chris Hayes: And the reason that I think it’s interesting to contrast that with the Mifepristone case is because in Rahimi, it seems like they’re kind of applying the conservative court’s own logic and the court’s like, wait, no. In the Mifepristone case, like the standing analysis that is cooked up at the district court for this one judge that Melissa mentioned, Matthew Kaczmarek, who’s this like movement right-wing lawyer. He’s the only judge in Amarillo. You go and file in Amarillo. You know you have him. Then it goes to Fifth Circuit where you know you’re going to get a sympathetic here. They kick it unanimously, I think, on standing, right. And I wonder maybe like, Leah, this would be real one on one for your audience, but not necessarily for mine. So like what standing is as a legal concept. And then maybe what the standing analysis of the plaintiffs were here that the court found so absurd. Leah Litman: Yeah. So standing is the rule that in order to bring a case in federal court, in order to sue, you have to show you were injured or you have some likelihood of injury in the future. And here the plaintiffs were a group of anti-abortion doctors who did not prescribe or use mifepristone. Instead, they maintained that other people’s prescription of mifepristone somehow harmed them, even though they had never been called upon to treat complications from mifepristone in part because mifepristone is so safe. The district court and the courts of appeal, you know, in order to conclude there was standing, relied on retracted scientific studies and some anonymous blog posts and concluded actually there was a sufficient risk of injury from mifepristone, right. Like it’s laughable. But I do kind of want to push back on the idea that it was just the laughability of the standing analysis that led the court to conclude we just can’t go for this because this Supreme Court has adopted some pretty laughable -- Chris Hayes: Totally. Leah Litman: -- standing analysis, like in the Student Debt Relief case. Chris Hayes: Student debt, yeah. Yup. Leah Litman: Right. And I think they specifically made moves so as to prevent having to reach the merits of this case. So, for example, they did not grant the doctors, you know, cross petition. Chris Hayes: Sorry, what’s a cross petition? Leah Litman: So the request to hear the case on behalf of the doctors because the court of appeals had ruled against the doctor’s request to revoke mifepristone entirely -- Chris Hayes: Okay. Leah Litman: -- had only granted their request to reimpose some additional regulations. But the Supreme Court also denied the request to intervene, that is to participate in the case by some states. Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: And so, therefore, the court didn’t have to confront whether those states potentially had standing. And so they put off a decision on medication abortion until after the election. Chris Hayes: Right. So you read this as they took the off ramp that was convenient so as not to come up with a really like wildly unpopular ruling in an election year. Leah Litman: Yeah, in part, right. And the laughability of the standing analysis certainly helped them. But, you know, having seen this court adopt laughable theories before -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: -- I’m just not sure that that was sufficient. Chris Hayes: I guess this gets us to an interesting question, which is we’re always in this era and we’re going to talk about the admin law cases and we’re going to talk about immunity. But we’re always in this era, I find, or I am at least, like bumping up against this question of like what the law actually is and whether the law is like a set of activities that a group of people acculturated through a set of institutions that credential themselves as making lawyers. That’s what the law is. Or if the law actually has some kind of internal logic and that certain legal arguments are so bad that they just fail on the merits. And we kind of go back and forth between these two. And I think in some ways this term is sort of testing both of those, right. So I guess my question to you is, is everything a sort of calculation of the sort of political consequences or sort of the agenda? Are there still arguments that are just so bad, Melissa, that they can’t persuade that they fail under their own weight as arguments? Or is everything essentially, from a descriptive standpoint, a kind of just a sociological question of how a group works and who you can get to do what? Melissa Murray: I mean, that’s a really good question, sort of like the legal realism behind the current court. Certainly, I think there are elements of the court, maybe even a predominant element of the court, that are motivated by outcomes, maybe ideological outcomes, if you want to put that final point on it. And I think you can definitely see that. I think they’re also very attentive to the world outside of One First Street and sort of thinking about how their decisions may play out on a broader scale in the public. I think that was certainly the case in the two abortion decisions that the court heard this year. The Mifepristone case, as you note, they never decided on the merits. They kicked it out on standing grounds. And that temporarily preserved abortion access in the United States. But of course, there are states that are already planning to file lawsuits challenging the FDA’s regulation of mifepristone. So that case will be back -- Chris Hayes: Back up, yeah. Melissa Murray: -- before the court, probably after the election. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: The EMTALA case is another great example. You know, that case was pending for five months on the court’s docket when they decided like, oh, wait a minute, maybe we shouldn’t have taken this case. That’s weird that it took five months for them to figure that out. It’s not weird if you think about them recognizing that abortion has the potential to galvanize electoral majorities and send women to the polls in massive numbers -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- in this very tightly contested election. And so, you know, that may help explain what happened in EMTALA. And it preserves abortion access in Idaho for now, although I will note there’s also a challenge involving EMTALA going on in the Fifth Circuit. And the Fifth Circuit has allowed Texas’s very draconian six-week ban to go into effect and to prohibit the provision of emergency abortions in that state. And that’s still going on because the court never decided -- Chris Hayes: Right. Melissa Murray: -- whether EMTALA conflicts with the state law. And if so, if EMTALA should preempt that state law. So that substantive question is still out there. And Texas has a lot more women of reproductive age than does Idaho. So it’s a major punt by the court - Chris Hayes: It’s a great point. Melissa Murray: -- and one with real consequences. Chris Hayes: Can I just say when you put it like that, it just seems so cynical. It seems -- Kate Shaw: Yeah. Leah Litman: Yes. Chris Hayes: Like shocking, appallingly cynical. Kate Shaw: We just recorded our term preview and we were just like, if honestly read together, it really looks like, all they have done in these two cases is decide to minimize the chances that abortion is going to be a really salient issue in the November election. And then they will do atrocious things in both of these cases when they come back, you know, a year to two years from now. I think there’s a very real chance that that’s where we are. Leah Litman: Wait, I sound super cynical. I think I probably am super cynical, but I think it’s hard not to be. Like, there are these glimmers, these moments where the court seems principled, where, you know, perhaps they do the right thing, as it were. But then there are these moments where they do the wrong thing in such a colossally wrong way that it’s hard not to think that they’re completely motivated by outcome. And I think a real difference is you have to look at how different this court has been since it became a six to three conservative supermajority. That happened in 2020 after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And in every term since they’ve had a conservative supermajority, six justices, they’ve overruled a past precedent. And it can’t be the case that every one of these earlier courts was so dumb that they didn’t get it. Like it’s because -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- this court doesn’t believe in those decisions. So you overrule Roe, you overrule the affirmative action decisions, you overrule Chevron, you overrule by implication United States versus Nixon. And through your delay, you give Donald Trump de facto immunity on the January 6th case. And you set him up with your decision to be a dictator king if he wins the presidency in November 2024. And so if it seems like they’re in the bag for Trump, they’ve made it look like that. Chris Hayes: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I want to get to you. I definitely want to talk about Trump and the immunity case. But since you mentioned Chevron, it seemed to me, aside from sort of both the Fifth Circuit getting smacked down, but also maybe looking into the ghost of Christmas future when we look at the Fifth Circuit is like seem to be one theme. The other big theme seemed to be on administrative law, which is something that we just talk about in cable news constantly. It’s a huge, sexy topic for us. It’s basically my A block every night. Kate, since you teach admin law -- Leah Litman: Checks out. Chris Hayes: -- since you teach admin law -- Melissa Murray: I want to go there. Chris Hayes: Well, I think you’ve done an amazing job about writing about this for popular audiences multiple times in “The New York Times” where you’re a contributing columnist. Maybe let’s just start with the Loper Bright case, which, as Melissa just mentioned, overruled a case called Chevron and just set up like what Chevron said, what Loper Bright says and why it’s a big deal. Kate Shaw: Sure. And you’re right. I think administrative law is not appearing on cable news in A blocks. It sounds dry and technical. And I think that people can assume that it’s sort of abstract and so are its stakes. But like we are kind of trying to communicate that it’s not abstract. The stakes are super high. People should care tremendously about these cases in this body of law. So basically, Chevron is this 40-year-old case, 1984, that just sets forth kind of distilled to its essence, a very simple rule, which is that there’s lots of laws passed by Congress and they say things that are sometimes kind of broad and general, like employees should get overtime or agencies should take steps to provide that emissions level remain as low as feasible and things like that. So like what employee means, what feasible means like those aren’t self-defining terms, but agencies that administer statutes have to spend time thinking about what the words in those statutes mean. And what Chevron says is if there’s a law passed by Congress and an agency administers that law, the agency gets to decide what the words in the law mean, if they’re ambiguous at all. And so long as the agency decision about what the words mean is reasonable, courts are supposed to defer to agencies. So that’s the basic rule. Courts defer to reasonable agency interpretations of statutes. And for 40 years, that has been the governing standard against which agencies have operated and regulated industries have operated and courts have operated. And the Supreme Court last week overruled Chevron and says agencies don’t get to be in the driver’s seat when it comes to interpreting statutes. We do. Federal courts and ultimately the Supreme Court gets to decide what statutes passed by Congress mean. And the tools that courts use to interpret statutes are not like deep expertise and understanding of the industry and the science. The tools courts use are, you know, dictionaries, Latin rules about how to interpret language, the amicus briefs filed by, you know, ideological fellow travelers and vibes. Those are the things courts use to construe statutes. And that’s what this decision says is now going to determine the meaning of every law passed by Congress. Chris Hayes: So I want to follow up on a few things. One, the practical implications of this. It’s like, okay, courts are going to decide rather than agencies, but how does that cash out, like why does it matter and why was there such interest in this as a project of both the conservative legal movement and also a bunch of very wealthy interests and corporate interests to get to this point? Kate Shaw: You know, they have just for decades been hostile to the general project of agency power. I mean, I don’t want to give too complex an answer, but I will say two things. One, really, you know, since the Reagan administration, like, you know, there have been administrative agencies and government writ-large has been in the crosshairs. And that is actually in some tension with this kind of empowerment of the president that I do want to talk about -- Chris Hayes: Yeah, I want to talk about that. Yeah. Kate Shaw: -- in a little bit. You know, there’s definite tension there. But I think basically the attack on agencies is really not about agencies, quite agencies, but the attack on agencies as independent vessels that possess expertise and decide based on, you know, rigorous reasoned based decision-making processes. So actually, I think the conservatives who have had agencies in the crosshairs for decades don’t so much want to, you know, disempower agencies writ-large. They want to bring agencies under the control of an unchecked president if they can control that president, obviously not under the control of Joe Biden, but that maybe is getting ahead. But as a general matter, I think it’s an anti-government and anti-expertise orientation that underlies this attack on the administrative state and Chevron has come to stand in for the entirety of the administrative state. And so this is an enormous symbolic victory, but it is also a huge practical victory. And agencies will get to do less because these -- Chris Hayes: They’ll get sued more, right? Kate Shaw: -- in regulatory courts. They’ll get sued more in courts. These conservative justices and many conservative lower court judges are going to read statutes -- Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- always in ways that empower the agencies as little as possible -- Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- to intervene in business, right. Like that’s the long and short of it. Chris Hayes: Okay. Right. Let me ask one and any of you can answer this? I don’t know. Just a devil’s advocate defense of Loper Bright or at least Chevron skepticism. I’ve read commentary by people that work in like civil liberties with like intelligence agencies. And basically, they’re like the people inside the intelligence agencies are menaces. They interpret statutes to maximize their power, to maximize their surveillance power, because that’s what they like. And trying to get courts to review that because of Chevron has been very difficult. Similarly, immigration lawyers I’ve seen said we can’t get our clients to get their cases heard by courts because of Chevron deference, which says whatever the whim of the administrative interpretation of this is, that’s what goes and our clients are screwed by it. And if we can get into court, that will help us. So these are just two examples where people that I think have interesting or righteous politics are more aligned with, you know, my worldview other than like, you know, the oil companies, for example, have arguments about why maybe this is good or why in their at least narrow practice in the agencies they deal with, maybe this will help. I’m just curious to hear your reactions to that. Kate Shaw: Yeah, I’m happy to say two things, but you guys should feel free to jump in as well. I mean, I think that it’s really important to make clear that no one defending Chevron is suggesting that agencies always get it right or agencies always operate in good faith or anything like that. It’s just that in a world with really two regimes on offer -- Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- one where agencies make these determinations and one where unelected judges make these determinations, agencies are the better option. Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: They are, you know, staffed with experts and democratically accountable to a degree that federal courts are not. Not totally. They’re not elected, but they are far more democratically accountable than our judges and agencies, if they’re overreaching as immigration agencies and intelligence agencies so frequently are do have checks that can be brought to bear upon them. You know, congressional checks, internal checks in ways that the federal courts just don’t. Chris Hayes: Interesting. Kate Shaw: So, I think those critiques have merit, but it’s a universe in which you really have two options. And I don’t see how those advocates can prefer the outcomes that their clients are likely to get in front of this Supreme Court. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One of the things that’s really striking to me, which is related to this, and Leah, I think this is something you all you guys talk about on the podcast a lot. It’s just like almost at a tonal level, the complete lack of humility that is exuded by these individuals in their opinions. Like Robert says, this really snarky line in Loper Bright, where he says like agencies don’t have the expertise interpretation. Courts do. And it’s like and everything is this kind of like smarmy condescension. Leah Litman: If you think that’s smarmy condescension, you should read a Gorsuch opinion. Chris Hayes: That’s true. Yes. My line about Gorsuch is that I went in the oral arguments, the immunity case, and I don’t listen to oral arguments very often that I had actually never heard a man make love to his own voice before I heard Neil Gorsuch. But it’s really quite a thing. Leah Litman: He cites himself. Chris Hayes: It’s really quite a thing to listen to. It’s really like just comes through the microphone. But, you know, this complete, this sort of imperiousness, the smugness, the sort of like self-satisfied. And to your point, Melissa, before about like they’re overturning all these people, but they’re just generally just like leaking out of these opinions. There is just this sense of like, you know, you ever meet someone who’s like always like I’m surrounded by idiots and it’s a gnarly personality and also not someone I ever trust. They’re like that. It’s like, well, look at these idiots over here. Look at those idiots over there. Like there’s no sense in these opinions, Leah, of like humility, circumspection. We’re carrying the part of like a long tradition and we’re fallible human beings trying to get it right. And part of what binds us is like I’m thinking of John Paul Stevens, who is very much loved those values and the way that he talked about judging, but they’re totally absent in so many of the parts of the opinions that I’ve read. Leah Litman: They’re absent, despite the fact that these justices make mistakes all the freaking time. I mean, Justice Gorsuch’s opinion -- Chris Hayes: In a space. Leah Litman: -- in another administrative law case, Ohio versus EPA, which concluded that the EPA is good neighbor rule was not adequately justified because, he, Neil Gorsuch, just wasn’t convinced by their explanations about ozone, misdescribed nitrogen oxides, the gases that cause pollution and smog as nitrous oxide, laughing gas. Chris Hayes: Wait, wait, I want to stop there. Multiple times, five times in the opinion. Leah Litman: Yeah, five times. Chris Hayes: And I just want to be clear about this. I would not get out of bed for a week if I did this. I cannot imagine showing your face. It would be like there are certain errors people make with a typo, and then there’s other errors that show they don’t understand anything. And it would be like it’s such an obvious error, but it would be like calling the Supreme Court a district court. Like if you did that, you don’t deal with the law at all. You don’t know anything. Leah Litman: Chris, Justice Sotomayor made a mistake citing like something in one of the abortion cases, like some statistic. And conservatives literally flew on her and just attacked her. If any of the female justices or any of the Democratic appointees had made the mistake that Neil Gorsuch made, they would be run off of the court, like people would be talking about how stupid they were. And instead, we’re just like there is Neil Neiling. Neil’s going to Neil. Neil’s going to mistake laughing gas for smog. And who among us hasn’t done that? They get away with a lot. Chris Hayes: The Gorsuch one, I knew I did a piece on the show, but Kavanaugh also made a mistake. Leah Litman: Well, so this was back during COVID, during one of the court’s COVID voting cases. Justice Kavanaugh made the inaccurate statement that Vermont had not changed its election practices because of COVID. And the Vermont secretary of state literally corrected him on Twitter and was like, could you please correct this in the opinion? And he did. And like those are like pointed ones, right -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- that like we can like laugh about and are very easy to describe. But the reality is the court makes all sorts of questionable moves, like in the Ohio versus EPA case where Justice Gorsuch basically misdescribed what people said during the agency process and misdescribed how the federal government had responded. And the idea that these people are so satisfied and are so convinced by what they are doing, it’s grotesque. Because you think about, for example, you know, the court’s inability to imagine a post Roe versus Wade future where you have justices confidently predicting that the federal courts will be out of abortion cases once they overrule Roe. That was nuts. And similarly, when the court overrule Chevron, they’re just like, yeah, here’s some random thoughts about what the post Chevron world will look like. But gosh knows we haven’t decided to actually hammer them out because we’ve just drank the Kool-Aid. Chris Hayes: I mean, you’ve got a situation where Alito writes in the EMTALA case, which was the emergency care as mandated by federal law in states like Idaho that have intense abortion restrictions. He dissents from them kicking it, basically punching on it to say like, yeah, we should take it and also, here’s Sam Alito. I’m like, I didn’t go to med school, I don’t know. But here’s where me and like my 25-year-old clerks who’ve like been, you know, pounding Red Bull to get this opinion out after some googling. I mean, I say this like with sort of like knowledge and love and respect. But like, again, those are the people who are doing this. And here’s what this clerk, you know, thinks about, like how much blood you can lose and it still be okay is what is the world that we’re living in. Leah Litman: Well, but it’s even worse than that, because that opinion is like I recognize that doctors, hospitals, experts and patients are telling me that abortions are required for some of these medical conditions like premature eruption of membranes. But I, Sam Alito, have concluded actually they’re not and -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: -- no evidence, right, to support that. Melissa Murray: Leah’s makes a great point about just the disdain for expertise and evidence. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: And in a way, I think this term in a lot of different ways showed the modification of the court, not just the Trump immunity cases, but in these cases involving the administrative state, just the disdain for expertise. I mean, this is a more genteel strain of Marjorie Taylor Greene refusing to call Dr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci, and saying that he has to be brought up on crimes against humanity. Like there’s a real disdain and — Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- distaste for anything that reeks of elitism when they are the most elite group of individuals in the country. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: But Justice Thomas likes regular people, Melissa. Melissa Murray: He does. He does like those Walmart parking lots. Leah Litman: And his RV. Chris Hayes: It is a quarter million-dollar RV that was basically gifted to him, which is the most amazing detail in the world. And also the documentary about how he likes regular people because he rides in an RV was also paid for by a rich guy, which is also an amazing detail. Okay, so you just mentioned, we’ve mentioned a few times, I’m talking to you the day after the court immunity decision in, I guess it’s Trump v. United States, right. And it was a 6-3 holding. Leah Litman: That’s King Trump to you, Chris. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Well, okay. So, this is something that I have more thoughts about than the other cases just because it’s more in the wheelhouse, but let me just start with one. I have a lot of thoughts. But one thought I had and I’d love for you to talk about this. Again, I’m a civilian here. I’m obviously legally adjacent. But one of the things that’s like galling is to compare what happened with the 14th Amendment cases in which it literally says in the Constitution, no one’s like debating this, that you can disqualify people from office for insurrection. It’s written right there in the 14th Amendment. And that doesn’t mean that that’s the end of the story because the courts we interpret and that’s what courts do fine. But the textual basis for it is like pretty damn clear. The court very quickly takes that case on an expedited schedule. It comes down with a, you know, split ruling, but on the holding unanimous, basically saying like, yeah, it says that, and yes, Colorado found that. But no, this doesn’t work. Then so when you compare the textual foundation to disqualification of the 14th Amendment to the textual foundation, the Constitution for absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, it just is ludicrous. It’s nowhere in the text of the Constitution. I went back and actually read Article II today to be like, what’s in here? Like what is given? And it’s like, yeah, sure. These are smart enough people that you can construct something about constitutional power and checks and balances and some analog to like immunity from civil suit, et cetera. Other forms of immunity that like officials enjoy, which it does exist and has developed in constitutional tradition and at common law, yada, yada, yada, yada. But in the end, like there’s no textual foundation. There is no textual foundation for this thing that they freaking made up yesterday at 10:30 a.m. And the way the court treated this argument with zero textual foundation to the way they treated the 14th Amendment argument with like very clear textual foundation and actual, as Ketanji Brown-Jackson, I think rightfully said, like real historical context, it’s just obviously we all know they’re not actually doing originalism. We all know that this isn’t a cover story. But man, if there was ever something for me that brought that home, it was that. Leah Litman: Yeah. I mean, if your question is why aren’t they principled in their conservatism, I could not tell you why. I think you’ve seen this in a lot of different places, like think about the Fischer case, which was the criminal law case about the January 6th rank and file — Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- defendants and whether or not that statute could be appropriately applied in the context of an insurrection on the Capitol. And this group of conservatives, all of whom are avowed textualist, meaning that they prioritize above all the plain meaning of the words in the statute, looked at the statute, which says that it is a crime to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding. What they really meant when they made the statute Congress -- Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: -- the purpose behind the statute was to prevent stuff like Enron. And, you know, that kind of context plus text analysis is usually what you hear from the Democratic appointees who are always trying to sort of think about things in a broader context. Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: And they get pilloried for it. Like that’s activism. Yet, in the context of this criminal law case, the court was all over the context, very little attention to the text. And, you know, managed to really undermine a number of cases brought against those rank-and-file defendants. Chris Hayes: This seems to me, Kate, this case yesterday, this was as bad to me as everything. Anything other than January 6th was the case — Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- as I read the opinion. And the only thing I compared to is Bush v. Gore in terms of like the sheer kind of power play that it is. But Bush v. Gore at least acknowledged in its own way, cynically, very famously, there’s a good for one ride only where the court, after coming up with this completely fakakta analysis of equal protection and why you have to stop the count so that George W. Bush should be president, says, now, don’t get carried away. This analysis doesn’t last after this decision. And at one level, I sort of would have been happier if they’d been like, look, we’re just trying to spring our boy here. This is not carried out afterward. Like if they had given the Bush v. Gore treatment, I think I would have felt better, you know. So, basically, how bad is it? Is it as bad as everyone’s saying? Kate Shaw: I honestly think it is worse. The more you read it, the worse it looks. So, obviously it’s a textual. As you said, Bush v. Gore at least has the equal protection clause to hang its hat on. There is nothing in the Constitution that so much as hints at the suggestion that an ex-president should be absolutely immune for anything, let alone maybe everything that’s plausibly official, which is what this opinion holds. So you have no tax to support this wild conclusion. Everything in our history points precisely in the opposite direction. Back to text, actually, not only do you have no tax, you have this very strong evidence on the other side, which is that legislators have explicit immunity granted by the Constitution. So members of Congress do get immunity. That’s what’s called the speech or debate clause. There is no analog that the president enjoys. So text, not at all on your side. History points entirely in the opposite direction. But at least in the 14th Amendment Anderson case about disqualification, you had a pragmatic argument that even though text and history actually seemed to support what Colorado had done in disqualifying Trump, there was at least a pragmatic argument that it would be too destabilizing to let individual states do what Colorado had done. So that’s what was driving the justices. Here, it seems so obvious that also every argument from pragmatism -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- and stability and democracy requires the denial of this kind of immunity. So you have that overlay, which makes this a significantly harder decision to swallow, I think, than the 14th Amendment decision. And you just have this coming at the worst possible time historically, right, where you have Trump running for election on a campaign, an avowedly anti-democratic campaign, promising to lock up his rivals. The court has just, it seems to me, given a permission structure for Trump to do everything in his wildest imagination he might want to do, but might have been somewhat constrained by the prospect of legal accountability from doing. All of that is now gone. It seems to me, not only a wildly wrong, but just an unfathomably dangerous decision. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: There’s one part of the analysis that I find also like so offensive. Well, there’s a lot of it. But this idea of you can’t investigate motive, which I think has been a key part of the sort of Trump era. And I remember someone I once had on the show had just made this great example once. He says, look, if a new mayor comes into town and his big thing is he changes garbage collection to be on Saturdays. Like, obviously, you could do that. If he does it because he wants to chase the Jews out of the town because he knows the Orthodox won’t be able to put their garbage out and then he can ticket them, that’s obviously not okay. It’s the same action, but obviously, the motive matters tremendously. It could transform a thing from perfectly fine to not okay. And that obvious, simple analysis that we apply in the law everywhere, all the time, to come in and say, in this case, for this only this person and for this narrow class of people, which is maybe three or four living individuals at any given moment, we just completely throw that out. And anything that’s constitutionally allowable there, you can’t question motive, which is part of the Roberts opinion. Like, it’s a really insane thing to say. Leah Litman: It’s totally nuts and it both dates back to kind of one of the earlier iterations of Trump’s power grabs and unlawful activity. And then I think it’s one of the most concerning aspects of the immunity opinion. So back in the early days of the Trump administration, when he fired off the Muslim ban that sent travelers into chaos and just upended -- Chris Hayes: Yup. Leah Litman: -- a lot of things, his administration defended it on the theory that you actually couldn’t consider why Trump had enacted this. And instead, the only thing that mattered is that presidents have extensive authority, right, to decide who enters the country. And the Supreme Court didn’t exactly adopt that, basically did and said, if there’s any reasonable way of understanding this Muslim ban as not being rooted in Trump’s very apparent and egregious anti-Muslim animus, then we will understand it. Now, I don’t think there was -- Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: -- a way of understanding it, divorced from that. But that is a way of minimizing the relevance of why he enacted that. And then you get this immunity decision that says you can’t probe an official act that is why a president do something. You can’t introduce evidence about the president’s and his advisors’ deliberations about why they did something. And that is effectively eliminating the ability to prove a crime. Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: Because for all crimes, you need to prove motive, right? Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: The mens rea, why they did something? Did they do it corruptly? Did they do it to advance personal gain? Did they do it right out of vindictiveness for retribution? If you can’t prove that, you are eliminating a prosecutor’s ability to prove a crime. So even if you can introduce some evidence, you’re effectively tying their hands on proving motive. Chris Hayes: There’s a difference between I swerved my car into that person because the truck was going to get me and I swerved my car to that person because I owe him $50,000 and I wanted him dead. Leah Litman: Right. Chris Hayes: Like, that’s the most obvious thing in the universe. We all understand this, even if we’re not lawyers, like we totally get it and to remove it here. There is something, Melissa, this is a question that, well, any you can answer. I’ll go to you first, Melissa. So, I saw a lot of people making this point and people were reaching for it in different ways. People reacting very strongly, obviously, to this opinion, I think rightfully so. Just like the weirdness of the court’s conception of the executive, which is like they love the president but hate the agencies. It’s like you can order SEAL Team Six to assassinate your political rival. You can, in a very funny and darkly funny example, in a footnote from Ketanji-Brown Jackson’s dissent, poison the attorney general to replace him. But you can’t like regulate smog. And just trying to sort of think through, like how the sort of admin law and agency jurisprudence fits with their view of executive power, or maybe that’s the wrong question even asked. But I did see a lot of people yesterday trying to kind of make sense of that as a whole. Melissa Murray: No, it’s a really good question. And again, I think the inconsistency of the conservative position is worth highlighting. You know, weirdly, they are arguing that the president, as the executive, cannot, through administrative agencies, do things like regulate smog. But the president, acting through the DOJ, which is merely an appendage of his office, can fire an attorney general who’s doing something that he doesn’t want done. Chris Hayes: Right. Melissa Murray: I mean, and it’s not prosecutable. It’s completely immunized. And so, you know, it is an imperial court and I think part of the appetite for limiting agency action is also about irrigating power to the judiciary. And that’s very clear in the cases overruling Chevron. You know, in the absence of a congressional mandate to do something, it’s not the agency that gets to decide. It’s the courts. And that’s a huge grant of power to the judiciary. And so you have this imperial judiciary also enabling and facilitating an imperial presidency. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: And if you think about the whole system of constitutional design, the point of the Constitution and the separation of powers is that you don’t want any one of these branches to consolidate power in a way that allows them to dwarf any of the others. And you have this court essentially creating a king and creating within itself kind of would-be kings. And what gets left out? Congress, ostensibly the most direct representatives of the people. Chris Hayes: Right. I mean, I saw a bunch of people make this point, which is true, is that like if you have any familiarity with the constitutional, like the convention, the debates about it, like it’s so obviously an odious view to the founders and to the constitutional tradition. Again, not telling anyone anything they haven’t heard before. Okay, so here’s where I want to kind of try to land this conversation and this is really important. And I tried to make this point on air last night amidst the pit of despair. And I’m going to make a version of it on my show tonight. But you guys are better equipped to make it. For me, it feels important to not, in advance, concede things that they are going to try to do. And what I mean by that is what I tried to say last night is if the President of the United States goes to the Department of Justice and says, I want Chris Hayes prosecuted and they open a prosecution of me, let’s hope that doesn’t happen, they’re violating core constitutional rights I have. Like I have rights under the Fifth and 14th Amendment that mean they can’t do that. And it’s and it’s not legal. And I saw a lot of people conflating. And again, I understand why they made this conflation. And I’m not trying to take away how horrible the decision is. But I do think it’s important to say that, like, it’s not like God is dead and all is permitted and because of the 6-3, you can do anything and you can order your death squads. Because to me, that feels like giving up the game ahead of time. We still have a constitutional order and that constitutional order is greater than the sum of its parts. It is embedded in a civic culture, in the constitutional decisions made by lawyers, made by the members of SEAL Team 6, who, like, honestly, I have an opinion of that I don’t think they would do that, honestly. And then weirdly, this is one of the arguments that Trump’s lawyers made before or argument. But my point is, when you look to 2020 to get back to this legal realism, the reason the coup didn’t work was that basically enough people who were lawyers and legally credentialed in some ways were like, this is nuts. I won’t do it. And I just don’t want to give up the fact that, like, that still exists and those norms should still be there. And these six people cannot tell us what the Constitution means and that we can have a king and a tyrant because we can’t. And they’re wrong and we’re right about the Constitution. And in some ways, all of us participate in the constitutional culture as much as they do. Kate? Kate Shaw: Yeah, I think that’s exactly right. And if one of the things this decision does is to kind of knock the Supreme Court off its pedestal -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kate Shaw: -- for a lot of people as the sole and final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution, that is, I don’t want to call it a silver lining, but that at least is something to seize onto because they can err. They erred terribly in this case, but they are not the only parties who participate in the forging of constitutional meaning and I think it’s right. Executive branch lawyers, members of Congress, lower court judges, civil society, like, you know, the individual subordinates inside the bureaucracy who might be getting orders of the kind that might issue from Trump, they all have an obligation to the Constitution to not an obligation to the Supreme Court. Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: And that is a hugely important distinction -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- to underscore. And I think it is possible to hold both of those two ideas that it is wildly dangerous for the court to have given permission to a malevolent actor to do the worst possible imaginable things. But I totally agree with the instinct that as bad as this decision is, there are ways to fight back. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And to me, it’s like it’s desperate. It’s like desperate defense of the worst outcomes. But I don’t want to go on TV and I don’t want to go on this podcast. I don’t want anywhere where anyone who’s like a lawyer, the DOD is hearing that like, well, assassination is now legal. It’s like, first of all, that’s not actually the holding of the court. Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Importantly, like it isn’t. It isn’t actually the holding the court. But that aside, it’s also not lawful. It’s also not right. And it’s a violation of your oath. And I just feel like everyone needs to understand that, that the court can’t change that because a lot of people I think we’re heading towards a period where like a lot of people are really going to have to come up the way they did in those very dark weeks in 2020 and 2021, you know, in all sorts of places. And I have a lot of faith in the American people and I’ve been very inspired. Like when I watched Rusty Bowers, even people those politics I actually really don’t like. Anyway, Leah, so I’d love for you, Leah and Melissa, to sort of give your thoughts on that. Leah Litman: I mean, one, I think there’s an important historical antecedent and pedigree for the idea that people who are in the executive branch in particular and hold other offices are not bound by the Supreme Court’s worst interpretations of the Constitution and law. You know, dating back to Dred Scott, you know, when the Supreme Court declared that black people could not and would not be citizens. Abraham Lincoln famously said, like the Supreme Court can resolve the rights of the party to that case, but they can’t force me, right -- Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: -- and my executive departments to refuse to treat black people as citizens. He issued passports to black people. And so there is a tradition of, I think, executive officers in particular holding true to the Constitution and their oath to uphold the Constitution even when the Supreme Court is purporting to allow them, right, to do truly morally and legally outrageous things. And second is, I think there are political and civic checks, right. So part of that should come as a response to the Supreme Court’s decision. Sure. Right. Maybe the Supreme Court says the president can’t be prosecuted for an assassination, but gosh, right, like there should not be assassinations and that idea is horrible. Right. We should reaffirm that idea. And we should also understand that this is partially what is at stake in the upcoming election, right, which is partially a referendum about do you want to elect someone as president who has basically promised to use that office to seek political retribution, exceed the bounds of the office, be a dictator? Or do you want to reaffirm the idea that maybe you want someone who believes that laws and morals should be a constraint on what officers should do? Melissa Murray: I think right now it seems really bleak because it is really bleak and, you know, I don’t want to, you know, blow sunshine toward anyone and then sort of minimize the fact that it’s really bad. I think one of the things that we can do going forward is to sort of center not just the court, but all courts and the way we think about our electoral priorities and recognize that this isn’t inevitable. It took a long time for it to get this way. Chris Hayes: Totally. Melissa Murray: It may take some time to reverse, but it’s completely possible. It’s completely probable. And, you know, I know that everyone is tired of getting told about voting, but it really is incredibly important, especially if you center the court as part of your electoral priorities. You know, Justice Thomas and Justice Alito will probably step down under a Republican president. That is what they want. And that means that this conservative supermajority will last for another generation and a half because they will surely be replaced by younger -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- even more extreme movement conservatives. Just maintaining what we have now and not becoming more extreme is a priority. And that doesn’t feel like a huge win. It’s hard to get people excited about stasis. But honestly, until we can make some movement, that stasis is much preferable to the alternative, which is to push this extremity even further. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And two things I’d say that just to sort of close here is one is I saw people reacting angrily to, you know, in the wake of the decision being like, Democrats are going to tell us to vote again. And it’s like, look, 55,000 votes across three states go differently in 2016, and we have a 6-3 liberal court. That’s the fact. Like everything we’ve seen was the votes were not there in those three states in that election that created the conditions here. The second thing is in terms of your point, Melissa, about stasis is like no one knows what the future brings and no one knows what the actuarial role of the dice will be for anyone of any age at any time. And so we don’t know. We don’t know. All we know is who will be empowered to shape the courts. And it’s like right now, it’s like the guy that shaped the Fifth Circuit and made the 6-3 court or the other party that has shaped the three justices in the in the minority in yesterday’s decision and throughout the federal courts as well. Leah Litman: Well, can I say something about that? I mean, I do think there is a role for activism to play here, too. And yes, there is one side that has a particular vision of the courts, and they’ve prosecuted it really ably over the course of Trump’s four years in office. Biden has been perhaps less focused on the courts. I think he is at his core an institutionalist. He’s not someone for whom the reform the court, pack the court -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- arguments has resonated really well. But I will say this. I wouldn’t have imagined that Biden would have been the guy to forgive student loans, and he did. Chris Hayes: Right. Totally. Chris Hayes: He did massive student loan relief, much of it overturned by the court. But even after that, he worked to find other solutions that offered student loan relief to a lot of people and it was incredibly successful. And that’s real money in real people’s pockets. I don’t think he would have gotten there if young people hadn’t been like, I am riding with Biden, but only if this happens. And so I think if you do care about court reform and you do think that it ought to be a priority for the Democratic Party, I think that this is the time to say so. Like, you know, my support is really conditional on you getting serious about this and doing something about it. And I do think it can be resonant because we did not start off the 2020 election with any of the candidates really talking about their plan for student loan reform and look how far we’ve come in just four years. Chris Hayes: Melissa Murray is a law professor at NYU. Leah Litman is at Michigan. Kate Shaw is at University of Pennsylvania. They co-host the fantastic, wildly popular “Strict Scrutiny” podcast, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts. It’s a really amazing way, if you’re into this stuff, to learn about the court. It’s incredibly funny and entertaining as well, and Kate, I love you. Great show, guys. Kate Shaw: Thanks, babe. Doni can decide whether to keep that. Melissa Murray: It’s a conjugal pod, people. Yeah, it is a conjugal vibe, for real. Chris Hayes: I’m just telling my wife I love her. I think that’s fine. Melissa Murray: I mean, but for me and Leah, it’s just like, sorry we’re here. Leah Litman: We’re still here, guys. Melissa Murray: Get a room. Chris Hayes: Once again, my great thanks to the glamorous ladies of “Strict Scrutiny,” including my brilliant wife. That was so fun. It’s so fun we do it. That podcast is really phenomenal. I definitely highly recommend it. I find it so useful just for my own understanding of the court, and you should check it out too. It’s available wherever you get your podcasts.

Team Trump pushes back against FBI’s Wray on assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:07 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ronny-jackson-pushes-back-fbi-chris-wray-assassination-shooting-rcna163840,"FBI Director Chris Wray probably didn’t intend to spark a controversy during his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee this week, but the Trump-appointed official managed to make some unintended news anyway. The trouble began when Wray testified that there’s some uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Donald Trump’s injury from the recent assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” the FBI director told lawmakers. That might’ve reflected Wray’s genuine beliefs at this stage in the investigation, but the comments were not well received. Congressional Republicans spent much of yesterday expressing outrage about the testimony. Last night, the former president — who’d already called for Wray’s “immediate” resignation — published a furious, 144-word condemnation of the man he chose to lead the bureau. This morning, Team Trump went a little further, issuing another written statement from Rep. Ronny Jackson, addressed to “concerned citizens of the United States.” The right-wing Texas Republican, after reminding everyone that he’s Trump’s former White House physician, wrote: Jackson went on criticize Wray, saying that Congress should “correct the record” in the wake of his sworn testimony. Referencing the recent attempt on Trump’s life, the letter added, “There is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet.” The congressman’s statement has been promoted via social media by both the former president and his campaign team. For the record, I find it very easy to believe that Trump’s ear was, in fact, hit by a bullet. What’s more, I’m not altogether sure whether it matters: A gunman tried to kill an American presidential candidate. Whether the projectile that hit the Republican was a bullet or some kind of shrapnel, his life was clearly in great danger, and the incident deserves to be carefully scrutinized with the utmost seriousness. I also think it’s fair to say Team Trump hasn’t handled questions about what happened particularly well. As we’ve discussed, for the first several days after the shooting, the former president and his political operation had surprisingly little to say about the medical care he’d received. What’s more, it wasn’t at all clear why they were being so tight-lipped about this. An Associated Press report noted last week that the public was “still in the dark over the extent of his injuries, what treatment the Republican presidential nominee received in the hospital, and whether there may be any long-term effects on his health. Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family.” Eventually, Team Trump issued a statement from Jackson — a scandal-plagued former White House physician with serious credibility problems — instead of from one of the physicians who actually treated the former president after the incident. Now, they’re promoting another statement from Jackson, as part of an apparent effort to push back against Trump's handpicked FBI director. Again, something hit Trump’s ear. Based on everything we now know, I’m very much inclined to believe that it was a bullet. But what’s baffling is why the Republican and his operation are so resistant to transparency. Jackson’s latest statement said he’s reviewed the relevant medical records from Butler Memorial Hospital. Terrific. Why not show those same records to the public and put an end to the speculation? What’s more, why not make doctors who treated Trump available to journalists, instead of relying on a controversial member of Congress? This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why LeBron James and Coco Gauff are the perfect Team USA flag bearers,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 26, 2024, 10:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/lebron-james-coco-gauff-are-perfect-team-usa-flag-bearers-rcna163245,"LeBron James is about to make history yet again. The 39-year-old NBA superstar, about to compete in his fourth Olympics, will be one of two flag bearers for the U.S. Olympic team in Paris on Friday. (Coco Gauff, the 20-year-old reigning U.S. Open champion, will be the woman athlete carrying the flag.) Surprisingly, James will be the first men’s basketball player to carry the flag for the U.S. As he is arguably the greatest player to ever lace them up, he is a fitting first. “It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together,” James said in a Team USA statement. “For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself, but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my teammates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations. Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I’m proud to be a part of this important moment.” Floating in a boat on the Seine in Paris while waving the American flag is indeed a long way from Akron, Ohio. James was voted to carry the flag by the other Olympians on Team USA. This is a vital detail, because the flag bearers are not usually the competitors with the most fame but the most game: the people whose athletic performances inspire documentarians for decades. But James, while certainly having the game, is a different kind of figure. He’s not so much an athlete as he is a brand, an institution, a corporation and a political lightning rod. It’s that last point that makes members of Team USA choosing him to represent them particularly significant. In 2012, James helped organize his then-Miami Heat team to speak out against the killing of Trayvon Martin by the self-appointed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. He has spoken out forcefully against police brutality and racism. He was perhaps the most famous voice to say “Black lives matter.” The choice of James is particularly fascinating when one considers the amount of time the GOP, Fox News and Donald Trump have spent vilifying him. In their minds, James refusing to uncritically “back the blue,” calling out anti-Black racism and defending the right of athletes to express their dissent by kneeling during the national anthem was proof that he didn’t love his country. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham infamously suggested that he “shut up and dribble.” We saw the same criticism lobbed at Colin Kaepernik, who was then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers. When he initiated the national anthem protests that inspired other athletes including James, Trump said he needed to “find another country.” James’ ventures into politics haven’t always gone smoothly. The NBA’s lucrative relationship with China is a topic James has fumbled, as his own financial entanglements have kept him from speaking out against the injustices of the Chinese government. But James has rarely, if ever, looked afraid to put himself out there. This has been in sharp contrast to the player against whom LeBron will always be measured: Michael Jordan. When Jordan was playing, he eschewed involvement in political matters. It must be mentioned that Gauff, who like James was also chosen by Team USA, has also been politically brave. She gave an extemporaneous speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in her hometown of Delray Beach, Florida, when she was just 16. And in a May interview with The Associated Press where she talked about preparing to vote for the first time, she sharply criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ leadership. She called it “a crazy time to be a Floridian, especially a Black one at that.” She said, “We aren’t happy with the current state of our government in Florida, especially everything with the books and just the way our office operates.” By selecting James and Gauff, this generation of young athletes — some of whom weren’t born when James began his illustrious career in 2003 — are rejecting the template set forth by the right wing that dissent, protest or even tolerance is inherently against the best interests of the country. Choosing James and Gauff is a rebuke to the forces of division. It’s a reclamation of the idea that marching forward is preferable to looking — and acting — backward. And it’s a rebuke of the idea that criticizing what’s happening in your country doesn’t mean you don’t love it."
Enthusiasm is Everything,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 9:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-enthusiasm-everything-rcna163846,"In a record-breaking week, Kamala Harris has united the Democratic party behind her, with significant momentum and grassroots support.  Former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri liken it to the energy felt in the Obama campaign, especially as online support grows organically among younger voters. They also take a beat to reflect on President Biden’s heartfelt address to the nation Wednesday night, and the legacy he leaves after decades of public service. Then, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz stops by, to chat veepstakes, explain the Democratic Convention rules, and highlight some important governors’ races to watch in November. And lastly, Claire and Jen dispel the myth of the vice president as a ‘DEI’ candidate with a reality check: JD Vance is the candidate who’s been handed everything he has.   Further reading: As promised, here is Governor Tim Walz’ winning hotdish recipe from the Minnesota Congressional Delegation’s Hotdish Off: Turkey Trot Tater Tot Hotdish. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Thursday, July 25th. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m here with my co-pilot, Claire McCaskill. Hi, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Hey, can you hear my voice? I’m another year older. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Everyone, it was Claire’s birthday yesterday. Claire McCaskill: So old. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s very exciting. Claire McCaskill: So old. I spent the day in the swimming pool with my three-year-old delicious granddaughter. Jennifer Palmieri: Betty Ann (ph). I met her in our prep call yesterday. Claire McCaskill: Oh, Betty Ann (ph) is a deal. I asked her if she wanted to go swimming with me, and she said, well, Cece (ph), of course. Like, you know, like she was 25, you know? Jennifer Palmieri: So cute. Claire McCaskill: So -- Jennifer Palmieri: And like, here’s an important development you might not be aware of. Claire knows this, I’m missing my parents, and I made a peach pie last night. Homemade crust, by the way, I always was terrible at it. Salt, fat, acid, heat. That is the best. You’re nodding. That recipe, even somebody like me who is not good at crust, you mix a phenomenal crust. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Well, it’s the season for peaches. I thought your pie was beautiful. And in honor of you, Jen, I’m going to make a peach crumble for dinner tonight, so. Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Love it. Claire McCaskill: There we go. Jennifer Palmieri: So since we spoke on Monday, Democratic coalitions continue to unite behind Vice President Harris’ bid for the White House, making her so far the unchallenged de facto nominee. We’re about 100 days out from the election, people, and the pressure valve has been released to her immense benefit. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, it’s not official until it’s official. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: But there is so much energy. I mean, we talked about this, and it was in an environment that was difficult and painful and hard. I know I irritated a lot of loyal Democrats by how I spoke about this election in those painful weeks between the time of the debate and the time that President Biden did, in fact, pass the torch. But this enthusiasm that’s been released is so powerful and it’s so fun. And we’ll dig into the latest about that energy. And then Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is going to stop by to give us the lay of the land on a few things, excitement in the party right now, sorting out the Democratic convention rules and the most important governor’s races to watch in November. Jennifer Palmieri: And before we wrap today’s episode, a quick reality check on this DEI attack that is coming on Vice President Harris. And this is something that I’ve done a lot of research on because I’ve, you know, written a couple of books about women leaders and people are trying to help the vice president and how they respond. There are some things people should know about the most effective ways to do that, that lift up the vice president and don’t diminish her because that’s what they’re trying to do. Also, Claire has a lot to say about J.D. Vance. And if there’s a candidate who fell out of a coconut tree and had their path paid for them, it is him. But wow, let’s take in where we find ourselves on a Thursday. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, 102 days is our best friend. I love a sprint. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s so good. This is so good. Okay, so Steve Kornacki reminded us that it’s only about 65 days until voting starts in some states because a lot of states have early voting, right? So that’s going to start in September. The excitement is it’s like 2008, but somehow more powerful because it’s condensed, right. Is that how it feels? How does that feel to you? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I agree. I think it’s a wonderful stew of relief tinged with sadness, but relief. And then there’s also, wait a minute, this is going to be so cool. This is so historic. We’re going to be able to fix what happened in 2016. And finally, we will look to the top leader in the world and it will be a woman. And how delicious is that that these guys are wanting to take us back to a time? I mean, J.D. Vance is one of these like, oh, it would be really important for men to be the sole breadwinner and women to stay home and all this stuff that is, my mother would say if she were still with us, I thought we handled that. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: You know, I thought we took care of that. So she’s taken the center stage with a really powerful message, too. It’s not just the organic we won’t go back chant that happened. Jennifer Palmieri: But let’s pause on that for a second, because it’s really important. You know, a few days ago I got asked from people on the outside, like, what kind of signage do you think the Harris campaign should be using? And I was like, I don’t know. I think something will probably organically pop that. And sure enough, she has a message about how, you know, we’re not going back. And a crowd picked it up, started chanting it organically. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Kamala Harris: We are not going back. Not going back. Audience: We’re not going back! We are not going back! We’re not going back! (END AUDIO TAPE) Jennifer Palmieri: As happened with President Obama’s campaign with “Fired Up and Ready to Go.” Claire McCaskill: Yep. Jennifer Palmieri: Started by one old lady. Claire McCaskill: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: In South Carolina. He was having a low day and she was like, fired up, ready to go. And that’s the same kind of energy we’re hitting here. But sorry, go on. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. So I thought her pitch perfect trolling at her very first rally as a presidential candidate. Let’s listen to how on point she was. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Kamala Harris: Before I was elected United States senator, I was elected Attorney General of the state of California, and I was a courtroom prosecutor before then. And in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type. (END AUDIO TAPE) Claire McCaskill: Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And then we’ve got this other cool thing is now we have a really old man who can’t put two sentences together on the other side. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s so true. I mean, it’s so true. Not that he’s ever made sense as a presidential candidate, but there’s definitely a change where he can actually string a couple sentences together. And there is something that I want to say specifically about the condensed timeframe that, again, a little historical perspective about women leaders that might not be obvious. So as people may know, America’s never had a woman leader. One of the reasons why people think that has not happened here is because we do not have a parliamentary system. Most countries that have had female leaders, they have a parliamentary system. And that’s different because we make our candidates go through a very long, drawn out primary process. In Hillary Clinton’s case, for example, we announced in April of 2015, obviously the election was more than, you know, almost 18 months later. In a parliamentary process, a woman leader is selected to head the party by a relatively small number of folks in the party. And then they’re presented to the country as the winner. Here’s the winner of our nominating process. And then you have a relatively short sprint. In the U.K. It’s only six weeks to an election, right. And so the problem for women leaders is, you know, in like in 2020, it takes a long time for women candidates in a big field to break through. We recognize the sort of potential of a male candidate sooner. Think of Buttigieg, Beto, Bernie, Biden in 2020. Right. That was sort of the story of 2020. Six great women running. They really never broke through. Nobody won a primary. Or you win the primary, but you come at it with a ton of having survived a lot of attacks. And that makes for difficulty in the general election. That’s sort of the Clinton experience in 2016. And so this is kind of an ideal scenario for electing a woman. Kamala Harris is being presented to us, not as someone who’s gone through a battered primary, but as the winner and a lot of excitement and relief about it. And, you know, Claire, it’s funny because some of the best, we’re going to talk about the memes, and, you know, if I were in the room, how you would continue to exploit them. Some of the best memes that are helping the vice president have been pointed out to us by the RNC, right? The Republicans. And it reminds me of Trump, right. In that, you know, in 2015 and ‘16, when other Republicans or Democrats would attack something about Trump, his supporters would be like, yeah, whatever. We like that because they just really had his back and he touched something deep within them that they wanted to support. And now that’s happening with her. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And if I were in the room, I would not overthink anything that’s going on right now because -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- I think there is a tendency of people who run campaigns. I’m not talking about you, Jen, but having been around a few that thinks that they know better than what may be going on organically. And this is an instance where the organic movement here is really paving the way for them. There’s a couple of key elements, as I want to talk to Governor Walz about freedom, the future and joy. I mean, I love it that the Republicans have made a deal about her laughing. I hope they do it all day long. I love it. I love it. And every woman in America knows that that’s stuff like that, that have been used against them unfairly. You know, we used to say husbands, hair and hemlines. Those were the three H’s that we had to deal with as women candidates. So laugh away and have joy and smile and laughter because the other side’s dark. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And the Bernie Bros are getting in the act here. Charli XCX, I think it’s a really good sign that something happened on this campaign almost immediately that I had no idea what it was. Who knew about Brat Summer? Jennifer Palmieri: Oh yeah, Brat Summer. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And my kids told me not to even talk about it. So I’m not because they said, it’s just embarrassing for you, mother. Do not go there. So I’ll leave it to the kids. But the point is that young people have enveloped this campaign online. Women are very excited. I think voters of color have a reason to be enthusiastic now. It really is a win, win, win, win, win. Jennifer Palmieri: And the other thing that is that, you know, it’s the positive stuff on the Harris side and then J.D. Vance in particular, really turning women off with this, like talking about childless cat ladies. That pissed off Jennifer Aniston. And so she weighed in to talk about how, you know, talking about IVF and how, you know, she hoped that his daughter would never have trouble having children because, you know, it’s something that millions of families, women struggle with. And I was like, all right, Rachel has entered the chat, you all. You have pissed her off. She is now engaged. She’s not someone who really engages a lot in politics. But that’s the kind of level of enthusiasm. But if I were in the room, I would make sure that you are not just saying, okay, this is great and engaging and letting a thousand flowers bloom. But you’re engaging these people right now to be like, okay, great. We have your attention. What are you going to do? Start asking people to do things, get them bought in, get them bought in on a schedule. Like, okay , week one, we’re doing this to register voters. Here’s what you need to know about registering voters in your state. This is happening on the convention. Here’s how you can participate in the convention. I know that the convention team is figuring out ways they can expand participation virtually to make it the biggest convention ever in terms of actual participation. And then, you know, what are you asking people to do when early voting starts, right? These are early days and I’m sure there’ll be days that are really tough for the Harris campaign, this doesn’t really feel like a sugar high. This feels like momentum and deep, real engagement. But harness all of that now and, you know, make sure that those people stay with you. Claire McCaskill: And grassroots fundraising. You know, the vice president talked about this. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Kamala Harris: And we just had some breaking news. We just had the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. (END AUDIO TAPE) Claire McCaskill: It is amazing that 60 percent of the donors in the first 24 hours had never given before. And keep in mind, when we talk about online donations, we’re talking about typically the online donation average is around $27. So we’re talking about a whole lot of people. And black women have organized online. When they have 45,000 black women on a Zoom call -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- that’s really exciting. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. All of that kind of organizing happened in organically, too. It’s amazing. Claire McCaskill: And I think we need to take a moment and listen to some of President Biden’s speech last night, which it was terrific. And I know how hard it had to have been for him and his family and his staff, but he nailed it. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Joe Biden: You know, in recent weeks, it’s become clear to me. I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation. (END AUDIO TAPE) Jennifer Palmieri: And what’s amazing, you know, did you see the photos afterward that they released afterwards? He got through that speech in the Oval Office surrounded by his family. I’ve seen a lot of president, you know, Oval Office addresses, but like, wow. What an incredible family moment. And also, just to pause, I’m still wrapping my head around how Biden is going to emerge in the history books as such a major political figure of the late 20th century, early part of the 21st century, elected at age 29. They called his campaign the Children’s Crusade in Delaware when he first ran for Senate because he was so young. And then, you know, goes on to become President of the United States and the oldest serving President of the United States, which means Joe Biden like eked every inch of his life out to do something important in public service. And, you know, it’s not just incredible that he was the vice president of the first black president and that he has passed the torch as president to who he hopes to be the first black woman president, but had an incredibly historic, productive presidency as well. So he’s just going to be someone who’s really appreciated and remembered. Claire McCaskill: His legacy will be legend. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes, legend. He’s such a legendary figure. Claire McCaskill: Yep. Jennifer Palmieri: People talk about LBJ and like the ability to work the Congress. And he has that plus all these other dimensions. So just really proud to be around when this all happened. Claire McCaskill: Yep. So we’re going to talk about if I were in the room in terms of the Veep stakes, because we’re going to talk about Vance in the last segment of the episode today. But I think it’s important for us to make sure people know who really is being vetted, because it’s going to happen quickly. It’s going to happen by the 7th of August, and it’s going to be one of the following names. Andy Beshear, who’s the governor of Kentucky; Roy Cooper, who is the governor of North Carolina; Mark Kelly, who’s the U.S. Senator of Arizona; the Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. And none other than Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Jennifer Palmieri: We will pause here. But speaking of Tim Walz, one of the nominees being vetted to possibly become the running mate, he is going to join us, Minnesota Governor and head of the Democratic Governors Association, Tim Walz will join us for his take on a new Democratic ticket and how the convention rules are getting worked out. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. As we mentioned, the energy in the party right now is just remarkable. The vice president’s entrance into the 2024 contest has buoyed what was a lagging, pretty sleepy campaign. And no one knows this better than Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Claire McCaskill: And we are thrilled to have him join us. Jennifer Palmieri: Yay! Claire McCaskill: The home of the hot dish. Tim Walz: The home of the hot dish. Hey, I won that contest three times. Jennifer Palmieri: What? Claire McCaskill: And by the way, you know what happened when you won that? Amy Klobuchar died a little bit inside. Jennifer Palmieri: Claire. Claire McCaskill: I mean, I’m just telling you. Tim Walz: Both of us are going to have hell to pay, Claire, because as you know, she is -- Claire McCaskill: No, I got to tell you. She is my dear buddy. But no one is more competitive -- Jennifer Palmieri: Mine too. Claire McCaskill: -- than Amy Klobuchar. Nobody in the whole world. Tim Walz: And I won it using Spam. It’s just beautiful. Claire McCaskill: Oh, I love that. Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: My family loves Spam. We do Spam grits. Tim Walz: It tells you a lot about a family. Claire McCaskill: There you go. Tim Walz: That’s all I need to know. Claire McCaskill: There you go. Jennifer Palmieri: Maybe we could link to Governor Walz hot dish recipe on the link in the show notes. Claire McCaskill: There we go. Tim Walz: I’m telling it to you (ph).  Claire McCaskill: Yes, we would love that. Tim Walz: It’s a hot dish recipe. Yup, we will. Claire McCaskill: We will do that. Tim Walz: There’s a cookbook out on congressional hot dish recipes. So you’ll be all fascinated. You know, our good friend Collin Peterson -- Claire McCaskill: By the way, just so everybody knows this. I mean, I love Governor Walz and I love my friend Amy Klobuchar and I love Minnesota. But that is just their way of saying casserole, just so you know. Hot dish is a casserole. So for those in Missouri, these are casserole recipes. All right. Tim Walz: There you go. Claire McCaskill: So Tim Walz is the Governor of Minnesota and Chair of the Democratic Governors Association and Co-chair of the Democratic National Convention Rules Committee. He has had a career that has enveloped public service from serving our country in the military to serving Minnesota students as a high school teacher and football coach. So you think he’s not ready for anything when you’ve been a high school football coach and a school teacher in high school, you are ready. So we welcome Governor Walz. Glad to have you. Tim Walz: Thank you. I also supervised the lunchroom. That’s where I gained it. Claire McCaskill: Oh my god. Tim Walz: Well, that prepared me for Congress. Claire McCaskill: I mean -- Jennifer Palmieri: I was ready to go. So, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Because everything is like high school, we say. It’s not fair to high school. We’re like, oh, everyone’s behaving like a high school, but really high school is just real life. Tim Walz: Oh, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: We hope to evolve behind it, but beyond it, but yeah. Tim Walz: You never close a yearbook. Never. That’s me, so. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my goodness. Tim Walz: Good to be with you. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, thank you. Claire McCaskill: So why don’t you talk first, Governor, about how this race, how the dynamics have shifted in the presidential from your perch on the rules committee, maybe make sure our listeners understand, because we try to explain things here -- Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- that this is not a done deal, that it was perfectly wide open to anybody who wanted to try to run after President Biden released his delegates. Tim Walz: Yeah. And I’ll take it first. You’re right. The dynamics of the race and look, Jen, you and Claire both know this was a challenging week emotionally and watching President Biden, who we adore, who we all know is effective and trying to show the dignity and the respect and not closure, but a transition. And I don’t know if we could have asked for anything better. His dignity, his grace, shifting it. The energy has blown off the roof. I think the only, in my analysis is, is this is mid Obama years, if you will, in terms of energy amongst the activists. And so that was all there. And this issue about the virtual vote, look, we did this and our rules are the same as they’ve been for decades. But COVID, we voted in COVID virtually because we all learned you could do some of these things. The real rub came on this when the state of Ohio, like Republican legislators across the country, have started to mess with the voting rules. And Ohio’s law says we have got to have wet signatures signed of our nominee into the secretary of state’s office in Ohio by August 7th. Well, our convention starts August 19th. So that in itself was one. And now there are people that said, well, you know, they said they would fix it. And to those people, I would say, if you’re trusting Republicans on the voting sanctity right now, that’s a bit risky. It gets worse and that Washington State is the 20th. So the process is open. What we did yesterday, and Claire, you’ll appreciate this. I got asked months ago to be the Chair of the Rules Committee. They said, oh, it’s just honorary pro-functional. You won’t do anything. Jen Palmieri: Excuse me Governor. I hate to interrupt, but I think it would help if you explain, because I think we kind of just jumped into this and no one has any idea. You’re like chair of the rules, the DNC rules and bylaws committee. Tim Walz: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: I think, are you there because you’re chair of the DGA? Tim Walz: No. No. Jennifer Palmieri: No? Oh, no. You’re just a nice guy and someone said -- Tim Walz: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: -- can you please take this? Okay. Tim Walz: Yeah. Totally -- Jennifer Palmieri: But explain what they get assigned to do -- Tim Walz: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- because I think it’s not a body we’re familiar with. Tim Walz: Well, it’s a good point. Yeah. And the chair of the DGA, this is really important. We have 23 Democratic governors. When you have a Democratic governor, you have reproductive access. When you have a Democratic governor, you have free school meals. When you have a Democratic governor, you’re dealing with climate change. My job is to be the chair of that, to elect Democratic governors in the 11 races this year, including Missouri. With Crystal and Mike, we got great candidates and we got Ashcroft down there that I want Claire to spend some dirt with me on this one, but that’s my job. Totally separate from that, the party apparatus has a convention coming up and somebody has to run the rules. Like, how are we going to vote? When are we going to vote? What do these things look like? And these are experts. These are people that love this stuff, but they need to have a chair. So Bishop Daughtry, who’s an expert at this, is a co-chair. Claire McCaskill: Leah Daughtry, yeah. Tim Walz: Yeah. She’s fabulous. Everybody loves her. But they asked me because it’s like an honorary thing coming from, you know, the White House. Well, little did I know now this thing became central because look, Claire’s right. Look, I didn’t know how this worked. And digging into this, there was a lot of misinformation that you’re not allowing people to vote on the floor. It’s the foundational thing that we do. Everybody who wants to get in should get in. And it felt like the system was closed. Now, what’s rich about this is Republicans talking about disenfranchising voters, you know, with pictures of January 6th behind them or whatever. It’s not that. And so, Claire, here’s how this works. What we finished yesterday was opening this week will be the process. We have 4,699 delegates. You got to get the majority of those to get the nomination. These are pledged delegates who were for Joe Biden who are now open to go to whoever they want. If you can go get 300 delegates before, I believe, the 30th, you’re able to bring that to the floor and you’ll get a vote if you can get that. So it is open. It’s the same way it would be done in person, but it must be done before August 7th to ensure ballot access, certainly in Ohio. And then it falls in quick succession, August 20th, Washington State, 22nd, California, 23rd, Virginia. So that’s what it was. It’s an open process. Anybody can get in. We’re going to vote virtually. And then we’re going to go to Chicago and do something that I think people worried about. We are going to celebrate and bring energy that blows the roof off things to celebrate Joe Biden, but to shift the torch to our nominee and presumptive nominee at this point in time is Kamala Harris. Jennifer Palmieri: If somebody wants to run, they need to get 300 delegates. Tim Walz: Correct. Jennifer Palmieri: By the way, delegates, to remind people. The delegates were selected by you. Tim Walz: Correct. Jennifer Palmieri: Because if you vote in the Democratic primary, well, I vote in the state of Maryland. You vote for Joe Biden. You’re really voting for an actual person delegate -- Tim Walz: Correct. Jennifer Palmieri: -- like actual delegate who will represent you in Chicago. And so if you wanted to run, you need to get 300 of those delegates who were elected by Democrats. Again, I’m just like building up the legitimacy of this process. Tim Walz: You’re doing great. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s almost like I did communications for a living. And then if you get 300 of these delegates to sign a nomination form -- Tim Walz: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: -- your name can be placed in nomination and you can compete for the Democratic nomination. Tim Walz: That’s right. Jennifer Palmieri: No one has done that to date. And the vice president has secured enough delegates are pledged to her now that we know she can be elected as the nominee on the first ballot that will happen virtually sometime between August 1st and 7th. You haven’t resolved what date yet, right? Tim Walz: That’s right. It’ll be open during that time, finished by the 7th. You should be a teacher. And also Claire would appreciate this. Superdelegates can’t vote on the first vote. So none of the 700 superdelegates will have a say. So it’s pledged into that. I think the unity that came behind this, but it is open, there is the opportunity, but I agree. I don’t think anyone will. And I think the good news is, is because we have a candidate that was there on the ticket with Joe Biden that is a known quantity that people are excited about and then we can get to Chicago and do the rest of the work. Claire McCaskill: I will just tell you as an aside, I know your pain about the Rules Committee. I remember after the election in 2008, I got a call, I think it was from Plouffe, somebody and said, Claire, we want you to serve in an honorary capacity on this committee for the DNC. And I said, oh, sure. And then a month later I got the call. Now here’s your job. We want to change the first primary away from Iowa. Tim Walz: No way. Claire McCaskill: And I’m like, oh, gee, thanks. Tim Walz: All my neighbors in Iowa still wanted to know who that was. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: Well, I’m going to go ahead and pass along your name, Claire. Claire McCaskill: I was the sucker. Okay. So we got to get this done. Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: You know, you were obviously being vetted for vice president, which is a tremendous honor in and of itself and we want to congratulate you on that honor because that is Joe Biden would say, is a BFD. So we don’t want to force you to talk about this, but we certainly want to give you the opportunity to address it if you would like. Tim Walz: Thank you. And I’m not going to share the internal or the personal things conversation, but I will say this. Just even being mentioned in that is the most surreal thing in the world. And I remind people, you know, less than 20 years ago, I truly am supervising that public school classroom with no intention to run. But I think now, and I’m saying this, I’m biased. I’m biased towards democratic governors. That’s why that list is full of most incredible people. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: And I will go back to it again. She cannot go wrong where she picks. And I say that because these are states that across the country that have protected reproductive freedoms, that have come up with real solutions on climate change, that are focusing on labor unions and middle class. It’s certainly, as I said, personally, it’s an honor, but it’s reassuring to me that Vice President Harris and the party, if you will, is seeing this ability to be able to compete across the board. And I think, again, the states and the people being mentioned make sense because we need to win them. But I just be candid with you. I think this map expanded. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: And I look at it as the 11 races we have as for governors, we’re going to win North Carolina. We have incredible Attorney General down there, Josh Stein. But their candidate is full blown beyond anything I can imagine. He makes Donald Trump look somewhat sane, and that gets really weird. But there are states like Missouri, there are states like Indiana, there are states like Montana. So what I would say about it is, is I think they’re focused on the right things. I think they’re focused on winning. That’s my concern. They make sure that when they get through this process, whoever that is, needs to be there to make sure that we win in November. Claire McCaskill: Where’s your best chances for pickups in terms of Democratic governors? I don’t want you to diminish any of the states, but why don’t you lift up for our listeners? Because we want everybody to help. I mean, governors are really important. I know. I ran for governor and then I ran for Senate two years later. Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And it’s a different exercise in terms of how there’s a national base for when you run for senator, not so much when you run for governor. Tim Walz: That’s right. Claire McCaskill: And people across the country need to realize they need to help out these Democratic governors races. Where would you highlight for our listeners to maybe send 10 or 20 bucks if they felt like it? Tim Walz: My heart is melting for Claire. I need to take you on the road for this because that assessment is exactly right. People who don’t know, say it’s a statewide race or whatever, it’s very different. Governors races are very localized and they don’t gain that. It’s very hard to gain resources. That’s why the DGA is so important. We are a key player in this. This is like the DSCC or the DCCC, but we do it for governors. Look, we have no incumbents. This organization has won 27 out of 28 of the last races, but we’re going to win in North Carolina, hold that seat that Roy Cooper’s in. We’re going to win and beat Kelly Ayotte, a former colleague of yours, Claire, up in New Hampshire. We’re going to, of course, hold Delaware. I believe we can play in much broader places. We have incredible candidates. Like I said, we’ve got Indiana, we’ve got Missouri. And I will just mention this in Montana that people need to -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I know that guy well. Yeah. Tim Walz: Sixteen out of the last 19 years, it’s been a Democratic governor. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Tim Walz: Democrats give up so easy. Oh, Montana’s stalled to red. John Tester is going to win, Claire. Don’t bet against that guy. He is going to win. And I think our governor candidate. So we’ve got some safe seats. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Ryan Bussey is the governor candidate there, he’s good. Yeah. Montana, it’s still a purple state. People don’t believe that it is. Tim Walz: It is. And they care about public lands. Claire McCaskill: They really do. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. It’s a big deal. We’re going to take a quick break, but stick with us because I think that Governor Walz has one of the best critiques I have heard yet of why the Trump advance ticket is not right for America. So stick around. We will be back in just a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Governor, we’ve talked about your role as chairman of the Rules Committee for the DNC, and we’ll look forward to seeing you in Chicago. And we’ve talked about your role as Chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and those important races. Let’s turn now to the mess that is known as the Republican ticket for president. That is Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Why don’t you give us your take on the strength or weakness of that particular ticket? Tim Walz: Oh, wow. The thing is, is that I come at this, I keep saying this, Claire, and you get it from Missouri. And, Jen, I grew up in a small town of 400 people. I said I had 24 kids in my class, 12 were cousins graduating. That’s small town America. And I said the thing that most irritates me and it baffles me and I think we can take this message back is a failed real estate guy from New York City that knows nothing about small towns and a guy who wrote a book that denigrates my neighbors and tells them that this is some type of cultural thing. I think the real message here is, is the reason that rural America is struggling more, and we’ve seen it whether it’s outsourcing of jobs, is because of Republican policies and people like Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist who cares nothing about those institutions there. If you’re in a town of 400, there are two institutions that are the most important to your town. That is the public school and a hospital or a clinic, if you have it. Both of those things are being gutted by the Republicans. They’ve been telling us for six and a half years they have a plan on healthcare, and that means taking away Medicare and Medicaid and reducing the ACA access. And they talk about privatizing public schools. And I think the simplest thing on this is, where do you think you’re gonna find a public school in a town of 400? Where do you think that’s gonna work? The great genius of this country was everybody gets an opportunity. Every community thrives. I had the best government teacher in a guy named Ed Pebble in a town of 400 with a small class, and now I’m the Governor of Minnesota. That’s the American story. Oh, we’re gonna privatize this and take the money out of our public schools. Let me be very clear. When you talk about private education, that means you gut the public schools, you send it to people already sending their kids to those schools, and you got it. So I think the condemnation of these people are they don’t know middle America. They don’t know who we are. Their policies do nothing to help them, and yet we know? You know, Claire, I represented a district that Trump won by 18 points, but that got tougher and tougher. You and I both saw this, that there was a transition in real time in front of us. I think we need to take this populist message, the economy, the freedoms. These guys aren’t for freedoms. Their idea of freedom is to be in your exam room, your bedroom. You know, banning books, we’re banning hunger. These are democratic policies. And I think the people in Missouri, I would argue, the people in Montana, doing those types of things make a big difference. What is Donald Trump offering? You go to these rallies, he’s talking about Hannibal Lecter. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: He’s trying to think up names. It’s stunning to me. At some point in time, I am convinced of this. At some point in time, this crumbles like the house of cards it is because there is no plan. There is no policy. And now they’re flirting with, you know, totalitarianism, Orban down in Mar-a-Lago, you know, no problem with Putin, none whatsoever. Those are the types of things that I think are all coming to a head. So look, this is a bad ticket on the other side. It is anti-union. It is anti-public school. It has no solutions on healthcare or climate change. And these are things that are in everybody’s life every day. So I’m very hopeful that the Harris ticket will bring that message. Claire McCaskill: You know, I think the freedom message, Jen and I have talked about this before, you know, we do a segment on this podcast often about if we were in the room, what we would be talking to campaigns about in terms of their ability to win in November. And I think the freedom message is so important. Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, that’s where people like J.D. Vance are so hypocritical. If you look at some of the votes he’s taken recently -- Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- and this is not some interview he did, you know, when he was in college. These are votes as a U.S. senator where he was one of only 28 senators to vote against a bill that would have restricted law enforcement from getting women’s medical records -- Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: -- which is just bonkers in terms of being anti-freedom. Big government is watching you. Big government is tracking you. I mean, in my state, they actually caught a person in the Republican administration trying to track women’s periods. Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, it is really, really scary shit. Tim Walz: It’s terrifying. Well, you’re in the right spot, Claire. I saw the new ad just this morning that came out from the vice president, and it’s freedom, freedom. And you’re exactly right. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: And I think their idea of freedom is very, very different. Very different. Claire McCaskill: Very, very, very different. Jen, what else do we need to cover with the governor about this race? Jennifer Palmieri: So, Minnesota, you know, prior to the sort of last round of polling, it was sort of reported that I guess that one of the reasons why President Biden in the end did decide to not run is that he saw polling from the campaign that showed even states like Minnesota, you know, people say, Minnesota is no blue state. I know. I know it is not easy to win in Minnesota. I know it’s not easy for Democrats to win there. It’s a very diverse state. Tim Walz: That’s right. Jennifer Palmieri: A lot of rural areas as well. You know, there’s big cities, but a lot of rural areas, the Iron Range, the whole thing. Tim Walz: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Like, I know it’s tough. But what were you seeing in Minnesota prior to the president dropping out and how do you think that this Harris nomination sort of upends the Trump and Vance playbook? Tim Walz: Yeah. Well, it was real. It is close. We don’t take anything for granted. I will, though, tout our record. We have the longest streak of voting for Democrats going back to ‘72. Jennifer Palmieri: Wow. I didn’t realize that. Tim Walz: Oh, yes. And every other state got it wrong in ‘84, except us with Walter Mondale, as you well know. But look, it was going to be close. It was there. But here’s the thing. Minnesotans vote in highest numbers, or either one or two. So, the universe is pretty predictable. Donald Trump’s floor and ceiling is the exact same thing. He’s going nowhere. He’s got his folks that they’re there. The issue we had was enthusiasm around the Democratic base. That is now gone. And so Donald Trump, you know, said he won in 2020. He lied. He said he was going to win in 16. ‘He didn’t. And so in hockey parlance, he’s going for the hat trick of getting his butt handed to him again this year. We will win. And I think the thing to keep important is all the money Donald Trump raises goes to Donald Trump. All that money goes to his funds, whatever he does. They do not have the infrastructure. They talk about it. Now, he’s coming out here. I tweaked him online, and apparently he was watching Fox News. So he’s now scheduled a rally out here. Here’s my thing. Come spend your money in Minnesota. Come pay your damn bill, though, if you’re going to hold a rally. That’s what I would say. Pay your bills, but spend your money here, because while you’re spending your money here, we’re building up in North Carolina. We’re building up in Wisconsin. We’re building up in Pennsylvania. So we’re going to win this thing. It’ll be close. We’ll take it to them, though. Jennifer Palmieri: Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, thank you so much. It’s delightful to meet you. You’re as fun as everyone promised. Yeah, we really appreciate your time. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, let me just say about Tim Walz. I don’t know who’s going to be selected as vice president, but, you know, give me a plain talking former public school teacher any day of the week from the heart of this country. It is not flyover country. It is the beating heart of America. So go, Tim. Tim Walz: Thanks, Claire. Thanks, Jen. Claire McCaskill: All right. Tim Walz: Good to talk to you. Jennifer Palmieri: Thank you. Claire McCaskill: See you in Chicago. Tim Walz: Yep. See you. Claire McCaskill: Okay. So we are now going to talk about the real DEI candidate in this race, who is J.D. Vance. You know that DEI is used by Republicans as shorthand. Well, it really means he’s not a white guy. DEI to them means anybody other than a white male, which is so bad. It undermines Harris to do this, and it tries to diminish her amazing qualifications. And the resume she has built through her effort, through hard work. I mean, you don’t win Democratic primaries in California without being tough as nails. And she has won a number of them against the odds, not only for D.A. of San Francisco, but Attorney General of California and United States senator. I mean, that was a really tough primary for her. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And she prevailed because she’s really good at public service. So let’s talk about how J.D. Vance. Jennifer Palmieri: Claire is going to tee off on J.D. Vance, which is excellent. But I’ll just add in here because, you know, again, like worked with a lot of people who’ve done research and polling and focus groups about the, you know, what’s really going on here and the best way to handle if you’re trying to be helpful. So, as Claire laid out, what’s really happening here is that Vice President Harris is far more accomplished, qualified and prepared to be president of the United States than either Donald Trump or J.D. Vance, okay. And also she’s electric on the trail and they are trying to do whatever they can to undermine that. And they know that in people’s minds, even though it’s 2024, we still have a lot of questions about women. People have different questions about female candidates and they do male candidates. And we have to be constantly reminded of women’s qualifications. So, you know, it may be true, but not necessarily helpful to be like this. These attacks on the vice president are racist and they’re sexist. It’s kind of diminishing of her. It’s kind of what they hope we do. It triggers all sorts of things in our brains. What is helpful to say is, you know what? The vice president is one of the most qualified and prepared people to ever seek the office. She was a prosecutor. She was attorney general, the largest state of the nation. She was elected senator of the largest state of the nation. She was elected vice president. And she’s been doing this job. She’s prepared to take it on. These attacks are not going to stop her. She’s been hearing this kind of thing her whole life. But you know what? Our daughters do hear it. Our nieces hear it. Young women hear it. And it’s harmful for them. And so that’s what I’m concerned about here. People don’t need to worry about Kamala Harris. She is going to be fine. But this may turn off black voters. This may turn off women. And by the way, it’s really destructive for these guys to be sending that kind of messages to our daughters. That is a great way for people to respond if you want to push back on this and do it in a way that, you know, frankly, inflicts as much damage as possible for the jackasses that are saying it. All right, Claire, go on J.D. Claire McCaskill: All right. So here’s the deal with J.D. The reason Republicans complain about DEI is they claim that that gives people positions that they did not earn, that they did not get on merit, that they got by a certain classification, either gender or ethnicity. That’s exactly what he did. And he admitted it in his book. And I’m quoting him, “The financial aid package Yale offered exceeded my wildest dreams. In my first year, it was nearly a full ride. And it wasn’t because of anything I’d done or earned. It was because I was one of the poorest kids in school.” So he got special treatment because of a status, not because he earned it. That’s how he got what he got. Okay, then fast forward. He gets out of Yale, writes a book that was notable, and I will give him that. But he’d written a book. And what does Peter Thiel do, this billionaire tech guy? He starts getting him hired in financial firms when he has no experience whatsoever doing anything in the financial sector. And they even admitted these financial firms said, I hired him because Peter Thiel told me to. Once again, he didn’t earn it. Peter Thiel gave it to him. And then fast forward to his Senate campaign. He wasn’t raising any money. And what did Peter Thiel do? Gave him $10 million so that he could win the primary for U.S. Senate in Ohio. Not only did he have 10 million, he then gave another 5 million. I mean, I ran for the U.S. Senate. I can’t imagine what it would be like to get a $15 million contribution. You know how hard you have to work to raise that money if you’re used to doing things on merit? This guy, Peter Thiel, has been carrying him piggyback style from the moment they had a bromance back when Peter Thiel attended a speech he gave. And it has been all Peter Thiel since then, not merit. So he is the DEI candidate. He is a guy who is where he is not based on what he’s earned. He’s been a U.S. senator for 10 minutes. He has no experience in doing this. He doesn’t know government. He wants to take away your freedoms. And he is a really bad dude. And he’s way out there. He’s way out there extreme. So here you go. Jennifer Palmieri: And like, also just to remind people of Trump’s lack of, I mean, Trump has served in one government position. He has won one campaign and he got impeached twice in the four years he had that because he was doing a bad job, okay. And J.D. Vance has won one race. He served as senator for 10 minutes, you know, versus Harris, who had almost 14 years as prosecutor and attorney general and then elected to the United States Senate and then four years as vice president. Claire McCaskill: She’s ready. Jennifer Palmieri: We don’t know her nominee is, her running mate is, but we know enough of the choices like that person is also going to be infinitely more qualified and prepared for this job than either J.D. or Donald Trump. Claire McCaskill: And by the way, the Republicans are now worried about J.D. Vance. Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Claire McCaskill: This was a delight, right? Jennifer Palmieri: All right. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Man, we are cooking with grease now, as my friend Donna Brazile would say. Thanks so much for listening.

A second Trump term would actively make climate change worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 9:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-climate-change-project-2025-proposals-rcna163426,"The videos first started appearing a dozen years ago. Pickup truck drivers, mostly young men, would modify their diesel engines and then record themselves deliberately spreading air pollution. It was called ""rolling coal,"" and the idea was to spew dark clouds of exhaust at bicyclists, Prius and Tesla drivers and other cars as a protest of environmentalism. The trend appears to have peaked in 2014, thanks to new state laws and crackdowns on people selling vehicle modification kits and, presumably, finding better things to do with their time. But the impulse behind it lives on, even as the risks of climate change become ever more serious. The most recent example? Project 2025, a set of conservative proposals from the Heritage Foundation that outlines step-by-step plans to remake the federal government in a second Donald Trump administration, including dismantling nearly everything the federal government is doing to fight climate change, making it dramatically harder to conduct basic scientific research on it and actively promoting more oil and gas use. Trump has tried to distance himself from the proposals, despite the fact that some of his top former advisers spearheaded it. But it's in line with his thinking. As The Washington Post reported, he told a gathering of top oil executives this year that he would reverse dozens of environmental regulations and stop new ones if they raised $1 billion to help him return to the White House. His campaign, meantime, targeted environmental regulations such as electric vehicle mandates in its Agenda 47, a scattershot series of videos outlining its plans for a second term. And at rallies, Trump frequently criticizes electric cars, claiming in one bizarre aside that buying one made his friend gain weight because he would eat at restaurants while it charged. Trump has also gone off on weird tangents about the risks of electric batteries on boats. In his first ""rolling coal"" term, Trump rolled back or loosened nearly 100 rules and regulations on pollution, many of which set the U.S. further behind in the effort to stop the worst effects of climate change, according to a tally by The New York Times. But that record would be dwarfed by the damage that the Project 2025 proposals could do if he followed through on them, even as Monday was the hottest day ever measured by humans, according to a European Union science agency. The 922-page document drips with disdain for what it calls ""climate alarmism"" that it argues is being used as propaganda for ""ineffective, liberty-crushing regulations."" But its most damaging proposal looks like it would launch what amounts to a propaganda effort against climate science. The first step is something called Schedule F, which would reclassify thousands of government workers, making it easier for the president to hire and fire them. Even if Trump were to fire only some of those workers, the shift toward politicization of lower-level government jobs would mean an exodus of experienced scientists. Those who remained might become more cautious about their research decisions to avoid trouble. The second step is to create a job that appears to basically be an anti-climate change czar. Project 2025 proposes creating a position of ""science adviser"" and six senior political appointees who would be charged with ""overseeing and reforming"" research at the Environmental Protection Agency, emphasizing that these political overseers should be hired for their ""management, oversight and execution skills,"" rather than scientific expertise. Imagine something like the final scene of an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" only with Trump hauling climate scientists into the boardroom to dramatically fire them. That may be exciting for the oil and gas industry and some of Trump's supporters but not for the two-thirds of Americans in a recent Pew Research Center survey who said they support the country's taking steps to become carbon neutral by 2050. (If you want to understand the depth of disdain here, the section on the EPA was written by Mandy Gunasekara. The Drilled newsletter points out she's in the famous 2015 photo of her then-boss, the late Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., holding up a snowball in the Senate as an attempt to disprove climate change.) The report goes further, proposing dramatically downsizing the National Weather Service and leaving weather forecasting to private companies. That could hamper its ability to issue public warnings about floods, hurricanes and other dangers, just as we are seeing more intense and frequent extreme-weather events due to the human-caused increase in greenhouse gases. That's not all. Other sections of Project 2025 propose ending subsidies for wind and solar power; cutting research into wind, solar and battery technology needed to help transition away from fossil fuels; ending federal mandates and subsidies for electric vehicles; and expanding drilling for oil and natural gas on federal lands. As Trump said in his convention speech, ""we will drill, baby, drill."" The efforts would not be limited to the U.S., either. A section on foreign aid proposes rolling back efforts to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuels, arguing that they are ""unachievable."" But then it goes further, arguing that the U.S. should spend taxpayer dollars persuading these countries to burn more oil and gas. The U.S. Agency for International Development, the proposal says, ""should cease its war on fossil fuels in the developing world and support the responsible management of oil and gas reserves as the quickest way to end wrenching poverty."" Taken together, these proposals would not just make it harder to fight climate change but actively make it worse. A second Trump administration would be rolling coal on the entire planet."

"Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris, throwing 'full support' behind her",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 8:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/barack-michelle-obama-endorse-kamala-harris-rcna163817,"Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 race on Friday. The announcement was posted to the Obamas' social media accounts, accompanied by a video of Harris — the current vice president and de facto Democratic presidential nominee — receiving a call from the Obamas offering their endorsement.  “Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend @KamalaHarris,"" Obama said in his post. ""We told her we think she’ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support. At this critical moment for our country, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you’ll join us.” In the video, Michelle Obama can be heard saying, “I can’t have this call without telling my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.”  In response, Harris thanked them for their friendship over the years. “And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she said in the video. You may have detected a bit of consternation online from people who wondered why this endorsement didn’t come sooner — perhaps, along with the wave of Democratic endorsements that immediately followed President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race. Barack Obama had released a statement soon after Biden announced his intention to drop out that didn’t make any endorsement. Its reference to Obama's ""extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges"" may have suggested to some that he hoped for a brokered convention scenario.  But a source familiar with discussions between Obama and Harris told NBC News that Obama didn't want to overshadow Biden's moment by issuing his endorsement before the president addressed the nation on Wednesday. Whatever the reason for the delay, the Obamas have offered their full-throated support of Harris now. In fact, aides to Obama and Harris have already discussed potential plans for the former president to join the likely nominee on the campaign trail, NBC News reported on Friday, citing three people familiar with the matter."
"U.S. politics are catching Olympic fever, but it's not all fun and games",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 8:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/us-politics-play-olympic-games-rcna163794,"With the 2024 Olympics officially kicking off Friday, politicos from Washington, D.C., and campaigners from around the country are starting to look for ways to stretch their own political muscles.

U.S. political campaigns are also riffing on Olympic themes in a slate of new ads. The Senate Majority PAC, an organization vying to help Democrats keep their Senate majority, uses various events to poke fun at Republican Senate candidates and highlight what a group spokesperson Hannah Menchoff characterized as ""out of touch"" and ""extremist"" policies. In an ad against Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, for example, announcers characterize Lake as a gymnast who's vaulted to the political fringe while taking dangerous positions. And the group's ad against Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde depicts him as a champion beach volleyball player who practices at his mansion in Laguna Beach — a reference to Hovde’s recent residency in California, which has become a campaign issue.  And Ohio Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes debuted an Olympics-themed ad of her own Friday that features Sykes, a former state champion gymnast who participated in the Junior Olympics, flipping off of a balance beam.  The massive platform that is the Olympics and the attention that it generates are already providing a rich opportunity for political power players to promote causes and people they support.

"Struggling to govern, House Republicans start summer break early",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 8:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/govern-house-republicans-summer-break-early-congress-capitol-hill-rcna163818,"House members have known for a while that their summer break was drawing closer — for generations, Congress effectively shuts down in August — but the hapless Republican majority hoped to get some meaningful work done before heading to local airports. At least, that was the idea. While the GOP leaders’ original schedule had members working next week, they decided not to bother. As NBC News reported, House Republican leaders canceled next week’s session “and sent lawmakers home for a six-week summer recess with little to brag about to constituents and voters heading into the final months before the election.” As recently as last fall, Johnson’s position was that House members shouldn’t leave town until the chamber had completed its work on all 12 of the federal appropriations bills. That was certainly a nice idea in theory. But in practice, the House’s Republican majority had passed only five funding bills — none of which can pass the Democratic-led Senate — and plans to take up four more this week fell apart. As Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida told NBC News, in reference to GOP leaders: “They can’t pass their own bills.” Looking ahead to the near future, a Roll Call report added, “The outlook is similarly grim come September, the focus will shift to passing a stopgap funding measure to avoid a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.” Ordinarily, ahead of Congress’ summer break, House leaders try to rack up at least some wins so that their members have something to boast about in their local districts. That’s clearly not the case in 2024. “Extreme MAGA Republicans have been in the majority for over 18 months,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement Thursday. “Can anyone name a single thing extreme MAGA Republicans in the House have done in order to make life better for the American people? A single thing that they have done? You can’t. ... You can’t name one single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans have done on their own to make life better for the American people. “They are incapable of governing.” The New York Democrat’s rhetoric comes roughly eight months after Republican Rep. Chip Roy delivered impassioned remarks on the House floor about his party’s legislative efforts. “One thing. I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing — one! — that I can go campaign on and say we did,” the Texan said. “Anybody sitting in the complex, if you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me, one meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done.” No one rushed to respond to Roy’s — or Jeffries’ — challenge. The point is not to point and laugh at congressional foibles. The point, rather, is to question what in the world House Republicans intend to say as they hope to maintain their majority in the chamber. A recent Punchbowl News report noted that they’re “struggling to figure out what — if anything — to tout this November.” When Punchbowl News asked “roughly two dozen House GOP lawmakers about how they plan to convince voters to let them hold on to the majority,” they had strikingly little to say. In fairness, Republicans could plausibly argue that with a Democratic-led Senate and a Democratic White House, the prospect for legislative breakthroughs were severely limited. That’s true. But it’s also true that GOP House members could’ve engaged in good-faith negotiations, embraced legislative compromises, and scored some meaningful victories they could take to voters in the fall. They didn’t want to. The result is a wasted governing opportunity and a blank slate where a record is supposed to be. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
I've helped secure 5 Olympic Games. Here's what's worrisome about Paris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 26, 2024, 8:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/olympics-paris-2024-security-threats-rcna163437,"UPDATE (JULY 26, 2024, 11:15 a.m. ET): French officials say a “massive attack” on part of France’s high-speed rail network disrupted service for hundreds of thousands of passengers Friday morning but that the attack has had no direct impact on the Olympic Games themselves other than inconveniencing rail passengers. As America continues to process the shocking act of political violence that was the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there’s another pressing security concern 4,000 miles away. The 2024 Summer Olympics begin in Paris on Friday and run through Aug. 11. Securing a Trump rally on a field in Butler, Pennsylvania, for a couple of hours proved to be a fatal failure, and the challenge of the Olympic Games makes Butler pale in comparison. The threat in Paris has already manifested in the form of arrests and disruptions, and the Games haven’t even started. During my FBI career and subsequent corporate security stint, I led or supported security plans for five Olympics. The Games play out on a global stage. An expected 15 million visitors are expected in France’s capital, including 2 million from outside the country. More than 10,000 competitors from 206 countries, including almost 600 U.S. athletes, will be there, and there will be billions of viewers watching on television and streaming platforms. The Olympics are supposed to transcend politics and bring the world together through peaceful competition, if only for a couple of weeks. But that large a bull’s-eye, with so much of the world paying attention, makes for an almost irresistible target for those whose causes are antithetical to peace. On July 17, French anti-terror police arrested a suspected neo-Nazi who allegedly planned to attack the Olympic torch relay. Prosecutors said the suspect runs a group called “French Aryan division” on the Telegram social media platform and was being questioned over death threats, hate speech and other postings. In May, French authorities disrupted a reportedly “Islamist-inspired” plot to attack Olympic soccer matches at the Paris Games. Police arrested an 18-year-old ethnic Chechen when they discovered the man exchanged encrypted messages with “known Islamists” and found photos and videos of the soccer stadium on his phone and computer. Prosecutors said the suspect intended to target spectators and police at Paris’ primary stadium. Paris is now on lockdown. Terrorism of all shades will be the primary security threat to the Games. The threat poses such a concern that the number of planned spectators allowed to watch the Olympic torch relay along the Seine during the opening ceremony was reduced in half, from 600,000 to 300,000. French authorities have already banned 4,000 people from even getting near the Olympic sites based on the potential threats they pose. The global threat level is already quite high in part because of the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Paris Games will only serve to heighten the threat level. Specific delegations to Paris will pose a greater security challenge in addition to the overall security plan. For example, the International Olympic Committee has banned Russia from being represented at these Games, but that doesn’t mean Russian athletes won’t participate. Only 15 Russian participants will be permitted and they’ll be identified as Individual Neutral Athletes. Russia is not happy with this decision and has been trying to keep people from attending the Games by stoking fears of a terror attack. There’s talk of a Russian cyberattack in Paris. The presence of 140 Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics further heightens the tensions and the threat picture in terms of Russia. Some of Russia’s athletes attending the Games are accused of violating the rules precluding them from supporting their nation’s war against Ukraine. Israeli athletes in Paris may make a particularly troubling target for terrorists, and will be protected by their own nation’s security agency, Shin Bet, even as they mix with and potentially compete against Palestinian athletes. As we cheer for our U.S. athletes over the course of the Games, let’s also root for a peaceful and safe Olympics. Regardless of which country wins the most events, I’m hoping that the French security services earn a gold medal, and that any would-be terrorists go home feeling defeated and disappointed."
"Why in the world does Trump keep saying, ‘We don’t need the votes’?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-keep-saying-dont-need-votes-election-2024-rcna163808,"You don’t need to be an expert in electoral politics to understand Rule One of any campaign: Candidates should pursue as many votes as possible. In a democracy, it’s common sense: The more votes a campaign has, the greater the chance of success. With this in mind, Donald Trump appears to have a counterintuitive rhetorical habit. The New Republic noted: As a clip from the show makes clear, the former president didn’t appear to be kidding. If the phrasing sounded at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. The day after last month’s presidential debate, for example, Trump held a rally in Virginia and told attendees, “We don’t need votes.” A week earlier, the Republican spoke at a far-right conference and said roughly the same thing. “I tell my people, I don’t need any votes,” said Trump, who added: “We don’t need the votes.” That came on heels of the GOP candidate pushing the same line during an appearance in Detroit. “Listen, we don’t need votes,” Trump said. He added: “We don’t need votes. We have to stop — focus, don’t worry about votes.” In fact, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the former president has been pushing this line since last fall, during his party’s primary process. “You don’t have to vote,” Trump told a New Hampshire audience in October. “Don’t worry about voting. The voting — we got plenty of votes.” At face value, all of this probably seems bizarre. In fact, I’ve never heard a candidate for elected office — in any race, in either party, in any cycle — literally tell the public, “Don’t worry about voting.” But making matters worse is the message behind the message. Despite the odd phrasing, Trump isn’t literally telling Americans not to cast ballots, he’s instead arguing that he’s so wildly popular, receiving support from voters will be effortless as Election Day nears. The real challenge, the former president invariably adds, is dealing with cheating and electoral fraud that definitely exist in his weird imagination, despite Trump’s inability to substantiate his conspiracy theories with evidence. In other words, every time the Republican downplays the need for votes, he’s necessarily emphasizing the need for unnecessary voter intimidation tactics."
Growing number of Republicans see JD Vance as the wrong VP pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-see-jd-vance-wrong-vp-pick-donald-trump-election-2024-rcna163788,"By all appearances, Democrats seem quite pleased with Donald Trump’s latest choice for running mate. In fact, Democratic officials and their allies have spent the last week effectively treating Sen. JD Vance like a pinata, eagerly reminding the public about the Ohio Republican’s weird far-right views. The question, however, is whether Republicans are equally satisfied. Donald Trump appeared on Fox News around this time yesterday, and co-host Steve Doocy asked the former president, “I’m sure you’ve seen there have been a couple of stories out saying they wonder whether or not you feel you made the right pick. ... You’re still 100% behind JD Vance, right?” The Republican nominee, not surprisingly, reiterated his support for his newest running mate, but the fact that a Fox host even felt the need to ask the question — a week after the party’s national convention — was itself extraordinary. It was emblematic of a conversation in GOP circles that the party didn't expect to have. The day after President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta wrote via social media, “[The] most striking thing I heard from Trump allies yesterday was the second-guessing of JD Vance — a selection, they acknowledged, that was borne of cockiness, meant to run up margins with the base in a blowout.” This was not the only such report. Axios reported yesterday that some Republicans are “second-guessing the former president’s selection,” with one House GOP member explaining that Vance “was the only pick that wasn’t the safe pick. And I think everyone has now realized that.” The same report quoted another House Republican saying the feeling withing the conference is that Vance “doesn’t add much” to the party’s ticket. The Hill, meanwhile, published a related report of its own overnight. The article quoted one GOP lawmaker who called the Ohioan “the worst choice of all the options.” Another told The Hill, “I think if you were to ask many people around this building, nine out of 10 on our side would say he’s the wrong pick. [Vance is] the only person who can do serious damage.” The latest polling suggests the senator’s intraparty critics have a point. As the young, far-right senator makes the transition to being a national candidate, Vance begins his effort with a negative favorability rating — a rarity for any modern running mate. Circling back to our recent coverage, the case for the Ohio senator has long been difficult. The 39-year-old Republican — the least experienced major-party running mate in nearly nine decades — has no accomplishments to speak of. He has a record of extremism on key issues. He comes from a state the GOP ticket is almost certain to win anyway. He actually hated Trump in the recent past. In his first-and-only campaign, Vance prevailed, but he also “underperformed every other statewide Republican on the ballot by a large margin.” And as the public was reminded at Vance’s first solo rally since joining Trump’s team, the guy doesn’t exactly radiate charm and charisma, either. But Trump picked him anyway at least in part because Trump assumed he was poised to win anyway. As the former president saw it, with an inevitable 2024 victory in hand, there was no harm in running up the ideological score, satisfying the MAGA base, and establishing greater control over the Republican Party’s vision for the foreseeable future. That, of course, was when the GOP nominee thought a relatively easy victory over Biden was at hand. As of five days ago, things are suddenly ... different. All of this obviously matters in an electoral context, but the developments also say a great deal about Trump’s judgment, and none of it’s good. CORRECTION (July 26, 2024, 2:57 p.m. ET): This post originally misspelled Steve Doocy's name. The above text has been corrected. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Harris mocks Trump after he hedges (again) on presidential debate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-mocks-donald-trump-election-presidential-debate-2024-rcna163777,"The first sign of trouble came on Sunday. Just a few hours after President Joe Biden announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term, Donald Trump quickly turned his attention to one thing: an upcoming presidential debate, which he suddenly seemed reluctant to attend. The Republican published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC in early September, and though Trump and his campaign operation had already agreed to participate in the event, the former president declared on Sunday that he instead wanted a debate on Fox News, instead of a network he described as “fake.” The second sign of trouble came two days later, when the GOP nominee doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later Tuesday, Trump told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate the likely Democratic nominee, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden.” The latest sign of trouble came last night. The New York Times reported: The written statement from Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign’s communications director, was weird, even by 2024 standards. It said there’s “chaos” in Democratic politics (there’s not). It said Biden is corrupt (he isn’t). It suggested Barack Obama opposes Harris (he doesn’t). It suggested it was necessary to use Obama’s middle name (it’s not). It said the opposing party is called the ""Democrat Party"" (it's not). It also said “many” Democrats want to nominate someone other than Harris (they don’t). But after combing through the nonsense, the bottom line was simple: Team Trump concluded that it would be “inappropriate” to “finalize” the existing debate schedule until after the Democratic National Convention. It led the Democratic vice president to respond with a simple and derisive message via social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” It came hours after Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’s only been a candidate for less than a week, and she didn't know why her rival was ""back-pedaling."" Harris’ mockery was rooted in fact. Trump spent the better part of a year begging for debates against Biden, and expressed total indifference to the details. The former president summarized his position in three words: “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” When Biden proposed a pre-convention debate, Trump was only too pleased to agree. The Republican’s position is obviously vastly different now. When we last kicked this around, it seemed as if there were a couple of possible explanations for the antics. One was that Trump was engaged in a mind-numbing “work the refs” exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff. The other possibility is that Trump and his team are simply afraid of how he’d perform against the incumbent vice president. All things considered, the latter explanation appears to be the accurate one. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Sonya Massey’s killing highlights the stakes of the 2024 election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/sonya-massey-police-accountability-trump-harris-rcna163741,"As calls for police accountability mount over the killing of Sonya Massey, the Black woman who was shot by a sheriff’s deputy in her Illinois home, I’ve thought about the stubbornness of police violence — how this issue can seem intractable and insurmountable, given how frequently incidents like this seem to occur. And as presidential election talk rages on, I think it’s natural for people to feel a bit helpless. To believe presidential elections don’t have much of an effect on policing at the local level. Certainly, not as much as races at the local and state levels. And but not for Donald Trump’s remarks about police, I’d largely agree with them. This election is unique in that he is vowing to use presidential power to influence local police departments — and in ways that could make it far more difficult to achieve justice for victims of police violence in the future. “We’re going to give our police their power back,” Trump recently vowed at a Wisconsin rally, “and we’re going to give them immunity from prosecution.” One could argue that Trump wouldn’t have any federal authority to do such a thing as president. But after the Supreme Court’s Trump-friendly immunity ruling, few things seem out of bounds, legally speaking. Trump has also vowed to indemnify police officers “against any and all liability,” seemingly meaning that police who mete out violence on the job — even deadly violence — would be even more shielded from lawsuits than they already are. And there’s a clear contrast here. Under the Biden-Harris administration, the Justice Department has taken the opposite approach when it comes to police. The DOJ has issued scathing reports on civil rights abuses committed by various police departments, like in Louisville, Kentucky, where officials are currently negotiating a consent decree with the federal government, and in Phoenix. It stands to reason that, as president, Kamala Harris would want a Justice Department similarly committed to police accountability. After all, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee has been outspoken about the Trump administration’s opposition to such accountability. And that’s a notable contrast as we consider cases like Sonya Massey’s."
Kamala Harris has 100 days to make history. Here’s why I think she can do it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-100-day-campaign-history-rcna163541,"In a little over 100 days, Vice President Kamala Harris needs to put together a campaign staff, develop her platform, decide on her strategy, approve advertising and prepare for a possible debate, among other things. It's a daunting set of tasks even when a nominee has months of preparation. But as her former senior adviser and chief spokesperson, I believe she is well-prepared to pull it off. It will not be easy, but it is doable. Look at what she's done so far. In the days since President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed her, the nonpartisan website Vote.org saw 35,000 people register to vote, 83% of them ages 18 to 34. The Harris campaign says it raised an earth-shattering $126 million in three days. The campaign also enlisted thousands of new volunteers, including in crucial swing states such as Nevada, Michigan and Georgia. On Wednesday night, the president appeared on national television behind the Resolute Desk to elaborate on his decision to leave the race and reiterated his support for his governing partner of nearly four years, saying she “is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.” The torch was passed, and now it is up to Harris to take it from here. The first hurdle to clear is reintroducing herself to the American people. Who is she and what does she believe? The campaign has responded so far by reaching back to her start in politics as a prosecutor who took on criminals and rapists, drawing a contrast with Republican nominee Donald Trump. She'll also most likely lean on her experience as vice president. From Day One of the transition, even before we got to the White House, Biden set the tone that his vice president would be in every meeting and she would get all the same materials he received. His directive was there would not be any “silos."" If for some reason we did not have something, all we had to do was ask. Just as President Barack Obama did with him, as their schedules allowed, they would have a private lunch weekly. Every day they were both at the White House, they would receive the Presidential Daily Briefing together. Biden set that tone and, in doing so, laid the groundwork for the surge of possibility and enthusiasm Democrats are experiencing.  Once in office, she was sometimes out of the spotlight, due to the nature of the vice presidency. Frankly, it’s a job few people pay attention to and that the mainstream media apparatus has not covered extensively. So people may be unfamiliar with Harris’ work as the chair of the president’s labor council or her work with the Small Business Administration to increase access to capital for small businesses, especially ones owned by people of color. They may not know her extensive foreign policy engagements with the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine or Central America.  More of them may have heard about her political work. It was the vice president’s emphasis on keeping the government from interfering with women’s bodily autonomy that helped lay the groundwork for the Democratic Party’s success in the 2022 midterms. Her laser focus on the root causes of migration — rather than focusing only on border enforcement, as Republicans tend to do — has helped envision a way to curb the crisis without obscuring the humanity of people braving untold peril in search of a better life. Even from the White House she’s set a record in Congress. As a result of the closely divided Senate, Harris has cast more tiebreaking votes than any of her predecessors. These votes were vital in getting some of the White House’s defining legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, over the finish line. It is a matter of historical fact that she has been one of the most consequential vice presidents the nation has ever seen. The second hurdle for her campaign is slightly more daunting. In order to win, Harris will have to claw back crucial base voters whom past Democratic nominees have been shedding in small but consequential numbers. Black women have been an indispensable voting bloc for the Democratic Party. While the vast majority still vote blue in every presidential election, their numbers have steadily waned since 2012. That year, Black women voted 96% for Obama, followed by 94% for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 90% for Biden in 2020, according to NBC News exit polls. We have seen similar drops among other key voting blocs. On paper, the percentage differences may seem small, but this is going to be a close race. Minor differences in these groups could make a difference in what will be a consequential election. The Harris campaign should treat base voters as persuadable. It is not a foregone conclusion that the diverse coalition of the Democratic Party will turn out simply because the candidate at the top of the ticket has been swapped out. When I worked for the vice president, she often stressed the importance of being straightforward and taking out the fluff. For example, instead of talking in general about the investments in small businesses, she would ask for specific numbers about how many small businesses in a particular state were affected and who they were. She was intentional about making sure people knew when they heard from her that she saw them and that the work spoke directly to them. That is one of Harris’ superpowers.  Beginning a successful presidential campaign roughly 100 days from the election is unheard of in modern American politics, but make no mistake, a lot of history can happen and a lot of odds can be beaten in that time. Allied troops in World War I began an offensive that would result in the end of the Great War 95 days later. In his first 100 days in office, Franklin D. Roosevelt laid the groundwork that would lift America out of the Great Depression.
