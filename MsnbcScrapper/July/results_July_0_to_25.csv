Jim Jordan’s latest crusade against ‘woke’ companies proves the GOP isn’t for free enterprise,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 4:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/jim-jordan-war-woke-companies-esg-rcna164605,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio is continuing his war on private companies.  Here on the ReidOut Blog, I’ve written a fair amount about Rep. Jordan and his use of the Judiciary Committee to pressure businesses to either invest their money in conservatives or craft policies that benefit conservatives. From trying to pressure social media companies not to curtail hate speech or propaganda, to trying to pressure advertisers to spend more money on conservative media platforms, Jordan has led a right-wing crackdown on industrial independence — which is blatantly hypocritical behavior coming from the purported party of “free enterprise.”  And Jordan isn’t finished.  On Tuesday, he and Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie sent letters demanding information from more than 100 investment companies that form a coalition known as Climate Action 100+. It's a group of investment firms that work to “ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take appropriate action on climate change in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize the long-term value of assets.” Basically, they make sure that companies they’re investing in abide by a set of climate-conscious guidelines. This kind of investment — known as environmental, social and governance (or ESG) investment — is a way for corporate financiers to prioritize issues important to them as they dole out money. And Republicans have tried their damnedest to demonize it and root it out.  For example, the X account for GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee announced Jordan and Massie’s probe of the more than 100 firms by referring to their coalition as a “Woke ESG Cartel.” Jordan and Massie’s letter alleges “the Committee has uncovered evidence that financial institutions are colluding with climate activists through initiatives like Climate Action 100+ to adopt left-wing environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related goals, potentially in violation of U.S. antitrust law.” It also demands each company turn over all documents related to their membership in Climate Action 100+, and answers to questions about how each firm encourages companies to comply with their climate goals.  So Jordan’s committee is essentially putting pressure on private companies for their work to curb climate change, and using a dubious report his committee released in June, which includes the “collusion” accusations, as a pretense to justify his meddling. The letter even references organizations that may have been scared into withdrawing from the climate-conscious coalition of investment firms.  It says: To me, this sounded like thinly veiled threats of a mafioso. Essentially: “These companies knew what was good for ‘em, and and avoided our wrath.”  To be sure, some of the companies that withdrew from Climate Change Action 100+ cited other reasons for pulling out of the coalition. But the committee's actions could very well have caused a chilling effect, more broadly. However you spin it, though, what we’re seeing here is yet another example of the type of government shakedown tactics voters can expect to be completely unleashed if Donald Trump and the Republican Party wield full control of Washington after November’s election."
"Arizona election officer, shunned by GOP for saying the 2020 race wasn't stolen, loses GOP primary",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 4:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/arizona-maricopa-county-stephen-richer-gop-primary-2020-election-rcna164552,"A Republican election official in Maricopa County, Arizona, who forcefully defended the integrity of elections in the county and as a result was shunned by some in his own party, lost his primary race on Tuesday. Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer lost the GOP primary to Justin Heap, a state representative who has cast doubt on election operations in Maricopa County but has not outright said that the 2020 election was stolen. Heap is backed by the state’s far-right Freedom Caucus, and he was endorsed by Kari Lake, an election denier who on Tuesday won the Republican primary for U.S. Senate. Heap will face Democrat Tim Stringham in November. Election officials in Maricopa County, many of whom bore the brunt of baseless accusations from Donald Trump and his allies that the 2020 election was stolen, have worked to make the election process more efficient and transparent to the public. Although Richer had not been involved in running the 2020 election and assumed office only after the right began its campaign of election conspiracy theories, he faced fierce backlash for rebutting claims that the election was stolen, including death threats and calls for his lynching from Maricopa County Republican Committee Chair Shelby Busch. (Several former Trump aides have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in the plot to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona.) Richer was also accused of election tampering in 2022 after some Republicans, egged on by Trump, amplified false claims of irregularities in the midterm elections. At the time, Lake blamed Richer and another county election official for her loss in the Arizona gubernatorial race. Richer sued Lake for defamation in June 2023. Lake has declined to defend herself against Richer's claims, and she asked a judge to determine the damages she owes him. In a post on X conceding the primary on Wednesday morning, Richer congratulated Heap on his win. ""Elections have winners and, sadly, losers,"" he wrote. ""And in this one, it looks like I’m going to end up on the losing side of the column."" Before he leaves office, Richer will administer the critically important elections in November, including the presidential race, in Maricopa County."

Trump's NABJ appearance was the train wreck many expected,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 2:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/nabj-trump-interview-panel-chicago-rcna164300,"Just as expected, former President Donald Trump’s appearance Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention came with a bevy of bigotry and lies.  His appearance — which took the form of a panel discussion with three NABJ members moderating — had cast a pall over the convention itself before Trump even showed up, to be honest. The organization faced a deluge of denunciations from journalists and activists after it announced it would give a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the free press, spread racist propaganda and repeatedly insulted Black journalists. In fact, NABJ has issued several statements in recent years denouncing Trump’s illiberal behavior and attacks on its members. NABJ announced ahead of the panel that no one in the audience full of journalists would be permitted to ask questions. And the composition of the panel — particularly, its inclusion of Fox News host Harris Faulkner, who has given Trump chummy interviews on a network that has helped spread Trump’s lies and paid a historic legal settlement for doing so — fueled suspicion that NABJ was giving the GOP nominee a relatively friendly platform to lie and peddle propaganda.  Before the event even started, Trump claimed on Truth Social that Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, “refused” to speak at the convention as he did. In reality, as news outlets and NABJ leadership confirmed, a scheduling conflict prevented Harris from attending in person. And it was NABJ leadership who refused to allow her to hold a virtual conversation with journalists at the convention. (NABJ said Wednesday that it is ""in talks"" to hold a Q&A ""virtually or in person in September."") When it came to the event itself, what many people predicted would be a train wreck lived up to those expectations. Though NABJ leadership assured critics that Trump would be fact-checked live on social media, the PolitiFact feed tasked with doing so didn’t catch all of his lies, and the panelists didn’t catch all of them in real time, either.  Trump began his appearance with a petulant attack on a moderator, ABC senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, who asked about his history of racist rhetoric.  “I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,"" Trump responded. ""You don’t even say, 'Hello, how are you?' Are you with ABC, because I think they’re a fake news network — a terrible network. And I think it’s disgraceful."" He went on to claim he has “done so much” for Black people. Predictably, he had glowing things to say about Faulkner, whom he described as a “fantastic person.”  Then came the litany of lies. Trump lied and said Harris “happened to turn Black” a number of years ago after decades of identifying only with her Indian heritage. Harris, of course, is an HBCU-educated Black woman who has known she was Black since she was a child, but Trump’s claims align with right-wing disinformation claiming Harris isn’t truly Black — despite her father’s being a Black Jamaican. He lied — as he did during the presidential debate last month and several times since — about an “invasion” of immigrants from jails and mental institutions taking “Black jobs.” (NABJ honors journalists from outside the U.S., too. One wonders how some of them felt about that claim.) He lied about Democrats’ stance on abortion, falsely claiming the party is in favor of being able to ""execute"" babies. He lied about the criminal cases against him, claiming they exist only because he's a ""political opponent of two people that have weaponized our justice system.” He lied and claimed those convicted for their actions at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, show there are “two systems of justice.” And when he wasn’t outright lying, he was doubling down on disturbing policies. For example, he was asked about his support for immunizing police from prosecution, in response to the recent police killing of Sonya Massey. Trump said the incident ""didn't look good to me"" yet still didn’t back off of his previous calls to protect police from legal accountability for abuse.  He said during the NABJ panel: This car crash of an event was forecast by NABJ members. It sowed distrust and animus among members toward NABJ leadership. It sparked a protest outside the event, an NABJ convention co-chair’s stepping down from her role and multiple speakers’ backing out of their planned discussions.  It also highlighted some of the broader internal debates that have raged within the organization. As the Columbia Journalism Review wrote in 2018, NABJ has faced divisions over shifting paradigms in journalism, pitting some older members and other traditionalists against younger journalists “attuned to the fast pace of new media.” That rift was at play ahead of this event, with some supporters of the panel arguing NABJ's tradition of inviting presidential candidates justified inviting Trump this year and critics of the panel arguing Trump’s tendency to lie with abandon — and the fact most of his illiberal views have been broadcast for nearly a decade now — warranted a departure from the norm.  I’m with the latter group. It’s fair for NABJ leadership to have suggested there are lingering questions about what a second Trump term might look like, but the group never adequately explained why Trump — a serial liar who has targeted its members — was best suited to answer them, let alone given the opportunity to do so without better guardrails in place."
What Olympics star Ilona Maher doesn’t have to explain to you about her body,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 2:47 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/paris-olympics-womens-ruby-ilona-maher-tiktok-bmi-rcna164574,"Ilona Maher is having herself a time at the Paris Olympics. The 27-year-old rugby player just captured a bronze medal after Team USA’s improbable win in the finals seconds of Tuesday night’s match against Australia — the first medal ever for American women’s rugby sevens. But even before the win, Maher had become a burgeoning social media sensation. Footage of her stiff-arming opponents has drawn comparisons to Baltimore Ravens star Derrick Henry, and her impressive TikTok account has gone viral with videos highlighting an endearingly quirky and honest personality. A consistent theme in Maher’s social media posts is her advocacy for body positivity, which is touted on her official Team USA profile. Last week, she posted a reel on Instagram stating that “all body types can be Olympians.”  “As the Olympics officially start today, I want you all to take a look at all the different body types on display,” she said. “All body types matter, all body types are worthy, from the smallest gymnast to the tallest volleyball player, from a rugby player to a shot-putter to a sprinter. All body types are beautiful and can do amazing things, so truly see yourself in these athletes and know that you can do it, too.” The reaction to Maher’s posts has been overwhelmingly positive, but she’s unsurprisingly had to deal with a few trolls commenting on her weight and Body Mass Index (BMI). One person in particular wrote, “I bet that person has a 30 percent BMI,” prompting Maher to respond directly with a candid message about her body. “I think you were trying to roast me, but this actually is a fact. I do have a BMI of 30 — well, 29.3 to be more exact,” she shared on TikTok. Maher noted that misperceptions about weight and athleticism are nothing new; in middle school, she received a physical that labeled her overweight. Today, Maher is one of the best women’s rugby players in the world. The notion that her body is in anything but optimal shape is absurd. BMI is also a famously flawed and inaccurate measure of health, a fact that rings even truer for athletes. This simple calculation uses weight and height to measure body fat, but doesn’t account for important factors like bone density and muscle mass. As a world-class professional, Maher has access to dietitians and medical experts, whom she says have told her it’s not a particularly useful measurement for athletes. In her TikTok post, Maher reiterates that she’s 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds — 170 of which is lean muscle. That gives her a body fat percentage of 15% — well below the 25-31% range considered healthy for average women who aren’t athletes. Maher certainly doesn’t need me, or anyone else, to defend her body to random people on the internet (who, as she points out, did not just win a bronze medal in the Olympics). But if anything, the Games offer a rare opportunity to witness and celebrate a truly diverse range of body types, particularly among women. Gymnasts are not built the same as rugby players; weightlifters look dramatically different than swimmers. Multiple Olympians across the various sports have talked about body image and how harmful the narrow view of what constitutes healthy bodies can be, especially for young girls.  Much of this conversation in recent years has centered around notions of what “feminine” bodies are supposed to look like; some female athletes have admitted that they avoid building muscle because they believe that looking overly bulky hurts their marketability.  But it should be noted that these conversations are by no means limited to women in sports. For years, ESPN the Magazine’s “The Body Issue” celebrated diversity in body types for men and women athletes alike. When Texas Rangers first baseman Prince Fielder appeared on the cover in 2014, his husky build stood in sharp contrast to other players who would be considered more traditionally fit. But Fielder deserved to be on that cover: A six-time All-Star, he was among the game’s most feared power hitters in his prime. Thankfully, notions of what a healthy body looks like are changing, even as Maher’s comment section proves they certainly still exist. Events like the Olympics are the perfect time to call out and celebrate the athletes and body types that we don’t often get to see on an international stage. For her part, Maher just used her “big, broad, beautiful shoulders” to stiff-arm her way to the Olympic podium."

Haniyeh, 62, was assassinated in Tehran after he attended the inauguration ceremony for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Hamas said.” * On a related note: “Israel warned that no Hamas leader was safe, but the assassination of the militant group’s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Iran’s capital has sent shockwaves across a region hardened by war and conflict. Not only did the strike — which Iran and Hamas have blamed on Israel — deepen fears of an all-out war in the Middle East, it has dimmed hopes for a cease-fire deal that could help wind down the catastrophic war in the Gaza Strip and ensure the release of hostages still being held there.” * Meanwhile, in Iran: “Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has issued an order for Iran to strike Israel directly, in retaliation for the killing in Tehran of Hamas’s leader, Ismail Haniyeh, according to three Iranian officials briefed on the order.” * In Ukraine: “Ukraine has received the first F-16 fighter jets that it has sought for months to fight back against an onslaught of Russian missile strikes, a U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press.” * Where’s our rate cut? “Federal Reserve officials said Wednesday that while there are signs the economy is slowing, it was not yet ready to cut its key interest rate.

Trump judge in Texas border case goes too far for far-right court,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/texas-border-rio-grande-james-ho-rcna164543,"As surprising as it sounds, the Supreme Court isn’t the most right-wing court in the country. That label better applies to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has gone too far in some cases that have led to Supreme Court smackdowns. So it doubly stands out when a 5th Circuit judge goes further than his colleagues.  That just happened in a dispute between Texas and the United States over the state’s installation of a floating barrier in the Rio Grande. By way of background, the federal government sued Texas over the move, arguing that the state had violated the law by obstructing the “navigable” capacity of the Rio Grande without congressional authorization and building the barrier without approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Ahead of a trial on the matter, the full Circuit Court sided with the state on Tuesday, reversing a trial court injunction that said the state had to move it. So the barrier remains for now. In an opinion by Donald Trump appointee Don Willett, the circuit majority decided that the trial court “clearly erred in finding that the United States will likely prove that the barrier is in a navigable stretch of the Rio Grande.”  Though the circuit sided with Texas, Willett’s ruling didn’t need to address the state’s far-reaching claim that it is permitted to erect the barrier in defense of a border “invasion.” The Constitution says that “No State shall, without the Consent of Congress . . .  engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.” And here’s where we get to the circuit judge who went further than his colleagues: James Ho, also a Trump appointee. The former Clarence Thomas clerk deemed it necessary to address the invasion question and he agreed with Texas, writing that the case “presents a strategic military decision directed toward a foreign enemy within the State’s authority” and that because the state’s claim presents a “political question” that courts can’t review, the case should be dismissed.   Ho’s opinion has been criticized from the right and the left. One of his Trump-appointed colleagues, Judge Andrew Oldham (who clerked for Justice Samuel Alito), wrote separately to explain why the court didn’t need to reach the invasion issue. Oldham noted that it’s “well settled that we should not reach constitutional questions if we can instead decide the case on a non-constitutional ground.” A dissenting opinion from Biden-appointed Judge Dana Douglas further pointed out that Texas’ position “would enable Governor Abbott to engage in acts of war in perpetuity.”  Ho is known for taking outlandish positions, so his opinion isn’t entirely surprising, however extreme its implications. But it’s worth considering because he has been floated as a possible Supreme Court nominee should Trump return to office in November — a scenario that could make the high court more like the 5th Circuit.

Kamala Harris practically dares Trump to debate her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 12:56 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-trump-debate-september-rcna164521,"Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, once again challenged Donald Trump to debate her, telling a roaring crowd in Atlanta on Tuesday night that he was feeling the pressure of running against her in November. ""So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it — you may have noticed,"" the vice president said at a campaign rally, as she pointed to Trump's refusal to commit to a debate in September. “He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.” “Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” Harris said. “Because as the saying goes, 'if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.'” Harris' remarks seem designed to taunt Trump into debating her. The vice president has been engaged in a back-and-forth with the Trump campaign as it dithers the GOP nominee's participation in a previously agreed-upon Sept. 10 debate, which it arranged with Joe Biden's re-election campaign before he withdrew from the race. On Thursday, Harris accused the Trump campaign of “backpedaling” on the scheduled debate, saying, “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage.” Trump's campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, later said it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.” The calculations for the Trump campaign have shifted dramatically since Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. Trump had previously challenged Biden to debate “anytime, anywhere, any place,” and the fallout of Biden’s disastrous showing at the June 27 debate also overshadowed his own blathering performance. Now, as his campaign tries to reorient its strategy for Harris, Trump, whose debate style is rich on insults and poor on substance, now faces the daunting prospect of taking on a former prosecutor known for her debate punches on live television. In an interview with Fox News this week, Trump himself waffled on the subject. He suggested there was no point debating Harris because “everybody knows who I am, and now people know who she is.” He then said he would “probably” debate Harris, but added that he “can also make a case for not doing it.”"
Harris' historic campaign builds on breakthroughs by other Black women,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 12:15 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-historic-moseley-braun-2024-rcna164343,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 29 episode of ""The Beat."" It was a whirlwind first week for Vice President Kamala Harris’ historic presidential campaign. The Guardian described her candidacy as a generational shift in U.S. politics.  Harris, of course, is no stranger to breaking barriers — she’s serving as the first woman vice president in our country’s history — but she's drawn from a range of trailblazers who laid the groundwork for this moment.  Geraldine Ferraro, a Democrat, became the first female vice presidential candidate on a major U.S. party ticket in 1984. There's also former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican Party's first female candidate for vice president. In 2016, Hillary Clinton shattered the glass ceiling when she won the Democratic presidential nomination. Shirley Chisholm was both the first Black woman elected to Congress and the first to run for president. Chisholm pushed her party, which has since come to rely heavily on Black voters, to take Black leadership seriously. Before ascending to the highest echelon of the Democratic Party, Harris was the only Black woman in the Senate. There was only one Black female senator who served before her. That senator was Sen. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, sworn into the Senate in 1993. Moseley Braun, who ran on a platform of women’s and civil rights, immediately challenged the status quo in Washington. In her first year in office, she defiantly took to the Senate floor to protest the renewal of a congressional patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, whose insignia featured the Confederate flag. “I’ve got to tell you, this vote is about race. It is about racial symbolism. … It is about our racial past and the single most painful episode in American history,” Moseley Braun told her colleagues.  Moseley Braun also challenged sexism in the Senate. She was among the first to buck the unofficial ban on women wearing pants on the Senate floor. Moseley Braun wore them repeatedly until the rule was changed. The feminist publication Ms. described that action as a “rebellion” and “a seismographic event.” On Monday’s episode of “The Beat,” I spoke with the former senator about Harris’ historic candidacy. Moseley Braun told me she was “over the moon” and “strongly supporting” the vice president. She also pledged to do everything in her power to help Harris make history yet again: “We have 98 more days to the election itself. We all have to show up and be there for her, take advantage and not let this enthusiasm dwindle. People have short memories sometimes. But if we can keep the drumbeat going, we can have our first woman president.”  Join Ari Melber, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its-kind live event.

Time to update the talking points: Border conditions keep improving,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 11:01 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/border-conditions-improving-trump-republicans-election-2024-mexico-rcna164538,"During Donald Trump’s Republican National Convention speech — which, believe it or not, was delivered less than two weeks ago — the former president spent a fair amount of time talking about conditions at the U.S./Mexico border. The GOP nominee, however, did not appear to have any idea what he was talking about. “We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and it’s taking place right now,” Trump said, adding, “The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. ... They’re coming at levels that we’ve never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them.” The comments were well received by his partisan followers, which wasn’t surprising: Republican voters have heard this message so many times that they assume it’s true, though reality tells a different story. In fact, as a CNN fact-check piece noted soon after, “Trump’s claim that the Biden administration is doing ‘nothing’ is incorrect. Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration.”  CBS News recently ran a related report, noting that the number of migrants unlawfully crossing the U.S. southern border “continued to drop markedly in July.” The same CBS report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that illegal border crossings were already falling earlier this year, but after the Biden/Harris administration implemented changes, crossings “plunged further ... reaching a three-year low in June.” To help drive the point home, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut added via social media that border crossings are now even lower “than in Trump’s last non-pandemic summer.” A New York Times report also noted last week that while the rhetoric from Trump and his party remains the same, “the reality on the ground has recently changed.” To be sure, conditions might yet change again, and there are a variety of factors that have contributed to the improved numbers. The bottom line, however, remains the same: To believe that “the greatest invasion in history” is underway at the U.S./Mexico border is to believe stale and discredited nonsense."
Justice Alito’s extreme approach reportedly cost him court majorities,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/alito-social-media-supreme-court-jackson-barrett-rcna164461,"Ever wonder how certain Supreme Court justices wind up writing the majority opinions in cases? After oral arguments, the justices discuss them and, if the chief justice is in the majority, he can assign the opinion to another justice or write it himself — as Chief Justice John Roberts did in the Donald Trump immunity case, for example. If the chief is in the minority, then it’s up to the senior justice in the majority. Against that backdrop, consider a new report that Justice Samuel Alito was assigned two cases this past term but couldn’t keep majorities together. That’s not unprecedented but, like Roberts’ reportedly aggressive handling of the immunity appeal, it can shed light on the opaque court as we review this past term and look toward the future. That new report from CNN, which hasn’t been confirmed by NBC News or MSNBC, states that Alito was assigned to write the opinion in a big social media case over red-state laws seeking to restrict platforms’ content moderation. CNN reported that Alito (who reportedly declined the outlet’s interview requests) “went too far for two justices — Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson — who abandoned the precarious 5-4 majority and left Alito on the losing side. As a result, the final 6-3 ruling led by Justice Elena Kagan backed the First Amendment rights of social media companies.” Alito also reportedly lost the majority in a case about retaliation for criticizing government officials, which resulted in an unsigned opinion from the court. The justice’s unyielding views are well known, whether in his public statements, rulings or related refusal to recuse from cases. So it’s not difficult to believe he couldn’t keep a majority in a given case. And to be sure, while every case is important, he has led Republican-appointed majorities in big right-wing cases with wider impact, most notably his Dobbs opinion overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022. In some respects, then, the report is as illuminating when it comes to other justices like Barrett and Jackson, who have gone their own ways in various cases. Among other examples this past term, Barrett didn’t fully join Roberts’ immunity ruling in Trump v. United States, while Jackson joined his 6-3 majority opinion narrowing obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants and Barrett wrote the dissent in that case, Fischer v. United States, joined by Jackson’s two fellow Democratic appointees. So their votes — especially Barrett’s, holding more power in the relative middle of the court — are worth watching, even if they don’t move the needle in the biggest cases on the Republican supermajority court, which can afford a defector here and there while still achieving goals that align with the Republican Party (as in Dobbs, where Roberts didn’t agree to overturn Roe but five other GOP appointees, including Barrett, did). Turning back to Alito, the report also reveals that the aggrieved justice “has reflected in private about retirement.” Presumably, he wouldn’t do so voluntarily under a Democratic administration. The 74-year-old is the second oldest sitting justice after 76-year-old Clarence Thomas. This reinforces the reality that November’s election has potentially dramatic stakes for the court’s future.

Why it matters that Mark Kelly is slamming Trump for killing a border deal,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mark-kelly-slamming-trump-killing-border-deal-election-2024-republican-rcna164519,"The current Congress has been dreadful for a great many reasons, but arguably the lowest of the low points was the fight over a bipartisan agreement on border policies. Months later, it’s something Democrats are eager to discuss anew. In case anyone needs a refresher, it was last fall when congressional Republicans said they were so desperate to deal with U.S./Mexico border policies that they took a radical step: GOP officials said that unless Democrats agreed to a series of conservative reforms, Republicans were prepared to cut off military aid to Ukraine and let Russia take part of Eastern Europe by force. Democrats, left with little choice, agreed to pay the GOP’s ransom and endorsed a conservative, bipartisan compromise. At that point, Republicans killed the compromise plan they’d demanded — largely because Donald Trump told them to. Making matters worse, the calculus was electoral, not substantive: The former president didn’t want Congress to hand President Joe Biden an election-year victory on one of the party’s top priorities. Republicans followed Trump’s lead and concluded that they’d rather have a campaign issue than a solution. As NBC News reported, some leading Democrats believe it’s time to refresh voters’ memories about what happened and why. “This was not meeting the Republicans on the 50-yard line, this was meeting them on the 10-yard line,” the Arizona Democrat said during an appearance on MSNBC. “On their side of the field, we realized, we’ve got to get operational control over the border. I realized this, Kamala Harris realizes this, and this legislation was going to do that,” he added. “And our goal here was to get this legislation passed and then start working on comprehensive immigration reform. But this was stopped dead in its tracks by Donald Trump because he wanted to have this as an election issue. Like a lot of other Republicans, they don’t actually want to solve this problem.” To be sure, it’s not a secret that Kelly is being considered for his party’s vice presidential nomination, and his comments Wednesday morning served as a timely reminder about his focus on a key issue in the national campaign. But whether Kelly makes Harris’ 2024 ticket or not, the point he emphasized this morning deserves to be at the center of the public conversation: Every time Trump and Republicans refer to conditions at the border, they should be reminded of the fact that they, at the former president’s behest, rejected a conservative border reform package — twice — that they co-authored and requested. What’s more, it’s not just Democrats who’ve accused the GOP of killing the bill at Trump’s insistence. The Harris campaign just released a new video via social media highlighting a variety of instances in which Republicans have conceded that the Democratic claim is true. The video didn’t include Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but the Kentucky Republican said largely the same thing in April. Kelly helped put all of this in the spotlight Wednesday morning, and no one should be surprised when other Democrats do the same thing every time Trump brings up the border between now and Election Day 2024."

Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hello and welcome to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday morning, July 30th. Oh, I can’t believe it, July 30th. It’s like, for those of us who teach, it’s only one month left for the summer. So, I’m Andrew Weissman and I’m here with Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. For those of us who teach and have a normal -- Andrew Weissmann: A day job. Mary McCord: -- 365-day-a-week job, it sort of just feels like another day. But you’re right, we actually start teaching also within a month, and it seems like we’ve barely even finished. So, that’s just the way. Of course, you know, my life since age 50 has been on fast forward. I don’t know about you, but. Andrew Weissmann: So, speaking of that, welcome back from Highlands, where we did our live show, it was really nice to see you. Like, it’s so funny, I always feel like I’m seeing you, but it’s really different when we’re actually in the same room. Mary McCord: It’s right. Days and days, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So, what’s on our dance card? Mary McCord: Right. I think, for listeners, we are continuing to see the fallout from the Trump immunity decision of the Supreme Court. We talked last week about the motion before Judge Merchan in Manhattan, brought by Alvin Bragg. We now, of course, have Alvin Bragg’s response to that, which we’ll talk a little bit about today. But really, the other big thing that got filed, it got filed on Friday, was Mark Meadows. Yeah, blast from the past now, indicted in Georgia along with 17 others as part of that RICO conspiracy case, has now petitioned for review in the Supreme Court, for review of the 11th Circuit’s denial of his motion to remove his case to federal court. Remember, this is a Georgia state case that he sought to have in federal court. And what we’ll talk about is how this is really just more and more of the fallout from the immunity decision. I mean, sure, he had that removal motion way before the immunity decision, but he’s now using the immunity decision as part of his petition. So, we’ll talk about that and then just get to a few things on our radar because there’s some things that are going to be coming up, schedules, things that we’re looking to in the next weeks and months. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, there’s some big things coming up, not just sort of 11th Circuit briefing and sort of our legal appellate side, but there’s the case going back to Judge Chutkan. So, that’s going to be a really interesting thing to talk about and sort of what we’re looking for. One quick note is this is a pat ourselves on the back moment. We don’t really do that, I have to say, which is kind of nice. Mary McCord: No, never. Andrew Weissmann: Never. Mary McCord: Sometimes we’re wrong and we just ignore that and we just move on. Andrew Weissmann: Although the immunity decision, I think we were pretty good about. Mary McCord: Yeah. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: What’s the phrase? We blew it? Mary McCord: Yeah, well, yeah. That’s still PTSD, so. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Okay, I’m triggering you already. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So, patting ourselves on the back, this podcast won and our whole team won another award and it’s Adweek’s award for best political podcast of 2024. And it’s so funny because you and I think probably don’t even think of this podcast as political. We really think of it as legal. Mary McCord: In fact, we tried pretty hard to make it legal and not political. Andrew Weissmann: I know. It’s like when we’re both on air, we’re really good about trying to studiously avoid sort of political commentary. But in any event, that’s a long way of saying thank you, listeners. Thank you, Adweek. It’s very flattering. And I know, Mary, I speak for you, which is if you’d said to us when we were left the government that we were going to be doing an award-winning podcast. Mary McCord: We would have laughed. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. It would have been something along the lines of, I’m not sure what you’re on, but I’d like some of that. Mary McCord: Right. I will say the description that Adweek had of the podcast doesn’t sound political at all. Andrew Weissmann: It’s true. Mary McCord: It sounds like what you do is you tune in to hear the deeper dive legal analysis of the case -- Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: -- which is why we’re here. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: It was a really nice, thoughtful description. Have we finished? Is it enough? Patting ourselves on the back. Mary McCord: Yes. My back is so padded that it’s getting sore. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. My shoulder is a little wrenched out from doing the patting. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So let’s turn to our first topic, which last week we talked about that there was briefing. This is a very live issue, which is the briefing in the New York criminal case where there is a jury conviction on the 34 felony counts. But there is briefing about the effect of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision because the Supreme Court, just to remind people, had said even in a case involving personal conduct where the crimes are personal, there’s an issue about what can be heard with respect to official acts by the president and can that evidence be introduced. And if you recall, the Supreme Court by a decision of five to four on this issue said that there are restrictions. It’s not absolute, but there are restrictions. And we sort of surmised what we expected. And that brief has now come in. Alvin Bragg has now submitted his very lengthy brief setting out the various reasons why the sentencing should go forward and why there’s nothing in the Supreme Court’s decision that should result in the convictions being set aside and there needing to be a retrial of the case. That would be the remedy if the trial judge were to agree with Donald Trump. Mary McCord: Well, except for one little caveat there, which is that, you know, again, in this swing for the fences motion that Donald Trump brought, he actually made a final argument that there couldn’t even be such a thing as a retrial because the grand jury would have considered official acts evidence and so essentially the entire indictment was tainted by that and should be thrown out. I mean, that’s a reach. Let’s just say that’s an extended reach. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: And I don’t think, you know, our greatest, tallest basketball player could reach that high. But nevertheless, he is trying -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes, right. Mary McCord: -- to get rid of the whole thing once and for all. Andrew Weissmann: Good point. Mary McCord: As we predicted, though, the district attorney comes in in his response to the motion saying, although the Supreme Court restricted the consideration of certain evidence of official conduct for which the president is immune, that ancillary holding, remember, ancillary to the primary holding, which is that a president cannot be prosecuted for official acts, that ancillary holding about evidence, the D.A. says is inapplicable here. And he says for several reasons. One is that the defendant failed to preserve an objection on immunity grounds to most of that evidence. And in fact, the D.A. goes back in history and gives the entire sort of recitation of the proceedings in this case, including the former president’s attempt to remove the case to federal court in part on immunity grounds, the federal district court judge denying that motion, sending it back to state court. This is a little bit of foreshadowing of what we’re going to talk about with Georgia, sending it back to state court. Trump’s team taking an appeal of that, but then deciding to abandon that appeal. So one issue here is you could have pushed this immunity issue and you decided not to, says the district attorney in his opposition. Andrew Weissmann: Can I just interrupt for a second just to make sure everyone understands? So this is like saying whatever the merits are of the claim. I started in Trump, but we’re about to get to that. Mary McCord: That’s okay. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But this is an issue of essentially, you’ve waived it. It’s like in order to make a claim now post-trial, the courts want to see that you’ve actually made the claim before and given the trial court an opportunity or there has to be a very good reason as to why you didn’t make the claim. And so as to most of these, the claims that Donald Trump made, the D.A. says it’s waived. In other words, you had the opportunity and you did not raise this. In fact, you abandoned it. That’s your point about when they went to federal court -- Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: -- they actually started to assert presidential immunity and then decided not to. And so the first argument is basically you did not make this claim below. You had an opportunity and now you shouldn’t be heard on that issue. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And then they go on to the issue of the merits. And that’s where I interrupted you. Mary McCord: Well, no, actually, there’s another one of those sorts of failure to preserve issues that one is you abandoned it and waived it in your federal court proceedings. But secondly, even in these state court proceedings, you failed to object to all the things that you now say should not have come into evidence. And again, part of this is about generally speaking in any trial, but in criminal trials, if you do not object to things before trial or during trial and give the judge the opportunity to rule on them, then your ability to bring those issues on appeal is restricted. And the way that it’s reviewed on appeal is different than if you had preserved the err. It’s not that you cannot get any review for most errs, but it’s something we call plain error review. If we really want to geek out, we can talk about the two different types of review. And so it’s harder to get a win or a reversal on something you did not object to earlier because the whole idea is, look, you can’t pull a gotcha at defendants. You can’t sit there; hope you’re going to win and get a jury to rule your way. And when you don’t bring up a whole bunch of things on appeal that you never gave the trial court judge the ability to rule on. It’s one of the just bedrock principles of defense in trying a case as you’ve got to bring up issues and let the trial court rule on them. Andrew Weissmann: And in next year’s course, we’ll cover plain error and clear error and the difference between waiver and forfeiture of a claim. Mary McCord: Forfeiture, yes. Andrew Weissmann: So that’ll be in next year’s -- Mary McCord: That’s true. Andrew Weissmann: -- criminal procedure class. Mary McCord: Yeah. That’s the 200-level class. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, okay. Mary McCord: Maybe the 300 level. And so the two things that he did object to, right, as Alvin Bragg says, the only two things that you objected to was Hope Hick’s testimony just with respect to her testimony about statements that Mr. Trump made when he was president and the admission of the Office of Government Ethics Form 278E, which is one of those forms that is about your financial statement form that’s required of all federal officials. Alvin Bragg says those are the only two things you preserved. Everything else you failed to object to. Andrew Weissmann: So on page 13, I thought that the D.A. gave a very good summary of the three ways in which the D.A. says that the remaining claims do not work. And I just thought it was a very easy to understand way of understanding what they’re saying about Donald Trump’s claims. The first is they say the evidence that Donald Trump complains about is unofficial conduct. It’s personal conduct. So you don’t even have to deal with the issue of how to deal with official conduct because they say it’s unofficial. This is personal stuff. The second argument is that even if it is considered official conduct, the presumption of immunity has been rebutted. And they say because reliance on such evidence in a criminal prosecution poses no risk of interference with presidential decision making, unquote. That’s argument two. And the third, which is one that, Mary, I remember you talking about just last week, which we were talking about tweets and the public forum that you just talked about. The third argument is, quote, “The evidence consists of a public record of an official act,” unquote. So those are sort of the three ways in which they say that they should win. Even if you disregarded the waiver -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- arguments or narrowed just to the two things you pointed to. But even if you ignored all that, these are the three arguments and they go through that, applying it to all of the different things that Donald Trump says came into the trial. And I just thought that was such a clean, easy way to separate this out. I thought it was a really good brief. I don’t know what you thought. Mary McCord: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was strong and I thought that, again, you know, what they needed to do is show Judge Merchan on each one of these categories of evidence that Donald Trump says should not have come in, make the argument not official, otherwise rebutted, otherwise a public record. And then they go on and show how each alleged error was harmless, including even harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. And so, you know, we don’t have time to go through because its very detail oriented in terms of going through each allegation of official acts and explaining why that wasn’t an official act at all. So, for example, Michael Cohen’s testimony before Congress about what he did in his capacity as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer to, you know, make this personal payment to Stormy Daniels as hush money to keep her story from coming out before election, how that was all personal and couldn’t be an official act. And you remember, this is something that Mr. Trump’s attorneys have argued in their motion that Cohen’s testimony about this in front of Congress was actually something that implicated Trump’s official acts. Andrew Weissmann: So the thing that you referred to about harmless error is sort of their final argument, which is that -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- even if you found against us on everything we just talked about, all three of those points and waiver, then we’re going to talk about sort of, is it harmless error? And that’s where Donald Trump made the argument that it’s both not harmless and also something called structural error. In other words, that harmless error analysis doesn’t even apply. And I think, Mary, again, you -- Mary McCord: Talked about this last week, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And a good example that you gave last week of what’s called structural error is you don’t have a lawyer in a criminal case. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And your example was Gideon v. Wainwright, which said that the right to counsel applies to the states, not just federally, but it’s sort of broadly applicable. That’s a structural error, meaning you don’t engage in harmless error analysis. You’re entitled to a lawyer. If there’s no lawyer, it doesn’t matter how -- Mary McCord: You can’t fix that. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. And it doesn’t matter how otherwise fair it is. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s sort of per se unfair. Structural error is very unusual to apply to something having to do with evidence coming in. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And so even for this Supreme Court, I mean, I think the immunity decision is horrendous and is result oriented, it’s hard to make predictions just because I never would have thought the Supreme Court came out this way. But it’s so hard to see this as structural error. Mary McCord: Oh, agree. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, allowing Hope Hicks, for instance, to testify about one conversation in 2018, the one -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- that we’ve talked about as being potentially the most problematic, that just isn’t structural error. Mary McCord: No. Andrew Weissmann: And it’s going to have a harmless error analysis. Mary McCord: Yeah, I’m not worried that any higher court’s really going to compare this to structural error, but you know, they may go through a harmless error analysis as to some of these things. And so what the DA does is he goes elaborately through, you know, the proof of every element of the charged crimes and why even if you keep out the challenged evidence, not just significant, and he says really overwhelming evidence to prove each element of the crimes that were charged and for which the jury returned verdicts. I will say one thing, and you probably noted this too. We’ve talked about this in the past, and I know that Mr. Trump’s team made a big deal about this in their brief, which is that the way that the prosecutors referred to Hope Hicks’ testimony in their summation, in their closing arguments, as, quote, unquote, “devastating.” And of course, Mr. Trump tried to use that to say, this almost say this can’t be harmless, because the prosecutors themselves said it was devastating. And that is dealt with in just a footnote in this brief, basically making what I think is the legally correct argument, that a prosecutor in argument making arguments to the jury about the evidence that really has not that much bearing on whether an error can be harmless or not. Because just because something might be devastating, they explained, doesn’t mean it’s not cumulative of other evidence that already supports the charges. And that’s their whole argument here, right? There’s ample, more than ample evidence to support the charges and there’s no reason to believe that this, the omission of Hope Hicks’ testimony or anything else challenged, made the difference for the jury. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Also, there are two parts to Hope Hicks’ testimony in 2018. And one part seems much less problematic than the other. And so saying that cumulatively, that there’s taking her testimony as a whole, it’s devastating, isn’t saying that the particularly most problematic part is devastating. So I think that the key here, just for to keep everyone so has this on their dance card, September 6, the judge has said he is going to issue his decision. It’s an unusual thing for a judge to announce when he will rule, but here he has. He said that he intends to rule on September 6. And so I suspect that he is going to deny Donald Trump’s motion. It is conceivable he would have a hearing. And then if there is a sentencing required, it is on first September 18. So keep that those dates in mind. Mary, let’s take a quick break and then we’ll come back and we’ll talk about some other things on our dance card. Mary McCord: That’s right. Mark Meadows. (ADVERTISEMENT) Andrew Weissmann: Okay, welcome back. So, Mary, we are going to talk about something that is definitely a blast from the past, which is Mark Meadows filed this week a petition in the Supreme Court to have reviewed the decisions from the federal courts in the 11th Circuit to not allow his removal of the state criminal case to federal court. And we’ll get into the details of that. But let me just ask you the first question, which was definitely the first thing on my mind when I was reading this, which is what on God’s green earth accounts for the fact that we’re in July and the 11th Circuit decision, not even the district court decision, the 11th Circuit decision was in December. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Again, as you know, I don’t do math in public, but December to July is usually a lot longer than you have the normal time you have to seek certiorari, that’s to seek review by the Supreme Court. So what explains this enormous delay? Mary McCord: Extensions of time. That’s what explains it. Extensions of time. Andrew Weissmann: And which justice would it be that did that? Mary McCord: And I don’t know if we’ve talked about this before, but the different circuits each have a justice assigned to them. And so that if you’ve got sort of motions for things like an extension of time and also other emergency motions, motions for stays, motions related to execution of death penalty, things like that, oftentimes when you’re making those kinds of motions, they go to the justice who is assigned to your circuit. For the 11th Circuit, that happens to be Justice Thomas. So Justice Thomas has agreed to extensions of time from the original, what the original due date would have been for a petition all the way to July 27th, which was last Friday. And, you know, one has to wonder possibly was Mark Meadows and his attorneys, were they waiting and hoping that somehow, they could benefit from the Supreme Court’s immunity decision and use that as fuel in their petition for a writ of certiorari? Andrew Weissmann: I actually went and did some homework and I read the applications for the extension. And in fact, one of the grounds was the pending Supreme Court immunity decision. And so that is sort of front and center of the actual petition -- Mary McCord: Yup. Andrew Weissmann: -- in terms of what it is that Mark Meadows is focused on and very much focused on this. Remember the part of the Supreme Court immunity decision that deals with the very, very expansive view of official acts, evidence like, you know, and they just have a lot of flowery language -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- about just how expansive you can view official acts, even if it’s something that doesn’t really seem within the normal purview of the presidents. Mary McCord: And this was about official acts of the president -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Not underlings. Mary McCord: -- just to be clear, that’s what that was about. But before we jump into all the substance, because I know we’re both dying to do that, I want to just make sure people know what the heck we’re talking about. So there is a federal statute that says that in any civil or criminal prosecution that’s brought in state court that is against or directed to an officer, the United States or any agency thereof, not relevant here, or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the United States, right, in an official or individual capacity for, and this is the other key language, for or relating to any act under color of such office. These are things that that federal officer can seek when criminally prosecuted, right, as a federal officer for things that he alleges were acts taken under color of his authority. So to official acts, the word is not official acts in the statute. The word is under color of such office, right? Then the person can remove the case to federal court. This is not an immunity statute. This is a statute saying when you’re being prosecuted in a state court and you are being prosecuted for something that you argue as part of your official acts, you can have your case moved to state court. And the idea behind that is so that if you do have some sort of immunity as a federal officer, you’re not relying on the state court to make judgments about your federal officer immunity. You have a federal court, which is perceived to be a more favorable forum or one that will take these claims of federal immunity more seriously and be a fairer tribunal than a state court. Now, query whether that sort of judgment about the fairness of a state court versus a federal court has any legs or is well-grounded or well-founded. Put that aside. That’s sort of the assumption underlying the law. It doesn’t mean you get federal immunity. Then if you do remove your case to federal court, if the federal court says, yes, you meet the qualifications of the statute, we’ll now take it up in federal court, then you would make your arguments. I shouldn’t be able to be prosecuted for this because I have immunity under federal law. Andrew Weissmann: And as we talked about when this was going on in the Pleistocene years, meaning last year, because it’s that long ago, this would just mean that you keep the same prosecutor, you -- Mary McCord: The D.A., still a D.A., not a U.S. attorney, right. Andrew Weissmann: -- you have the same and, you know, charges. But what you do have is you have a different judge and you have a slightly different jury pool. It’s sort of depending on how the veneer or the pool of jurors comes from. But it really is that you have this federal forum to decide the case, but it’s by no means saying the case is over. Of course, one thing to keep in mind is that people might be going, who cares? Because isn’t the Georgia case sort of on hold right now? And the answer to that is, yes, it is on hold because there’s a whole appeal at the state court level right now related to the alleged conflict of interest ruling by the trial judge with respect to Fani Willis that has now been appealed and the appellate court issued a stay. So that whole case is sort of on hold. But Mark Meadows has a sort of belt and suspenders approach, which is, yes, it’s on hold, but I still want to try and get to federal court. So he has made this motion. And, you know, maybe there’s sort of two key arguments he makes. One is he takes on the decision that has to do with when you describe this statute, this congressional statute, it seems to be worded to current officials, not former officials. And that was something that the 11th Circuit decided that there was an issue that it should only apply to current federal officials, not to former federal officials, and Mark Meadows was a former. So that’s sort of issue one. Mary McCord: That’s right. And just to kind of frame this up, the argument and the petition to have the Supreme Court take this is that this is the first time in 190 years that any court has held that this federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and that this is just wrong and the Supreme Court should fix this. I will note for the textualists out there that the 11th Circuit’s decision is a conservative bench and all three judges agreed to issue concurring opinions and we’ll talk about that briefly. But all three judges agreed if they look at the plain text of the statute, it just doesn’t apply to former officials, whereas Part B of the statute makes clear that it applies to former officials. And this is not Part B. This is Part A of the statute. So for those of you who may think about other textual analyses, particularly that the U.S. Supreme Court has engaged in in this past term, as well as other terms, this is a court that is saying, look, we think this is the wrong result in terms of we think Congress should actually fix this statute. In fact, two of the judges concur and say we think it’s imperative that Congress fix the statute to make clear that it applies to former officers. But the plain text of the statute, we’re just reading the words on the page, is in the present tense of a current officer. So that’s their first big argument. Andrew Weissmann: By the way, one of the things that I find fascinating is that Paul Clement, a very notable Supreme Court advocate who is on the brief for Mark Meadows, basically says, like, I know there are these concurrences that says Congress should fix it, but we figured there’s a shorter way that you can just fix it. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, this is so topsy turvy because this is what conservatives traditionally have accused liberals of doing, which is, you know, this is like the whole attack on Roe v. Wade is, oh, this is reading way too much into the text of the Constitution. And you have the current court basically throwing out its originalism doctrine when it’s needed. Mary McCord: When suitable, right. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, exactly. When convenient for them. So what’s the second issue? The first issue is just this one about, you know, the text doesn’t apply to formers, but then they go on to the second issue. Mary McCord: Right. But to your point on that, before I move to the second issue, is this is another place where they rely on the immunity decision, saying Mr. Trump is a former and there was no question that he was able to obtain immunity. Now, when we are mixing apples and oranges here, Mr. Trump wasn’t removing a case from state court to federal court and having applying a statute. There’s no statute that applies at all. Remember the immunity that the court found they found based on, you know, what they called presidential -- Andrew Weissmann: Policy. Policy and separation of powers. Mary McCord: I would say, yeah, constitutional principles, including separation of powers. So we’re not talking about the interpretation of a statute. Nevertheless, they rely on that. The second part is really more of an affirmance of the district court’s opinion. The district court had not denied the motion based on the statute not being applicable to former officers. It had gone through and said, you essentially have not shown that the gravamen or gravamen, we now know both pronunciations are correct. Andrew Weissmann: Either, either, tomato, tomato. Mary McCord: That’s right. That, you know, the heart of the case is about official acts. Mark Meadows, as chief of staff, yes, you had expansive, you know, authorities, but this was about state election administration and neither the president nor the chief of staff has any sort of authority over that. That’s not related to your official acts. Therefore, because it’s not related to the official acts, you can’t remove it. You will have to stay in state court. I will note, just because we didn’t say this earlier, even staying in state court doesn’t mean, oh, now you can’t argue you’re immune. You just have to argue it in state court. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. This goes directly to the issue flagged by Amy Coney Barrett. And this is where, to a large extent, it is a 5-4 decision on immunity, at least when it deals with the issue of the fake electors. And where Amy Coney Barrett says in a footnote, quite pointedly, you know, sometimes it’s hard to know and make a distinction between official and unofficial. And she goes, and sometimes it’s not. And when it comes to the fake elector scheme, it’s not. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So she would find that that is clearly unofficial conduct. And so, you know, it’s very interesting because this brief, if the court takes it, it both deals with the sort of application of the immunity decision to somebody who’s not the president. I mean, it’s not directly related, but also goes to this real conflict where Amy Coney Barrett is not with the majority on this expansive view of what is official. So it could be pretty fascinating to see whether the majority of five holds with respect to this, because here there has been fact-finding. Mary McCord: I mean, the federal elector scheme is a little different, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: But they’re comparable because we’re talking about pressure on state legislatures, pressure here on also the secretary of state in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, right, to reconvene the legislature and basically -- Andrew Weissmann: And this is one where, remember, the posture of the immunity decision was sending it. This is the great preview to we’re about to take a break and talk about Judge Chutkan. But the immunity decision sent it back to the trial court to have this factual hearing. But here, if people recall, there was a factual hearing where Mark Meadows actually testified and there was fact-finding by the federal trial court. And then that was reviewed by the appellate court. So there is a record for the conclusion that this was the acts that are unofficial or that are as a candidate. And this is going to be quite interesting if this case is taken by the Supreme Court. Mary McCord: Yes, it absolutely will. And, you know, like I said, it’s kind of like a dam bursting, right? That one decision has just led to a flood of other litigation. And we have to wait to see how courts are going to rule and what things are going to get to the U.S. Supreme Court. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. I mean, the first thing we talked about was the effect of the immunity decision on the Trump case. Now we’re talking about the effect of the immunity decision on Mark Meadows’ removal. I mean, by the way, I think it’s a totally intentional part of the Supreme Court in terms of what they were doing -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- like a giant bowling ball, like knocking down all these pins. Mary, should we take a quick break and then we can turn to actually -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- the third way that the decision from the Supreme Court on immunity could be affecting Judge Chutkan. Mary McCord: Absolutely. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, the floodgates are open now. The dam has broken. So what do we expect now by the end of this week, Andrew? The case, the D.C.-based January 6th case, the one that went to the Supreme Court on the immunity issue, that will finally actually get back into Judge Chutkan’s court by the end of the week. Andrew Weissmann: Just to remind people, there’s a normal delay that occurs when a case is on appeal to get it back to when the trial court can start again. And with the Supreme Court, it’s 32 days, I’ve learned. And so that’s going to happen this week, meaning that the district court has essentially the baton again to go forward. Mary, I know you’re going to say that the parties could actually seek to shorten that and I suspect that that didn’t happen here because the Jack Smith team probably was like, we do not want to ask the Supreme Court for anything. We want to just take our marbles and go home and not give them an opportunity -- Mary McCord: To say anything else. Andrew Weissmann: -- to delay anything. Exactly. Let’s just let the normal processes go forward, especially since there isn’t going to be a trial before the election. And so the main issue that we’ve talked about is Judge Chutkan has, I think, been essentially directed by the Supreme Court to have a factual hearing. Now, on certain issues, it may be -- Mary McCord: Well -- Andrew Weissmann: -- a law issue. Mary McCord: Yeah. I would say she’s directed to have briefing, right, on the legal issues and factual issues, which could include a hearing on those factual issues. I think that’s not for every issue based on the Supreme Court, but certainly for some of them, yes. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, exactly. So, I mean, they talk about the context. They just go on and on with respect to not the vice president stuff -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- which is the best argument that Trump has -- Mary McCord: Legal. Andrew Weissmann: -- for legal, but for other issues having to do with state interference, where they just talk so much and what happened on January 6th about the factual context. And they keep on talking about facts specific. And that to me is hearings. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So, I think we’re going to see briefing on that issue with Donald Trump trying to do everything and anything to avoid any sort of factual hearing before the general election. And again, kind of remarkable because if you have nothing to hide, what’s the big deal? I mean, put the witnesses on. I mean, remember, the witnesses are going to be to a large extent, if not exclusively, people who are part of his administration in one form or another, or at the state level, very much Republican allies. So, these are not sort of your normal deep state Democrats who I expect would be heard. Mary McCord: Yes. Just to play devil’s advocate, though, you know, we are getting very, very close. We’re, what, 100 days from the election, I think his argument will be. And I don’t think this is a crazy argument that, you know, this would be a very big distraction for the nominee for one of the two major parties. And, of course, in America, it really is a two-party contest. And that to have any kind of hearing, because remember, it’s not like this hearing is going to be Friday, right? There would be number of steps before a hearing. Judge Chutkan may this week, may not till next week, she may put out an order asking the parties to propose next steps. She might put out her own order saying, here is what I want for next steps. Here’s a briefing schedule. Here’s a hearing date. Or she could put out an order saying, come in for a status conference and let’s talk about next steps. So, first, you’ve got to kind of like the setup to what is going to happen. Then, at some point, a briefing schedule, like you said, a hearing schedule. And, you know, the briefs, you know, unless you do, there are two types of briefing. There’s the normal course, where one side puts forth its position, the other side opposes. The side that started does a reply, that’s sequential briefing. And then there’s simultaneous briefing. And that’s where both sides file at the same time. She could do that here. She could do sequential here. And either way, though, these take time. The parties have to, you know, write these briefs, they have to file them. Then she has to make some decisions. I suspect she may make some decisions, maybe now, but she could make some legal decisions before she even decides to have a hearing on the facts. She could be. She does it all at once. So my point is, by the time you get to a hearing, we are probably in October, really, realistically, maybe September. And I very, very strongly suspect Donald Trump’s team will say, this just has to be put off. I mean, he’s a candidate, it’s too close to the election, this would be an interference with the election. Andrew Weissmann: And to continue that motif of delay, there are other arguments. There’s lots of ways for additional mischief. Mary McCord: Sure. Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So they can make an argument that even if there is going to be hearing, what should the evidence be? Is it protected by executive privilege? What kinds of things should be allowed? Mary McCord: Is it official acts, right? She needs to decide what’s official or non-official, even to know what could come in at the hearing, right. Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So there’s that. There’s also Judge Cannon’s decision is, of course, not in any about Jack Smith not being legally appointed. That, of course, is not binding on Judge Chutkan. In fact, there’s a D.C. Circuit case saying that he is official. Mary McCord: Which is binding. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. But that can get raised to say, wait a second, you should wait and see what happens with that because we shouldn’t have a hearing and be required to go to this hearing, especially, as you said, Mary, at this time, et cetera, when there’s a real issue about whether Jack Smith is even legally appointed. In other words, there are all sorts of ways in which there’s lots of sand thrown in the Judge Chutkan gears. Mary McCord: You’re right. And on that last point, which segues nicely to our last thing we want to talk about today, they will say, I think, that, you know, notwithstanding this D.C. Circuit opinion on the legality and constitutionality of the appointment of Jack Smith, the issue is in the 11th Circuit now and you should wait for the 11th Circuit to rule and that could potentially go to the Supreme Court. So you should wait for that. And we shouldn’t have to go to your point through the hearing when we’ve got this live issue out there. So you’re right. That is more than sand. That is gravel and chunks of like boulders. Andrew Weissmann: So talking about the 11th Circuit, Mary, remember, Judge Cannon said throughout the Mar-a-Lago case that Jack Smith is not legally appointed. She’s the first out of nine judges who have held that. And the 11th Circuit has issued a scheduling order that doesn’t have the case even being fully submitted, doesn’t have an oral argument date, but it doesn’t have the briefing done until sort of late October, assuming that you have a government brief, a defense brief, and then a government reply brief. And so it is quite conceivable, if not likely, that the oral argument would not be until after the general election. And I have to say, in many ways, knowing that the Mar-a-Lago case was not going to happen, that that trial was clearly not going to happen before the general election, I’m not sure it’s such a bad thing for the 11th Circuit because in many ways, look, it’s better to have it decided afterwards and sort of without the heat of politics on it. And so the court can rule on it. It would have no effect because there was no way for Judge Cannon that she was going to have this trial. And the key issue that I am looking for, obviously, there is this substance of what Judge Cannon said. I think she’s wrong. I agree with the other judges. Obviously, I was part of the litigation team in the Mueller case where we argued for why it was statutorily correct. But I think the key issue is whether Jack Smith is going to ask to have Judge Cannon removed from the case for one reason or another. Mary McCord: Yeah. My money is that he won’t, but we’ll see. Maybe I’ll be wrong about that. And just so that folks know, this is not like a delayed or an extended briefing schedule. This is pretty normal. The due date for appellant, which is Jack Smith and the government here, is August 27th. Then there’s 30 days for the appellee, that’s Donald Trump’s team, to file their brief. And then 21 days after that for Jack Smith and the government to file a reply. That is a pretty standard appellate briefing schedule. And neither party, to my knowledge, and I did not just double check this, but neither party sought an expedited -- Andrew Weissmann: That’s right. Mary McCord: -- briefing schedule. And so no one should be thinking, oh, this is some sort of delay. This is pretty normal. And like you said, there’s not a reason to rush here. I mean, Jack Smith, to be clear, has never asked for expedition on anything based on the election. He’s very careful not to do that. He’s asked for expedition of other things like the immunity decision in the interest of the public, good in being able to get that matter to trial, never tying it to the election, but get it to trial sooner rather than later and not have delay. But here, there was no reason to try to expedite, and they didn’t do that. So yes, we will see if he adds and, you know, August 27th. We’ll see what he has to say. As you and I have discussed, there is also an option for this case to be re-indicted by the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida because Judge Cannon’s opinion was about the appointment of a special counsel, Jack Smith, and U.S. attorneys are presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed. There’s no question that they have the authority to bring cases like this, so that issue would go away. And it’s not mutually exclusive, like he can file his appeal, like he has noted the appeal already, file his brief, and it wouldn’t be Jack Smith again, the government could have a U.S. attorney re-indict the case, then of course, at some point, there’d be arguments that now the appeal is moot, so it shouldn’t go forward or things like that. But we haven’t seen any indication thus far that that other track is being pursued by the government. Andrew Weissmann: Mary, so nice to see you again. Mary McCord: It is. Andrew Weissmann: Even if it’s now virtual and not in person. Mary McCord: Yes, it is. And, you know, it’s funny how just a few days ago, as I was thinking, gosh, we don’t have a whole lot new, but kind of, yeah -- Andrew Weissmann: We do. Mary McCord: -- we always do. Andrew Weissmann: You know, it’s the law business keeps us very busy. Mary McCord: It does. Absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: So before we go, I want to be sure to invite everyone who’s listening to join my MSNBC colleagues and me for a live event.

Simone Biles celebrates Team USA's gold with a pointed response to critics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/simone-biles-olympics-gold-2024-gymnastics-vance-rcna164462,"Three years ago, when Simone Biles withdrew from the U.S. women's gymnastics team final at the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health, she faced a barrage of criticism, including from right-wing pundits who called her ""weak"" and ""selfish."" On Tuesday, Biles led Team USA to a triumphant gold medal after they scored a nearly six-point win over their competitors. In an Instagram post later in the day, Biles appeared to respond to critics, writing “lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions” alongside photos of her and her teammates Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera celebrating their win on the floor. Biles' caption appeared to be a pointed reference to her former teammate Mykayla Skinner's comments last month. In a now-deleted YouTube video, Skinner — who replaced Biles in the 2020 team final after she withdrew — criticized the team, saying “a lot of girls don’t work as hard.” “Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t like what it used to be,” Skinner said. “The girls just don’t have the work ethic.” She later posted a statement apologizing for her comments. The team's gold medal Tuesday was a victorious comeback after winning silver in the last Olympics. Several of the Team USA gymnasts had overcome significant mental and physical health issues in recent years: Biles publicly struggled with the ""twisties,"" which led to her stepping down from the last Olympics' team final; Lee, who won the Olympic all-around title in Tokyo, was diagnosed with two kidney diseases last year; and Chiles, who has grappled with the expectations in gymnastics, had considered letting go of the sport. Biles' withdrawal from the Tokyo team final, in particular, drew intense criticism from conservatives, many of whom jumped on the opportunity to turn her into a culture war villain despite showing no understanding of the rigorous demands of professional sports. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called her a ""selfish sociopath,"" North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson said she was ""weak,"" and JD Vance, who was running for the Senate at the time and is now Donald Trump's running mate, questioned why people were praising Biles for putting her mental health first. Biles, 27, became the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history with her team's gold medal Tuesday. So far, no word from her critics on that."
"Wednesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 7.31.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-campaign-73124-rcna164509,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * In Arizona’s closely watched U.S. Senate race, election denier Kari Lake won a Republican primary Tuesday, two years after narrowly losing the gubernatorial race in the state. * In related news, Reps. David Schweikert, Eli Crane and Juan Ciscomani faced GOP primary rivals Tuesday, and each of the incumbent House Republicans prevailed. * Arguably the most notable result in Arizona’s primary contests was further down the ballot: Stephen Richer lost his re-election bid for Maricopa County recorder, losing to a right-wing primary rival. Local Republicans punished Richer for telling them accurate information about the 2020 election results that they didn’t want to hear. * While Vice President Kamala Harris technically isn’t yet the Democratic presidential nominee, her odds appear quite good: When the Democratic National Committee holds its virtual roll call, Harris will be the only name on the ballot. * In related news, we don’t yet know who Harris’ running mate will be, but the incumbent vice president has already scheduled a rally in Philadelphia for Tuesday, and she’ll share the stage with her choice. * Before President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll found Donald Trump ahead in each of the nation’s most competitive battleground states. A new Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll, however, shows Harris leading Trump, 48% to 47%, across these seven states. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * Ahead of Missouri’s primaries next week, Trump has endorsed both of the GOP’s state attorney general candidates and all three of the party’s gubernatorial candidates. * In Minnesota, the latest KSTP/SurveyUSA poll found incumbent Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar leading both of her Republican rivals by more than 20 points. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * And in case California’s 2026 gubernatorial race weren’t already crowded, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced last week that he’s running, too. This will be the Democrat’s second attempt at the office: Villaraigosa lost to Gov. Gavin Newsom six years ago."
‘Coup’ doesn’t mean what Republicans seem to think it means,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 8:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/coup-doesnt-mean-republicans-think-means-vance-biden-election-2024-rcna164492,"After President Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid, Republicans did little to hide their disappointment — GOP officials were convinced the Democratic incumbent was likely to lose — and some tried to turn the development into some kind of scandal. Sen. Tom Cotton, for example, insisted that Biden “succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors.” Pressed for an explanation, the Arkansas Republican struggled to defend his own over-the-top nonsense, but others in the party have nevertheless echoed the rhetoric. Take Donald Trump’s running mate, for example. The Washington Post reported: “The media ... for years has said the Republicans are a threat to democracy,” Vance told a Nevada audience. “They’re calling it a coronation [of Harris]. I’ve got a different word for it: I call it a coup.” So, a few things. First, as we discussed last week, we already have a good idea as to what a “coup” is. Merriam-Webster’s definition is as good as any: “a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics and especially the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group.” To think this applies to an incumbent president voluntarily withdrawing from a re-election campaign is obviously bad-faith nonsense. I realize that Vance is new to all of this — his career in elected office began last year — but incumbents retire all of the time. It’s perfectly normal. When they retire at the urging of allies, it doesn’t suddenly transform into a rebellion. Second, if Republicans like Vance and Cotton are looking for evidence of developments that actually resemble a coup, perhaps they should turn their attention to Trump’s Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol? As a recent Washington Post analysis concluded, after Trump’s 2020 defeat, the Republican “tried to cheat Biden voters in those five states out of their choice. He tried to short-circuit the effort to count electors. And then he suggested that the furious crowd near the White House direct their anger at the Capitol. It’s useful for Trump’s allies to pretend that Biden’s decision was comparable. It isn’t.” But at the heart of the GOP’s “coup” talk is an implicit message to Democratic voters. The Republican line effectively tells them, “Your own party’s officials helped nudge your own party’s president into retirement! It was a coup against Biden! Aren’t you outraged?” The answer, by all appearances, is no. Before Biden’s announcement, national polling showed most Democratic voters supported a change at the top of the party’s ticket. In the wake of the president’s decision, a new poll from the Associated Press found roughly 8 in 10 Democratic voters will be pleased when Vice President Kamala Harris wins the party’s nomination. If Republicans are looking for a genuine controversy, they’ll have to look elsewhere. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
“When the Clock Broke” with John Ganz,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 8:06 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/-clock-broke-john-ganz-rcna164261,"There’s a lot of unprecedented things going on nowadays. And with everything going on, it can be tempting to distort the moment we’re in and to view things as totally new and completely abrupt. Our guest this week has written about the source of historical continuity, particularly in the 1990s, that has brought us to our current moment. John Ganz is the author of “When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s.” He joins WITHpod to discuss his thesis on modern conservatism, the placid politics of the '90s, inflection points since then and more. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. John Ganz: Shortly after Trump was elected in 2016, a piece actually came out in 2017 by Rick Perlstein in “The New York Times” magazine, and it was basically kind of Rick saying that he had to revise his picture of the conservative movement and cranks and oddballs and fringe figures that he had thought had been marginalized and pushed out of the conservative movement were more important than he had suspected. And also around this time, the alt-right, as it was known then, was really in the news a lot because they were very excited by Trump’s victory, very excited by Trump’s campaign. And I kept on coming across the name Murray Rothbard when reading the profiles and interviews with these guys. Now, a lot of these guys were neo-Nazis, but they all, almost to a man, talked about Murray Rothbard as the person who kind of started them on their road to the kind of political consciousness that they had then. So I was looking around at what Rothbard wrote, and I found a piece from 1992 called “Right-Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement.” And it was eerie what it said and how much it seemed to anticipate Trump and what had happened in the Republican Party. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. We live in an era of the unprecedented. You hear that a lot. I get to say it a lot on the television show “All In,” which I host on MSNBC. And it’s true, there’s lots of stuff happening that hasn’t happened before. At least since the firing of the cannons of Fort Sumter, there had been no violent attempt on the interruption of the transfer of power in the United States, not since Lincoln’s election. So that really was pretty unprecedented, certainly in our lifetimes. There’s never been a president impeached twice. That was unprecedented. There’s never been a nominee for the presidency running who has 34 felony convictions. That’s completely new in American history. It’s been since the 19th century that we had someone running for president who had been president once before. There’s a lot of stuff happening all the time that is genuinely new, has not happened before, out past the frontier of the known world. All of that said, of course, it is often tempting to dehistoricize the moment we’re in, to view thing as totally new and completely abrupt. And often you have opportunities to dip into some historical text. I’ve been doing this in this book I’ve been writing, where you will read something that feels shockingly contemporary, even from a long time ago. An article I was reading that was decrying the fact that everyone back in the 19th century was reading magazines and the whole family never talked to each other anymore because each member of the family had their own magazine they were looking at. So you can find historical continuity and oftentimes that historical continuity is as illuminating as our sense of disjuncture. And my guest today is someone who has found the source of historical continuity that has brought us to our current moment, I think in a fairly unlikely place, in a fascinating place, in the era politics of the kind of end of the Cold War 1990s. I think it’s a time that, as we’ve gotten further from it, has been marked down in history as relatively placid, the emerging of this kind of global consensus about capitalism and democracy and not the site of incredible, contested, violent conflict. You know, we think about the ‘60s as a tumultuous decade. We don’t think about the 90s as a tumultuous decade in the same way. And yet it’s certainly the case that many of the precursors to the ideological tendencies and cultural dispositions that would cohere into what we think of now as Trumpism or MAGA are extremely present in that decade. And John Ganz is a fantastic writer. He writes a Substack that you should definitely check out. I don’t know anything about him. I know literally nothing about him and I love this because it reminds me of the glory days of blogs where you would find someone on the internet who wrote something really good and you’d think, Jesus, this is great. And then you’d keep reading them and you didn’t know. Maybe they were a barista. Maybe they were an econ professor. Maybe they were a software engineer. Maybe they were a Hollywood producer doing this. You never knew. You had no idea what their credentials were or where they were. They were just writing really good stuff and you’re reading it. And John Ganz is one of these people who I started reading and this book is phenomenal. The book is called “When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s.” John, welcome to the program. John Ganz: Thanks so much for having me, Chris. Chris Hayes: I saw a picture of you, I think for the first time fairly recently. I was like, I don’t know, the guy could be 65 years old for all I know, or he could be 15. He could be a high school freshman savant who does spends all his time reading history. John Ganz: Somewhere in between. Chris Hayes: Somewhere in between. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Congratulations with the book. It’s genuinely excellent. John Ganz: Thanks so much. Chris Hayes: Truly, truly great. Well, first tell me a little bit about yourself. Like -- John Ganz: Sure. Chris Hayes: -- why am I reading a John Ganz history? Where does all your erudition come from? John Ganz: Well, I have a history degree with honors from the University of Michigan, which served me very well. I’ve always been extremely interested in history, political theory, social theory, you know, were a big part of my reading habits. And I wrote before the election of 2016, a little bit, mostly about art and culture, not very much about politics, although I was always interested in politics. But then I thought I had to take politics more seriously and started to write more about politics. Chris Hayes: How did you find your way to the 1990s and the topic of this book? John Ganz: Yeah. So basically what happened was all these events kind of fade together in my memory now, but I’ll try to reconstruct it. So shortly after Trump was elected in 2016, a piece actually came out in 2017 by Rick Perlstein and “The New York Times” magazine, and it was basically kind of Rick saying that he had to revise his picture of the conservative movement and cranks and oddballs and fringe figures that he had thought had been marginalized and pushed out of the conservative movement were more important than he had suspected. And also around this time, the alt-right, as it was known then, was really in the news a lot because they were very excited by Trump’s victory, very excited by Trump’s campaign. And I kept on coming across the name Murray Rothbard when reading the profiles and interviews with these guys. Now, a lot of these guys were neo-Nazis, but they all, almost to a man, talked about Murray Rothbard as the person who kind of started them on their road of political to the kind of political consciousness that they had then. So I was looking around at what Rothbard wrote, and I found a piece from 1992 called “Right Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement.” And it was eerie what it said and how much it seemed to anticipate Trump and what had happened in the in the Republican Party. So I had this essay or this article from his newsletter, and then I tried to get in touch with people, writers who I admired. I wasn’t known as a writer very much. I had written a couple of things, but nothing big. And I tried to send this to Jamelle Bouie, who didn’t know me at the time but now we’re friends. And I tried to send this to Rick Perlstein, same story. And you know, they didn’t get back to me. So I had to start writing about this myself, essentially, which turned out to be a good thing. So I wrote a piece about Murray Rothbard for “The Baffler.” And then shortly, a few months after that, I think I wrote a piece about the year 1992 in general and put Rothbard kind of into context of David Duke’s run for governor in Louisiana and Pat Buchanan’s primary campaign against George H.W. Bush, Ross Perot’s candidacy and a bunch of other strange things that were going on at that time. Chris Hayes: The book sort of chronologically starts with Duke, but maybe let’s start with Rothbard because he is a fascinating figure. John Ganz: Sure. Chris Hayes: Son of the Bronx like myself. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Who is Murray Rothbard? John Ganz: Murray Rothbard is one of the big figures in American libertarianism. He is one of the people who helped found the Cato Institute, but he was kind of also a marginalized and fringe figure. He was involved with the right in the 1950s and the emergence of the conservative movement, but was pushed out because of his extreme libertarianism and his continued adherence to the pre-war tradition of isolationism, which was not what the conservative movement with its Cold War hawkishness really wanted to have anything to do with. So he led, you know, a literally very eccentric life in American politics. In the 1960s, he tried to kind of forge a coalition alliance with the new left because he shared or he thought he shared some of their critiques of the welfare warfare state, bureaucracy. That did not work out. That’s when after that episode and getting tired of the new left and the new left getting tired of him, he moved over to, you know, meet the Kochs and try to start Cato. He was pushed out of that organization partially for his personal difficulties, partially for his extremism. He’s involved in trying to, you know, match nations within the libertarian party to push in his direction. And eventually he comes up with a kind of new synthesis that he calls paleolibertarianism with a man named Lew Rockwell, who had been Ron Paul’s chief aide. So this is kind of the Ron Paul side of the libertarian movement. And this includes an extreme free market, laissez-faire capitalist approach with very strong social conservatism. He was very much opposed to what he called left libertarianism with their kind of hippie-ish social liberalism. Chris Hayes: Pod and, you know, do whatever you want in the bedroom -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and abortion and things like that. John Ganz: Yeah, he still calls himself a libertarian, but was really also a pretty vociferous social conservative. But what he does, what he comes up with after he witnesses David Duke’s run is he comes up with this strategy, this theory of politics, which he had been kind of working on for a very long time. There are a few components to it. Insofar as they actually happened, he was a bit of a victim of Buckley’s famed purges from the conservative movement. So he viewed those as a kind of betrayal and weakening of the conservative movement. He viewed himself as the continuer of the pre-war America first isolationist right. So he thought, okay, well, our moment has arrived where, you know, the Buckleyites ascendancy and control over conservatism and the right in America is coming to an end and we’re turning to an older, healthier tradition that I’m a representative of. But he also says, and when he writes right wing populism, he says, look, let’s face it, we live in a big statist world. The government is in close cahoots with big corporations. They have these kind of underclass parasitical clients, and together they squeeze and exploit the middle class in the country. So his strategy is not to dismantle the state so much, although that may have remained. I mean, it definitely remained his ultimate goal, but to put in a kind of big bully in the White House and to menace and smash the liberal elites that he hated. And the inspiration for this, partly, and he had been working on this theory since the 1950s, was Joe McCarthy. I think a lot of conservatives who attempted to make themselves appear respectable to liberal elites would defend aspects of the Red Scare, defend a muscular approach to the Soviet Union, but say, okay, maybe McCarthy was a bit crude and a bit of a demagogue. And Rothbard essentially says, no, you’ve got it exactly wrong. McCarthy’s demagogy and his ability to menace the liberal elites is exactly what was good about him and this is what we should emulate. Chris Hayes: So there’s a few strains here, right? John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: There’s the sort of maybe somewhat paradoxically for a libertarian, he really likes the strong executive. He sees the presidency as a great place to sort of like wield this kind of power. Caesarism, I think, in the words of Samuel Francis, is another thinker that we’ll get to. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: There’s this kind of populism. It’s driven by this resentment that goes both up and down. There’s resentment against big business and the sort of globalist elites, both the country club and the sort of Fortune 500 CEO types. And then the underclass, the clients, predominantly black and brown folks, immigrants, black people in major urban centers, particularly this kind of white middle class and its resentments both up and down. And this kind of embrace of demagoguery and also the sort of on the kind of isolationist front, this kind of rejection of some of the interventionism of the Cold War era conservative -- John Ganz: Movement. Chris Hayes: -- movement, right. Like those are some of the big strains that he’s marrying together there. John Ganz: Yes. Chris Hayes: So that’s Rothbard. Now, I mean, he’s just a weird intellectual who sort of bops around. But you know, his sort of eureka moment is watching David Duke’s success. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And Duke is sort of the person that puts this into practice before Buchanan and, to a certain extent, Perot. We could talk about that, but talk about Duke’s political success and what it did to the Republican Party and conservative movement at the time and what ideas it gave to some of them. John Ganz: Well, I think basically the most interesting thing about David Duke as a parallel to what we’ve seen the past few years, I mean, David Duke was a neo-Nazi and a former Grand Wizard of the Klan. He kind of disavowed this, but not really. It was pretty thin. And he goes on to become a state legislator in Louisiana, and then he goes on to run for Senate and then he goes on to run for governor against the state and national parties. And the state and national parties were unable to stop him. And they were really frantic in ways that kind of reminded me of the Republicans in 2016, really unable to stop Trump. Now, ultimately, Duke, freighted with his past and, you know, a certain lack of political talent perhaps falls. I mean, there’s a very big black vote in Louisiana. They’re not about to elect a former Klansman. So he loses, but he wins 55 percent of the white vote. And I think most notably, again, really gives the Republican establishment a lot of trouble. And yes, Rothbard, Sam Francis, another one of these paleo conservative intellectuals and Pat Buchanan, all see the David Duke candidacy and the struggle that the mainstream Republicans RNC, I mean, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both released radio ads against him. They sent the RNC staffers to fight against him when he was just running for a state legislator seat. They were spooked by him. And this was a hopeful sign to this little circle of paleoconservatives and they took this as a signal for the launching of their own political ambitions at the time. Chris Hayes: You do a great job chronicling Duke and both his sort of vileness, but also his appeal. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And one of the things that the Republicans and even the local media keep encountering are there are two aspects that really resonate. One is that he’s an attentional magnate. He loves being on TV. He makes good TV. So people keep having him on TV. He’s constantly sort of the star of the story. He’s a good story. He’s a good copy. Right. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Former Grand Wizard runs for office. And the second thing is, once people kind of locked into him, once a certain kind of white person in Louisiana locked into him, a lot of whom were conservatives, but other people who were a little more politically unaffiliated. It was very difficult to pry them loose with, like, facts about what a disgusting monster he was. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: It just didn’t work. And they kept finding themselves flummoxed by this. John Ganz: Yeah. It was a very strange phenomenon and there’s a clear parallel. I mean, when I was researching the book, there was a focus group run by the choice of the mainstream party that the incumbent governor, Buddy Roemer, you know, and they asked people, well, what about a guy who have gotten a facelift and what about a guy who hadn’t paid taxes and never really had a real job? And they hated this hypothetical candidate. But when they were told it was David Duke, they made up a lot of excuses. They said, well, you know, only stupid people pay taxes. He must be smart, which sounds very familiar. So, yeah, there was a certain magnetism he had for voters, and it was intensified when he came under attack by the establishment and the media. It was intensified. Now, it’s important to note that this did not make him invincible. It just created a certain base, a certain core that was very loyal to him and very hard to shake. Ultimately, you know, he loses quite badly. You know, it was a landslide election against him. But, you know, more sophisticated political observers like the people who, you know, wanted to emulate him really took very careful note of that white vote. Chris Hayes: That he’s able to win the majority of the white vote. John Ganz: Yes. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Actually there’s a crazy moment where he comes to the Senate gallery after his loss. So he runs. He wins the state rep seat, which is a nail biter. He wins by 226 votes or something like that. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: He runs for state rep. He runs for Senate. He loses. He runs for governor. He loses. But he ends up in the Senate gallery during like a civil rights bill debate -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- sort of attempting to kind of personally intimidate George H.W. Bush into not voting or not signing a piece of civil rights legislation that is passed by both houses. John Ganz: Yeah. So this bill, which had broad bipartisan support, the Civil Rights Act of 1992, which you don’t hear talk about that much, was opposed by, you know, the hard right and some also some business interests. Duke goes to the Senate gallery while they are trying to overturn Bush’s veto of this bill. And it comes close, but doesn’t work. Duke goes outside and crows to the news cameras that he’s the reason why Bush vetoed the bill because he could see that the kind of appeal that he was having was politically potent, he didn’t want to irritate this section of the electorate. And then he goes and gives an interview at “The Washington Times” and there he meets with Sam Francis, who you’ve mentioned earlier, who’s very intrigued by what Duke has to say. Did Duke actually affect that vote or affect Bush’s decision to veto it? He certainly was not the only person on the right who did not like the Civil Rights Act of 1992, but he was a very visible exponent of resistance to it. It’s really interesting to think back about the Civil Rights Act of 1992, which, again, is a little bit obscure now, because at the time it was labeled a quota bill. And there had been a series of Supreme Court cases that had weakened employee protections for race discrimination, sexual harassment. And this was a legislative fix for those problems. Now, if you read some of the more sophisticated attacks on wokeness today, and DEI and so on and so forth, that actually try to connect it to the civil rights infrastructure of the government, they will bring up the Civil Rights Act of 1992, continuing this tradition, I guess you could call it, of opposition to it. But, you know, unless you’re an employment lawyer, you’re not going to hear very much about it. Chris Hayes: One of the lessons about Duke that I would say Rothbard and then Francis will talk about and then Buchanan is really the big one, there’s two lessons. One is race baiting is very powerful. Racism is powerful. It’s a powerful way to attract white voters. And the idea that there are certain things that just can’t be done or said and certain kinds of backgrounds that couldn’t possibly support a politician aren’t really true. Maybe the boundaries are different than you think. John Ganz: Yeah. I think it’s a complicated issue. I think that it’s obviously polarizing, as people might say today. You know, I think that there are both in the type of politics that say someone like David Duke practices, there are strengths and obvious weaknesses, right, so he can get a very enthusiastic core of support. But at the same time, alienates a lot of other people -- Chris Hayes: Yes. John Ganz: -- frightens and mobilizes them. So it’s a little bit of a game of chicken, a little bit. You know, how scary can you possibly be that will excite your type of voters, but it won’t scare people too much that they’ll be encouraged to really come and bash you at the polls, right? So David Duke obviously is a little bit too being a literal Nazi, a little bit too frightening, you know. Chris Hayes: Also humorless, which I think is key. John Ganz: He was somewhat humorless for sure. I mean, he actually, you know, people found him charming. Chris Hayes: Yeah. He had his own appeal. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: The Trump humor schtick to me is a key way that Trump pulls off this trade -- John Ganz: Right Chris Hayes: -- at a higher mathematical level -- John Ganz: Oh, absolutely. Chris Hayes: -- than Duke was able to. John Ganz: Well, he’s an entertainer. Chris Hayes: He’s the kind of like weird. Is he playing a character tongue in cheekness all the time that gives everybody -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- a kind of plausible deniability about just how bad he can be -- John Ganz: Absolutely. Chris Hayes: -- and allows people to go there in a way that was harder with a literal Nazi, you know, in the person of Duke or even Buchanan. John Ganz: Yeah, I think you’re right. And I also think that what I’ve mentioned recently and I don’t think it’s really mentioned enough with Trump is an organic. I mean, look, David Duke wanted to be Adolf Hitler, but he wasn’t, you know. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: He’s not. And, you know, he didn’t have that kind of talent or relationship with crowds. Trump has a relationship with crowds that’s very unusual in American politics. I mean, American politics, politicians are real pros. I think they would go to countries in Europe and clean up, you know. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: But I think Trump is different. He doesn’t shape a message with his advisers or maybe he does that a little bit, but he kind of does this on the fly. He has an organic relationship with the crowds. He sees what they want to hear. They respond to him leading them, but they know that he’s also taking cues from them. And this relationship, this dynamic is quite unique. And it explains a lot of his loyalty and a lot of the excitement he generates in people. Not any of the candidates, maybe a little bit. Ross Perot had a little bit of this. But most of the candidates I discussed in my book are more conventional. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So we talked about Rothbard. We talked about Duke. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Duke goes and meets with Francis, who’s another key figure here. Francis is at the right-wing “Washington Times” at the time, is editorial page writer. And Francis is, again, he calls himself a fascist, pronounced fascist, Italian style. John Ganz: Yeah. Right. Chris Hayes: And along the lines of Rothbard, you know, kind of authoritarian racist populism, essentially. John Ganz: Yeah. Well, Sam Francis becomes involved with the conservative movement around the time of the new right, what’s called the new right and the new right is part of the kind of single-issue movements having to do with busing, gun control, abortion, taxes. And they are all kind of separate, but they sort of come together and coalesce and part of the wave that gets Reagan into the White House. But they are kind of not so intellectually coherent. So Francis is asked to contribute an essay for a book that’s trying to give the new right kind of a theoretical underpinning and he says this represents the revolt of middle Americans, the rise of middle Americans as a kind of ascendant class. And the Reagan administration hopes is a Caesarist populist presidency that will, you know, forge a new political order that’s in the interests of these of these middle American radicals. He got this idea from a from a sociologist named Don Warren. He and like many of his other people in the hard right, and he says, very notably in this, we can’t really call ourselves conservatives anymore. We really have to call ourselves something else. We’re radical. We’re revolutionary. We’re radical, right. We’re not conserving things anymore. The old institutions are dead. He, over the course of the ‘80s, like many other people in the hard right, who some of whom he’s quite close with, are very disappointed with the Reagan administration. Now to us liberals and leftists, we think of the Reagan administration as a huge success for the right and a big disaster for the left. But for people on the hard right, Reagan was a moderate and a squish. Chris Hayes: I mean, there are certain ideological dispositions that can only be disappointed so. John Ganz: Yes. Chris Hayes: And, you know what? Part of that -- John Ganz: That’s also very true. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Yeah. That’s also very true. And I think, you know, Reagan is also temperamentally a lot different from the right in a lot of ways with his sunniness and his optimism, you know. So by the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Francis is very unhappy with what the state of the Republican Party. And like Rothbard, like Buchanan, who he has a personal relationship with, he sees that the arrival of Duke as being a sign that maybe something else is up. You know, it’s also interesting to think about is I know there’s a lot of emphasis in studies on the right put on evangelicals and on the Christian right. And I don’t think that that’s wrong. But I will note that in ‘88, Pat Robertson tried to primary Bush. And that did not activate this button that made all of these members of the of the populist hard right kind of say, oh, maybe it’s time to go in the way that David Duke did. Chris Hayes: So Francis and Buchanan are meeting, you know. John Ganz: Yes. Chris Hayes: They’re having dinner. Buchanan then, I think, kind of take some of the ideas of Francis and the ideas of Duke and he puts it into that ‘92 campaign. And people have drawn these parallels for me. That campaign really, it is a paleo campaign. It has these kinds of recognizable features in that it is kind of trade skeptical, even anti-trade, also very anti-immigrant, also very demagogic, bullying, sort of authoritarian in its kind of tone, if that makes sense, you know. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And it’s surprisingly successful again. And Buchanan’s a smart guy. I knew him a little bit back in the day when doing MSNBC with him. And he’s pretty intentional about what he’s doing. I mean, he both believes it, but also understands what he’s doing, right. John Ganz: He’s a political professional and a media professional. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So what’s his theory of the case for that race? John Ganz: I think he believes that David Duke’s, you know, unexpected strength, the weakness of the of the Republican establishment is a kind of go signal. But he also has his own grievances, one of which is that he believes, along with his fellows, that the neoconservatives have become too powerful within the conservative movement in the Republican Party and they need to be kind of thrown out. So his campaign, as much as an attack on H.W. Bush, who is not really a neoconservative, he had neoconservative allies and advisors, but is really like, I think in their mind, although H.W. Bush kind of moved pretty far to the right, was a Rockefeller establishment Republican kind of guy who they got to get rid of. Chris Hayes: He was mostly just a guy who happened to be there. John Ganz: In my opinion, yes, I think he was a professional public servant whose ambition was to rise to the highest office he possibly could. I think he was driven by a very old type of patriotism, WASP type of patriotism that is different. Chris Hayes: And ego, you know, like everyone. John Ganz: And ego, yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Which was different from the nationalism that was espoused by somebody like Buchanan. Chris Hayes: I mean, he’s the least popular person you can imagine. John Ganz: Yeah. He is a preppy WASP. You know, like in Kennebunkport and so on and so forth. So he views his campaign as also a war against the neocons in an attempt to reverse their power within the party or to arrest their power within the party. So that’s part of his crusade as he puts it, to take back our party and then our country. Now, the thing to note about the neoconservatives and Buchanan is Buchanan, there’s really no way around it. He’s an anti-Semite. Throughout his career, he’s evinced anti-Semitic opinions. He seems to have gotten that from his family when he was growing up. Chris Hayes: I mean, he wrote a book basically saying more or less we picked the wrong side in World War II. John Ganz: Right. And, you know, he views himself also as a member of this America first tradition. Chris Hayes: Yeah. So going back to Taft and Lindbergh and all those folks who were -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- very skeptical of the American war machine and also were -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- if not pro-Nazi, kind of, you know, not that -- John Ganz: Sympathetic. Chris Hayes: -- sympathetic and not that upset about them and often quite anti-globalist, which also always is difficult to disentangle from opposition to the nefarious actions of the international Jew. John Ganz: Exactly, exactly. So he, you know, views the neocons are, look, many of them are Jewish and like with his other guys on the paleocon right, resents their kind of importation of liberal ideas into the right. Now, Buchanan’s version of conservatism, although it does undergo some changes in the 1980s, he says at one point, I think in 1989, I think to Sid Blumenthal, the biggest vacuum in American politics is to the right of Ronald Reagan. So this is the space he sought to occupy. I mean, he knew this, you know, being a man of the right, but he definitely familiarized himself and began to speak the language of the far-right increasingly. The other thing is though, you know, he is a veteran of two White Houses, the Reagan White House where he was communications director and he was an advisor also to Nixon. And this may not be well known among, you know, liberals and lefties today, but Nixon was not particularly well liked within the conservative movement. He was viewed as an establishment Republican, a pragmatist, a liberal. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: Buchanan was close to him and had a different view and had a very interesting reading of Watergate. Basically, he thought that Nixon was this tribune of middle American populism that Watergate was essentially an establishment elite liberal coup against Nixon. And the missed opportunity of Watergate was not to launch a kind of counter coup. So that just kind of tells you the tone in which Buchanan is reading politics. He has a personal crusade in a sense to retake the conservative movement and also to, you know, retake the country. Chris Hayes: So to me, the sort of defining features of that ‘92 race, there’s sort of tonal and rhetorical ones, and then there’s substantive ones. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: The tonal rhetorical ones are this just really braying and kind of bile filled populism. I mean, you know, that speech at the convention is just this, you know, sort of execrable. It’s the one someone famously quipped, I like it in the original German, and it ends on this totally kind of fascistic ending about the L.A. riots and the, and the soldiers. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: You know, the sort of, that everything comes from the soldier, that that’s the true source of all sort of freedom and -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and this who’s who list of all the enemies, the feminists and the -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So there’s that. There’s just the bigotry of the demagoguery and this sort of populist, this sort of resentment that just drips through everything. Everything is resentment. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And then there’s these kinds of substantive areas, three of which I think really do become that are really important because they do become, I think, they form the basis of what will be successful in 2016, which is anti-immigrant, anti-trade, anti-foreign intervention. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And those are the places where there’s real heterodoxy, real breaks with some of the establishment ideologically and are actually substantive, not just tonal changes. And all three of those are gonna be woven back together, you know, 24 years later. John Ganz: Yeah. Absolutely. You know, Buchanan is on campaign in New Hampshire and he’s already a part of this kind of protectionist wing of the right. And he plans to run against, he thought what conservatives and Republicans would be upset about was the breaking of the no new taxes pledge, right? So Bush makes the famous no new taxes pledge and breaks it. And among right-wingers today, the story that they tell, or more conventional conservatives, the story they tell themselves is that’s why Bush lost the election. But what Buchanan discovers in New Hampshire campaigning is that people are much more concerned about trade. So that becomes more central part of his message. He doesn’t talk about the no new taxes stuff very much. So the trade stuff becomes big. People are very concerned about, you know, what the last decade of free trade policies and then upcoming, you know, the negotiations are going on for NAFTA and what the effects of that will be. And, you know, at the time, New Hampshire is in an economic downturn because of the recession of 1990, ‘91, so yes. Then the interesting thing is, although the Gulf War was extremely popular, Buchanan, Rothbard and Francis, all opposed it not because for pacifist reasons, but because of the multilateral nature of it and the globalist side of it, that it was, you know, America’s sovereignty was threatened by these multilateral agreements. Chris Hayes: It’s funny you say that because one of the things that would happen that I remember from my early 20s, post 9/11 when, you know, opposition to particularly the war in Afghanistan, but then the war in Iraq was a, you know, relatively marginal view, not totally marginal, but you go to anti-war events or anti-war. You know, these folks were sort of floating at the edges of it because they were the people on the right that were also kind of anti-war. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: But there’d be like some table at the event that like some weird libertarians had. John Ganz: Sure. Yeah. Chris Hayes: And you’d look at the table and you’d be like, huh, that was interesting. It was like the Ron Paul people, basically, and -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you know, and they’d have a Samuel Francis book and then there’d be a Rothbard and, you know, there’s something about the Zionists where you’re like -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And then there’s a book about how like Abraham Lincoln was a dictator -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and like suspended habeas corpus. And you’d be like, okay, all right, I got what’s going on with this table. John Ganz: I get where this is going. Yeah. Chris Hayes: I understand this table. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But that was a real fixture of certain kind of anti-war events back in the early aughts. John Ganz: I remember that. I remember that very clearly, Chris. Yeah. I remember seeing that kind of literature where it’s like mixture of kind of anti-Clinton. I mean, this is after Clinton is president, but there’s still anti-Clinton paranoia. Chris Hayes: Yeah. John Ganz: And then you see like more kind of abstractly trilateral commission and -- Chris Hayes: Yes, right. Exactly. Yes. John Ganz: Bankers and you know, like -- Chris Hayes: The Rothschild family -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you know, that kind of thing. John Ganz: I’m sure that if you ask the guy for the real stuff, he would reach under the table and -- Chris Hayes: Yes, that’s right. Yeah. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Right. So they all oppose the war, which again is a real thing. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: I mean, it makes them unpopular in their own party. That war, of course, is very popular. But then what’s interesting is that in some ways, you know, it’s so fascinating to me, Buchanan and Perot are different ideological figures. They’re coded at the time very differently. It doesn’t feel like at the time, having lived through it at the age of 13 and as a news junkie, even at that tender age, like a lot of continuity. But you draw out some of the continuity and really like, you know, there’s a lot there that places them in conversation with each other. John Ganz: Well, they were both concerned about trade. Perot had also been a skeptic of the intervention in the Gulf. They both kind of were worshippers of the 1950s. I think that at the time, most commentators thought that they were, you know, part of the same kind of underlying phenomenon. Buchanan, when his campaign is flagging, he says, look, I can’t really compete with Ross Perot. Most of the people who are interested in me are now going after him because he looks like the winner. So, yes, I mean, look, race is less front and center part of Perot’s appeal. And it’s much more on the surface level, kind of universalistic. The fact of the matter is that Perot’s appeal was mostly white. Chris Hayes: Right. John Ganz: He had trouble breaking into minority constituencies, not helped by his extreme awkwardness around race because, you know, he was from Texas and he had very condescending and paternalistic attitudes about black people. Not as hateful, perhaps, as Buchanan, but did not help him. He gave a disastrous speech at the end of the NAACP. There’s a folksiness to Perot that is a lot less threatening than Buchanan and I think he’s angry, but it’s a different tone to the anger and it turns less people off than Buchanan or definitely David Duke. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: You know, one thing about Perot is there was a sense at the time that something had changed, had happened, that this was historically important, maybe even a hinge point. It’s interesting now how much that just seems like a footnote. What was the meaning of Ross Perot? No one really even asked that question. It was just like, well, that was kind of a quirky thing we did there. But you read it as something that did signal something deeper. John Ganz: I think it signaled a true vein of discontent with the political establishment looking for some way to express itself. It was the biggest challenge to the two-party system since, you know, Teddy Roosevelt’s Bull Moose Party, which is almost 100 years earlier. And I think it represented, yeah, a vein of anger and disconnect at the government, you know, with sometimes extremely vague notions of what that meant. But it seemed to peter out the party establishment seemed to be victorious. But then I think, you know, one interpretation of Trump that makes a lot of sense to me was essentially that Trump is a third-party candidate who’s kind of taken over one of the major parties, right. He’s agglomerated himself. And, you know, when he was kind of playing around with the idea of running for president in the past, you know, Ross Perot’s Reform Party was once, you know, one of the vehicles he was looking at. So he definitely viewed that world of third parties, of protest votes as a possible angle. And ultimately, you know, he attaches himself to the Tea Party, which is an internal anti-establishment faction of the Republican Party. So I think basically Trump represents the triumph. I mean, I think of Trump as a synthesis and I think the book tries to articulate the different elements that would go on to be crystallized within Trump. And one of them is Ross Perot’s third party, clean up government, drain the swamp, throw the rascals out, middle class populism. Some of it Buchanan and David Duke’s kind of ethno nationalist race, baity, anti-immigrant stuff. And then some of it is the entertainment industry. Trump is, you know, a creature of cable news. I mean, as is Perot and as is Buchanan to a great degree. But so I think that, you know, obviously he’s not a repetition exactly of Perot, but Perot shows that there is a great deal. There’s a large opening for someone to attack the political establishment as such, from a vantage point that that is sometimes an attack from the left and sometimes an attack from the right. Chris Hayes: I think there’s always this search for kind of materialist, causal explanations -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- particularly on the left and I certainly do this as well. And I have my own theories and I wrote a book back in 2012 that that had something of a materialist or at least a sort of macroeconomic -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- account of some of the levels of distrust and elite failure and sort of the kind of breakdown of meritocracy as a means of explaining some of this alienation that I think has culminated in things like Brexit and Trump. But I also think there’s limitations that I wonder, like, what was it about this time and ‘20s? Is there anything or is it just that history is a kind of stochastic process? But was there something specific about ‘92 and 2016 that market it as propitious moments for the first sort of forays of this style of politics in Duke, Buchanan and then Perot and then for Trump’s success in 2016? John Ganz: Yeah, I think my orientation is similar. I try to base this in kind of a material account. I think it does have limitations. There are other things going on. But essentially what you see in 1992 is that the way that the economy was re-geared during the Reagan ‘80s, some of the consequences of that are becoming apparent for the first time. And you have the American middle class really struggling. A lot of people are falling through the cracks. Wages have stagnated now for about a decade. You know, unions have been crushed, interest rate, and this is different from now and the last 20 years or so or 15 years, but interest rates were very high, which also encouraged, you know, contribute to wage stagnation. And you have also a great deal of discontent with the political establishment because there’s a sense that the political elite, the political class is just working in their own interests and in the interests of, you know, of lobbies and special interests to kind of make these deals that just divide up the spoils of the government and there’s not a sense of a broader public spiritedness going on. So there’s a great deal of anger. I would say, it’s not right to exactly understand this as a class struggle, although that’s the underlying problem. But the issue is what you see in this period is that there is a struggle essentially between the representative and the representatives. There’s a lot of irritation, anger by people against Congress, against representative government in general. And Kevin Phillips, you know, the famous Republican strategist and Nixon advisor, you know, he identifies this as a rejection of representative government as such, searching around for a plebiscitary form of government, a strong man, an authoritarian leader who can cut through the morass of special interests and kind of, you know, rule on behalf of the people. Chris Hayes: So Kevin Phillips identifying this desire for this kind of, you know, sort of populist strong man who can cut out all the special interests who are, you know, preying on the aggrieved white middle class, right, both from below and above, and that’s a similar thing that Samuel Francis identifies. And there’s a deeper ideological thing happening here. I mean, Francis calls himself a fascist. Buchanan doesn’t, but I think has some sympathies that go in that direction. John Ganz: For sure. Chris Hayes: And the ideological moment we find ourselves in is a kind of rejection, a deep rejection of liberal democracy -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and its ethos. And there’s a part of the book where this synthesis and this ideological, alternative ideological vision is made plain in this essay that Francis writes about “The Godfather.” John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: And I thought this was the most ideologically revelatory part of the book. You just wrote about it in your Substack on Popular Front because it kind of perfectly captures the Trumpist model, like what Trump truly believes about to the extent he has normative political commitments about how things should be. They are embodied in this sort of mafia state vision with him as the Don. And this is something that people, you know, the Don father and all these things, these sort of mafia terms, he talks about snitches and all this stuff. So this has always been there. But Francis basically writing an ideological endorsement of this really blew me away. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Tell me about that essay. John Ganz: That essay he writes, yeah, in 1992 is called “The Godfather is a Political Metaphor.” And essentially what he says is “The Godfather” depicts the Corleone family as a representative of an earlier form of social association. He uses the term from the German sociologist Frederick Tonnies, Gemeinschaft, which means community as opposed to Gesellschaft, which means society. Gesellschaft is bureaucracy, the rule of law, corporation, the modern state. Chris Hayes: Yeah. All the elements of liberal democracy and cosmopolitan liberal democracy where -- John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- strangers and citizens meet each other, mediated through all sorts of institutions, and we negotiate these pluralistic differences. John Ganz: Precisely. Yeah. And Gemeinschaft community is, you know, blood ties, feudalism, family. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah, exactly. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Like, yeah, straight up mafia, feudal kind of -- John Ganz: Right. And he says that, you know, the myth that the Godfather explodes is that we can live in an American society, these operations of mediation work, and we can leave behind force and fraud and all become integrated as free and equal citizens in this democracy of ours. And he says this is BS. Essentially, the Godfather shows the necessity of both force and fraud, even when they have tragic consequences. It shows the reality of politics. And I think basically what unites all of the political currents that I talk about in my book and the ones that we’re seeing now, nationalism and Trump’s kind of gangster populism, if you want to put it like that, is that there’s a rejection of liberal democracy. There’s a rejection of the kind of universalistic promises of liberal democracy. So, you know, citizenship to all or as an ever-expanding franchise, no, this needs to be cut off, retained for a few. The market, the free market, well, which has like non-zero-sum outcomes and no, like what you need is an unfair advantage. We need to favor ours, like enough of this free trade bullshit and enough of, you know. You know, Trump is a capitalist, but he’s not a free marketer. He doesn’t believe in the ideology of the market. Chris Hayes: No. John Ganz: He believes in getting an unfair advantage. Chris Hayes: That’s right. John Ganz: And the belief in, you know, these bounded communities that don’t have necessarily paths to infinitely expand except by, you know, force, taking over other people or bashing other people. So, you know, I think there’s an analogy, a structural analogy between, you know, the appeal to the family as a kind of basic unit of politics and society and that race, for example. It’s like you have to protect your own. It’s time to protect our own. You know, obviously in the context of the United States, which is a pluralistic society, it’s very difficult to make, you know, nationalism, although it has a has an appeal in the United States, is a hard fit because we don’t have a single ethnicity. We’ve always been a pluralistic country. But the rejection of this, that sort of patriotism that says our abstract fealty to ideals of equality and justice for all are what makes us American. No, something more elemental than that. Some bond that’s either racial, ethnic, familial, or just rejects the idea that there can be non-zero-sum outcomes. So you have to form -- Chris Hayes: Right. John Ganz: -- some kind of gang or association and get yours. Chris Hayes: That’s right. Or in the end, right, because there’s James Caan in The Godfather, you know, that you can join the gang. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: See, this this to me is the point and you write this in that Substack piece, that the appeal is that you can be inside our -- John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: -- and that you can get the unfair advantages and you can be on the inside of the -- John Ganz: Sure. Chris Hayes: And the gang is going to take on the people that you don’t like. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And that appeal, I think, is the opposite of a kind of universalist, pluralistic, liberal conception, but it has a lot of appeal. And in some ways, it’s elementally what we’re battling against. John Ganz: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And what’s key about that is that it is a little more universalist than the sheer racism of Duke, even though it has lots of those elements, because there are people who think they could be on the inside. John Ganz: Right. Chris Hayes: That it leaves open the door for them to be on the inside. John Ganz: You can be on, you know, not to take the mafia analogy too seriously, but you know, you can be an associate of the mob and not a main man if you’re not a Sicilian, for example, right. Chris Hayes: Right. John Ganz: So you can have some kind of relationship with the enterprise, but you’re not going to be, you know, the center figure of it. So that’s one way of looking at it I suppose. You can be a friend of mine, but not a friend of ours. But yeah, I think that’s true and I think the struggle is that I think a lot of people, you know, the assumption is that in the failure of the revelation that capitalist society is extremely competitive and people fall through the cracks is not to create institutions of broad solidarity. Chris Hayes: No. John Ganz: It’s to create these -- Chris Hayes: To get yours. John Ganz: -- the institutions of what I call negative solidarity or following (inaudible), which is bounded groups that are created out of opposition to other groups. And you can have pluralism. You know, what’s interesting about this new nationalism across the world, it’s pluralistic to a certain degree internationally because there’s all these little, you know, different nation states, but it’s a hostile and toxic pluralism, right? It’s a war of all against all, not a oh, well, we all have different interests, but then, you know, through the wonderful workings of the market and liberal democracy, they come into concert somehow. This kind of rejects the possibility of civic peace in favor of a constant civic, ongoing kind of cold civil war, which might break out into more hostilities. So, you know, that connects it again to Rothbard’s old conception of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard also wrote about “The Godfather,” and he says mobsters are essentially anarcho-capitalists. That’s what my vision of an anarcho-capitalist society would be these kind of like family concerns that are self-regulating, but, you know, they have to take care of their own and there’s no bigger framework other than the meeting of these businesses in the kind of commission to do things. So it’s strange. It is a pluralistic vision, but it views a world of constant struggle and sometimes that’s understood to be different families fighting each other. Sometimes that’s understood to be different races fighting each other. And sometimes that’s understood to be individuals grasping for what they need. I think that the conservatives in this country, as their counter to socialism, used to provide the market as a potential utopian tool where if it was allowed to do its thing, you would get these wonderful outcomes based on its own internal operation. And essentially what I’m describing is right-wingers who don’t particularly believe in the magic of the marketplace, who recognize the competitive nature of capitalist society, but instead of saying, well, what do we do to obviate that, they want to create an order where you say, well, some people are the winners and some people are the losers. Chris Hayes: That’s right. John Ganz: And, you know, this is really interesting. I was recently reading for the first time, actually, “Wages of Destruction” by Adam Tooze, which is a great book about, you know, the Nazi economy. And it’s so fascinating to see how he talks about, well, we of course know that Hitler and the Nazis had this highly ideological racialized view of the world, but that was also their way of explaining Germany’s unique position in the global capitalist world and its struggles to compete with other countries, right? That was explained in racial terms. So these things kind of turn into each other and, you know, I think that that’s what’s happening, is essentially, you know, to go back to your earlier point about the material underpinnings of this, you know, I don’t know if I’m going to get in trouble for this on MSNBC. But, you know, as Mark said, you know, the rule of the market, the rule of law in a capitalist society is kind of just continuation in many ways of the rule of the jungle. And conservatives or market conservatives, market liberals say, no, that’s not really true. It’s not the rule of the jungle. These institutions work. And liberals and left liberals and social liberals say, well, it is a little bit, but we can mediate. We can soften that. I think this strand that I’m describing, the political phenomenon I’m describing says it is the law of the jungle and you’re going to be the biggest beast.

"Trump pushes his luck with new attack on Harris, China and Russia",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 7:49 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-pushes-luck-new-attack-harris-china-russia-election-2024-rcna164482,"In her first week as an unexpected presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris confronted plenty of racist and sexist lines of attack, but as a Washington Post report makes clear, Donald Trump added to this record in an especially ugly way in his latest Fox News interview. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham started to ask the GOP candidate how international leaders would consider a Harris presidency, but before she could even finish asking, Trump interjected. “They’ll walk all over her,” the former president said, adding, “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy. They look at her and they say, ‘We can’t believe we got so lucky.’” Trump then appeared to turn toward the camera and said, “And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.” A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Post the Republican nominee wasn’t referring to race or gender, and if you believe that, I have a lovely Trump University seminar I’d love to sell you. The obvious problem with the former president’s comments was that they were overtly offensive in ways even he should be able to understand. But there are plenty of less obvious problems, too. For one thing, Harris has spent the last four years in national office, meeting with international officials and leaving no doubt that she’s a force to be reckoned with. For another, if Trump is so convinced that international leaders will walk all over the Democrat, perhaps he could explain why he’s so afraid to share a debate stage with her. But perhaps most important is the degree to which Trump keeps failing tests of self-awareness. Indeed, if he’s looking for an American leader who wasn’t taken seriously abroad, Trump probably ought to find a mirror. In 2018, for example, he addressed the United Nations general assembly, where foreign diplomats literally laughed at him. China’s state-run media routinely characterized Trump — during his presidency — as a bumbling fool who had a habit of slapping himself in the face. Even U.S. allies quietly conceded that they perceived the then-president as an intemperate child with a short attention span. Let's also not forget about a 2019 international gathering in which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the U.K.'s Boris Johnson were overheard mocking Trump, treating him like a punch-line to a joke they found rather exasperating. Russia’s Vladimir Putin was more reluctant to ridicule Trump in public, but that’s only because he enjoyed walking all over the Republican and didn’t feel the need to put that advantage at risk. All of which is to say, Trump’s latest line of attack isn’t just ugly, and it isn’t just wrong. It’s also the latest example of the former president engaging in projection."
Reports of Project 2025’s demise have been greatly exaggerated,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 6:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/reports-project-2025s-demise-greatly-exaggerated-trump-election-2024-rcna164459,"A couple of weeks ago, Chris LaCivita, a leading member of Donald Trump’s political operation, publicly conceded that he considered Project 2025 a “pain in the ass” for the former president’s campaign. His candid assessment was understandable. As regular readers know, Democrats have spent much of the year letting the public know about the right-wing policy agenda crafted by the Heritage Foundation — with the assistance of several prominent Trump associates. Given the governing blueprint’s radical provisions on practically every area of public policy, Republicans have started to see Project 2025 as a political albatross. It was against this backdrop that NBC News reported yesterday: In theory, the developments might lead some to believe the Project 2025 fiasco has effectively run its course. The initiative appears to be ending its policy work, and former Trump administration personnel official Paul Dans who served as the director of Project 2025 is stepping down. In practice, it’s not nearly that simple. As Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign manager, explained in a statement, “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot. This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country. Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real — in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.” The core details of the Project 2025 controversy haven’t changed at all. The right-wing policy agenda was still co-authored by several dozen members of Team Trump. Trump’s running mate, Republican Sen. JD Vance, still wrote a highly provocative foreword to Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts’ forthcoming book. Trump still delivered a 2022 speech at a Heritage Foundation event and said, “This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” It’s also still true that the GOP candidate more recently said he agrees with parts of the radical governing plan. Dans still told a right-wing podcast last year that his group has a “great” relationship with the former president and that “Trump’s very bought-in with this.” What’s more, as The New York Times’ Jonathan Swan explained online, it’s also still true that Team Trump hasn’t prepared for a post-election transition, and if the Republican ticket prevails, the president-elect will still rely heavily on Project 2025. As a practical matter, the latest developments about winding down the initiative matter very little. Indeed, for all intents and purposes, Project 2025 is wrapping up because it’s already done: The blueprint has been written, its Trump-aligned authors remain positioned to implement the plan if given the opportunity, and the threats posed by Project 2025’s objectives remain real."
"The problem(s) with Trump’s ugly rhetoric about Harris, antisemitism",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-trumps-ugly-rhetoric-harris-antisemitism-jewish-election-2024-rcna164448,"Donald Trump seems determined to convince voters that Vice President Kamala Harris is antisemitic. She’s not, and the former president’s attacks are as ugly as they are false, but the Republican appears preoccupied with pushing this line anyway. During a speech last week, for example, the GOP nominee falsely said his likely Democratic rival is “totally against the Jewish people” — a curious claim about someone who’s married to a Jewish person — and as the Associated Press reported, Trump went even further yesterday. The former president seemed quite worked up on the issue, ranting that Harris dislikes both Israel and Jews — it’s something “everybody knows,” Trump said, reality notwithstanding — while adding that Jewish voters are “fools” to vote Democratic. The radio host, Sid Rosenberg, proceeded to say that Harris’ Jewish husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is “a crappy Jew” and “a horrible Jew.” And while Trump didn’t use those words himself, as an audio clip makes clear, he seemed to agree with the condemnations. A Politico report described the comments as ""bizarre."" A press statement from the Harris campaign, not surprisingly, went much further, describing the on-air exchange as “disgusting” and adding, “America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump.” At this point, we could spend a few paragraphs talking about how wrong the Republican’s attack is. We could also highlight the fact that Trump hasn’t even tried to substantiate his absurdities with evidence. But as important as those points are, I’m struck by a larger point: Trump apparently believes he has credibility when it comes to antisemitism, but he really doesn’t. As regular readers might recall, it was just four months ago, for example, when the GOP nominee invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel. To put it mildly, Jewish Democrats in Congress were not impressed. An Axios report quoted Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, for example, saying, “Trump demonstrates daily his lack of fitness for the presidency by spreading dangerous stereotypes and embracing antisemites.” Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina added that the former president’s rhetoric is “particularly disgraceful and dangerous at a time when Jews are facing dangerous levels of antisemitism nationwide.” Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland issued an especially pointed response, noting, “Luckily I don’t know any Jews who look to Donald Trump for advice on how to be Jewish. After all, this is the guy who saw ‘very fine people on both sides’ of an antisemitic riot and entertained the neo-Nazi Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes over at his house at Mar-a-Lago for dinner.” That larger pattern was of particular interest. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, “You’re not gonna support me because I don’t want your money. You want to control your politicians.” He added, “I’m a negotiator — like you folks.” Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met “in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.” While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their “loyalties.” Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council’s national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign. There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters “don’t love Israel enough,” dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago and arguing that Jews need to “get their act together” and “appreciate” Israel “before it is too late.” In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders “should be ashamed of themselves” over their “lack of loyalty.” Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker. In his earlier campaigns, Trump has struggled badly with Jewish voters. If he thinks lying about Harris will change that, the Republican probably ought to lower his expectations. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
‘Mountain Queen’: The greatest Everest climber you’ve never heard of,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 4:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/mountain-queen-greatest-everest-climber-ve-never-heard-rcna164065,"Lhakpa Sherpa has conquered seemingly impossible mountains all  her life — both literally and figuratively. And now, the 51 year old, who has climbed Mount Everest more than any other woman, is sharing her story in hopes of inspiring women and girls around the world to pursue their dreams and break glass ceilings. “Life can sometimes be very hard. It’s not easy…But you can’t give up. Good things can come from bad,” Sherpa told Know Your Value. Sherpa’s extraordinary life is chronicled in “Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa,” which will be released on Netflix on July 31. The documentary, directed by Lucy Walker, follows Sherpa on her tenth ascent of Mount Everest, when she was just shy of 50, as she attempted to break her own world record of summiting the tallest mountain above sea level. The film also tells the story of her unconventional upbringing. Sherpa, the daughter of yak farmers was born in a cave in Nepal. She was fascinated with climbing as a young girl, even though society did not approve of girls going to school, let alone climbing mountains. Still, she climbed (often disguising herself as a boy) and set world records. In the documentary, she tells the story of how she met her eventual husband, a Romanian climber named George Dijmarescu — and how that relationship imploded due to his drinking and abusive behavior. In interviews, Sherpa details leaving her husband with no money, in hopes of securing better future — particularly for her daughters. The film shows Sherpa living in Connecticut and working at Whole Foods to make ends meet. Even though she hadn't climbed in years, viewers watch a determined Sherpa return to Everest for a tenth time to redeem her life’s purpose and show her two teenage daughters that anything is possible. Know Your Value recently spoke to Sherpa and Walker about the film. Below is the conversation, which has been edited for brevity and clarity. Know Your Value: What was it about Lhakpa Sherpa's story that drew you in? Walker: In a word, everything. I love making character-driven narrative longitudinal documentaries, the kind where you can follow the arc of a life and see the forces that shape it at work, to glimpse the machinery of how a life unfolds. And the characters that I love to follow are the kind of superhuman people who have special reserves of qualities like creativity, grace, courage, and resilience — Lhakpa has all four of those. I love documentaries that are as cinematic, visually and dramatically and emotionally compelling, as any scripted Hollywood movie. And I love telling stories that haven’t been told before. Lhakpa is unique as a protagonist, in what she overcomes in her childhood and in her culture and in her marriage, and in her motivation to climb.  Know Your Value: What do you hope viewers — particularly women facing their own difficult times -- take away from Lhakpa’s story Walker: When Lhakpa was told “no”, she didn’t let that stop her. Her persistence, creativity and strength are magnificent to watch. Her story reads like a legend or a fairytale. Cutting off her hair to pass herself off as a boy in order to avoid arranged marriage and get a job on the mountain. Entering a running race to use the prize money to open a teahouse to support herself when she was an outcast as a young unwed mother, and spending years and years begging her customers to help her in her quest to become the first Nepali woman to summit and survive Everest, until, in what she describes as a moment of magic, one customer told her sure, come with me to the prime minister’s house, and the door to her future finally opened.  Know Your Value: Tell us about filming the current day scenes. Did you climb too? What were the biggest challenges? Walker: Filming on Everest is challenging but I was confident about exactly how to do it because of my experience making my film Blindsight, for which I directed shoots covering two expeditions, one of which went up all the camps of Everest and into the death zone in order to climb the mountain next to Everest on the Tibet side, a 23,000’ mountain coincidentally called Lhakpa. The breathtaking high altitude cinematography was captured by Matt Irving as well as by Lhakpa’s team of Sherpas who climbed with her. We gave everyone cameras and trained them because we wanted to see what shots they might see from their point of view. And I also knew that one camera and one cinematographer was not enough. We needed to be prepared in case the team split, or any one individual might have to descend at any time due to altitude illness etc. I think what is challenging is to keep focused on story and emotion and drama, even though the backdrop is so diverting. The landscape always needed to contribute to the narrative, and not vice versa. But in a way it was equally challenging to capture the intimate scenes of the family. I am especially overjoyed with the scenes with Lhakpa’s teenage daughters at the end of the movie, especially because of how distressed and traumatized Lhakpa’s elder daughter was feeling after all that they had been through. At the beginning of the movie Lhakpa’s daughters are barely speaking to her, even though she had dedicated her life to inspiring and empowering women and girls. But as Lhakpa returns from her quest to Everest to reclaim her legacy, she has inspired her very own daughters. It was very delicate filming them, as I felt very concerned for their well being and not wanting to push them past where they were ready to go. I think I pushed them just the right amount, and it’s remarkable to watch the girls heal and grow thanks to the inspiration of their mom.   Know Your Value: Why do you climb? What do you love about it? Sherpa: I grew up in the mountains and spent my childhood climbing. I wanted to explore.   I wanted to change my life.  I wasn’t educated in a school. The mountains are my school. I’ve been mountain educated and I want to finish my degree. The mountains are my doctor, my healer. They make me mentally and physically strong.   Know Your Value:  In the film we see you overcome many challenges — the physical and mental hardships of climbing to the top of Mount Everest, but also domestic abuse, being a single mom, and financial difficulties. What do you tell yourself when things get hard? How do you get through those times?  Sherpa: Life is a challenge. I was hurt from the divorce and you have to focus on the positive. You have to stay strong mentally and physically. We need the negative and positive to balance out our lives but we must focus on the positives. The mountains can also help heal. People will experience divorce, lose a business, suffer an illness…Nature can help you in a different way. Nature and happiness can love our body back. Nature is power. Nature can help you recover. Everyone is different. Some people will become a doctor, a lawyer, a pilot. Whatever it is that you want to do in life, even if it’s not easy. Keep doing it. You can reach the top of your Mt. Everest.  Know Your Value: Do you have another mountain you are hoping to climb? What’s your next challenge? I have a goal to climb the highest mountain in each of the 50 states. My daughters have come with me on some of the climbs already. We’ve done nine states so far. "
Why Trump targeted Christians with his darkest promise yet,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 31, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/christian-nationalist-trump-speech-voting-rcna164091,"In a speech at the Turning Point USA Believers’ Summit on Friday, Donald Trump implored audience members to vote in the 2024 election, assuring them that, if he gets a second term, “it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” In four years, he reiterated, “you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham recognized the anti-democratic promise that his supporters “won’t have to vote anymore” had created problems for Trump. In an interview with the former president on Monday, she encouraged him to clarify his statement, yet he continued to repeat it multiple times. Taken together with the rest of Trump’s speech, in which he cast himself as a divinely protected savior of his supporters’ vision for America, and falsely portrayed Kamala Harris as a ruthless persecutor of patriotic believers, his doubling down on his promise to “fix” it sends an unambiguous message. It is the most definitive statement to date of his intention to implement the Christian nationalist autocracy sought by his most ardent believers. Trump made false claims that the Biden-Harris administration “weaponized” the government against Christians, and picked up on an attack circulating in right-wing media that Kamala Harris is anti-Catholic. That smear dates back to Harris’ time as senator and her 2018 questioning of Trump judicial nominee Brian Buescher. Harris had questioned whether Buescher’s membership in the Knights of Columbus, a fraternal Catholic organization that vociferously opposes reproductive and LGBTQ rights, would impede his impartiality as a judge. At the time, the pro-choice group Catholics for Choice defended Harris, arguing that the Knights of Columbus was no apolitical charity as conservatives claimed, but “brazenly used” its status “to pour money, effort and influence into political contests and policy debates.” When Harris ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primary, conservatives resurrected the questioning to charge that she had engaged in anti-Catholic bigotry. Since Harris announced her bid for the presidency last week, right-wing media has resuscitated this attack, even though Harris has served under Joe Biden, a committed Catholic. “She is without question one of the most aggressively anti-Catholic career politicians in American history,” wrote an editor for the conservative nonprofit CatholicVote. A staff writer for the Federalist claimed that “she has a long history of anti-Catholic bigotry that not only hurts pro-lifers but also faithful papists.” In his speech, Trump claimed Harris had “viciously attacked” judicial nominees because they were Catholic, and claimed she is “really militantly hostile toward Americans of faith.” He also claimed that Harris “wants to forcibly compel doctors and nurses against their will to give chemical castration, drugs to young children” and wants to force “every public school in America to let men into women’s and girls’ locker rooms.” In short, “the Harris agenda is an agenda for national destruction,” he said. “The Trump agenda is an agenda for national renewal and greatness.” These comments are particularly incendiary to an audience steeped in rhetoric that the Christian America that God intended is under siege from secular leftists. The Believers’ Summit was billed as “a testament to our commitment to see the body of Christ rise to its calling in this pivotal moment in history. We are dedicated to seeing believers not just defend their faith, but to put it into action, ultimately turning our nation towards the Lord.” Speakers included Christian nationalist author and revisionist historian David Barton, Christian right author and podcast host Eric Metaxas (also a prominent promoter of Trump’s stolen election lie) and Doug Wilson, the extremist pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Wilson explicitly promotes theocracy, or what he has called “a network of nations bound together by a formal acknowledgement of the lordship of Jesus Christ,” rejecting civil government as “demonic” and “satanic.” In the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump earlier this month, TPUSA’s founder, Charlie Kirk, promoted the claim — echoed in rightwing media and at the Republican National Convention — that Trump had been spared because he wore the “armor of God.” Kirk had picked up on a tweet from Jack Posobiec, who has called for the overthrow of democracy and declared anyone on the left “un-human,” claiming that God had protected Trump as an anointed figure in a cosmic battle between good and evil. On Friday, Trump thanked supporters for their prayers: “I stand before you tonight thanks to the power of prayer and the grace of almighty God.” To assure the audience that he would defend them from supposed persecution of Christians by the left, Trump reprised his promise to create “a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias and its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America.” This is another way of telling his followers that they will be able to impose their ideology — against abortion, against LGBTQ freedom, against anything they consider part of the “woke” or “globalist” agenda — on the grounds that freedom for others, whether in the bedroom, examination room or classroom, is “anti-Christian.” The question of just how literally to take Trump’s assurance that Christians “won’t have to vote anymore” is almost besides the point. Long before 2028, Trump is promising his supporters in the religious right that he will bring about the Christian nationalist government that they seek. And democracy is not a priority for those who would be “turning our nation to the Lord.” The triumphant rollout of Harris’s presidential campaign has left Trump and his allies running scared. But he’s also playing a dangerous game with a base that has been hearing a great deal of very hot rhetoric about godly versus demonic forces, and about their political adversaries being “un-human.” Trump is trying to capitalize on all this hate, casting it as a religious war, and hoping to ride it to authoritarian rule."
Simone Biles just proved she’s so much bigger than her sport,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 4:44 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/simone-biles-gymnastics-olympics-2024-score-team-usa-rcna164406,"UPDATE (August 1, 2024 2:50 p.m. E.T.): Simone Biles won her eighth Olympic gold medal in the Olympics all-around final Thursday, making her the most decorated U.S. gymnast of all time. A couple of weeks ago, ESPN put together a list of the top 100 athletes of the 21st century. It’s the sort of clickbait designed to get talking heads arguing during a long summer. And there’s plenty to debate — I’d say Kobe Bryant and Floyd Mayweather are too high and Diana Taurasi and Barry Bonds are too low — but what I found most fascinating about the list was its top 10. With a quarter of the century gone, only three are still active: Lionel Messi (No. 3), LeBron James (No. 4) and Simone Biles (No. 7). Everybody else designated the top of the top is retired. And with all due respect to Messi and LeBron, both are in the valedictory periods of their careers: Neither is the best player in his sport anymore, and their grandest accomplishments are behind them. But Biles? Well, Biles has a way of making you still feel like she’s just getting started.  On Tuesday, in a return to the Olympic women’s team final — the event she famously withdrew from four years ago after suffering from what she called “the twisties” — Biles helped lead Team USA to its fourth women’s team gold medal ever and its third in the last four Olympics. It was a joyous moment for Biles and her teammates and a very strong start to Biles’ so-called redemption tour after she took two years off in the wake of her Tokyo Games collapse. Team USA is back on the top of the world again. Which means, of course, Biles is, as well. It’s Biles’ fifth Olympic gold and the eighth Olympic medal of her career, which makes her the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history. (She already has more golds than any other U.S. gymnast in history.) She’s now only three medals behind track star Allyson Felix for the most non-swimming Olympic medals in U.S. history. She also has three more chances this Olympics, in the vault, the balance beam and the floor exercise, to add to her total. Indeed, her floor routine is perhaps the most anticipated event of these whole Olympics. And that’s just her Olympic titles. When you add in world championships, she has a total of 38 medals, making her the most decorated gymnast in the history of the sport. The numbers keep going up. The numbers get so high, in fact, that they almost become difficult to comprehend. Biles’ withdrawal in Tokyo and subsequent mental health break was rightly praised as an unusually brave and honest response from a star athlete. But they shouldn’t overshadow just how truly incredible, and wholly dominant, an athlete she really is. Biles has ruled her sport in a way that no one in any sport has for more than a decade now. And here she is, still doing it. Biles is the oldest gymnast, at 27, to win a gold medal since 1964. (That’s another record she’s likely to break later this week.)  The closest parallel you can find to Biles may be Michael Jordan, who, after winning his third NBA title, famously took a nearly two-year break from the league to play baseball in the wake of his father’s murder. But ultimately, Biles has a story like no other. Besides talking openly and eloquently about mental health struggles, she has also shared her own heartbreaking experience as a victim of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. This is someone who experienced the unthinkable and not only survived it, but thrived — all while speaking out and empowering others to do the same. And she is, of course, not done. She will remain the story of these Games for the next fortnight, and, despite her advanced age (in gymnastics terms, anyway), she hasn’t yet spoken of retirement in any concrete terms. She’s the No. 9 athlete on ESPN’s top 100 — right now. But everything she does this week, and surely in the weeks and months and years to come, will keep pushing her up. Simone Biles is like nothing we have ever seen. She is literally unprecedented."
Wayne Brady gives an important lesson on the power of vulnerability,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 3:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/wayne-brady-reality-show-vulnerable-black-masculinity-rcna164055,"“Wayne Brady: The Family Remix,” a reality show documenting the lives of comedian Wayne Brady and his blended family — the second episode of which drops Wednesday — subverts mainstream representations of masculinity by centering expressions of male vulnerability and sexual fluidity. The Freeform series will explore, among other things, Brady’s journey of coming out as pansexual and how this forces him to confront and challenge his own internalized oppressive ideas of what it means to be a Black man.  I want to say up front, I am not a cisgender man nor am I Black. So my reflections on these themes are only relevant insofar as I have my own lived experience as a pansexual/queer man of color. I know what it’s like to be situated in a space of racial alterity and the many ways that complicates my relationship to my masculinity and sexuality, but pansexual/queer men of color are not a monolith. While I do not know what it’s like to be a Black cis man (which itself includes a near infinite range of lived experiences), I can offer reflections only as someone who’s read exhaustively about and has personally navigated some of the themes this show foregrounds.   The first episode was largely framed around Brady coming out to his friends Joe Nickson and Vincent Bragg, co-founders of the elite advertising agency ConCreates. Nickson and Bragg, who both identify as straight, were formerly incarcerated (primarily employing currently or formerly incarcerated people at their agency) — and Brady describes how coming out to them feels like a litmus test for how people within his circle might respond to the news.  Brady invites the duo over to his house for a meal with his family. Immediately, the viewer is offered a version of masculinity — specifically, Black masculinity — which both normalizes and embraces vulnerability.  “Honesty is me telling you what you ask me … Vulnerability is me volunteering that information,” Bragg says to the group. “I go to therapy twice a week, I’ve been to prison — that’s me volunteering information that you would not be able to see on me in a regular conversation. That’s me being vulnerable ‘cause now you can judge me. Vulnerability and masculinity — those two things go together, actually.” Brady connects this to his experience of fatherhood. “We are not taught ‘my vulnerability can be an asset.’ I know that I wasn’t taught that because my dad wasn’t around to be able to teach me. So I’m now tryna play catch up at 51 years. So, vulnerability is definitely something you have to learn and embrace.”  Nickson shares that his experience with fatherhood, and co-parenting specifically, has demanded he interrogate a lot of the same notions — and that observing Brady’s now convivial relationship with the partner (Jason Michael Fordham) of his ex-wife (Mandie Taketa) prompted him to ask: “What is masculinity and when do I divorce my ego?” Journalist, public health advocate, therapist and political commentator Araya Baker, whose work focuses on anti-oppressive frameworks, has written about Black toxic masculinity as a deeply embedded and necessary survival mechanism that leaves little room for vulnerability. “Beginning with slavery, America’s sociopolitical structures and institutions have upheld a racially stratified, patriarchal class system that, to varying degrees, has oppressed everyone except wealthy white men,” Baker wrote in The Mighty. “This reality, coupled with a desperation to escape racialized poverty, left Black men with no other choice but to attempt assimilating into the dominant culture.” While I subscribe more to bell hooks’ analyses of patriarchal masculinity as a violence enacted against all men — something I’ve written about before — it is unquestionable that men with less privilege and who are subjected to greater levels of oppression experience this kind of cultural violence to greater degrees. I’ve witnessed, first hand, Pakistani men in my family internalize deeply harmful expressions of white supremacist and patriarchal masculinity for the sake of assimilation or, in their case, survival. And this is precisely what makes the show’s representation of masculinity, inextricably bound with vulnerability, so exigent and perhaps even profound.   “I’m still struggling with this s---,” Brady says later, as he comes out to Nickson and Bragg. “Because of talking about the issues of, oh, how people see you and masculinity and all that stuff. Everybody has f------ s--- to say. But I’m not going to be unhappy 'cause I’m not living my truth, and there’s been a lot of shame around it.” Bragg responds to Brady’s news by describing how he started his business after getting out of prison — by leaning into his experience as someone who was incarcerated, rather than obscuring it, and by only concerning himself with the people with whom he had authentic connections and mutual support. “So, there’s 8 billion people on the earth,” he says. “I don’t need 8 billion people to f--- with me. … In order for me to get where I’m goin’, I just need my people.” Bragg’s response both defies Brady’s anxieties and offers a type of instantaneous receptiveness, which is rare.   Reality television, whether we love it or hate it and whether or not we want to admit it, has cultural significance in terms of how it reifies gender roles — most often promoting regressive representations of gender. “[T]aking reality TV seriously also means holding it accountable for its frequent awfulness,” Judy Berman, TIME’s TV critic wrote in 2022. “Shows are still edited to reinforce stereotypes, from the vapid blonde to the angry Black person to the sassy gay man.” This is to say nothing of the “gender essentialism” propagated by ubiquitous (hetero) dating shows, she adds.  Given this, I am prone to taking reality TV and its reductive narrative and character constructions with a grain of salt. And, at the same time, I don’t discount it when this genre of television — with its significant cultural impact (le sigh) — offers us something with a little more nuance and a little more humanity, just as “The Family Remix” seeks to do.

What to watch for in Arizona’s primaries Tuesday night,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 30, 2024, 2:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/arizona-2024-primary-races-to-watch-rcna164331,"Arizona is holding its nonpresidential primaries Tuesday, and there are several races to watch. Here are some of the ones I’m keeping an eye on. Last year, I referred to the race in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District — a seat being vacated by Rep. Debbie Lesko, a far-right Republican — as a “Mr. MAGA pageant.” And the GOP candidates — Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh, in particular — have really made that look like a great call as they’ve competed for MAGA voters’ affection in the deep-red district. This race is interesting because, as my MSNBC colleague Steve Benen wrote for the MaddowBlog, Hamadeh initially received former President Donald Trump’s sole endorsement. But just this week, Trump came out and also endorsed Masters, who’s a protégé of Peter Thiel’s — just like Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. The race for Maricopa County recorder — the Phoenix area’s top elections official — has come into focus as Trump allies have spread election falsehoods about Stephen Richer, the GOP incumbent. Richer is running in the GOP primary against state Rep. Justin Heap and Don Hiatt, who have both tried to sow distrust in the integrity of elections in Arizona. A win Tuesday for Richer, who has garnered bipartisan praise for standing up to election deniers, seems like the best way to keep a Republican in the recorder’s office. A victory by Heap or Hiatt could open the door for the Democratic candidate, Timothy Stringham, to win in November. I’ll also be watching the packed Democratic primary in Arizona’s 1st Congressional District. The district is currently represented by Rep. David Schweikert, and Democrats see the beleaguered Republican’s seat as one of the most vulnerable in Congress due to his ethics scandals. This is a district that I felt Democrats foolishly neglected in 2022, so the winner of this primary will have another shot at it. Former Arizona Democratic Party Chair Andrei Cherny appears to be in pole position, but recent polling showed the race as tight. Failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake seems likely to win her race against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in Arizona’s GOP primary for a U.S. Senate seat. But if she does, the margin could tell a deeper story. Lake has turned off Arizona Republicans, at times, particularly due to her attacks on fellow Republicans. If she merely ekes out a win, it could indicate weak Republican support for Lake — which certainly wouldn’t be ideal ahead of a general election matchup against the Democratic candidate, Rep. Ruben Gallego, who’s running unopposed in his primary."
