The Secret Service failed Trump. They can’t fail Harris too.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 2:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/secret-service-president-assassination-trump-harris-rcna163421,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 23 episode of ""The Last Word."" With just over 100 days until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris spent her first day as the presumptive nominee for president of the Democratic Party on the campaign trail in the crucial electoral college state of Wisconsin. Harris’ Secret Service detail, which was already very strong, should now be strengthened  — not just because she has moved up from vice presidential nominee to presidential nominee, but because we have seen recent proof of Secret Service protection not being strong enough. The director of the Secret Service resigned Tuesday after being sharply questioned by both Democrats and Republicans in a congressional hearing about how a lone gunman was allowed to get on a roof within range of a presidential candidate and fire shots that could have killed the candidate and did kill one of the spectators and wounded two others. That is the first time in history that a Secret Service director has resigned after shots were fired, even though every single time shots have been fired at a president since the creation of the Secret Service, after Abraham Lincoln’s presidency, it has always been the Secret Service’s fault. Every time.  In every single shooting, the Secret Service made the mistake of giving the shooters a clear shot. In 1901, the Secret Service allowed an assassin to walk right up to President William McKinley to shake his hand and instead revealed a handgun shooting the president to death. Congress had no hard questions for Secret Service Director John Wilkie after that, and the Secret Service director served another 10 years in that job after failing to protect the life of President McKinley. In 1933, two weeks before his inauguration, an assassin approached President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s car in Florida and fired shots that missed him but killed a mayor who was standing on the running board of the president-elect’s car. Once again, the Secret Service let an assassin with a gun get too close to the president-elect. Roosevelt was riding in an open car. It was an easy shot because it was an open car. The world was lucky that the assassin missed. Congress did not grill Secret Service Director William Moran who allowed that assassin to get so close to the president. Congress did not ask why Moran allowed the president-elect to ride in an open car. Moran served three more years as Secret Service director and continued to allow Roosevelt to ride fully exposed in an open car, which Roosevelt did throughout his presidency. Thirty years after those shots were fired at Roosevelt, shots fired at President John Fitzgerald Kennedy riding in the back of an open car took the life of the youngest president in history. As pieces of the president’s skull and brain tissue fell onto the surface of the open car behind President Kennedy’s head, his wife tried to reach back to grab those pieces while the fully incompetent Secret Service began climbing onto the back of the limousine and urging the first lady to stay in the car.       It was only after Kennedy was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, that afternoon that Secret Service Director James Rowley decided the president should never again ride in an open car. And no president ever has, since that day. If Rowley had made that decision one day before, American history would be so much less tragic. Rowley served 10 more years as Secret Service director after losing Kennedy on his watch because of his incompetence. Kennedy’s younger brother Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 while running for president.  The Secret Service provided protection to presidential candidates starting the day after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Bobby Kennedy’s assassin was able to walk up to him and shoot him point blank.  In 1975, the Secret Service allowed President Gerald Ford to be shot at twice within two weeks. Stuart Knight was the director of the Secret Service then. He allowed people with no firearms training to simply get too close to the president.  He’s the only Secret Service director in history who allowed the same president to be shot at twice. But he wasn’t finished. He became the only Secret Service director in history to allow two different presidents to be shot at.  He was in charge when the Secret Service allowed another completely untrained pedestrian with a handgun to walk up and get close enough to President Ronald Reagan to fire shots as the president was entering the Washington Hilton. In that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed the president’s press secretary to be shot. And in that shooting, the Secret Service also allowed a Secret Service agent to be shot. All because the Secret Service and Secret Service directors had not yet figured out how to prevent pedestrians from randomly walking up to presidents and firing handguns at them.  There was no condemnation of Knight after the Gerald Ford shootings — two in one month — or the Ronald Reagan shooting. He left the Secret Service after eight years as director.  The Secret Service got marginally better after some of these shootings. No more open cars. No more people allowed to get close to a president moving on foot in or out of a building.  And now the Secret Service thinks it has figured out how to protect Donald Trump at his rallies. The Washington Post reports that the Secret Service urged the Trump campaign to “stop scheduling large outdoor rallies and other outdoor events with big crowds.”  But at the outdoor rally in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service failed to do the elementary thing of securing every possible elevated firing position. The roof it decided not to secure was the roof the murderer used to fire at the candidate and his supporters. It was, as usual, the Secret Service’s fault. The Secret Service director was right to resign, but she should not have been the first to resign. The new acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, is a 24-year veteran of the Secret Service. We can only hope that he will provide the protection that allows this campaign to make it to Election Day with all of the big surprises being only political surprises.

Buttigieg hits back at JD Vance’s dig about ‘childless’ Democrats,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 2:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-pete-buttigieg-childless-cat-ladies-harris-rcna163504,"Sen. JD Vance, now in the spotlight as Donald Trump’s running mate, is being widely criticized for his past comments about “childless” Democrats, which have come under renewed scrutiny. “You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” he told Tucker Carlson on Fox News during his run for the Senate in 2021. “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has been floated as a potential vice presidential pick by Kamala Harris, addressed the Ohio Republican’s remarks in an interview with CNN. “The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,"" Buttigieg said. “He couldn’t have known that, but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children.” Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, announced in September 2021 that they had adopted newborn twins. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has talked about the struggles they dealt with in the adoption process, saying they had “some false starts and some heartbreaks.” And even though Harris is a stepmother to her two children, she has been subject to an oddly regressive line of attack from some Republicans, who insist that she’s not a real parent because she doesn’t have biological children. Vance, a natalist, has a host of bizarre, ultraconservative views on gender, as Politico pointed out. In his 2021 interview with Carlson, he also specifically denigrated women without children, saying:"

"Wednesday’s Mini-Report, 7.24.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 2:30 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/wednesdays-mini-report-72424-rcna163533,"Today’s edition of quick hits. * On Capitol Hill: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday delivered an impassioned speech to Congress, taking on protesters inside the House chamber and hundreds gathered outside the Capitol, while emphasizing the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship.” * In related news: “The Israeli parliament gave preliminary approval on Monday to a bill that declares the main United Nations relief organization for Palestinians a terrorist organization and proposes to sever relations with the body. The vote against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) is the latest step in a Israeli push against the agency, which Israeli leaders have accused of collaborating with the Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza.” * The latest on the investigation into the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania: “The gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump may have had a firearm with a collapsible stock, making it easier for him to carry and conceal the weapon, the director of the FBI testified Wednesday. The gunman also had researched President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, FBI Director Christopher Wray said.” * On a related note: “Former President Donald Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one where he was shot during an assassination attempt this month in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to two sources familiar with his campaign’s operations.” * An intensifying climate emergency: “Sunday’s record as the hottest day ever recorded on Earth lasted only one day. According to preliminary data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average temperature reached 17.15 degrees Celsius (62.87 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, toppling the prior day’s record of 17.09 C. In other words, the planet had its two warmest days back-to-back this week.” * Occasionally in Congress, bills pass: “A federal bill that would allow victims of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes to sue people who create, share and receive them has unanimously passed the Senate and now moves to the House for a vote. The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (Defiance) Act of 2024, introduced by Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., would create a federal civil remedy for identifiable victims of deepfake sexual abuse.” * Following up on our earlier coverage: “The Justice Department’s inspector general on Wednesday blamed ‘ineffectual leadership’ and not political interference for the softening of Roger Stone’s sentencing recommendation in February 2020 after his conviction for lying to Congress. The report upheld an account by then-Attorney General William P. Barr but also found that line prosecutors’ suspicions of political meddling by President Donald Trump’s administration were not unreasonable.” * And while this might sound like a weird joke, it’s quite real: “Scientists have found traces of cocaine in wild sharks off the coast of Brazil, in a discovery that highlights the risks to marine life of the illegal cocaine trade.” See you tomorrow."
Trump's defamation case against ABC after Carroll verdict can proceed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 2:22 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-defamation-abc-e-jean-carroll-verdict-rcna163499,"After Donald Trump was found liable last year for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, the federal judge overseeing that New York case explained that the jury had essentially found that Trump had raped her, as that term is commonly understood. Nonetheless, a federal judge in Florida has allowed Trump’s defamation claim against ABC and George Stephanopoulos to proceed, based on the anchor’s use of the term “rape” to describe the jury’s verdict. Here’s why. As a refresher, the Carroll jury found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed her, but it didn’t find that Trump had raped her. The New York federal judge who presided over that case, Lewis Kaplan, downplayed the distinction when he rejected Trump’s challenge to the jury’s multimillion dollar award as excessive, reasoning that just because the jury declined to find that Carroll had been raped under New York law, that didn’t mean she failed to prove Trump raped her “as many people commonly understand the word.” Kaplan likewise rejected Trump’s defamation claim against Carroll for her saying that he had raped her. This new decision stems from Stephanopoulos’ March interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in which he questioned her support for Trump despite him being “found liable for rape.” Stephanopoulos repeated that phrase several times during the interview. ABC and Stephanopoulos argued that the former president’s defamation claim is foreclosed by the New York court’s findings. But on Wednesday, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the Southern District of Florida rejected the defense motion to dismiss Trump’s case. (If Altonaga’s name sounds familiar, that may be because the George W. Bush appointee reportedly urged U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to step aside from Trump’s classified documents case.) In Trump’s defamation suit, Altonaga distinguished Carroll’s claim that Trump had raped her from Stephanopoulos’ characterization of the jury verdict as having found that Trump had raped her. The judge determined that a reasonable jury could interpret the anchor’s statements as defamatory. Yet, she made clear that she wasn’t necessarily agreeing that Trump had been defamed; rather, the judge’s legal determination was that the defense didn’t present a strong enough argument to dismiss Trump’s case at this stage of litigation. “Defendants may very well convince a reasonable factfinder to follow Judge Kaplan’s reasoning or to adopt other reasoning leading to the conclusion that Stephanopoulos’s statements were not defamatory,” Altonaga wrote, adding that a jury that views the segment may find sufficient context to conclude Trump wasn’t defamed.  In some respects, the ruling is like another recent Trump defamation win in Florida. In that state court case, he beat a motion to dismiss his claim against Pulitzer Prize Board members and staff, related to a statement about his 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia. As with the Carroll-related claim, the rejection of that motion to dismiss doesn’t mean that Trump will ultimately prevail — only that his case can proceed.

Trump camp denies nephew's allegation that Donald Trump used racial slur,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 1:59 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-racial-slur-fred-trump-iii-nephew-book-rcna163500,"A new book by Donald Trump’s nephew Fred Trump III, a real estate executive, recounts an incident in which the presidential candidate allegedly used a racial slur after his car was damaged. The allegation appears in Fred Trump’s book, ""All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way,"" and is cited to offer insight into the ways in which Donald Trump has allegedly engaged in overt racism.  As The Guardian reported, based on an advance copy of the book the outlet obtained ahead of its release next week:  In response to the report, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told NBC News, “This is completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order.” Trump has faced previous allegations by his family that he’s used racial slurs. Mary Trump, Fred Trump III’s sister, published a book in 2020 that alleged Trump was known to use racist and antisemitic slurs. She told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow at the time that the N-word was among the slurs her uncle used. A spokesperson for Trump’s White House called Mary Trump's book at the time ""a book of falsehoods, plain and simple” and said Trump “doesn’t use those words.” Trump’s team has also had to bat away similar claims made by nonfamily members. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former Trump business associate and White House aide, claimed in 2018 that she’d personally heard a tape of Trump using the N-word during filming of NBC’s “The Apprentice”; Manigault Newman repeated the claim in her book published that year. As with the allegations made by Trump’s niece and nephew, this allegation of racism was disputed — at the time by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who dismissed the former aide as “a disgruntled former White House employee"" who was “trying to profit off these false attacks.” And a former ""Apprentice"" producer, Bill Pruitt, published an essay in Slate this year in which he said he was present to hear the former president use the N-word during the show's first season (Cheung disputed Pruitt's account in a statement to Slate, saying, “This is a completely fabricated and bull---- story that was already peddled in 2016”). Much of Trump's racist behavior and racist rhetoric has been public and well documented over the years. This latest allegation from his nephew — taken together with previous allegations — suggests his private persona might be a bit more bigoted than his public one."
"Mike Johnson insists Kamala Harris’ race and gender are irrelevant, as Republicans keep calling her a ‘DEI hire’",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 12:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/republicans-kamala-harris-dei-hire-race-gender-rcna163484,"As the ugly attacks on Kamala Harris from the right take shape, House GOP leaders are warning their fellow Republicans not to focus on her race or gender in their criticism of the de facto Democratic presidential nominee. The racist and misogynistic attacks on the vice president from conservative commentators and GOP lawmakers began almost immediately after she announced that she will seek her party’s nomination. Some lawmakers have called her a “DEI hire,” suggesting that Harris — who has served as a U.S. senator, a California attorney general and a San Francisco district attorney — is where she is due to identity politics and not because of her accomplishments. It appears that the top brass in the House GOP are trying to steer members of their party away from such bigoted attacks. At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, urged his party members to instead focus on Harris’ record with the Biden administration, Politico reported. Afterward, House Speaker Mike Johnson told Politico that this election “has nothing to do with race” and that it’s a comparison between the two candidates’ strengths and their ideas for how to solve the country’s problems. “This election will be about policies and not personalities,” the Louisiana Republican told reporters after the meeting, according to The Associated Press. “This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris, and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.” Whether such calls will sink in among House Republicans remains to be seen — they certainly do not seem to have gotten through to their presidential nominee. According to NBC News, while on a call hosted by the Republican National Committee on Tuesday, Donald Trump accused Harris of having “played the race card on a level you rarely see” in debates with Joe Biden during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2020."
JD Vance hopes voters won't dwell on his far-right abortion views,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 12:13 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-hopes-voters-wont-dwell-far-right-abortion-views-rcna163510,"Before settling on his new running mate, Donald Trump was reportedly worried about something specific: whether his choice would be seen as too far to the right on abortion rights. The Republican realized that the issue has been a real problem for his party, and he apparently feared the impact on his 2024 candidacy. NBC News quoted a source close to Trump in March saying, “He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position.” With this in mind, the former president appears to have made the wrong choice. Sen. JD Vance isn’t just a far-right opponent of abortion rights; the Ohio Republican also has publicly endorsed a national ban, supports enforcement of the Comstock Act, had a campaign website that described him as “100 percent pro-life” (under a headline that read, “END ABORTION”) and endorsed his home state’s six-week ban. What’s more, Talking Points Memo ran a related report, noting that the Biden administration finalized new regulations under HIPAA that limited law enforcement access to medical records tied to reproductive health. Eight Republican senators pushed back against the administration’s efforts — and Vance was one of the eight. The word “staunch” keeps coming to mind. But as Politico reported this week, Vance is hoping voters don’t dwell too much on his views and positions when it comes to reproductive rights, and will instead focus on Trump’s leave-it-to-the-states approach. In other words, the GOP’s vice presidential nominee isn’t denying his far-right views on abortion rights so much as he’s arguing that his far-right views on abortion rights aren’t especially relevant because he won’t be at the top of his party’s ticket. At first blush, that might sound vaguely reasonable. Throughout American history, when there have been differences between running mates on the same party’s ticket, it’s the candidate at the top who makes the final call about the prevailing position. But a lingering question hangs overhead: If voters return Trump to the White House and he were unable to complete his term for whatever reason, Vance would be elevated to the Oval Office. Would he stick to Trump’s far-right position, or his own even-further-to-the-right position? Or put another way, the senator would have people believe he’d only be the vice president. And while that’s true, (a) vice presidents often have influence over the administration’s agenda, especially when their presidents are indifferent toward governing and public policy; and (b) vice presidents sometimes become presidents. For its part, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign team said in a statement: “JD Vance is telling voters not to believe their own eyes and ears when he calls to ban abortion nationwide, rejects exceptions for rape or incest, and compares abortion to slavery. Voters aren’t buying his pathetic excuses — they know that the Trump-Vance ticket is all in on Project 2025, and that the only way to stop them is by voting for Kamala Harris this November.”"
Mike Johnson warns Congress and its guests that disrupting Netanyahu could mean arrest,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/netanyahu-congress-speech-2024-mike-johnson-arrest-rcna163471,"Ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial joint address to Congress on Wednesday, several lawmakers announced they won’t be attending.  Some — like Rep. Sara Jacobs, who wrote an article for MSNBC, and even Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie — made clear in their announcements that their absence is an act of protest. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying his damnedest to prevent any expressions of dissent from disrupting Netanyahu's speech. In an effort to pre-empt protests in the room, Johnson sent out a Dear Colleague letter on Tuesday in which he threatened the arrest of anyone in the galleries who interrupts the speech. Should members of Congress create ""a disturbance,"" Johnson said the sergeant at arms will intervene. Protests by guests at congressional hearings can routinely result in arrests. Last year, 10 protesters were arrested last year at a hearing on the Israel-Gaza war, and the father of a Parkland shooting victim was arrested at a hearing on gun regulations. Johnson made a similar threat in Milwaukee last week at an RNC-adjacent event hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition.  “There’s a number of Democrats in the House who have said they’re going to boycott the event,” he said, “and then some others are gonna protest. Listen, we’re gonna have extra sergeants at arms on the floor, and if anybody gets out of hand, the Speaker of the House will bang the gavel — we’re gonna arrest people if we have to do it. We’re gonna get the message out."" The message got out. Although it seems to contradict Republicans' claim that they're the “America First,” pro-free speech party, here’s one of their leaders threatening Americans with arrest if they protest a foreign leader speaking before the U.S. Congress."
"Live from Highlands, NC: Back to Manhattan",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-live-highlands-nc-rcna163485,"On Monday, July 22nd, MSNBC legal analysts Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord spoke at a live event at the Center for Life Enrichment in Highlands, North Carolina. They touched on President Biden’s historic decision to exit the race, and the legal ramifications it could hold for Trump’s continuing criminal cases. Mary and Andrew also address the question of whether a president can pardon himself, and to what extent. And they detail the reasoning laid out in Trump’s motion to vacate his New York conviction based on the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity, and if any of the arguments hold water.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, and welcome to Prosecuting Donald Trump. I’m Andrew Weissman, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Hi, Andrew. So we’ve got something special today. On Monday, July 22nd, Andrew and I participated in a live event at the Highland Cashiers Center for Life Enrichment in North Carolina. Andrew Weissmann: That’s a mouthful. Mary McCord: It is a mouthful. It’s one of those rare occasions when we get to do this in person, which is always very special and in front of a live audience. Andrew Weissmann: I know. It was really, really fun. I was there last year, and this year, you and I got to do it live together, which is always actually really nice. So, it was a fantastic event. We wanted to share it with you in this episode. It’s great to actually have a live event with an audience. So without further ado, here are some highlights from the conversation that Mary and I had. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) (APPLAUSE) Andrew Weissmann: It’s so nice to see you all. I was here last year, and I’m so glad to be invited back with my much better half. For those of you who listen to our podcast, you’ll know that we don’t script anything, and now you will actually really be able to witness that that is certainly true. You might be thinking it’s better if we do script it. So this reminds me, we were doing a live show in Austin, Texas -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Texas last year. Andrew Weissmann: -- and with Chris Hayes, and I looked over, and Mary and Chris, their microphones are perfectly placed, and mine was just, let’s just say it fell down into a location and just stayed there and so, I’m known on our podcast for telling anecdotes. I think that’s the main source of why I’m here. But anyway, so the first part of our discussion, we were planning on talking about a motion that Donald Trump has made in the New York criminal case where he was convicted that is based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. And we’re still going to do that and talk a bit about the immunity decision, give you a quick overview of it, just in case anyone is living under a rock, doesn’t know exactly what it is, but just to give a little context and then talk about that motion. And we’re still going to do that. However, there was some news and it doesn’t involve the change in chamber music program yesterday. It’s a little bit more national in scope. Mary McCord: International, I would say. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: That’s right. Yes. So we will start by talking about President Biden’s decision yesterday, and specifically not so much what that has to do with who will be the next candidate, but what impact that may have on these prosecutions. Andrew Weissmann: And I have to say, when you’re on MSNBC or doing these sort of short news clips, I think of it as like speaking in haiku. You know, the hard part of it is how do you shrink something down into a short amount of time. And we both get tons and tons of e-mails and people saying, but you didn’t explain, and we’re like, well, that’s true because as you know, it’s like -- Mary McCord: Because we had five minutes and they were already, the producer was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. Andrew Weissmann: Right. If you want to know what’s going on in our year, it’s usually it’s like, and you’re done. So probably me a lot more than Mary. So I remember when Rebecca Kutler, who came up with this idea, I was like, there’s no audience for that. I mean, what are you going to call the podcast, two nerds? And sure enough, she was right. There were people who did want that deeper dive. And the description of two nerds is probably one that at the end of this presentation, you’ll be able to judge for yourself that that would probably would have been a better title than “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” But anyway, that was the genesis of it. And it’s sort of been great. And I have to say, just working with Mary for the last year plus, it is also very calming because a lot of times things happen and people say like, how do you stay so calm on air? And a lot of it is when you’re thinking about having to do a podcast for like, you know, 30 minutes or 45 minutes on something, you get it all out of your system beforehand so that you can really sort of calm down and figure out what’s the best way to sort of explain this. So if you think all of us are naturally, or both of us are naturally calm, it’s all of that’s, the non-calm part is happening off screen. Mary McCord: Right. Right. Except for occasionally Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: And this is just to tell you how great it is to interact with those who listen is we had a whole episode, I think, after one of Judge Cannon’s decisions. I don’t remember which one anymore because -- Andrew Weissmann: Because there’s so many to choose from. Mary McCord: -- yes, exactly, yeah. That triggered Andrew, and then so I sure enough, like and we talked about this for, you know, many times. I’m triggered, I’m triggered. So a couple of days later, I get this e-mail from somebody who is listening to the podcast. And then he said, I was on vacation in Oregon, and I passed by this street and I had to take a picture. And it was Trigger Avenue, literally a street sign. So that became our next week’s name of our podcast, Trigger Avenue. And we both took a nice little stroll down Trigger Avenue. So anyway. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, let’s start. Mary McCord: Shall we -- Andrew Weissmann: So, we obviously don’t do political commentary. That’s not our background. We don’t have anything really interesting to say that would be useful more than just as we can react like citizens, but our background is not sort of political pundits or pollsters or anything like that. So we looked at the and thought about the announcement yesterday in terms of what does it mean in terms of the legal ramifications, whether it’s the four criminal cases or even some of the civil cases involving Donald Trump. So, Mary. Mary McCord: Well, obviously, if Donald Trump wins in November, that will be the end of the of the two federal cases. And so President Biden deciding that he’s not running doesn’t necessarily change what that outcome will be, but it just feeds into this election will determine many, many things far beyond these criminal cases. But if he is reelected as president, as probably most of you in the room know, he will be able to direct his Department of Justice to dismiss those federal cases. And that was actually true even before the immunity ruling. But it remains, I’d say, even more true now because the Supreme Court has explicitly held that it is one of the president’s core constitutional powers to, through his Department of Justice, make decisions about the investigation and prosecution of cases. And that is something that I think many of us wouldn’t have thought were part of his core presidential powers. We thought, yes, he’s the head of the executive branch. Certainly, he can direct his attorney general to do things as a matter of policy, prioritize certain types of cases. Let’s say sometimes presidents want to prioritize white collar fraud cases. Others want to prioritize violent drug trafficking cases, right? That’s kind of normal. But what has, through the years, developed within the Department of Justice and the White House is a set of norms that says we want the public to feel confident that prosecutions and investigations are not being made for political purposes. And so we will, by our own internal guidance, we will direct that there is separation between the Department of Justice and the White House. So at the Department of Justice, in my tenure and Andrew’s tenure, every attorney general that I worked under, and I worked there for well over 20 years, Republican and Democratic, would always put out a new memo that, you know, prosecutors are not to be communicating to the White House about decisions about investigations or prosecutions, with some exceptions in national security areas, mostly because the president shouldn’t be surprised if we have extradited a terrorist to come to the U.S. to be tried, right. He should know about that in advance because that would be pretty monumental. White House also has always had a set of memos. Every White House counsel, Republican and Democratic, have always put out similar guidance. The White House should not be directing the attorney general or the Department of Justice about individual investigations and prosecutions. But that’s not constitutionally required. And so one of the real consequences of this election when it comes to the ongoing cases is there would definitely be that power to direct that those cases be dismissed. Now, the president can’t direct that state prosecutions be dismissed. The president can’t direct that civil cases brought by people like E. Jean Carroll or even the state attorney general in New York, a civil case, he can’t direct that those things be dismissed. He can only direct his own Department of Justice. So as we come into this election, it’s obviously on the Democratic side, you know, a whole process right now of having another nominee to take President Biden’s place. And we have just a matter of months, but the outcome will have a real impact on these cases. Andrew Weissmann: So I add embroidery to the substance. And the one thing to note is a lot of times people talk about whether a president can pardon himself. And that is an issue that has not been decided by the Supreme Court. And given the Supreme Court, I hope they don’t get to decide it, but it’s also not something that is necessary because as Mary pointed out, the new president can just say, drop this investigation. He doesn’t have to worry about pardoning himself. He can just be like, you’re not going to prosecute, you know, to depersonalize it. The president could be like, you’re not going to prosecute Democrats and you’re only going to prosecute Republicans, or you’re only going to go after Muslims and you’re not going to go after, you know, white Protestants, or pick whatever hypotheticals you want. And so the president has this enormous power, particularly under the immunity decision to have these kinds of communications with the Department of Justice just to denigrate the immunity decision, which for one second, one of the things is when Mary noted that the decision said that within the president’s core powers, the Supreme Court said includes the communications between the president and the attorney general, they specifically noted the context of that was communications about bringing a sham investigation. And the Supreme Court said that is absolutely immune. I mean, so remember that those were the charged allegations in the January 6th case. They are now out of the case conclusively in a 6-3 decision. And so there’s enormous power and I do think that one of the things when I was thinking about what happened yesterday is something that Joe Biden said when the immunity decision came out was he that night went on air. And I thought in a pretty remarkable way, and again, I’m trying to sort of keep this depoliticized. He said, just in terms of the presidency, you had the sitting president of the United States saying the decision today to give the presidency, the position I hold, more power is wrong. And that just is remarkable, that sort of self-restraint and understanding the role that the presidency has and the limits of that role in what’s supposed to be a system of checks and balances, I thought was remarkable that you had that happening on the day of the decision. The second thought I had, which is a bit of a factoid, is that the fact that Kamala Harris, if she ends up being the nominee, which it looks like she will be, is that you have a former prosecutor and the contrast in terms of the rule of law where you have just looking at the absolute, you know, black and white facts, is you have a former prosecutor on one side and you have somebody who is a convicted felon. Regardless of what you think of the case, a jury listened to the evidence and found beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of 34 felonies and is facing charges in two other cases. And we’ll talk about it. I didn’t say three others because the case in Mar-a-Lago is now not just technically, it is -- Mary McCord: But actually dismissed. Andrew Weissmann: -- it is actually dismissed by the district court. That is likely to be appealed. So I just think that contrast of the rule of law being on the ballot as well as the Supreme Court is, I think, going to be really heightened and brought to the fore by the background of the two candidates. Mary McCord: And that reminds me, when I was saying the president, if Donald Trump wins, could dismiss the cases against him, that only assumes that somehow there is by then a Mar-a-Lago case because there is not one right now. We want to dig in now, we have already talked on a couple of episodes about we’ve gone through fairly extensively the immunity decision and its consequences, not only for the January 6th case and what Judge Chutkan in the D.C. District Court will be tasked with doing as that case comes back to her. We’ve also talked a little bit about the consequences more broadly for the government. But there is a specific aspect of the opinion that really is pertinent to the Manhattan case where there’s already been these guilty verdicts. And I’m sure all of you are aware that immediately following that opinion, Mr. Trump’s attorneys filed a motion before Judge Merchan in Manhattan seeking to have those verdicts set aside on the grounds that official acts evidence was introduced into evidence at that trial and should not have been in accordance, if this is Mr. Trump’s argument, should not have been in accordance with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. And so since that notice, they have filed a full brief, 50-something pages, and we are now awaiting Alvin Bragg, the D.A., to file his opposition, which is due in two days on the 24th, if I have my days correct. And then Judge Merchan has actually already announced that he will make a decision on that September 6th. And on September 18th, they will either move forward with sentencing or not move forward with sentencing, depending, of course, on what his decision is on the 6th. So we are in the midst of, you know, very significant briefing on a very significant issue that is directly about how do we apply the Supreme Court’s ruling. (END AUDIO TAPE) Mary McCord: Okay, let’s pause here. After the break, more from my discussion with Andrew from the Highlands Cashiers Center for Life Enrichment in North Carolina. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: So the reason it’s useful to do that sort of TikTok, it’s a phrase, by the way, which apparently I can’t use anymore, as my NYU students, like, keep me up to date with what anyone in the last 20 years has been doing. Mary McCord: But it’s too bad, because it’s a great phrase. Andrew Weissmann: I know. Mary McCord: Like, what’s the TikTok? Andrew Weissmann: A lot of people correctly are thinking, what in God’s green earth does an immunity decision about what you can do as president have to do with the New York criminal case? Because the New York criminal case was about conduct that, to a large extent, involved what candidate Trump was doing. And the decision was not about immunity for a candidate. It was immunity for a president. And so you’re thinking, well, this is clearly just personal conduct that was taking place either before he was president, or to the extent that it sort of spilled over to a time period that he was president. It might be a time period that he was president, but its conduct, the alleged criminal conduct, was personal, as if you got into a car accident or robbed a bank or did something, you know, you just did on your own time, but not as president. So how can the immunity decision have any consequence? And that is something we talked about, I think, last episode, but we didn’t really dig into. And the answer is that amongst the many things that that decision did, and this is one of the more outrageous, because it basically just takes the president, I think, almost completely off the hook for any criminal liability, is they said that a prosecutor cannot use official conduct, even to prove up that evidence of official conduct, to prove up a case, even if that underlying case is for unofficial conduct. Mary McCord: And is it worth pausing there to just give the three areas of immunity? I know you’ve all read the decision, right? And all the concurrences and dissents. No, seriously, I’m sure you’ve heard a lot about it. But just since we’re going to dig into this one aspect, just a real quick overview. Basically, the Supreme Court, you know, divides cases that involve a president to three pieces and says, you start with core presidential functions for which the president is absolutely immune. And the controversy there about that ruling, because I think just saying that is not controversial. In fact, even the government’s attorney, Michael Dreeben, who both of us know very well from our years in government, argued, yes, we agree, before the Supreme Court, there would be some core presidential functions for which a president couldn’t be prosecuted. These are things like the things that actually appear in the Constitution, like the pardon power, the veto power, things like that. The Supreme Court defined it much, much more broadly, as we were indicating, like essentially anything you do as head of the executive branch and many other things. So that’s a problem. But core presidential functions, absolute immune. There’s no balancing test or anything like that. Just can’t prosecute for it. Andrew Weissmann: And one thing that’s interesting is a concurrence by Amy Coney Barrett, I thought, laid out sort of the rationale in a way that’s, I think, very easy to understand as to how she thought about absolute immunity in that core area. She just said, look, if it’s a core area, what you’re really asking the court to look at is could Congress act in any way to criminalize that conduct or to regulate that conduct? And if it’s something that’s been exclusively given to the president by the Constitution, then Congress doesn’t have that power. It can’t go into that area. It has been given solely to the president. And as she said, in that limited number of areas that are in the Constitution, she just said the way to think about it is that’s just not something that Congress has the power to criminalize or even, frankly, civilly regulate. And so that was sort of the big issue, as Mary said, is that that sort of small area was interpreted quite broadly. Mary McCord: Because the majority does, you know, say something similar, but comes at it from a different perspective. They say in this broad view of core presidential functions, Congress is disabled from legislating and courts are disabled from examining it. So absolute immunity means in that most capacious description would be really calls into question, can Congress do oversight of the Department of Justice? What happens with the appropriations of funds? I mean, we could go on and on and on. So that’s that first bucket. The next piece is then a court who’s looking at an indictment has to decide are the charges in that indictment then outside core presidential, are they official acts or unofficial acts? Unofficial acts, purely private conduct, reimbursing a lawyer for paying hush money to a porn star, purely private conduct, unofficial act, can be prosecuted for that. But they’ve said when you’re deciding between official and unofficial, you can’t take the president’s motives into consideration. You have to just parse it separately. And within what they call the outer perimeter of official acts, again, looking sort of broadly at what might be an official act, then there is at least presumptive immunity. Maybe absolute, we’ll decide that later if we ever have to, but at least a presumption of immunity that can only be rebutted if the prosecutor can establish that there would be no danger of intrusion on the president’s executive authority and functions by that prosecution. This is a lot of gobbledygook, I understand. So there’s a lot of work that the court sent back to Judge Chutkan. They said the direction to the attorney general to tell states that they were investigating fraud in the election, that’s off limits. That’s absolutely immune. He can’t be prosecuted for. Communications with his vice president, Mike Pence, that’s at least presumptively part of his official acts. And so, Judge Chutkan, you have to determine whether the prosecution can rebut that it would not intrude on the functions of the executive to prosecute for his pressure on Mike Pence, right, to count the fraudulent votes on January 6th. And then these other areas, the pressure on state legislators and state legislatures and the fraudulent elector scheme and the tweets, you know, be there, be wild, and we’re going to march down the street and tell Congress what we think. And if Mike Pence had had courage, you know, we wouldn’t be in this position. All that sent back to the judge to determine official, unofficial. And they put some guidance there, and we talked about it at our last podcast. And then the thing we want to talk about today, this is a very long wind-up, is the other thing they said, which is that special counsel says, argues, and special counsel did, that official acts, even though special counsel will understand things that are immune from prosecution, you cannot base your indictment on that, but you could introduce as evidence official acts in order to prove, say, let’s say, knowledge and intent and things like that, absence of mistake when it comes to the personal conduct. And this is something that the chief had suggested at argument that he very much thought, yes, you should be able to do that. Andrew Weissmann: Chief Justice Roberts. Mary McCord: Chief Justice. And he’s the one who wrote the majority opinion, but he really reversed course on that in his opinion and said essentially that would eviscerate the immunity that they are providing to the president because it would allow the prosecutor to get into evidence, the very things that get into the president’s deliberations and his thinking as president, and it would prevent him from taking the kind of bold and fearless actions that presidents need to take if they’re worried not only that they might be prosecuted for them, but even that evidence might be examined by a jury. And this was remarkable for many reasons. This is where Justice Barrett disagreed and actually dissented from that, and then it -- Andrew Weissmann: So this is part of the decision. This is 5-4. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: This is not 6-3. This issue of can official conduct be evidence in an unofficial case. Just to be clear, what this is all about is the Manhattan case. To my mind, there is no question that that is exactly what the Supreme Court was focused on. They had an unofficial conduct in the Manhattan case, and you had a 5-4 decision saying that if there was official evidence that was put on in that case, the court’s going to have to look at that to see whether that was allowed and whether it was permissible. That is the issue that is going on now because then we’re going to the substance of what Donald Trump is claiming was the official evidence that was used in a case that clearly is about unofficial conduct and that 5-4 decision that is leading to this problem in the Manhattan case. And the rationale, there’s two paragraphs of this long immunity decision, and the court gives two, I think, very, very flimsy rationales for why this should even be a problem to introduce official conduct. One is that if you allow juries to hear this and a president knows that his, or maybe her, official conduct will be introduced at a trial in the future, it will distort, that’s the phrase, it will distort his decision-making process. Just think about that. Like if you thought that a jury in a criminal case for your unofficial conduct, your personal conduct, might hear about something you did as president within your official acts, that will sort of unduly distort what you’re doing. Mary McCord: And you’ll be jailed going forward as president. Andrew Weissmann: And Ketanji-Brown Jackson said basically to that, good, that’s what you want. That deterrence is a good thing, not a bad thing. Just sort of directly took it on in really terrific language, in my view. The second argument, which is, I think, even weaker for why this is a problem, is that the five justices on this part of the opinion said that a jury cannot be trusted to separate the policies of a president they may disagree with from anything else in the case and we cannot rely on normal criminal rules about keeping prejudicial evidence out, about balancing, that categorically a jury cannot be trusted, meaning this is not something that we’re going to allow a judge to sort of balance and decide case by case, which is the normal rule, because of the concern that a jury couldn’t hear this evidence and be fair. I think it’s really useful to think about that rationale when we go through the specifics of the Manhattan case that are being charged, because when you look at the specifics, it so belies that notion. Remember, this is a jury that by definition is hearing, that can be trusted to decide a case involving a former president for unofficial conduct. That you can go forward on because the Supreme Court hasn’t said, oh, they just can’t hear the case at all because they couldn’t be fair. So the tipping point for them is, but if you introduce anything within the broad official acts as defined by the Supreme Court that the president takes, such as a tweet or a conversation with the communications director -- Mary McCord: Well, hang on. We’re going to come back to that. We’re going to come back to that. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, but I’m just saying that’s the issue that gets created. So anyway, so let’s turn to the specifics. Mary McCord: Okay, but the one little area of hope, I guess, that the Chief Justice said in response to Justice Barrett’s dissent here, because Justice Barrett said, in this example, suppose you have bribery, a president offering an ambassadorship in return for a bribe payment, a monetary payment. It’s an official act to appoint an ambassador. So are you saying that the government could not put on evidence of the ambassadorial appointment? Because how could you ever prove bribery? Bribery is definitely an unofficial personal act. Supreme Court even agrees with that. But how would you prove it? And what the Chief Justice says in a footnote in response to Justice Barrett is, but of course, the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact the president performed the official act, made the ambassadorial appointment, right? And the prosecutor may admit evidence of what the president allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or agreed to receive in return for being influenced in the performance of that act, because receiving money would be personal, not official. But what the prosecutor may not do is admit testimony or private records of the president or his advisors probing the official act itself. And the reason I’m reading this to you is because I think this is something that essentially Donald Trump’s attorneys, when they swing for the fences in their motion in New York, they really ignore that footnote. Andrew Weissmann: And one of the issues for the courts going forward is that footnote is really hard to understand the difference between the second sentence and the third sentence of, you know, not being able to explore the testimony or the advisors as to why, in the case of an appointment of an ambassador in exchange for a bribe, you know, the government would normally be needing to show, well, it’s this for that. Mary McCord: It’s this corrupt quid pro quo. Andrew Weissmann: But let’s assume that the advisor had taped evidence of the president saying, oh, I’m going to do it for this reason. He’s actually or she is not qualified to be ambassador, but this is why I’m going to do it. It’s not totally clear from that footnote what evidence is allowed, which is, by the way, it’s insane that this is something that we’re all considering. And Chief Justice Roberts’ footnote gives sort of something for both sides to argue about what is that line as to what gets allowed. So, Donald Trump, so first, just to be clear, as a defendant in a criminal case, a Supreme Court case comes down, it gives him arguments to make, and neither of us has anything against that. That is what defendants are entitled to do is make arguments based on the law and the facts. And as long as it’s made in good faith, that’s part of our process. Mary McCord: And that includes when it comes down after the trial and before sentencing, right? Because you can bring arguments on appeal based on new case law, where things start looking questionable in terms of retroactivity is if you have a case that has been a criminal case that has been tried, convicted, appeals affirmed, it’s, you know, 10 years in the rearview mirror, new case comes down. Does that impact retroactively? But when it comes down before the appeal, generally speaking, you can raise issues on appeal. There are other issues here about whether this was waived by Mr. Trump or whether he failed to bring a timely motion before trial, and that will all get litigated. I think we’ll see that in Alvin Bragg’s opposition. But we’ll also see him arguing the merits that these things, and we’re going to go through the list, are not official acts. (END AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: Okay, let’s take a quick break. When we’re back, more from our discussion from the Highlands Cashier Center for Life Enrichment in North Carolina. (ADVERTISEMENT) (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: So I’m going to jump to sort of the key problem, and then we’ll talk about some of the other issues because as Mary said, Donald Trump gave a laundry list of anything that could arguably be official, and there are various responses that we expect the state to make in two days. But there is one key area that I think is worth discussing, and then we can sort of backtrack to things that we think are probably less of an issue, and that is Hope Hicks. So Hope Hicks, as you may recall, took the stand, and she gave a lot of evidence that had to do with the time period before Donald Trump was president. There’s no issue there. Mary McCord: And that’s because she was working with the campaign when he was a candidate, right? And they were doing damage control. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: That’s all personal. Andrew Weissmann: So that’s going to be fine, and there can’t be a claim about that. So the issue arises because, in addition to talking about what happened in 2016 and for instance, she was describing what it was like when the “Access Hollywood” tape came out and the reaction, and that was sort of part of the state’s case in terms of motive for the crimes, but she then talked about two things in 2018. So that is when Donald Trump is president, and she has an official role at the White House leading communications with the public. So you have the president and a sort of senior official having a conversation, and the two types of things that are said, one has to do with -- Mary McCord: I have them on my screen, if you want. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah, perfect. Mary McCord: Okay. So one is when “The Wall Street Journal,” I guess, had reported that Michael Cohen had claimed, and they had him quoted as saying, he made the decision to pay Stormy Daniels in order to, you know, keep the story of their alleged sexual encounter in order to keep that out of the press right before the election. He said he paid that hush money without Mr. Trump knowing it, out of the goodness of his heart. And so Hope Hicks was asked about this, and she reported that she had a conversation with Mr. Trump about it, and it was “New York Times,” not “Wall Street Journal,” I apologize. I believe it was the day after, this is Hope Hicks testifying. The morning after Michael, that’s Michael Cohen, had given a statement to “The New York Times” saying that he had, in fact, made this payment without Mr. Trump’s knowledge. Mr. Trump was saying that he had spoken to Michael and that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that, you know, Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that’s what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart. He never told anybody about it, you know, and he was continuing to try to protect him until the point where he felt like he had to state what was true. And this is what Hope Hicks testified that Donald Trump told her when he was president, and she was his communications director. She was then basically asked, you know -- Andrew Weissmann: Did you believe it? Mary McCord: Did you believe it? And she says, I would say that would be out of character for Michael and there’s an objection that’s overruled, and then she’s asked, why would it be out of character? And she says, I didn’t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or a selfless person. He’s the kind of person who seeks credit. Right? So here we’ve got this testimony where she’s basically saying, Trump was telling me that this is what Michael said, but I didn’t believe that Michael would have been telling the truth then. Just a couple questions later, and this is the other significant part that they’re arguing should not have come in because this was official communications between a president and his communications director. She’s asked, did he say anything about the timing of this new reporting, right, because this is in 2018 when he’s the president. Oh, yes, she says. He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story, a different kind of story, before the campaign had Michael not made that payment. And I think Mr. Trump’s opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. Andrew Weissmann: And then this was the end of her direct testimony. I was actually there for a lot of the trial, and then, as many of you may know, she then broke down in tears. And, you know, these two things were very strong evidence, and the DA in summation argued that this was very strong corroborative evidence. Mary McCord: He used the word devastating. Andrew Weissmann: Right, which was fair in terms of its import. Mary McCord: Now, did she alone prove up the actual false business records, you know, charges? No, not at all. The point of her testimony was to corroborate Michael Cohen, to corroborate David Pecker, to corroborate the witnesses that actually did have direct factual evidence. So she was not a direct fact witness, but she was an important corroborative witness. Andrew Weissmann: So Judge Merchan is going to have to make a number of decisions. Leave aside that if he rules that all of this shouldn’t have come in, he’s going to have to decide was it material to the case, it didn’t make any difference because there’s always harmless error. Something comes in, but it’s, you know, it’s a grain of sand on the beach. His first decision really has to be about looking at these two things that Hope Hicks testified to. Is this even official act evidence? Now, does it fall into the broad category which the Supreme Court has outlined in its immunity decision of official act evidence? Now, I think if you were to ask Justice Alito, the answer is going to be yes because I’m not sure he will ever see any non-official act evidence. But that’s not the issue. The issue will ultimately be will there be five justices who would agree to this. Judge Merchan has to initially make that call and then it will go up within the New York criminal system, and then it could go to the Supreme Court. And, you know, you can argue it both ways, some stronger than others. With respect to, I’ll take the second one first, which is Donald Trump’s statement, according to Hope Hicks, that it’s better this came out now than before. Fine, that’s the president. Yes, he’s talking to the communications director, but that has nothing to do with his official conduct. The argument is like, that’s just sort of like opinion evidence and it doesn’t help her do her job. Mary McCord: Yeah, and for example, because when you think about what would be official there, like there’s oftentimes bad news that comes out about a president, or maybe not quite like this, but you know, there are definitely scandals. We’ve had them before, right? And so there would be a strategy. What’s their communications strategy, right, to ensure the American public that this didn’t happen, or whatever it is, whatever the argument. So that the argument, because you might be thinking, why is this even arguably official acts? But, you know, strategizing as the communications director with the president about communications to the public, you can see that being official. But as you were just saying, Andrew, if you’re really just talking about, ooh, good thing that came out now and not like back when I was a candidate, that really has nothing to do about, Hope, here’s what you need to say when you go out and talk to the public about this, right? Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. But that then raises the issue with the first statement. And of course, the statement itself from Donald Trump to Hope Hicks, which is essentially Donald Trump saying, I didn’t know anything about this. Michael did it on his own. That’s exculpatory if you believed it. I mean, it’s hard to say I was prejudiced by putting in evidence that’s exculpatory. The problem is that she also testified, essentially, I didn’t believe a word of it. So you have coming out of Donald Trump’s mouth as sort of a story that she is saying, you know, that’s just not true. I mean, Michael Cohen wasn’t going to, and this is a critical issue. Michael Cohen wasn’t going to have done this on his own. This was something, as I used to say when the trial was going on, there were hundreds and thousands of reasons that he would make sure that Donald Trump knew because he wanted to get repaid because the theory was that he was fronting the money. Mary McCord: He took out a home equity loan to do it and didn’t tell his wife. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So the argument that Donald Trump makes is even if it’s a lie, the president can have a strategy in terms of what he wants to tell the public about something that would be detrimental to his presidency and he’s going to need to respond to. Even though it’s a personal matter, it’s coming up now that he’s in the role as president, the Supreme Court goes out of its way to say that a president can make official act comments, even about things that are sort of general interest that the presidency doesn’t really have a role in. Mary McCord: You talked about using the bully pulpit. They specifically talked about that. I think we both agree that will be the biggest issue, serious issue that Judge Merchan is having to consider. There are a bunch of other things though that I think are not serious and this is what I’m going to do because normally our producer when we’re going long does this, like wrap it up, and we ignore her for like a while because we have more things to say, but now we’re going to start talking really fast. Andrew Weissmann: We have a wonderful, wonderful producer. Mary McCord: Yes, we do, we do. Andrew Weissmann: And for the record. Mary McCord: But he swings for the fences and the reason I have this up is I have the list from the table of contents of his brief. I’ve read his brief, but then you can see everything. Not only does he challenge the testimony of Hope Hicks as official acts, he challenges the testimony of Madeleine Westerhout, who really kind of was like the person who was outside of his office. It was important testimony just because it kind of positioned. It was contextual testimony. It sort of positioned him in the White House, how he would talk to people, what his practices were, how he would make phone calls, things like that. But it really was not anywhere near like Hope Hicks is, I think, in terms of its importance to the case. Andrew Weissmann: Absolutely. But do you want to know what I think the D.A. should argue with respect to Westerhout, who is sort of this person sitting outside of the Oval talking about sort of just practices. Essentially, in the law, it’s called opening the door. If you are a defendant and you raise a topic, you can open the door to the government responding. You can’t raise something and then say, but wait, government, you can’t even respond to it. So in the opening, the statement by Donald Trump’s lawyer, he basically, I’m going to paraphrase it, says the president was too busy as president to be focusing on the invoices. And what was very important was that he signs these checks, a whole bunch of them while he’s president, and attached to the checks are invoices that are false. And his seeing them would be important evidence because you could see that it did not comport with the underlying facts of what happened. And so in the opening, the defense says he’s running the free world. He’s not going to be focusing on a few scraps of paper and invoices. He’s too busy. And so to me, that’s an argument for opening the door to say, wait a second, we get to put on evidence about the process that he did this. And the fact that one of the arguments the DA made that I thought was really powerful was like, hey, he didn’t even have to sign any of these checks. If these are all personal, he could have had his wife do it. He could have had his sons do it. The fact that he retained this is something he wanted to control, even when the White House tells you just how focused he was on this. We will see whether I’m right or not in two days. I’ve certainly been wrong before. Mary McCord: I mean, save one of these for last, because I think it’s in a different category. Then he also challenges Trump’s tweets, his Twitter posts. He challenges Trump’s public Federal Election Commission filing, an Ethics in Government Act filing, where he talks about payments made. So what, based on what I read in that footnote, do you think about tweets over social media and a public filing? What did the chief justice say could be introduced? Public records, right? So here you have Mr. Trump’s attorneys coming in and saying, all of these tweets that Mr. Bragg introduced into evidence, those are his use of the bully pulpit. Those are part of his official acts as the president to communicate with the public. Yes, and they’re public. They are public. So I would certainly argue, if I’m Alvin Bragg, those can come in because those are out there in the public as public records. What Mr. Trump’s attorneys here seem to me to be doing is conflating this notion of immunity for actual prosecution for the official acts with the bar on entering them into evidence. The bar on entering into evidence isn’t an absolute immunity to being prosecuted. And so they’re turning to basically say, those tweets are official acts, can’t introduce them, but that is not what the Supreme Court said. And I would say the same thing about this ethics form. This is a public form that is part of the public record, and it can’t be much more part of the public record than notice of an ambassadorial appointment. Andrew Weissmann: And just to go back now to the rationale when we talked about what the chief justice was saying as to why official act evidence shouldn’t be allowed, even in an unofficial case, because there’s the risk of undue prejudice that a jury couldn’t hear it. This is like a perfect group for this, because the citizens are made up of everyday people. The idea that you could not differentiate and somehow be categorically prejudiced against the former president because of Hope Hicks’ statements in 2018 versus in 2016, or whether they were tweets that said, I reimbursed, or a public form that said, I reimbursed. I mean, it proves to me just the absolute sort of lunacy of saying that a jury categorically could not hear this evidence. And I think when you start looking at the actual evidence that gets introduced, and so here we sort of have this great case study, it really belies the rationale that was used by the five justices in the majority as to why it shouldn’t come in. Mary McCord: The last one I think that’s worth talking about, last argument, is there was evidence that after Michael Cohen got into trouble criminally while Donald Trump was president, when this and other things like his lying to Congress came to light, he was contacted, and you may recall this from the trial, by an attorney, Robert Costello, who was urging Cohen to fight these charges, not to cooperate, and was sending signals because he had close ties to Rudy Giuliani, who of course had the former president’s ear, and he was saying things like, if there are things that you need, that you want, you should let me know so that I can convey that to the friend who may be able to do something about that. This essentially was dangling, you know, pardons out there. And this is where I really think this motion, you know, really is bold. They’re basically saying, pardon power, remember pardon power? That’s a presidential power. So this attorney, who is not Donald Trump, telling Cohen, you should, you know, communicate to me what your needs are, and I’ll communicate them up. They’re saying, that’s an official act. Now, that’s many steps removed. Now, of course, what Alvin Bragg wanted the jury to, you know, infer from that is that this attorney wouldn’t be saying that if Giuliani hadn’t told him to say that, and Giuliani wouldn’t have said it unless Donald Trump told Giuliani to say it. But still, to put that within official acts, this communication seems to me such an incredible stretch. But that’s what they did in this motion. Rather than kind of like spend almost all of the ink arguing hard about Hope Hicks, this is like the spaghetti at the wall, like everything basically is official acts. And to me, it takes away from the credibility of the real issue there. And the last comment I’ll make about this is, Andrew mentioned sort of harmless error. This motion starts from the prospect that you can’t even apply a harmless error test, that this is structural error that is automatic reversal. And so if you’re wondering, well, what is structural error? The best example is, first of all, it’s exceedingly rare that the Supreme Court holds that anything is a structural error that requires a reversal without even considering whether it’s harmless. And the classic example is someone who is made to go to trial without an attorney. Gideon v. Wainwright, the case where the Supreme Court held that criminal defendants have a right to an attorney and to counsel throughout their criminal trial. And so there’s no way you can fix that on harmlessness because it was from the very beginning of the case to the very end of the case, the person had no attorney. That’s structural error. These evidentiary issues, these are not structural error. And it may be they’d be reviewed for harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt because the immunity, at least according to the Supreme Court, derives from constitutional principles. But still, there will be that opportunity to argue harmlessness, which for many of these things, I think would be an easy argument. Hope Hicks, a more challenging argument, but not impossible. Andrew Weissmann: So expect a decision on this on September 6th from Judge Merchan and he could hold a factual hearing, which looks like if it did happen, it would be a few weeks later than that. He also could just deny it outright using many of the arguments that we just talked about, in which case the sentencing of the Republican nominee, can’t believe I’m saying that, will happen in mid-September. Then as a defendant, he has every right to appeal it within the New York system. And then we expect he would try to go as quickly as possible to the Supreme Court of the United States, which has proved to be a friendly venue. Unknown: Thank you both very, very much. We really appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) (END AUDIO TAPE) Andrew Weissmann: Thanks so much for listening. We’ll be back next week.

CREW’s call for Alito to step down highlights his recusal failures in Trump cases,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/crew-resign-justice-samuel-alito-supreme-court-trump-rcna163415,"Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has called on Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to resign, citing his failure to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, including the Donald Trump immunity ruling. The watchdog group’s letter won’t sway the justice, but it highlights the problem of Alito’s having participated in these crucial disputes. The letter, dated Tuesday, notes that Alito declined to recuse after it emerged that flags carried at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, also flew outside of his homes: CREW cited three cases: • Trump v. United States, the immunity ruling. • Fischer v. United States, which narrowed obstruction charges for Jan. 6 defendants. • Trump v. Anderson, the ruling that kept Trump on the ballot despite the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist ban. Alito was in the majority for all three — as was Justice Clarence Thomas, who, unlike Alito, never attempted to explain his nonrecusals, despite his wife’s connection to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. We can safely assume that Alito won’t be resigning — at least not because of this letter. The GOP-appointed justice is in his mid-70s and would probably want to retire under a Republican administration so Republicans could confirm his successor. So when Alito (and Thomas, also in his mid-70s) voluntarily leaves the court may depend partly on whether the litigant he’s been helping returns to the White House in November.

Republicans’ case against Kamala Harris is off to an ugly start,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/2024-election-republicans-case-kamala-harris-ugly-start-rcna163468,"Three days into the transformed 2024 presidential race, how is the Republican Party’s case against Vice President Kamala Harris coming along? While pondering the question, consider the headline on one of The Associated Press’ overnight reports: “Republican leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris.” From the article: On the one hand, Republican officials believe this will be the year in which they break through with voters in communities of color. On the other hand, GOP leaders feel the need to remind their members that targeting Harris with racism isn’t a good idea. That said, the reminders have merit. A political sprint is obviously underway — Election Day is just over 100 days away — and it stands to reason that Republicans are going to take on the likely Democratic nominee in every possible way. But it’s also hard not to notice that the GOP’s case against the incumbent vice president is off to a rough start. Over the course of the last 72 hours, the American public has seen Republicans target Harris with: • racism; • sexism; • false claims about her serving as a “border czar”; • complaints about her laugh; • complaints that she has served the public for too many years; • complaints about her hometown of San Francisco; • complaints that she likes Venn diagrams too much; and • complaints about plastic straws. For good measure, let’s not overlook the fact that Republican Sen. JD Vance — a year before getting elected to Congress, and two years before receiving his party’s vice presidential nomination — took rhetorical aim at Harris during a Fox News appearance, emphasizing the fact that she does not have biological children of her own. As part of his Senate campaign in Ohio, Vance specifically referred to Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” The Republican added that this included Harris. The GOP will need a winning message against the likely Democratic nominee. This isn’t it."
Elon Musk now denies he's donating $45 million a month to help Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-trump-donation-45-million-pac-rcna163404,"Elon Musk has denied that he is contributing $45 million a month to a pro-Donald Trump political action committee, saying he is instead donating ""at a much lower level” than was initially reported. “What’s been reported in the media is simply not true. I’m not donating $45 million a month to Trump,” Musk said in an interview with Jordan Peterson, a conservative Canadian pop psychologist and YouTube personality, posted Monday on X, the social media site that Musk owns. Musk said he created the America PAC not as a “hyper-partisan” group but to “promote the principles that make America great in the first place.” Those principles, he said, include meritocracy and freedom, which he defined as “the least amount of government intervention possible,” a condition without which “everything becomes illegal.” The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Musk was planning to donate around $45 million a month to America PAC. In response to the reporting, Musk appeared at the time to give mixed signals. He responded to the WSJ article on X with a picture of gnus with human legs and the caption, “FAKE GNUS.” But he also replied to a post claiming he is “pledging $180 million” to re-elect Trump — the equivalent of $45 million a month from July until November — writing, “Yeah.” Later on Tuesday, Musk posted on X that he is “making some donations to America PAC, but at a much lower level.” The acerbic Silicon Valley billionaire had publicly thrown his support behind Trump after the attempt on the former president’s life at a campaign rally July 13. The Journal's report about Musk's monthly contributions to the super PAC underscored the financial heft behind the efforts by Silicon Valley's increasingly right-leaning factions to shore up their candidate of choice. At a rally in Michigan this week, Trump himself vowed “to make life good” for people like Musk. (Read more from my colleague Ja’han Jones about Trump’s overtures to Musk.) He also boasted about the tech billionaire’s donations to him. “Elon endorsed me the other day, and I read — I didn’t even know this, he didn’t even tell me about it,” Trump said, “but he gives me $45 million a month.”"

The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has now sent the PAC a cease and desist letter, demanding that they stop using Haley’s name. * President Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver a speech Wednesday night in which he will discuss his decision not to seek a second term. Donald Trump and his political operation have demanded equal time, though as best as I can tell, no network has agreed to the request. * Speaking of the Republican nominee, the Trump campaign also filed a complaint this week with the Federal Election Commission, complaining about Vice President Kamala Harris taking over Biden’s campaign accounts. This complaint isn’t likely to amount to much, but it’s worth keeping an eye on. * As Sen. Bob Menendez prepares to resign, who’ll replace the New Jersey Democrat? The Garden State’s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, has vowed to appoint a temporary successor quickly, and a short list is coming together. * Harris continues to pick up 2024 support from some of the nation’s largest and politically powerful labor unions, including AFSCME and the AFL-CIO. * In related news, Teamsters Vice President at large John Palmer announced late last week that he’s moving forward with a challenge to incumbent President Sean O’Brien, following O’Brien’s controversial decision to speak at the Republican National Convention. * And an interesting observation about recent political history: “This will be the first Presidential election since 1976 to not have a Biden, Bush, or Clinton on the ticket.”"
Dems in array: Handoff from Biden to Harris appears seamless,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 8:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/election-2024-democrats-array-handoff-biden-harris-appears-seamless-rcna163430,"Ahead of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race, many of the Democratic incumbent’s supporters said he had to keep going with his re-election bid — because the alternative would be intraparty chaos, division and disarray. There was one important flaw, however, in the argument: Democrats were already dealing with intraparty chaos, division and disarray. Nearly every day, more party officials called on the president to pass the torch, and there were multiple polls showing most rank-and-file Democratic voters as wanting an alternative to Biden. It appeared unsustainable. It also appears that the party has turned a corner. A Wall Street Journal report summarized: With extraordinary speed, a party that appeared fractured is suddenly united. A party that saw its fundraising efforts screeching to a halt is suddenly reporting record-breaking hauls. A party that cringed in response to every new poll is celebrating the latest national survey data. This seamless handoff from Biden to Harris wasn’t inevitable, but it has been executed with striking skill. It prompted Matt Compton, a veteran of the Obama White House, to note via social media: “Shout out to the staffers in Delaware who just lived through the most stressful five weeks in campaign history, then flipped every piece of branding and content on a dime, raised $100m, recruited 58,000 volunteers, and generally just lit the internet on fire for Kamala Harris.” Pod Save America’s Dan Pfeiffer added, ""What [the Harris campaign team] has pulled of since Sunday is truly incredible. No campaign in history has ever undergone such a shift with no notice. The way they been able to capture the wave of enthusiasm is so impressive. True professionals."" That’s certainly fair, though it’s also worth pausing to emphasize Biden’s role. The incumbent president didn’t just do the bold thing by standing aside, he also played a direct role in helping rally Democrats behind their likely new nominee. The results have been unmistakably impressive."
GOP’s Tom Cotton pressed on weird talk about an anti-Biden ‘coup’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 7:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-tom-cotton-pressed-weird-talk-anti-biden-coup-rcna163416,"After President Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid, Republicans scrambled — in the most cynical way possible — to turn this into some kind of scandal for Democrats. In fact, one word came up more than any other: “coup.” The argument, to the extent such a word is applicable, is that Biden prevailed against token opposition in presidential primaries and caucuses and earned his party’s nomination in the process. For the party to urge him to stand down, and for the president to voluntarily agree to do so ahead of the Democratic National Convention, constituted a “coup.” It was, and is, a ridiculous claim, though it’s been embraced by a wide variety of Republicans, including vice presidential nominee JD Vance. One of his Senate colleagues, Arkansas’ Tom Cotton, went in an even weirder direction, writing via social media, “Joe Biden succumbed to a coup by Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Hollywood donors, ignoring millions of Democratic primary votes. Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy.” He didn’t appear to be kidding. In reality, of course, we know what a “coup” is. Merriam-Webster’s definition is as good as any: “a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics and especially the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group.” To think this applies to an incumbent president voluntarily withdrawing from a re-election campaign is obviously bad-faith nonsense, but there’s a related angle to this that shouldn’t go overlooked: If Republicans like Vance and Cotton are looking for evidence of developments that actually resemble a coup, perhaps they should turn their attention to Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol? CNN’s John Berman pressed Cotton about this on the air yesterday, asking, “As much as any politician I’ve seen, you choose your language very carefully. So, why call this a coup and not January 6th?” The far-right senator tried to change the subject, and the host tried again: Cotton dodged the question again. That wasn't too surprising; there is no good answer to these questions. As a Washington Post analysis concluded this week, after Trump’s 2020 defeat, the Republican “tried to cheat Biden voters in those five states out of their choice. He tried to short-circuit the effort to count electors. And then he suggested that the furious crowd near the White House direct their anger at the Capitol. It’s useful for Trump’s allies to pretend that Biden’s decision was comparable. It isn’t.” If Cotton and his cohorts are looking for a party that took steps to subvert democracy, we can show them one, but they might not like the look in the mirror."
"Kamala Harris sounds different, but she could still be a status quo president on Israel",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 6:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-israel-netanyahu-gaza-rcna163202,"President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his bid for re-election has sparked curiosity and hope among progressives and Arab Americans who were turned off by his support for and complicity in Israel’s brutal siege of the Gaza Strip. Many are wondering whether Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner to win the Democratic presidential nomination, may be more inclined than her boss to push back more forcefully against Israel and offer support to Palestinians. It’s a tricky assessment to make, in no small part because Harris doesn’t have a deep background in foreign policy. Most of Harris’ career focused on law enforcement, and during her brief stint in the Senate she wasn’t a major foreign policy player. Her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign focused mostly on buzzy domestic policy ideas. As vice president she did delve into foreign affairs and diplomacy, but her job wasn’t to craft major policy — it was to execute it. There are some small hints that Harris could be to the left of Biden on the issue. But there are also plenty of reasons to think she would approach the issue similarly to him, and that her divergence from Biden could come down to speech style rather than policy.  The case for Harris as being potentially more sympathetic to Palestinian interests is primarily based on subtle rhetorical signals. In March, Harris delivered a speech that included some of the most overtly critical statements about Israel’s operation issued by the Biden administration, acknowledging the situation in Gaza as a “catastrophe.” Moreover, that speech might have been even more pointed had it not been softened by her colleagues. NBC News, citing current and former officials, reported that “the original draft of her remarks was harsher on Israel in describing the dire humanitarian situation for Palestinians in Gaza and the need for more aid.” White House National Security Council officials reportedly “toned down” parts of her speech. (A Harris spokesperson at the time called the portrayal ""inaccurate."") Later that month Harris said in an interview that she didn’t rule out “consequences” for Israel if it launched an invasion of Rafah, which was at the time a stronger warning to Israel than any Biden official had made to date. As Politico reported at the time, Harris “has consistently gone further than President Joe Biden by at least half a step” in her rhetoric criticizing Israel. And in an interview with The Nation, Harris at least came across as more specifically attentive to the suffering of Gazans — and U.S. protesters on their behalf — than Biden. However, Harris’ criticisms of Israel, while notable, have been modest in scope, and might appear stronger than they are because Biden has set such a low bar. As independent journalist Spencer Ackerman has pointed out, in her March speech, Harris might have sounded more upset by the humanitarian horror show than Biden, but she refused to condemn or fully critique Israel’s policy that helped give rise to it: the collective punishment of Gaza by vastly restricting food, electricity and supplies in violation of international law. Harris' Nation interview might have sounded humane, but she made no substantive policy statements and declined to clarify which, if any, protesters she felt were right. And Harris’ saying Israel might face “consequences” over Rafah was not a red line comment, and hardly guarantees that she has the resolve to confront Israel in a meaningful manner.  From the beginning of Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 war crimes, the Biden administration has hinted that it could do something but has basically done nothing significant about it beyond private pressure — with the exception of a temporary pause on a shipment of some of the heaviest ordinance it sends to Israel. The more one digs into Harris’ background, the case that she could be an agent of the status quo on Israel appears meatier than the case against. Her rhetoric on Israel has generally ticked all the conventional U.S. foreign policy establishment boxes, including emphasizing the “ironclad” nature of the U.S.-Israeli alliance and Israel’s right to defend itself. As a senator, she spoke twice at conferences held by the hawkish American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), pledged support for Israel’s security and described the bond between the U.S. and Israel as “unbreakable.” During her first AIPAC speech in 2017, she noted that her first act as a senator was to introduce a resolution condemning a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel. Jeremy Scahill of Drop Site News recently wrote up a comprehensive evaluation of Harris’ policy record on Israel and described her as having “hardline” support for Israel, noting, among many other things, her co-sponsoring legislation in 2017 “condemning former President Barack Obama’s decision to abstain from vetoing a UN Security Council Resolution critical of Israel.” In addition to Harris’ conventional pro-Israel positioning, her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, is reportedly likely to remain central to her foreign policy agenda. He is a longtime U.S. foreign policy establishment adviser, who seemingly aligns with a number of Biden’s views of Middle East policy. When you put all this together, the picture emerges of a politician who, at least after Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks, has a rhetorical tendency slightly to the left of Biden. But most of her public positions don’t suggest that she is ready to change the course of the U.S.-Israeli relationship in a substantial way, if at all. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a seasoned former Middle East hand, summed up his assessment this way in a recent interview with NBC News: Her views on Israel are to the “left of what Biden is prepared to do but way to the right of those who argue we need to impose costs and consequences on Israel to make it clear we’re the superpower and they’re not.” Miller's synopsis is a reminder that Harris' rhetoric could cut both ways: it could signal openness to new directions, but it could also provide cover for business as usual. The one major X factor of Harris’ worldview is she is still a relative newbie in the world of foreign policy. Her worldview is still forming, and the world is changing. It is possible that Harris’ perception of Israeli policy — like many Americans’ — was changed by Hamas’ attacks or Israel’s response to them. While newness can make some politicians more conservative, still others might feel emboldened to shake up the status quo. Harris’ newness might, theoretically, make her more more receptive to left-wing pressure on the issue. That activism is already taking place — such as a recent statement by major unions calling on the U.S. to halt military aid to Israel. Some of it is likely to be on the way — such as widely anticipated pro-Palestinian protests at the Democratic National Convention. A sustained resurgence of effective pro-Palestinian protests could extract policy wins from Harris, whether on the campaign trail or during a potential presidency. Harris will most likely try to use use ambiguity and a light touch to work to her advantage. Without doing much, she can allow many progressives to project hope onto her as an alternative to the status quo. And without doing much, she can bank on most pro-Israel supporters of the Democratic Party, who’ll most likely assume she’s still on board with the Biden-Harris foreign policy they’ve come to expect. For now, Harris appears to be treading carefully. She won’t be presiding over or attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial address to Congress on Wednesday, which a number of Democrats are boycotting. She will instead be on the campaign trail and is expected to meet with Netanyahu privately during his visit. It’s a perfect way for her to avoid any polarizing optics — or make clear to anyone exactly where she stands."
"Eyeing new polls, Team Trump pushes flawed ‘Harris Honeymoon’ memo",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 6:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-polls-2024-trump-election-kamala-harris-honeymoon-memo-rcna163401,"It’ll probably be a few days before many of the leading polling outlets release new data on the 2024 presidential race, but in the wake of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal announcement — which was just three days ago — there are some preliminary survey numbers to kick around from polls conducted after Sunday’s news. The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll, for example, found Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by 4 points, 42% to 38%, with third-party candidates in the mix, and by 2 points, 44% to 42%, in a head-to-head match-up with the former Republican president. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) The latest national NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, meanwhile, showed the Democratic VP tied with Trump in a multicandidate field, and in a head-to-head match-up, the GOP nominee was ahead by the narrowest of margins, 46% to 45%.(Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) It was against this backdrop that one of the former president’s pollsters thought it’d be a good idea to issue a memo on where things currently stand. HuffPost reported: “The coverage will be largely positive and will certainly energize Democrats and some other parts of their coalition at least in the short term,” Fabrizio wrote in his memo. “That means we will start to see public polling — particularly national public polls — where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump.” The document added that Harris is seeing a “bump” in the polls now, and this is likely to “last a while until the race settles back down.” At face value, there’s nothing especially wrong with Fabrizio’s analysis. There’s also no great mystery about the pollster’s motivation: With Biden out of the race and Trump’s advantage in national surveys slipping away, it stands to reason that the Republican’s top polling expert would issue a document that, for all intents and purposes, tells his party — and his client — “Don’t panic. This is temporary.” There is, however, a relevant detail that the memo downplayed: where Team Trump expected to be at this point. Ahead of the recent presidential debate, the GOP nominee was already well positioned in the 2024 race. After the debate, his advantage grew. Then Trump was shot, the former president named his running mate and the Republican National Convention soon followed. Right about now, in other words, most political observers — in both parties — would expect to see Trump’s lead reaching new heights. But it’s not, thanks in part to Biden’s willingness to put the country’s needs first, and in part to Democrats rallying behind Harris with great enthusiasm. The fact that the vice president is getting a “bump” isn’t a huge problem for the Republican ticket and its allies; the fact that Team Trump expected to be riding high as July came to an end, however, is far more significant."
"New Republican impeachment measure targets Harris (yes, again)",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-republican-impeachment-measure-targets-harris-yes-rcna163389,"As this week got underway, House Republicans were all set to add to their rather extraordinary impeachment list. In the wake of the recent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, Rep. Greg Steube of Florida announced plans to file articles of impeachment against Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina soon after took steps to force a vote on the measure. The efforts quickly proved moot: A day later, Cheatle announced her resignation. But impeachment fans didn’t have to wait too long for the GOP to move forward with a related gambit. The conservative Washington Times reported: At the outset, it’s worth emphasizing that the California Democrat has never served as the administration’s “border czar,” no matter how many times Republicans and their allies claim otherwise. But that’s not the only area of concern here. For one thing, as GOP lawmakers really ought to know, impeaching a sitting vice president over policy disagreements is ridiculous. For another, if seeing the words “Ogles,” “Harris” and “impeachment” in the same sentence rings a bell, there’s a good reason for that: This same highly controversial congressman first introduced an impeachment resolution against the vice president last summer. The far-right Tennessean’s measure didn’t go anywhere, so he apparently decided to unveil a new one because —well, just because. But stepping back, there’s a larger context to all of this: Much of the House Republican Conference seems to look at impeachment campaigns as toys to be pulled off the shelf when they’re bored. In fact, it’s time to update the big list: President Joe Biden: There is absolutely no evidence uncovered by Republicans that the incumbent Democrat has actually committed any high crimes, but as of this morning, there are literally seven different impeachment resolutions pending in the House targeting the sitting president. Vice President Kamala Harris: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Harris in the last Congress (I still don’t understand why) and it picked up two co-sponsors. Ogles, meanwhile, has unveiled two resolutions over the last 13 months. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: For the first time in American history, the House voted earlier this year to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary, targeting Mayorkas despite lacking evidence of high crimes. Attorney General Merrick Garland: Several GOP lawmakers, including former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have raised the prospect of impeaching the nation’s chief law enforcement official. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a pending impeachment resolution against Garland a while back, as did Rep. Scott Perry, who also unveiled a similar resolution. Secretary of State Antony Blinken: For reasons that remain fuzzy, Republican Rep. Ralph Norman introduced an impeachment resolution last summer targeting the nation’s chief diplomat. Rep. Dave Schweikert also raised the specter of impeaching Blinken. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin: Nearly a year ago, Rep. Cory Mills of Florida introduced a resolution to impeach the Pentagon chief, and it managed to pick up three GOP co-sponsors. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg: A handful of congressional Republicans have endorsed impeaching Buttigieg, though formal resolutions have not yet been introduced. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona: Though this effort hasn’t yet moved beyond the discussion phase, Cardona is apparently in the mix. The New York Times reported last fall that “some” GOP lawmakers would like to impeach the education secretary. FBI Director Chris Wray: Schweikert also made behind-the-scenes comments suggesting the FBI director handpicked by Trump might face some kind of impeachment threat. Soon after, Greene introduced an impeachment resolution targeting Wray, which has picked up a half-dozen GOP co-sponsors. Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia: Greene, apparently upset about criminal cases against accused Jan. 6 defendants, has also introduced an impeachment resolution going after the federal prosecutor. (It has four Republican co-sponsors.) Taken together, the House Republicans' broader impeachment list now includes the sitting president, sitting vice president, six Cabinet secretaries, the director of the FBI and a largely unknown federal prosecutor. White House spokesperson Ian Sams told NBC News earlier this year, “House Republicans are treating impeachments like an Oprah audience giveaway. They are disregarding the Constitution for the sake of cheap, baseless political stunts, instead of focusing on the issues Americans care about, and it lays bare how extreme they have become.”"
Andy Beshear’s perfect response to JD Vance makes his case to be Harris’ running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 3:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/andy-beshear-kamala-harris-vp-rcna163228,"In early 2023, Kentucky Republicans launched an all-out attack on transgender children, trans families and the state’s broader LGBTQ community. The GOP’s supermajorities in the state House and Senate spent much of that year’s general session constructing and passing Senate Bill 150, one of the most heinous, restrictive, anti-trans bills in the country. One day during this hateful effort, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear traveled to my small, rural town in the middle of his re-election campaign to present a check for tourism and sidewalk improvements near an elementary school.  A standing-room-only crowd gathered in the conference room of our police department. I watched the governor go around and, as he always did, shake every hand. A number of local Republicans chatted as happily with him as everyone else.  When he shook my hand, he smiled and joked, “Long time no see!” as I had just seen him from a distance a few days earlier at the state Capitol, where he’d spoken at a rally for the pro-LGBTQ Fairness Campaign. “You doin’ OK?” he asked. I immediately thought back to some of the truly ignorant legislative committee meetings I’d covered concurrent with that rally, and how many lawmakers appeared, at best, indifferent to the suffering they were about to cause with SB 150. “To be honest, governor,” I replied, “I cried all the way home from the Capitol last Friday.” We talked privately for a few minutes about the bill. Then he looked me in the eye. “Hang in there,” he said with boy-next-door sincerity. “Remember, we are all children of God.” This may sound like an odd conversation for a regular citizen to have with a governor. But I can tell you it felt completely normal to talk to him — to Andy, as Kentuckians began calling him during the pandemic — in this honest, very basic, human way. With Vice President Kamala Harris now the de facto presidential nominee of the Democratic Party, many consider Beshear one of the most likely choices as her running mate. If he can’t deliver Republican-dominated Kentucky — and, let’s be honest, no one could — what does Beshear bring to a national ticket? The basics. His principled rejection of public mudslinging; his active listening skills, positivity and kindness; and his down-to-earth, Mr. Rogers-like ability to communicate with people no matter their party registration, which is how he won re-election. After years of Trumpian lies, fearmongering and divisiveness, I think we are starving for this. And Beshear, unlike former President Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance, has a sense of Kentuckians — and Americans — that goes beyond stereotypes concocted for a book. “I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like because let me just tell you JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said on MSNBC earlier this week. “The nerve that he has to call the people of Eastern Kentucky lazy? Listen, these are the hardworking coal miners that powered the industrial revolution. … We should be thanking them, not calling them lazy.” What Vance — who was raised in Ohio, not Kentucky — has in common with his new boss is that they are both slick, millionaire opportunists who exploit regular working folks.  Despite the bad impression our Republican state legislators create, Kentuckians are some of the most generous, welcoming people you will meet. I was born and raised in Missouri; my husband hails from Indiana. But after our son went to the University of Kentucky, he loved the state so much that he stayed. After a decade in Silicon Valley — where my husband worked in the tech industry and, yes, where JD Vance made his money as a venture capitalist — we wanted to be closer to our family and decided to join our son here. In our first days after moving, our new neighbors threw a picnic bonfire for us in freezing cold January. Beshear reflects that welcoming nature. Long before the GOP’s anti-trans fearmongering in 2023, right-wing activists were circulating a photo of Beshear with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an activist drag troupe, in an effort to hurt him with the Kentucky electorate.  “This is what our Democrat governor is about today,” a Republican state senator claimed. “These are the values that the Democratic Party of today is out there trying to convince our children’s the right way to live.” Conservatives predicted Beshear would run from the photo. Instead, he embraced it. “Everyone in Kentucky counts,” he told a local news station. “I would absolutely take that picture again.” That approach has paid off: In last November’s gubernatorial election, Beshear won with more than 52% of the vote (up from 49% four years earlier). A month before, I received a Facebook message from a prominent, lifelong Republican in my tiny, rural town. “Yes, I am a Republican,” he wrote, “BUT I AM VOTING FOR ANDY. He is what is best for Ky and has done an excellent job as governor.” He would do an excellent job as vice president, too.  Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign.

Here are 4 things to watch for during Biden’s historic speech,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-prime-time-address-wednesday-rcna163352,"President Joe Biden’s prime-time address Wednesday is designed to tell the nation — and, frankly, the rest of the world — “what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people.” We all have questions.  Biden’s speech caps a truly wild few weeks in what has become a truly unprecedented election campaign. It all started at the end, following Biden’s disastrous debate performance. (As a reminder, that was less than four weeks ago.) Two weeks after the debate, as Biden’s critics continued to call for an internal reckoning, a would-be assassin climbed onto a Pennsylvania roof and almost killed former President Donald Trump in the middle of an otherwise unremarkable weekend rally. This act of violence was followed by the political earthquake of Biden’s withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket.   In between these political earthquakes, Biden hosted a NATO summit, sat for two prime-time interviews and addressed the nation about the attempt on Trump’s life. All to end up in isolation at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware to recover from Covid.  Now, we will hear from the president directly again. This is the right move. But because it is a formal address, do not expect a speech that dives too heavily in politics. Here are four things to watch for Wednesday night.  First, this is not a farewell address; it is a “there is still work to be done speech.” While Biden will no doubt highlight some of the many accomplishments of his administration, it is equally important that he present what he still hopes to accomplish. His decision to drop out of the campaign makes him, surprisingly, a lame-duck president. But that should not mean he sits back and wastes the remaining five months of 2024. I would love, for example, to hear him expand on his promise to lower prescription drug costs for all people, not just those on Medicare Part B. Second, Biden must forcefully push back on the un-American rhetoric being spewed by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson, R-La., has gone on record demanding that Biden resign immediately, claiming that if he “is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president.” Frankly, it is disgraceful that Johnson would use his platform to even suggest that Biden is not fit for office at such a critical time. To undermine the American commander in chief when it has become clear that he is not running for re-election is dangerous, irresponsible and mean.  Up until this point, Biden has emphasized his work on foreign policy. This should continue, as there remains an incredible amount of good work to be done by one of the world’s most respected elder statesmen. Hopefully Biden will be able to secure more funding for Ukraine and Taiwan, two countries that Trump may turn his back on if he wins in November.  Last, it is important that Biden works to reassure the country that despite what can feel like overwhelming partisanship and rhetoric, the democracy that he has spent the last 3½ years defending is strong enough to survive and prosper. And that he will continue working to defend and bolster its foundations for as long as he possibly can.     Biden has been called our country’s consoler in chief, and after the last month, we could really use some reassurance.  "
The right pushed an absurd conspiracy theory about Biden after he dropped out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 24, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-conspiracy-theory-dead-covid-rcna163301,"As Republicans scramble to shift gears against a new Democratic presidential nominee, a conspiracy theory about President Joe Biden emerged over the past few days, one that purported a kind of “Weekend at Bernie’s” situation involving the president. Yes, that sounds ridiculous. But after the president‘s announcement that he would no longer run for re-election, the ludicrous claim gained some traction in right-wing circles: that Biden, who tested positive for Covid-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas on Friday, was either dead or severely incapacitated. (Biden's decision to bow out of the race was not attributed to any specific medical issue.) Several Fox News anchors cast doubt on Biden’s whereabouts on Sunday. Bret Baier said it was “disconcerting” that Biden had not been seen. His co-host Dana Perino said, “I hope he’s fine. But you can forgive people for wondering if we are really living ‘Weekend at Bernie’s’ right now. Proof of life, please.” An account associated with Donald Trump's presidential campaign posted a clip of the exchange on X and implied that Harris was somehow behind the mystery. On Monday morning, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., similarly demanded “proof of life from Joe Biden” in a post on X, adding that he should “discuss if he’s aware that he dropped out.” Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk then claimed on social media platform X that he had a “lead” that Biden was “dying or possibly already dead.” His account later shared a link to an unverified story, attributed entirely to anonymous sources, that Biden had suffered a “full-blown medical emergency.” Right-wing billionaire Bill Ackman also suggested that Biden’s Sunday letter was suspicious because it had a digital signature. Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, announced a press gaggle on Tuesday afternoon for the purpose of questioning why Biden hadn’t “been seen since Kamala’s Coup” (despite the demonstrable fact that Biden had been). The idea that Biden was dead or near death, and that Democrats were somehow hiding it from the public — and from a White House press corps that is voracious for scoops — is deeply unserious. There is no evidence whatsoever that the president was not simply recovering from Covid. But such unfounded conspiracy theories have often found a credulous audience among the right, where claims have long festered that Biden is a puppet of Democratic Party “elites” (a group that somehow excludes the president himself). Meanwhile, Biden was seen boarding Air Force One in Delaware on Tuesday. White House physician Kevin O’Connor said in a memo released the same day that the president's Covid “symptoms have resolved.” Biden is set to speak from the Oval Office on Wednesday about his decision to drop out of the presidential race."
Trump’s latest praise for Elon Musk should have us all concerned,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 4:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-elon-musk-project-2025-zuckerberg-rcna163339,"Happy Tuesday! Here’s your Tuesday Tech Drop, the past week’s top stories from the intersection of politics and the all-inclusive world of technology. In a rambling tangent over the weekend, Donald Trump boasted about how uber-rich right-winger Elon Musk reportedly is planning to spend $45 million a month on a pro-Trump super PAC and suggested that making the X owner’s life more comfortable should be a priority. “We have to make life good for our smart people, you know? We have some smart people,” Trump told rallygoers in Grand Rapids, Michigan, adding: “We have to make life good for our smart people, and he’s as smart as you get.” It was yet another authoritarian-sounding indicator that Trump would prioritize making life easier on uber-wealthy tech executives in his corner — like Musk, who seems to be living a pretty rich life already — if he regains the White House. Trump, who reportedly has offered oil executives favorable policy in exchange for donations, is behaving as though he’s indebted to Musk and other big donors. Musk reportedly pushed Trump to select Sen. JD Vance, someone else who has made a fortune from the tech industry, as his running mate. And Vance is the guy who reportedly courted Silicon Valley executives to throw their weight behind Trump. If the GOP ticket wins, we’re likely going to be living under a far-right technocracy. In a recent sit-down interview with right-wing commentator Jordan Peterson, Musk went on a disturbing diatribe claiming that “the woke mind virus” had killed his adult trans child, who is still living. The remarks provide some insight into Musk’s perverse bigoted ideology and what may have helped inspired it. Read more at USA Today.

The racist right-wing attacks on Kamala Harris have begun,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:21 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-republicans-racist-attacks-trump-rcna163264,"As Democrats largely coalesce around Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, some politicians and pundits on the right have resorted to racist dog whistles in their attacks on the vice president, a Black and South Asian American woman. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called Harris a “DEI hire.” Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., claimed that many Democrats feel they must support Harris’ candidacy “because of her ethnic background.” Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Donald Trump’s running mate, said Harris does not feel “grateful” for the country. “I never hear that gratitude come through when I listen to Kamala Harris,” Vance said at a rally in Ohio. Former Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested that Harris is inarticulate and lazy, two pervasive negative stereotypes that are used to disparage Black Americans. “She does not speak well, she does not work hard, she doesn’t inspire anyone,” Conway said. The ugly attacks on Harris started even before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race Sunday and endorsed her to run in his place. As Democrats began openly defecting after Biden’s debate performance and the discussion about who would replace him at the top of the ticket ramped up, so did the claim that Harris was only in her position because of identity politics, and not because she earned the spot on her merits. The New York Post recently published a column by Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino, who warned about Harris becoming the country’s “first DEI president.” Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump White House aide and a prominent figure on the right, echoed a similar insult shortly after: “She’s a DEI hire, right? She’s a woman! She’s colored! Therefore, she’s got to be good.” In a way, these Republicans are following the example that their standard-bearer has set. Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, has called people of color “animals” and elevated racist conspiracy theories against nonwhite opponents — including fellow Republicans. He has attacked the appearance of some women while sexualizing others. Trump has also attacked Harris personally. In 2020, after Biden picked her as his running mate, Trump helped fuel a false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory about her and also called her a “monster,” “nasty” and “the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate.” More recently, he has mocked her laughter and tried to put down her intelligence."
I’m the youngest Jewish member of Congress. Here’s why I’m not attending Netanyahu’s address.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netanyahu-address-congress-jacobs-israel-rcna163137,"It’s never easy being Jewish in today’s world, but the past 10 months have been especially excruciating. Like millions of Jews around the world, I’m still grappling with the aftermath of Hamas’ horrific attack on Oct. 7 and the sharp rise in antisemitism that we’ve seen since. And I’ve also been deeply alarmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s brutal, unrelenting military operation that has reportedly left more than 39,000 Palestinians dead. This response hasn’t been proportional, strategic or effective — and I can’t in good conscience condone it by attending Netanyahu’s joint address to Congress. I’m deeply connected to my Jewish roots and to Israel. As a child, my summers were split between visiting my family in Tel Aviv and helping to host my Israeli cousins in San Diego and going to camp together at the Jewish Community Center. I have traveled from the northernmost to the southernmost parts of Israel, prayed at the Western Wall, spent time with Bedouin families in Segev Shalom, stayed in Sha’ar HaNegev — San Diego’s sister city, which suffered a brutal onslaught on Oct. 7 — and visited Gaza and the West Bank. As a member of Congress, I’ve traveled to Israel twice on official visits — during the first, I met with then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and during the second, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu after he regained power. In the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, Israel had the right to defend itself after Hamas’ brutal attack left more than 1,200 civilians dead, thousands more injured, assaulted and traumatized, and more than 200 hostages taken. But there is absolutely no justification for leveling Gaza, displacing nearly its entire civilian population and destroying generations of Palestinian families. Civilian infrastructure from schools to refugee camps to ambulances to hospitals to water facilities has been demolished. Humanitarian aid can’t be delivered and distributed effectively, leaving 1 million Palestinians to experience the highest levels of starvation soon. Young Palestinians who have survived this war are spending their childhoods lining up outside food banks and scavenging for makeshift food alternatives. For 10 months, the Israeli military, under the prime minister’s direction, has conducted intense bombardments on Gaza. Yet Hamas hasn’t been eliminated, and Israel isn’t any safer. From my work at the State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, I know that civilian casualties fuel recruitment, radicalization and support of terrorism. Every civilian casualty that results from the Israeli government’s strategy provides an opportunity for Hamas and other extremist groups to prey on. There’s no justification for terrorism and nothing acceptable about Hamas’ actions — and that only makes it more important that Israel acts in a way that doesn’t drive more recruits into Hamas’ ranks. Unfortunately, Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn’t have a sound plan to avoid that outcome — or a plan to bring the hostages home or secure lasting peace and security. He has lost significant support within Israel, with thousands of Israelis taking to the streets recently to call for his resignation. Many believe that Netanyahu has deprioritized the hostages and continued this war to avoid a looming political reckoning. The reality is: There is no military solution to this conflict. Even a far more precise and better-executed military campaign than the one being waged won’t work without acknowledging the root political issues. Israel can effectively counter the threat posed by Hamas only by first addressing the core grievances that have fueled recruitment and support for decades: the lack of a Palestinian state and Palestinians’ right to self-determination. And yet, Prime Minister Netanyahu appears unmotivated to reach a cease-fire deal and continues to repel the idea of a two-state solution, and he has even used this conflict to advance Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Growing up, I was taught about Jews’ sacred task of tikkun olam — to repair the world. It’s our responsibility as Jews to speak out against injustice and work to make the world a better place. It is because of my Jewish upbringing and values that I can’t attend Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address. My faith isn’t a shield or an excuse for destruction. And my presence at Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address would be weaponized as false proof that I support him and his government’s conduct during this war, which I vehemently oppose. Partisan grandstanding before Congress doesn’t advance the cause of peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the region. It won’t bring the hostages home. And it won’t end this war, deliver humanitarian aid to those in need or give Palestinian children back their childhoods. When the stakes are so high, my faith compels me to reject performative gestures and focus instead on tangible actions to end this war."
