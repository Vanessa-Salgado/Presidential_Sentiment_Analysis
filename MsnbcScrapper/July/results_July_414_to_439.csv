‘Congress at its worst’: Republicans can’t shake home appliance fixation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 6:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/congress-worst-republicans-cant-shake-home-appliance-fixation-rcna161096,"A few months ago, Axios reported that there was some growing “frustration” among House Republicans over their party’s focus on home appliance-related legislation, especially given that the Democratic-led Senate would ignore the GOP’s measures. Evidently, Republican leaders prefer to ignore the intraparty irritation. The Associated Press reported overnight: During the floor debate, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California called the effort “ridiculous,” adding, “It is Congress at its worst.” The congresswoman’s argument was both accurate and persuasive, and it was clear that Porter was frustrated that she even had to make the remarks. But making matters worse was the familiarity of the circumstances. Indeed, it was just a couple of months ago when House Republicans also approved the “Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act” (or “HOOHA”), which, if implemented, would make it more difficult to enact energy efficiency standards for washing machines, among other things. There’s no great mystery as to the broader political context: GOP members have a problem with energy efficiency standards, which used to enjoy relatively bipartisan support before the party’s approach to energy policy moved sharply to the right. A recent PunchBowl News report helped summarize matters: “These are all part of the Republican culture war clash over energy efficiency and climate change. It’s similar to the gas stove hysteria or Trump’s war on low-flush toilets and light bulbs.” GOP lawmakers know that these home appliance bills aren’t going anywhere in the Democratic-led Senate, but by all appearances, party leaders don’t much care. They want to be able to tell the far-right Republican base that they’re on Capitol Hill, fighting tooth and nail in support of pointless bills that combat energy conservation and efficiency standards. As a result, the “Refrigerator Freedom Act” and the “Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act” (these are the actual bill names, which I swear I didn’t make up) will no doubt make for delightful fundraising letters and several Fox News segments, even as real priorities in need of Republicans’ attention go overlooked. As for the rest of the party’s appliance-related agenda, votes on the “Liberty in Laundry Act” (H.R. 7673), the “Clothes Dryers Reliability Act"" (H.R. 7645), and the “Affordable Air Conditioning Act” (H.R. 7626) were supposed to receive votes weeks ago. They have not yet been rescheduled, but it’s a safe bet they’ll end up on the House floor soon enough. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Joe Biden has no vision,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-age-2024-policy-rcna160505,"A few weeks ago I received a letter from President Joe Biden that distilled one of the key — and under-discussed — reasons that I believe he’s at serious risk of losing in November. To be clear, this was no personal missive. It was a fundraising pitch signed by Biden and sent out by his presidential campaign, presumably to people who might vote for Democrats in November. In this letter Biden laid out his case to voters for supporting his re-election bid. In paragraph after paragraph over the course of two pages, he sounded the alarms about former President Donald Trump. He warned of Trump’s campaign of revenge. He detailed the threats that Trump poses to democracy and the rights and social services that Americans currently enjoy. He called for help in debunking “MAGA lies.”  Biden’s case against Trump was sound. But something was missing: Joe Biden’s case for himself. He allocated just one sentence at the bottom of the first page to discussing his legislative accomplishments. As for his future aims, buried on the second page were three bullet points explaining a handful of things he planned to do if he wins a second term: ban assault weapons; cap insulin costs; and increase taxes on billionaires. The rest of the note returned to talking about the fight against Trump and the importance of mobilizing for November. Biden’s fundraising letter typifies a broader trend. His campaign relentlessly issues warnings about Trump — and there is much to warn about — but it’s thin on what he would do with his own time in office. His inaugural re-election campaign video opened with footage of Jan. 6 and focused overwhelmingly on the menace of Trumpism. His campaign’s leading social media account on X is laser focused on dunking on Trump or talking about how dangerous he is. A central theme of his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ public commentary is protecting abortion rights from further erosion under Trump. Even though Biden announced his re-election bid over a year ago, up until a few weeks ago, his campaign website didn’t even have a policy section (unlike Trump’s). The site’s headline argument was the need to support Biden “to keep Trump out of the Oval Office.” In recent weeks, Biden’s website has added an “issues” section, but it remains anemic. (More on that later.)  Again, preventing another Trump presidency is an essential part of the case for Biden’s re-election. But framing the case almost purely in those terms neglects an essential task of any political candidate: clearly communicating an agenda and building a mandate for that agenda. What should Americans expect — and get excited about — when casting their ballot for Biden other than “this guy is not Trump”?  Banking on dread of Trump isn’t working as an election strategy. The president has trailed Trump in national polls and in polls of swing states since last year, after Trump promised to be “dictator for a day,” after his Hitlerian rhetoric about immigrants and even after he was convicted of 34 felony counts. Polling indicates that for less politically engaged voters, who outnumber highly engaged voters and who lean toward Trump, economic concerns outweigh concerns about democracy.  Since the 2020 Democratic primaries, Biden’s central value proposition has been that he serves as the most practical bulwark against Trump and an American slide toward autocracy. But the president’s evidence for that premise has become far less clear since he has taken a huge hit in his approval ratings over the course of his tenure. And even before his disastrous debate performance, a majority of voters felt he was too old for the office. If Biden is not a reliable defender against Trump, then what exactly is it that will get voters to see the point of sticking with him? This is all the more frustrating because Biden has many accomplishments as president to be proud of and which should, theoretically, shape the public’s understanding of him. His first term was surprisingly productive given the narrowness of Democrats’ congressional majorities. His aggressive intervention in the economy with the American Rescue Plan was bold and successful, and he passed major bills securing, among other things, badly needed infrastructure, advanced manufacturing jobs at home, major clean energy investment, and lower prescription drug prices for seniors.  But voters have famously short memories. Polling shows that huge swaths of Americans are unaware of Biden’s signature policy achievements, and some even credit Trump for passing Biden’s infrastructure policy. A New York Times / Siena College poll taken earlier this year showed that more than twice as many voters think Trump’s policies helped them personally compared with Biden’s. Dispiriting as this may be, it means that Biden cannot rest on his laurels — he needs to set up more big swings and give people positive reasons to vote for him that speaks to their current concerns. While Biden’s execution of his agenda was remarkable, a lot of his motivation to take it on in the first place was due to circumstances that don’t exist anymore. Biden’s 2020 policy vision was beefed up by that year’s primaries, which generated Democrats’ most progressive policy debate in decades. Biden presented himself as among the most centrist of the candidates in the race, but after the primaries he adopted more progressive policies in a coordinated show of party unity with former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. This year the primaries were mostly a formality and Biden was not challenged to show policy ambition. Additionally, Biden took office during the pandemic, and his advisers counseled him to spend aggressively to avoid the mistakes of former President Barack Obama’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. He not only had a political imperative to go after big policies, but an economic one — neither of which he had coming into this campaign.  Biden will from time to time discuss policies he favors, but they generally take the form of vague and technocratic incrementalism, rather than a discernible and coherent vision. Americans can intuit that there are threats to their freedom beyond Trump, embedded in the way our political and economic systems operate. Given how badly inflation battered how ordinary Americans experienced and perceived the economy during his term, it is political malpractice not to propose headline-generating and coalition-building policies that will help Americans’ feel optimistic about the economy. What happened to Biden’s support for a public option, which has the potential to set in motion a revolution in reforming our barbaric and exorbitant health care system? Better yet, why not shoot straight for Medicare for All? What about aggressively lobbying for a higher minimum wage? What universal policy ideas does Biden have on issues like the cost of housing and higher education that can speak to the electorate’s desire for sweeping change? If Biden wants to do the right thing, excite progressives and show bold foreign policy vision, he should chart an independent course from Israel and stop subsidizing its brutal military operation in Gaza. What about tapping into widespread disenchantment with an increasingly radical Supreme Court by promising Supreme Court reform? Biden’s struggles in communicating clearly are only exacerbating his agenda problem. At the debate, Biden brought up a great policy — an enhanced child tax credit — multiple times. But he spoke in rushed, incomplete sentences and was often barely audible. He did not explain how it works in simple, clear and attractive language. He did not sell this idea as part of a package of exciting proposals tied to economic freedom, but instead jammed it into a rushed list of policies that are hard for nonpolicy wonks to follow as he scrambled to play defense against Trump. One can't help but feel that the Biden campaign is sleepwalking. Just as Biden is out of touch with voters’ widespread doubts about his ability to serve another term, he is also out of touch with how to renew their faith in him as someone who can deliver a better future. A future worth organizing for, funding and mobilizing to make into a reality. If Biden does not step aside — and he's adamant that he won't — then becoming assertive and ambitious on policy is maybe the only thing he can do to re-engage with a public that's dangerously cool on him. It may not be enough to save him. But Americans deserve a better campaign than, ""Hey, at least I'm not a fascist."""
The multiple tragedies of a Trump-nominated judge’s sexual misconduct,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/joshua-kindred-trump-judge-sexual-misconduct-rcna160912,"In December 2019, after Joshua Kindred was nominated by then-President Donald Trump to a federal district court judgeship in Alaska, he fielded questions from senators tasked with assessing his fitness for the job. One of them — Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii — asked him a question she poses to all judicial nominees: ""Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors, or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?"" Kindred, a state prosecutor-turned-Department of Interior lawyer, answered, ""No."" Ultimately, he was confirmed by the full Senate in mid-February 2020 by a vote of 54-41. Yet Kindred, who is only in his 40s, has now resigned from the job he could have held for life. And, perhaps not coincidentally, his resignation came the same day a judicial council overseeing misconduct complaints for his court publicly released an order summarizing the evidence collected through its ""thorough investigation"" of a complaint against Kindred and reflecting its judgment that Kindred should voluntarily resign. Specifically, the order ""reprimanded and admonished"" him for ""creating a hostile work environment for his law clerks and ... having an inappropriately sexualized relationship with one of his law clerks both during her clerkship and after she became [a federal prosecutor]."" Kindred's two-sentence resignation letter, submitted to President Joe Biden on July 3, did not address the allegations. There's no proof Kindred lied when he told Hirono he had never sexually harassed or assaulted anyone. But even the limited evidence discussed in the order suggests he was no novice, especially in fostering a hostile work environment. In particular, ""nearly all"" of his current and former law clerks sat for interviews, despite their stated ""reluctance or discomfort at being involved in the investigation,"" according to the judicial council's report. And collectively, they revealed his pattern of highly sexualized workplace talk, including ""encouraging rating people based on 'fuckability,'"" or soliciting a clerk's romantic advice after a federal prosecutor had sent him nude photos of herself. His 628 pages of texts with his clerks were filled with similar vulgarities and seemingly more frequent; with one law clerk, he exchanged 278 pages of texts in just 11 months, ""only a small fraction of which had any relationship to her legitimate job duties."" Calling himself her ""biggest cheerleader,"" he predicted he would become an ""emotional wreck"" when her clerkship ended. But what reads like an unrequited, consuming crush over texts escalated into something more pernicious in real life: at least two incidents of sexual contact, each of which seemed unwelcome from the report's narrative. For example, before the more significant of the two episodes, the clerk told the investigators, ""I just remember thinking like there's nothing I can do about this, like this is about to happen."" That doesn't exactly sound consensual. Yet when Kindred was given the opportunity to argue his case before the judicial council, he reflected that his ""great sin"" was that he ""treated [his] law clerks as friends rather than employees."" The judicial council, on the other hand, framed his misconduct more starkly: ""Judge Kindred created an atmosphere in which he was inappropriately inserting himself into the personal lives of his law clerks, engaging in a sexualized relationship with one of his law clerks, and having sexually suggestive and explicit conversations with his law clerks."" Kindred has not publicly addressed the allegations. He did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. Some of his alleged conduct might have come to light sooner if Congress had passed legislation, like that proposed by Hirono in past years, that would protect federal judicial employees from retaliation and sex discrimination. Still, even that doesn't go far enough. Beyond his impact on the careers of courthouse employees, did Kindred's attitudes about gender, sex and sexuality, whether owned or implicit, impact how he ruled in the cases before him? A survey of his opinions suggests Kindred did not encounter any sexual harassment claim he deemed worthy of a trial, let alone a verdict. Among the plaintiffs whose claims he dismissed is an Alaska state trooper trainee who alleged a fellow recruit entered her dorm while she was sleeping and later commented to her about watching her and also entered the women's locker room while she was undressed — both alleged acts violate academy rules. Kindred threw out her claims because while ""inappropriate, these two instances of harassment were relatively isolated, not 'extremely serious,' and were investigated."" Another plaintiff, a National Park Service employee, alleged that her boss grabbed her by the arm, hugged her and rubbed her back without her permission — and also would ""stalk"" her as she walked to her office or as she waited for an office printer. Yet none of her allegations were sufficiently pervasive and severe to constitute a hostile work environment either, Kindred found. In the wake of Kindred's resignation, neither of them will ever achieve redress. Meanwhile, justice for federal litigants in Alaska may be delayed, as Kindred's resignation leaves the state with only one active federal district court judge. And until we find a more probing, less punitive way of vetting judicial nominees, we too are doomed to award federal judgeships to those who collect brass rings and political patrons, without sufficient attention to what matters most: character."
Don’t expect Ukraine to get any closer to NATO membership at this week's summit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nato-washington-summit-ukraine-rcna160890,"On the eve of NATO’s Washington summit, which runs Tuesday to Thursday and marks the alliance’s 75th anniversary, American foreign policy mavens identified with the realist school of thought signed an open letter warning against steps that would move Ukraine closer to NATO membership. First published in Politico and later in the U.K.’s Guardian, the letter makes a case against such steps on two grounds. The first is that it would increase the risks of war with Russia. Article V of the alliance’s April 4, 1949, founding treaty provides — albeit with some wiggle room — for the collective defense of member states that come under attack. Were Russia to attack a Ukraine allied with NATO, the U.S.-led military pact would be at war with Russia. The letter writers’ second argument against bringing Ukraine into NATO is that no important American national security interest warrants running this risk. The letter’s signatories might have spared themselves the effort of writing. Even though NATO membership is something President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government has pushed for and, according to a recent poll, 77% of Ukrainians desire, there’s no chance NATO will take concrete steps that solidify Ukraine’s prospects for membership. To understand why NATO won’t oblige Ukraine, we need to look back and look forward. At NATO’s 2008 summit in Budapest, Hungary, President George W. Bush goaded a divided NATO to agree in principle to admit Ukraine. Such is the influence of the U.S. within the alliance: Without America’s military might, Article V would be meaningless. But even though Bush prevailed, so, in a sense, did the countries leery about admitting Ukraine. The part of that summit’s closing statement that pertained to Ukraine was noncommittal. It averred that NATO looked forward to welcoming Ukraine into its ranks but made no promises and didn’t provide a timeline. Because of divisions in NATO, Kyiv was consigned to the alliance’s waiting room for 14 years, at which point Russia invaded. It didn’t even receive the Membership Action Plan promised in the Budapest statement. While the possibility of Ukraine’s membership increased tensions between Kyiv and Moscow, when Putin ordered his army to march on Kyiv in 2022, Ukraine was left naked. The disunity within NATO over Ukraine’s membership has become even deeper. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are avid supporters, but elsewhere the mood ranges from reluctance to the outright opposition evident in Hungary and Slovakia. Worse, the success of far-right parties in the latest elections to the European Parliament (23 of 32 NATO countries also belong to the European Union) and their stronger presence in countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and even Sweden bode ill for Ukraine’s chances. Now, one might point out that more NATO countries support Ukraine’s admission than oppose it. That would be a good point if decisions on enlarging NATO were reached by a majority vote. But that’s not how it works. According to Article 10 of the founding treaty, “The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty.” This formulation gives any member nation a veto. Ukraine’s problems don’t end there. The U.S. has been unwilling to throw its weight behind Ukraine. In a May 28 interview with Time, President Joe Biden highlighted Russia’s threat to Ukraine and Europe more generally. But he had this to say when queried about “the endgame” for Ukraine: “Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That’s what peace looks like. And it doesn’t mean ... they are part of NATO, it means we have a relationship with them like we do with other countries, where we supply weapons so they can defend themselves in the future. ... I am not prepared to support the NATOization of Ukraine.” In Kyiv’s corridors of power, the realities that block Ukraine’s entry into NATO are well understood, even as they evoke frustration and disappointment. Much of what will happen at the summit that started Tuesday is entirely predictable: NATO will tout its past successes, the democratic values that bind it, the doubling of its membership from 16 at the peak of the Cold War to its current 32, its members’ increased defense spending and its support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russia. What’s equally foreseeable is that NATO won’t take any decision that definitively brings Ukraine closer to membership. NATO’s statement could reportedly include strong new language that aligns with or explicitly echoes NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s statement in April declaring Ukraine’s path to membership “irreversible.” That would mean Ukraine could become a member at some future, unknown, date. If that happens, Kyiv is likely to be pleased about the language. It would mean that Russia can’t count on a political settlement to its war with Ukraine that depends on Ukraine being kept out of NATO. But even a statement signaling that Ukraine’s path to membership is irreversible still wouldn’t set aside the requirement for unanimity within NATO for admitting new members. That’s not present now, and when it will be remains uncertain."
"At least 186,000 deaths in Gaza could result from Israel-Hamas war, researchers estimate",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 3:54 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/gaza-death-toll-lancet-israel-hamas-war-rcna160902,"More than 186,000 deaths in Gaza could result from the Israel-Hamas war, according to an analysis published by The Lancet medical journal. The analysis, which was published in The Lancet’s correspondence section, was not peer-reviewed, but it underscores the difficulty of accurately documenting the conflict’s death toll. The official Gaza toll since Oct. 7 is at least 38,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The researchers pointed to the number of eventual indirect deaths in recent conflicts, which ranged from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. “Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will continue to be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive, communicable, and non-communicable diseases,” they wrote. For their estimate, the researchers added four indirect deaths for each direct death reported so far in Gaza, concluding that “it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict.” Counting the death toll in Gaza is a monumental effort that has become increasingly difficult, with international human rights groups and news reports saying the official count is likely incomplete. Authorities have struggled to identify the bodies buried in mass graves, or body parts pulled from the rubble, while suffering from starvation and dehydration themselves. Israeli government agencies have previously accused the Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, of inflating the death toll. President Joe Biden similarly suggested at one point that those numbers are not to be believed. However, human rights groups, news organizations and even Israeli intelligence services have previously considered the health ministry’s numbers to be largely accurate. Israel’s assault on Gaza after Hamas’ attack has been catastrophic. United Nations experts say famine is spreading throughout Gaza, and they accuse Israel of carrying out a “targeted starvation campaign” against Palestinians. Much of Gaza’s infrastructure — schools, hospitals, housing, and water and electricity supplies — has been destroyed or damaged. The human toll of the war has been especially devastating. Most of the people killed in the past nine months have been women and children, according to the official numbers. The Associated Press recently documented 60 Palestinian families in which at least 25 people have been killed, with some of the deaths spanning four generations in one family."
Here’s why the debate over Joe Biden’s future is so important,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 3:36 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/latest/democrats-strategy-biden-beat-trump-2024-rcna160901,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 8 episode of “Inside with Jen Psaki.” President Joe Biden has come out fighting. It all started with his letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, vowing to stay in the race. Less than an hour later, the president was on the phone with our friends at “Morning Joe” doubling down on that promise. If this is a stare-down, and in many ways it is, Biden isn’t blinking.  As the president keeps a busy schedule, traveling to swing states and meeting with world leaders at the NATO summit, Donald Trump has been virtually out of sight since the debate. We’re seeing a defiant Biden and a virtually silent Trump. Even so, there are daily reminders of the threat the former president poses and the importance of defeating him. The thing is, there’s no universal agreement right now on who is the best person to do that. The clock is ticking, that’s just a fact. The Democratic National Convention is just a few weeks away and the election is in four months. On Monday, I spoke to two Democratic senators, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who have slightly different views on the right path forward. Fetterman has been arguably the president’s fiercest defender since the debate, joining Biden on his campaign swing through Pennsylvania. And then there’s Murphy, who’s been open about how Biden needs to do more to reassure the public. Two Democratic senators, both patriots who love their country and love the president, and who just happen to be answering the same question a little bit differently right now. And guess what? That’s OK. Disagreement is a sign of a healthy democracy. Disagreement is what Trump and the Republican Party want to get rid of in this country. While good faith actors in the Democratic Party openly discuss the best path forward, Republicans are blindly defending everything a man convicted of 34 felonies says and does. And that blind loyalty means everything is on the line in this election: women’s rights, the Supreme Court, the rule of law and, yes, democracy itself. The prospect of a criminally immune criminal in the most powerful office in the world is on the line. Fetterman knows that, and so does Murphy. Biden’s closest advisers know that, and, yes, the people calling on him to drop out of the race know that, too. We know winning has never been more important than it is this November. We know losing is not an option. It’s because the stakes are so high that there’s disagreement about how we get there. No one in the Democratic Party is disputing that Biden is an incredibly decent and empathetic human being. When I met with him for the first time about the White House press secretary job, his biggest focus was on whether I could play a role in returning civility and respect for the media to the briefing room. He didn’t want shouting matches or accusations. He wanted to restore dignity to the office. That’s who he is.  He is a person who asks about your kids and your family. A person who, when I was there two years ago, was so relentless that he would keep meetings going in the Oval Office for hours. He cares deeply about the country. He ran not for fame or fortune, and certainly not to keep himself out of jail but because he is a person who believes in public service and in making the lives of others better. He wants to help the guy from Scranton he talks to after church who feels left behind and forgotten. Representing those people is his calling, and that's what has always driven him to run for office. He was the uniter when the country needed it. He was the comforter-in-chief when people were mourning loved ones lost to Covid. It’s not just that he has defied the odds repeatedly in his career, including when he ran for president in 2020, landing in fourth place in Iowa and still coming back to win the nomination and defeat Trump. It’s not just that he forged ahead in pursuing bipartisan legislation at a time when most people said that was malarkey, as he might say; it's that he did it through hard work, relationship building and compromise — a part of governing that’s largely been lost in Washington. If you’re sitting there reading all of this and feel angry, I get it. If you feel frustrated, I get that, too. Biden is a good man who has been a great president and pushed forward an impressive agenda. That’s just a fact. But this discussion right now is not about that. It’s not about whether he defied the odds in 2020. He did. Or whether he defied the odds during his first term. He did. It’s not about whether he would stand up for democracy. He would. It’s whether he is the right person to defeat Donald Trump.  We don’t know at this moment exactly where voters stand on that question, and they are ultimately the only ones that matter. There are legitimate questions, and it isn’t only rich donors and coastal elites who are asking them. I worked for him, I respect him and I care about him deeply, but if I told you that every question being asked is unfair, I wouldn’t be respecting you. I’m not going to do that.  Yes, the president and his team came out fighting. He was defiant — a sign of vigor that is important in this moment, but that’s not his most effective message. This election will be won not by someone who simply name-calls Trump but by someone who can articulate clearly to the American public that Trump is not fighting for them. He is fighting for himself. Biden has done that effectively and can do it effectively. But the man I saw on that debate stage in Atlanta was not the person I worked for more than two years ago: a person who switched between spontaneous calls to members of Congress and to foreign leaders, who grilled policy people for more answers and harangued spokespeople for speaking in acronyms. That was not the person we all saw.  So maybe it was just one bad night, but the president will have to keep answering questions and convincing skeptics he’s up to the job. He has started that process, with interviews and campaign events, and there’s a big test coming up Thursday with a solo press conference after the NATO summit. Everything he does will be scrutinized. So while defiance is a start, defiance alone will not win back every supporter he needs, and neither will denial about the reality right now."

He was intensely homophobic (in opposing same-sex marriage, he once boasted to the Senate that in the ""recorded history"" of his family ""we've never had a divorce or any kind of a homosexual relationship""), he was rabidly pro-gun (he once blamed mass shootings on ""permissive laws"" in sanctuary cities) and opposed abortion rights. But Inhofe was best known for his zealous denial of the climate crisis and that human activity was its primary driver. (The New York Times reported, ""Mining, oil, gas, coal and utility interests were generous contributors to Mr. Inhofe’s Senate campaigns."") Inhofe called climate change “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” In 2015, when he was chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, he infamously took a snowball onto the Senate floor during a snowstorm, ostensibly to demonstrate that global warming was not real. Staffers told Politico's E&E News in 2020 that the stunt was intended to highlight media hypocrisy. “Whenever it’s hot in the summer, everyone’s like ‘Oh, my gosh, climate change!’ But if it’s something that doesn’t play into the global warming element, like a snowstorm in February, people don’t say, ‘Oh, my gosh, it’s climate change,’” the staffer who wrote the speech told the outlet. The Oklahoma Republican was also a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, who shared his denial of climate science. Inhofe had an outsize influence on the Trump administration's environmental agenda, according to The Washington Post. Yet he broke with members of his own party in 2020, opting to certify Joe Biden's election win in a move that earned him backlash among some Republicans. Twice, however, Inhofe voted against impeaching Trump."
Biden has stumbled on a way out of his post-debate mess,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-age-campaign-trump-debate-rcna160846,       
Democrats can replace Biden. But it won’t be like anything we’ve seen before.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 1:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-replacement-president-race-democrat-history-rcna160923,"How easy would it be for Democrats to replace President Joe Biden as their nominee? The answer lies at the intersection of party rules, party practices and voter expectations — and the conflicting goals of a party process. Most accounts of the modern presidential nomination process start in the late 1960s. The Democrats’ 1968 convention was a disaster, with protests inside and outside the gathering driven by party divisions over the Vietnam War and other policy issues, and growing discontent with the lack of grassroots input into nominations. After the tumult, the Democratic National Committee convened a commission to construct a new nominating process for the party. The result was largely the system we have now: States select delegates to the convention through primaries, caucuses or conventions, but these have to be open to all party members, with publicized dates and times. Though these reforms were intended to make the process more open and democratic, it’s a misconception that the goal was to write the party out. Instead, the delegates still choose the nominee at the convention. So who is a delegate and what do they do? There are two groups: “pledged” delegates (those selected in primaries and caucuses) and unpledged “superdelegates” (elected officials and party leaders who can vote as they please). You may recall superdelegates playing crucial roles in the delegate math during the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries, but after the latter contest, the party changed the rules to weaken their influence slightly. Now, only “pledged” delegates can vote on the first ballot for president; superdelegates join on subsequent ballots. The party rules state that delegates are bound by “conscience” to vote as they are pledged — and most are pledged for Biden. But from a formal rules perspective, it isn’t a big deal for delegates to vote differently on the first ballot at the convention. They aren’t legally bound, nor do the rules outline any consequences for delegates who vote differently. Where things get complicated is the informal party practices that have developed over time, and the voter expectations that come with them. It’s generally expected that delegates will vote as they are pledged — based on the primary votes of the states they represent. One reason for this is that primary contests help party leaders know what primary voters are thinking, and which candidates they prefer. It’s also expected that the nomination is sewn up well before the convention. Experts disagree somewhat about exactly how this happens. Some emphasize the early primaries as ways for candidates to show strength, while others stress the role of the “invisible primary,” in which different groups — say, environmentalists, labor or pro-choice activists for Democrats; religious conservatives and business interests for Republicans — weigh in and steer the process toward nominees who would be broadly acceptable to all groups. This is probably a much larger sticking point than the formal rules. In order to select a new Democratic presidential nominee, delegates would need some method to coordinate. Otherwise, the Wisconsin delegation could go in one direction, and the Florida one in another. Or progressives and establishment Democrats could set themselves up for a rough floor fight with the world watching. Or each faction could find itself divided among alternative candidates. As with the process under normal circumstances, party leaders would need to coordinate either among themselves or in consultation with voters. But what do the party’s voters want? At this point in the nomination process, the voters’ formal role has usually ended, with each state and territory having held its primary or caucus. The official rules of the party allow the delegates to make the selection on their own (or, if a post-convention nomination process is necessary, the party leaders can choose). But parties want to win elections, which requires paying attention to what voters want. And that’s tricky at this stage. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., floated the hypothetical idea of a “mini-primary” before the delegates take their roll call votes, but it’s not clear what that would look like. Delegates in a potential replacement situation would have public opinion data to build on, but it’s likely we would see some kind of institutional innovation in order to weigh the preferences of voters. This exact scenario has never played out. Parties have generally re-nominated sitting presidents, often without serious competition, since the late 19th century. But thinking through how it might happen requires pulling together these three strains: what the formal rules say, what the informal practices are and what the voters want. One possibility is that, should President Biden decide to withdraw from the nomination and not run for re-election, the Democratic Party would do a shortened version of its usual process, coordinating among leaders, crucial interest groups and the party’s voters, in order to select a new nominee. It’s likely that this process would heavily feature promotion of Vice President Kamala Harris, promoting her as the continuation of the administration while also gauging support for her. Absent the informal aspects of the process, a convention that relies simply on the party’s delegates could be quite chaotic. Even when conventions regularly chose presidential nominees — the first presidential primaries date only back to 1912 — there was often informal coordination and persuasion going on. This is what people refer to when they talk about a “brokered” convention — and the modern era leaves a lot of questions open about who the brokers would be and how they would operate. When these efforts failed, the conventions would need multiple ballots to figure out a presidential nominee, with new and sometimes unexpected names floated before the delegates. There’s nothing in the formal rules to prevent this sort of convention from happening now. If President Biden steps aside and the Democrats select a new nominee, the process can build on existing formal and informal rules. But it also will require innovation and indeed improvisation, because it will be unlike anything we’ve seen in American politics for decades."
‘The Bachelor’ let down its first Black male lead. Will it do better by Jenn Tran?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 1:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jenn-tran-asian-american-bachelorette-lead-rcna160934,"As the first Asian American Bachelorette, Jenn Tran is very aware of the added responsibility she carries.  “I want to be able to make everybody proud and make my heritage proud,” Tran, a 26-year-old physician assistant student, said during the season premiere Monday. “I think what it really comes down to is that I just have to be myself and do the best that I can do.” Indeed, already Tran is everything you’d want a Bachelorette to be: funny, bubbly, telegenic, open to new experiences and excited to find love. She can declare it “shot o’clock” one moment and then sit down for an earnest conversation about shared family history the next. (Bachelorettes can do it all!) There’s no question that Tran will be a capable lead — one episode in, she’s already shown herself to be a great choice. However, the jury is still out on whether a television franchise steeped in institutional racism is capable of doing right by her. When Tran was named the next Bachelorette back in March, the announcement was met with shock and excitement from Asian fans of the franchise. “I’ve watched #TheBachelorette since its first season and never thought I’d see the day we’d get an Asian American lead!” tweeted Washington Post reporter Jada Yuan, who watched the announcement live from a bar in Brooklyn, New York, and witnessed the pure joy of the two Vietnamese American women sitting next to her. After all, fans of color have come to expect as little as possible from “The Bachelor” franchise. The show’s less-than-stellar diversity track record is common knowledge at this point. For years, fans darkly joked about the way that contestants of color would show up for a week or two but never became serious contenders. After a class action lawsuit was filed in 2012 — the show began airing in 2002 — “The Bachelor” seemed to work a bit harder to inject racial diversity into its dating pool. But there were still no Black leads until Rachel Lindsay’s season of “The Bachelorette” in 2017, and the franchise took even longer to cast a Black man in the lead role, finally casting Matt James in 2020, the year George Floyd’s death at the hands of police set off national protests and a national racial reckoning. But the casting of Lindsay and James also proved that true representation is about more than ticking a box. Both grappled with the challenges of being a highly visible first while working within a show infrastructure that wasn’t equipped to support them. “I’m going to be really frank — we let Matt down,” executive producer Bennett Graebner told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published shortly before the beginning of Tran’s season. “That season went wrong on so many levels,” Graebner said, calling the show’s 15-year wait for a Black lead “inexcusable.” “We did not protect him as we should have.”  Graebner and fellow EP Claire Freeland seem ready to answer publicly for the franchise’s long-running failures — failures that didn’t stop with James’ season. Freeland came on board from the Canadian “Bachelor” franchise after creator Mike Fleiss was ousted in 2023 after a Warner Bros. investigation into allegations of racial discrimination made against him. (Fleiss told Variety he was “proud of the work we’ve done over the past five years to make the show substantially more diverse, but I do believe I could have done more. Hopefully, the franchise will continue to move in the right direction.”) Earlier this year, the American show came under fire after Rachel Nance, who made it to the final three on Joey Graziadei's season of “The Bachelor” and is biracial, said she was subjected to a barrage of racist messages after her hometown date. “I got a lot of hateful messages ... calling me the N-word or jungle Asian, all because I got a rose,” Nance told host Jesse Palmer during the women tell-all special. “It’s sad because my parents really enjoyed the hometown episode, and for them to see people attacking our culture and attacking me — I’ve been in this scenario before, but this was like a whole new level.” Instead of calling this what it was — racism from the show’s own fan base — Palmer asked all of the cast members if they had received hateful messages, and then asked the audience to temper their “strong opinions” in favor of “uplifting” the people who go on the show. (Freeland acknowledged to the L.A. Times that this segment “was another missed opportunity.” “Our intention was to bring light toward what Rachel was going through,” she said. “But we have to do better.”) This long history makes it hard to believe that even the noblest of intentions from producers will make a real difference for the people of color who are generous enough to share their lives and stories with millions of people each season. And even meaningful incremental changes from the show’s production team do not shield cast members from the racist aggressions of the fans that the franchise cultivated for years and years. Amid all of the Instagram posts from Tran excitedly boosting her season, she also reposted a commenter who noted, “We wanted white skin and blonde hair.” I have long wondered if and when “The Bachelor” franchise would be forced to choose between conservative white viewers who want to see the show remain as it was in its heyday when everyone was an evangelical dental hygienist and Black contestants never made it past week three, and more progressive viewers who have been vocally pushing for change from their problematic fave. For years, the show has tried to make both groups happy using cosmetic tweaks that never really addressed the rot at the core. The L.A. Times piece indicates that an affirmative choice has finally been made. Probably. “We can’t change the minds of people who aren’t interested in this new direction. What we have the power to do is change the program,” Freeland told the L.A. Times. Graebner was even more explicit: “If you don’t want to see a Black love story, an Asian American love story, an interracial love story, then maybe Bachelor Nation isn’t for you.” The sentiment is a great one, and one that so many members of Bachelor Nation have been waiting years to hear. But these words only have meaning if they’re backed up by action. So now we wait, and cheer for Jenn Tran. Here’s hoping she finds the love she deserves and doesn’t become a sacrificial lamb to the show’s growth."
Dems seek special counsel to investigate Justice Clarence Thomas,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 12:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-seek-special-counsel-investigate-justice-clarence-thomas-rcna160982,"As a matter of jurisprudence, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has reason to be delighted by the high court’s shift to the far right. Indeed, the controversial jurist has consistently found himself in the majority as he and other Republican-appointed justices have issued a series of reactionary rulings. But while Thomas is likely pleased with the Supreme Court’s ideological direction, he’s probably less satisfied with the difficult ethics questions he’s faced over the last year or so. The Hill just reported, for example, on the latest congressional escalation in the larger discussion. While the letter was dated July 3, the Democratic senators released the correspondence to the public Tuesday. “We do not make this request lightly,” Whitehouse and Wyden wrote. “The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations. Presented with opportunities to resolve questions about his conduct, Justice Thomas has maintained a suspicious silence.” The senators concluded, “No government official should be above the law. Supreme Court justices are properly expected to obey laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety and to comply with the federal tax code. We therefore request that you appoint a Special Counsel authorized to investigate potential criminal violations by Justice Thomas under the disclosure, false statement, and tax laws; pursue leads of related criminal violations by donors, lenders, and intermediate corporate entities; and determine whether any such loans and gifts were provided pursuant to a coordinated enterprise or plan.” Circling back to our earlier coverage, Thomas has faced difficult ethics questions for many years, but his difficulties took a more serious turn last spring. ProPublica published a rather devastating report in early April of last year, shining a light on the generous and undisclosed benefits Thomas has received from a Republican megadonor. In the weeks and months that followed, ProPublica took the lead on exposing Thomas’ other unusual ties to his wealthy friend, but the outlet wasn’t alone. The New York Times also took the story further, shining a light on previously unreported benefits the justice has received from a “cohort of wealthy and powerful friends,” thanks to his connections established through the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. The Times added fresh reporting last summer on one of Thomas’ other wealthy pals providing the sitting justice with undisclosed financing that made it possible for Thomas to buy an expensive recreational vehicle. How big was the loan? Neither the justice nor his friend say. How much did Thomas repay? They wouldn’t say. What were the terms of the loan? They wouldn’t say. Was there a formal loan agreement? They wouldn’t say. Soon ProPublica published another report that made the entire controversy look considerably worse, noting that Thomas had received “at least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” In each instance, the far-right jurist’s luxurious benefits “have been underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence.” Though the precise value of the trips is difficult to measure, ProPublica described it as “likely in the millions” of dollars. It’s an impossible dynamic to defend: Thomas has lived the life of a wealthy man, thanks to the generosity of his rich, likeminded friends. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, “There is nothing partisan about calling this what it is: a brazen, shameful abuse of power that undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. That Thomas reportedly took these gifts is alarming enough. That he reportedly took them without disclosing that he had taken them (with rare exceptions) makes it hard to believe that Thomas doesn’t realize how bad this all looks.” Earlier this year it reached the point at which Thomas became a punch-line to jokes about Supreme Court corruption. (In February, The Onion, a satirical outlet, published a memorable item with a headline that read, “Clarence Thomas Announces 50% Discount On All Favorable Rulings.”) Now, at least two senators want the Justice Department to take matters to the next level with the appointment of a special counsel. The attorney general is unlikely to agree, but it’ll be interesting to see how (and whether) Garland responds. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The end of libraries as we know them? with Brewster Kahle and Kyle Courtney: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 11:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/end-libraries-know-brewster-kahle-kyle-courtney-podcast-transcript-rcna160939,"Could the future of libraries as we’ve known them be completely different? Our guests this week say so. Megapublishers are suing the Internet Archive, perhaps best known for its Wayback Machine, to redefine e-books as legally different from paper books. A difference in how they are classified would mean sweeping changes for the way libraries operate. Brewster Kahle is a digital librarian at the Internet Archive. Kyle Courtney is a lawyer, librarian, director of copyright and information policy for Harvard Library. He’s the co-founder of Library Futures, which aims to empower the digital future for America’s libraries. They join to discuss what’s animating the lawsuit, information as a public good and the consequences should the publishers ultimately prevail. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Brewster Kahle: It’s really hard for people to fathom that all of these forces, political, judicial legislative, funding are all going against a tradition that built America out of a set of immigrants and brought us together to be able to know how to work as a populace. And all of that is in well, some of it is going to be judged again by an appellate group in lower Manhattan and we’ll see what it is they decide towards the fate of libraries as we know them. Kyle Courtney: It’s a slippery slope into a licensed only culture in which libraries cannot exist and mission this challenge. I do agree. A lot of people say, oh, this is just about the Internet Archives open libraries program. It’s a narrow focus. I don’t think that’s true. It’s about libraries entering and being supported in the digital space and through the use of either licensing or litigation. That’s a one-two punch, really will threaten the library mission now and in the future. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me your host, Chris Hayes. There is this news recently that I saw that just brought me up short, put my heart in my throat, which was nothing with life or death stakes, just that the mtvnews.com archives of 20 years had disappeared off the Internet. It had been removed by MTV’s parent company Paramount for reasons that were a little unclear, I think some financial decision or maybe site reorganization. But for a one-time freelance writer like myself, the notion of your work being on the Internet and then being taken off is really unnerving. I remember back when I started freelancing, I was writing for the “Chicago Reader,” which didn’t really even have an online version. It was just paper. I would go and pick up the paper version. And I got myself this kind of like leather book that, you know, has like the cellophane and you put the clippings in, and this was a big ritual for me. When I published a new piece, go get the “Chicago Reader,” bring it home, clip it out, put it in my clips book. And then at a certain point, you know, everything was online and there was some notion that we had back then that the Internet is forever, people would say. But the Internet is not forever. So one of the only ways the Internet is forever is an institution known as the Internet Archive, which does a bunch of stuff, which we’ll talk about in this hour, but runs the Wayback Machine you might’ve seen, which basically archives the Internet in real time. And so the Wayback Machine presumably will have the archives of mtvnews.com. And the Internet Archive is fascinating and important I think because it’s one of two pillars of what I would call the old pre-commercial and now non-commercial Internet. Wikipedia and the Internet Archive, neither of which are for-profit enterprises. They embody the notion of a non-commercial collaborative civic vision of the Internet as a storehouse of free and publicly accessible knowledge that people collaborate on. And that pre-commercial vision of the Internet Archive, which runs the Wayback Machine, but also does a bunch of other stuff we’ll talk about has come into conflict with commercial visions of knowledge and intellectual property in the form of a lawsuit, which has been brought by a bunch of publishers, Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley & Sons, Penguin Random House who is going to publish my next book I should note, full disclosure. They sued the Internet Archives in June of 2020, because Internet Archive digitizes physical books and makes them available to people to loan. We’ll talk about how that loaning works. And the publisher said, look, you can’t do this. They said it was willful digital piracy on an industrial scale with the program the Internet Archive runs called the Open Library. And the publishers included in their complaint that the Internet Archives did not have licensing agreements with them, nor does it pay its authors. So a federal district judge found in favor of the publishers in summary judgment ruling last year, and said that the use of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to be deemed fair use. Fair use, of course, is the carve out for a copyrighted material. And the Internet Archive has built a collection of more than 3 million books. It’s purchased them in print or received donations. And patrons of the digital library could borrow up to 10 books simultaneously for two weeks, each just the way you’d borrow physical book. And the Internet Archive says, look, this free e-book lending program is fair use, and it’s a controlled digital lending practice. The publishers say, no, this thing you’re doing controlled digital lending is a frontal assault, I’m quoting here, “on the foundational copyright principle that rights shoulders, exclusively control the terms of sale for every different format of their work. A principle that has spawned the broad diversity in formats of books, music, movies, television, music, the consumers enjoy today,” okay. So that’s part of the topic of today. We’re going to talk to some folks from the Internet Archive, but it’s a deeper conversation about the commercial versus non-commercial Internet, about what fair use is, about the notion of a public intellectual commons. And we should note that this conversation was recorded on June 26, 2024, which was actually just a few days before there was the oral arguments in the Internet Archive’s appeals before a three-judge panel to defend its Open Library controlled digital lending practice. Again, I want to be sort of bending over backwards to be fair here because we’re only listening to one side of the litigants, defendants actually, in this lawsuit. So just to lay this out, but I’m really, really fascinated and obsessed with the notion of reviving, expanding non-commercial models for digital life. So it was really enlightening and energizing to have this conversation about a case study in how that’s playing out right now with Brewster Kahle, who’s a digital librarian at the Internet Archive, intimately involved in the creation of the Wayback Machine, a founder of the enterprise, and Kyle Courtney, who is a lawyer, librarian, director of copyright information policy for Harvard Library. He’s co-founder of Library Futures, which aims to empower the digital future for America’s libraries. Here’s our conversation. Brewster, let me start with you and just take me through your background and how you, I mean, you’re one of the founders, creators, right? Brewster Kahle: Yeah, I’m the founder of the Internet Archive. Chris Hayes: You’re the guy, right. Brewster Kahle: Yeah, we started in 1996, and it took us that long because we had to get a lot of the rest of the Internet, like it was the ARPANET when I got going. So we had to actually get the Internet going. We had to have computers and search engines, we had the publishers online. But once I helped, I mean, I didn’t do all of that, but I helped go and get, you know, “New York Times’” first website up, the first “Wall Street Journal” website up, then we could build the library. So in 1996, we turned to build the library. And it’s been great. We’ve been archiving web pages, but also television, books, music, video, all your old flash games, all of that stuff. Chris Hayes: So just tell me about yourself personally, like how you found your way to this work. You’re obviously tech savvy, early adopter kind of person. Like what was your first connection to the Internet? Brewster Kahle: Oh, I’m a geek. So I started to at MIT, but I’m sort of in the tail end of the hippies, right? The sort of like, what can you do with your life that would be a good thing to do? And the idea of building the digital library of Alexandria seemed like a great idea in 1980. We’ve been promising the Library of Congress on your desktop for 35 years before that, starting with Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson. We’ve been promising this. It’s like, how hard could it be? And technically, it turns out to not be that hard, but boy, it’s been a long road. We’re not even there yet. Chris Hayes: I like this idea of the Alexandria Library of the Internet. Like, where did the idea come from and how do you start actually doing it? Brewster Kahle: It started with a technical conversation. We knew that digital publishing was going to happen. I mean, this is before the Macintosh. So it’s like, we knew all this stuff was going to go online. Chris Hayes: What years was this? Brewster Kahle: We’re talking 1980. Chris Hayes: Okay. So it goes back that far that you were thinking about this in these -- Brewster Kahle: Yeah, I’m old. But, you know, it wasn’t new to me. The idea of building access to all the information in the world, having that all at your fingertips has been in the air since the Library of Alexandria. The idea of having all the published works of humankind available to you was the promise when you walked into a library. And then you (ph) slogged your bones. When I was growing up, you slogged your bones in the library. They said, we have everything. And if we don’t have it here, we’ll get it for you from interlibrary loan. And that was how the American sort of Carnegie Library ethos of America and it was so important for educating people, for getting people ready for elections. A lot of it came out of the progressive era to go and try to get it so that when people are doing direct elections, they’re educated citizenry. All of that momentum was the world that I grew up in. And I had a new trick. I knew technology. And I also knew how long it would be before we would be able to have all of the books in the Library of Congress online and then all the movies online and all lectures at Harvard and anywhere else online. And you could just plot it out. So those conversations with Richard Feynman and Danny Hillis, Marvin Minsky, Stephen Wolfram. We just charted it out and it was like, this isn’t that hard. Let’s just go build it. And so that is, I don’t know, some of the early ethos of the Internet. It wasn’t uncommon, but it also sort of led some of those things. By 1996, it’s still before Wikipedia, it was before Google, it was way before YouTube. We knew that we needed to go and take the wonderful things that people were going and putting onto their websites. They were offering and sharing and putting unbelievable things and it was all getting lost. The average life of a web page is only 100 days -- Chris Hayes: Wow. Brewster Kahle: -- before it’s changed or deleted. And in the old days, publishers would go and publish things and they’d be bought by libraries and put in many places. So even when the publisher goes away, because they always do, there’s libraries that will be there that will store and keep the real precious things, which is the works of humankind, alive. And that’s what we went to try to build with the Wayback Machine and the Internet Archive. Chris Hayes: And that incorporated like officially in 1996? Brewster Kahle: Yes. Chris Hayes: And how -- Brewster Kahle: That’s when we started crawling the web with the Smithsonian Institution. Chris Hayes: Yeah. So how did you build it institutionally? Like, was it a 501(c)(3)? How did it work as an institution? Brewster Kahle: Nonprofit from the very beginning because this is everybody else’s stuff, right? We are custodians of everyone else’s materials, starting with the presidential election of 1996. You should see these old websites, man. They’re really critty-crufty, but they’re like the first bumper stickers in the early 1950s is the way the Smithsonian saw it. And we saw it as the beginning of the library of not just the elite that can publish books, but everyone’s words, everyone’s blogs, though there weren’t blogs yet. But every -- Chris Hayes: Web diaries. Brewster Kahle: -- city sites, web diaries, all of these things that were happening at that time as people were sharing up a storm because they could. Chris Hayes: So walk me through technically what the project was. Like, you said that you figured it out technically before you started doing it as an institution. Before we get to that, were you raising money? You have donors, you have members, did the Smithsonian pay you for the service? Like how did it work financially? Brewster Kahle: No, they didn’t pay us. I got lucky because along this route, I was helping building the publishing systems to get the publishers on board so they could start making money by publishing on the net. And that was bought by AOL. It was called Waze. It was the system before the World Wide Web. So that’s, I guess, why I’m probably in the Internet Hall of Fame is I did the earliest systems for publishers. And then that was put on AOL to help publishers. Then once I was done and I left, then the idea was like, what’s the most ephemeral of media? We said, let’s do the web. And so we made little crawlers and these crawlers are little robots. They’re programs that basically click every link on every web page and it just downloads a page and remembers it and then makes the file out of it and then finds the links and adds it to the queue. And then it clicks on that one and then finds the links on it and it’s a queue. And it just goes round and round and round and round. And we collected a copy of the web every two months, a snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, starting then. It’s gotten much more complicated now, but we’re collecting about 300 million web pages every day, about a billion URLs every day now. Chris Hayes: I have to say, back in 2002 or ‘03, I started a blog. This is pre-WordPress, so I had to hand code it in HTML. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. God bless. Chris Hayes: And put it up. And I had a thought a while ago, like, I wonder if that exists anywhere, and sure enough, on the Wayback Machine, I’m not going to tell you the name of this blog because I don’t want anyone to go read what I was writing when I was 23. It’s fine. It’s nothing like offensive. Brewster Kahle: Okay. Chris Hayes: It’s all perfectly defensible, but I was just a little baby. Brewster Kahle: Well, you started out with the MTV News and we got that for you. So MTV, we think we have it completely, but we also have the newspapers in Turkey and Russia and all these others that have been basically taken down with no warning. Chris Hayes: From a technical standpoint, it seems like a ton of data. And then you have, this is all very text-based, mostly text-based, text and image, still image when you’re when you start doing this in ‘96. Then you have the dawn of video and video comes to dominate huge portions of the Internet. I think it’s probably, if you think about social media -- Brewster Kahle: It’s huge. Chris Hayes: It’s the dominant media now. And that seems like an order of magnitude change in how you would do things and how you would save it. Like, do you start to have constraints on what you could hold? Brewster Kahle: Thank God that these guys are working so hard to make hard drives bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. So we have to replace all the hard drives every five years and then we have to reel in a new rack every few weeks to be able to keep up with the unbelievable amount of material. So we collect about a billion URLs every day. And a lot of those URLs now are images. Chris Hayes: It’s so nuts. Brewster Kahle: It’s nuts. People love this stuff. They are sharing up a storm. The idea that people will only do things for money is just not true. Chris Hayes: No. Brewster Kahle: People will do things because they can get some positive feedback from each other and share where they can, as long as it doesn’t cost them any money. So why don’t we make it so that giving things away doesn’t cost you? And that was sort of the premise of libraries and the Internet Archive. Chris Hayes: This point, just to go back, I’d like to hear some of your thoughts just to sync up with the monologue about the Internet I fell in love with, and again, I always sound like an old man talking about, you know, kids these days and in my youth, whatever. But the Internet I fell in love with is largely non-commercial enterprise in which people were motivated by all kinds of things, some of which were noble and some of which were base. I mean, you know, humans are humans. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But almost none of it was pecuniary, right? So people might want to, you know, get into a flame war because they wanted to assert domination or they were incorrigible contrarians and like to argue or they might want to share really cool stuff because creating cool stuff and showing it off as fun, the whole sort of spectrum of human motivation. But it was not commercialized and it was not done explicitly for profit, and it wasn’t done for profit at scale in which engineers are working very hard to figure out how to hack people’s attention such that you can maximize monetization. And I would like you to talk a little bit about why you think that’s an important ethos to preserve, because that is part of what you’re doing. And if it is an important ethos to preserve. Brewster Kahle: There’s a role on all sides of this. And so most people just want to be heard. They want to have some recognition. They don’t want to feel like they’ve been taken advantage of. And we develop search engines to help people, guide people to these even obscure topics to go and find your people no matter where they are in the world. Fabulous. But you also have people that wanted to make money by publishing on the net. And that’s not bad. Chris Hayes: No. Brewster Kahle: As long as if they’re not exclusionary about it or if they’re not sort of this platform that’s trying to control a whole media type, then that’s the controlling aspect that is really causing so much trouble out there, is not so much that, you know, a kid wants to sell his song off of his garage band. Actually, it’s really hard to do that. And that’s, I think, one of the faults is we made peer-to-peer selling so difficult and we basically have to sign up to go and put on iTunes or Amazon or the like. We’re trying to make a more decentralized web so that you can go and have people go and participate in their communities, sell a little bit if they can make some money off of it. And, you know, most people aren’t going to buy your rock and roll song, sorry, but at least it’s a possibility. And let’s keep it so that there’s no central points of control. And we have got people vying for monopoly control now in such a way that it’s really debilitating. So while we’re trying to keep up with the social media, some of those are very locked down. So you can’t even keep a record of it, even that’s sometimes the only way politicians are going and communicating their points of view. That’s not good. Chris Hayes: Oh, that’s interesting. So there are parts of the Internet on platforms that are essentially closed to the archiving that you’re doing. Brewster Kahle: Yes, but some of them are opening up. Reddit just yesterday went and said, yeah, we’re closing up to the AI guys, but the Internet Archive is A-okay, which we’re kind of happy about and other research organizations. So I think that going and showing that there is a role for libraries that’s different from Babylon is a good thing. But the control aspects and I wouldn’t say it’s just the platforms that, you know, you’re normally talking about the Internet platforms, but the publisher platforms and the back ends of these things, the television networks that are very closed, the book publishers, the magazine, the academic journals just so closed. Chris Hayes: So you’re saying when you say closed, what do you mean by that technically? Brewster Kahle: That it doesn’t operate the same way it used to, that basically libraries and people would buy things in the old days, they preserve them and then they would make them available to themselves or their communities through lending and they’d interoperate. But what we’ve got now is organizations going and saying, no, we’re going to want to watch every page turn. We’re going to want to be able to take that thing down. We want to be able to change that e-book. We want to go and make it so libraries don’t own anything in the digital world. That’s the problem. And there’s been lots of talk of the social media networks and the issues around that, you know, true issues. But I don’t think we’re really looking at some of the back end organizations that are exerting a level of control because they can in this digital world for surveillance and ultimately being able to change and delete things without anybody having a record of it. No libraries are allowed. Chris Hayes: Right. So if we think broadly, not just I mean, so when we started talking about this and when the way I think about the Wayback Machine specifically, which is just one part of the Internet Archive, right, is this all this sort of digital ephemera, you know, someone’s LiveJournal, right, someone’s MySpace page, someone’s political blog. When you start moving up to entities that are big corporate interests that are producing intellectual property that they want to charge people for, which, again, as you said, is all well and good, there’s a different set of questions, right. So, let’s talk about a show that streamed. This is a great example. The archivist in you, the librarian in you says what should be possible is that the library buys that show. It then owns it the way that a library owns a copy of Shakespeare’s completed works or a library owns the bestselling novel, it just came out, you know, by Miranda July and then can lend it to people, right? Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And what I’m hearing from you is that the entities are like, no, we’re not going to sell you our show for you to just have archived and lend to people we want to control if anyone sees. We want complete control of that model, we’re not going to abide basically. Brewster Kahle: You got it. That’s exactly what’s going on now. So libraries are not allowed from the big publishers. The small publishers are still, you know, in there trying to be, you know, publishers that we love. But the big corporate monopoly companies are basically making it so that libraries cannot own a digital e-book. So when you borrow an e-book from your local library, you think you are. It’s actually going and just being redirected into the publisher’s databases and they are surveilling everything about it and they’re changing and deleting those books at will. And so this is a future that is absolutely dystopian and counter to what it is we should be able to do now. We just want these people to sell. And it’s not it’s not happening. Chris Hayes: Right. You’re not saying give it to us. You’re saying we want to buy these things from you the way that a library buys things and then make it available. Brewster Kahle: Absolutely. And what libraries do is they often not just buy the blockbusters, but they buy the local content from the local authors and all of that’s being shut down and shuttled into these very few platforms And with the surveillance thing, it’s, you know, there’s a long history of libraries getting surveilled and then their patrons getting rounded up and bad things happening to them based on the books they’ve read. This isn’t good. So the libraries have always been a bastion of privacy. It’s part of our ethics. And so how do we go and move into this digital world in such a way we have many winners? So we have many authors, many publishers, many bookstores, many libraries and everyone a reader. That’s the world that we can live in. But it’s not the thing that we’re seeing happen at the tops of these mega corporations. Chris Hayes: That, I think, brings us to some of the legal issues the Internet Archive is facing. And maybe I’ll bring in Kyle Courtney here, who I know is also sort of read in on this. So a bunch of publishers have sued the Internet Archive. And Kyle, what is the lawsuit about? What are they contending? Kyle Courtney: So ultimately, I think the lawsuit is about to prevent libraries from being able to loan in the digital space now and in the future. Right. So if we imagine that loaning has always happened at the circulation desk. When it moves into digital space, this is what Brewster was referring to, they say, no, we haven’t sold you anything. We’re going to force you into renting your collections with these terms that basically eviscerate the library mission. So the case is about a methodology of lending called controlled digital lending, which I co-wrote in a paper in 2018. And it’s been endorsed by national library organizations, regional library consortia, specific library systems, individual librarians, legal experts. Ultimately, though, it comes down to this. We are being told, libraries, the royal, we are being told we’re not capable of entering the digital space with our same mission that we had. Now, of course, the library mission relies on the ability to acquire creative works, which, by the way, serves the economic purpose of copyright, right? We buy the stuff, right. This is not free. We’re spending money, millions and millions of dollars, and then distribute those works to the public, right. I always think this is a constitutional narrative, right. We’re promoting the progress of science and the useful arts by distributing those materials to this. And so that I think that the library loaning programs are part of this copyright cycle. Now, this method called controlled digital lending, which, again, digitally replicates what happens at the circulation desk, is more efficient. It’s less ableist. It’s good for folks that are remote, that can’t get to the library, senior citizens, et cetera, especially during our pandemic closures. But it’s through the lens of something called fair use, which is a copyright exception. And I’m sure that your show has heard about fair use before. I’m sure you have heard about fair use before. But this is basically saying, hey, copyright doesn’t mean total control of the copyrighted work. It does not. It is some control, certainly, but there are generous exceptions granted to users, to patrons, to libraries to be able to circulate those materials in service of that promoting progress of science and the useful arts. And again, I want to be very clear, libraries and their systems represent the commitment to both the economic and access parts of the copyright cycle. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: All right. So just tell me how does digital lending work under the scheme that you would like it to work? And what don’t they like about? Like, I still am having a hard time with this. What do you want to do and what do they not want you to do? Kyle Courtney: Yeah. So, imagine this. So, libraries spent millions and millions of dollars of collections that are in print, that are on our shelves, right. We have those books. We have paid for them. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: We control them. Chris Hayes: You own them. Kyle Courtney: We own them. We should be able to lend them without permission. Chris Hayes: Right. The publisher that you don’t have to check with the publisher. Kyle Courtney: Right, we do not. You can lend a book, yes, a thousand times and you never pay the rights holder again, right. You’re lending that book and you’re making sure it stays. You know, you bind the glue on the board. You know, you make sure that book lasts. That’s the way public libraries especially get a return on investment in their communities. And they’re holding on to those books. Many of those books never made the jump to digital, right. Maybe they’re not popular. Maybe they didn’t do well. But they were important for preservation and access purposes. So the controlled digital lending methodology says, okay, we take that book we bought and we digitize it and then we hide it away so it cannot be loaned. It’s not on the shelf. It’s not in a room, and we hide it away. Then we use that surrogate digital version to loan to one person at a time, just like we do at the SERC (ph) desk, except it’s digital. And then that person reads it, keeps it for two weeks, three hours, whatever the loaning period is, and then it automatically returns back to the library. Chris Hayes: So you’ve just created a digital version, a digital token of the physical book. But you’ve been the one that digitized it. Kyle Courtney: Yes. And more importantly, when the person’s reading it and looking at it, they can’t download it. They can’t copy it. They can access it. It prevents them from spreading Chris Hayes: It’s protected. Kyle Courtney: It’s protected. Using the same software that the publishers use for their e-books. I want to be very clear. Brewster has this system tight and perfect. And that’s what they’re suing about. Chris Hayes: Okay, so Brewster, the Internet Archive uses this method. Brewster Kahle: Yeah, we own a lot of books. We’ve been digitizing these and making them available for ourselves. But also hundreds of other libraries have been doing this all since 2011. This is common library practice. And we even stay away from the most recent five years just to, you know, knock off the commercial angle of these Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: And then we weave them back into Wikipedia. We basically fulfill a couple million links in Wikipedia so you can click to open to write the right page. What’s interesting is people only look at these books usually for a couple of minutes. They’re checking a fact. It’s not beach reading. You just don’t do that. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: You know, it’s basically you’re using it like you’re standing in a library. Chris Hayes: And why are they suing on this? Kyle Courtney: Because they feel that the licensed e-books, again, the forced rentals they’ve put upon libraries, should be the only way that -- Chris Hayes: The only standard. Kyle Courtney: -- the only standard that a patron can access at work, right? Licensing culture is out of control. You use Hulu and Netflix as an example, right. We don’t own any of that, nor are we likely to. My fear is as a result of this case, libraries become the next Hulu or Netflix and that says, you know, last day to read this book, August 31st, because that’s what happens. These books expire and they leave our communities unless we pay more. Chris Hayes: So the standard that you’re using is the CDL standard, which is we digitize books. We have tight controls on them so we could lend them one at a time. They can exist in digital space such that they could be used to check a fact. They could add to our store of knowledge. We don’t like that protocol because we don’t control it. Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Chris Hayes: We want to control the digital versions of our intellectual properties -- Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- such that we kind of hold always a sort of veto that it can expire. Like, we’re licensing it, which means we could always take it back. Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Ultimately, you don’t own it. You are a custodian of it for the time being Kyle Courtney: You’re a renter. They’re the landlords and we’re the renters. Libraries are being turned into renters. Chris Hayes: Right. So that’s actually very useful. So the library model is an ownership model because you guys buy the books and you own your collections. That’s the asset you have. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: And that’s what you make public. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: And they want to convert it to a rental. Kyle Courtney: Absolutely, because I understand why they would want us not to loan a book a thousand times and only pay once. They want us to get a thousand licenses, which is a revenue capital stream that looks much better to them than the -- Chris Hayes: Oh, so they want to charge you for each rental? Kyle Courtney: Oh, God, yes. There’s checkouts, price checkouts, there’s 26 checkouts and you have to buy the book again. There’s in a year or two years, these works expire. There’s many methods they use to prevent us from owning. Chris Hayes: Wait. I just want to make sure I understand this. You’re saying that’s the current market model for digital -- Kyle Courtney: Yes. Brewster Kahle: Yes. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- digital books from the large publishers. Brewster Kahle: Twenty six times and then it’s -- Kyle Courtney: Gone. Brewster Kahle: -- gone. It costs hundreds of dollars just to get those 26 potential lends. Chris Hayes: Okay, I know. Okay. I’m going to publish a book next year through a major publisher, Penguin Random House. And so walk me through. So I’m going to publish this book from Penguin Random House. Let’s say Kyle or Brewster or any librarian wants to get a digital version of that book to lend digitally from their library. How does that work? Kyle Courtney: So the publisher says, okay, here’s the terms by which this book is lent. Now, sometimes they say no libraries for the first two months. They’ve done that before. They embargo it, right? Or sometimes they say, okay, the average person gets it for $19.99, libraries path to pay $199 and they only get it, yeah -- Chris Hayes: Oh, $199 -- Kyle Courtney: Dollars. Yeah, Chris Hayes: But for multiple rentals, presumably. Kyle Courtney: No, not necessarily. Libraries pay five to ten times as much for access to e-books than the average consumer does off of a regular e-book site. Chris Hayes: Really? Kyle Courtney: Absolutely. And so we’re being punished for our mission, right. I call it a tax on libraries for being able to loan or provide access book. And Chris, this is what I’m talking about. The convenience of e-books comes at the expense of the library admission. And I don’t think that’s a tradeoff. But your book will be offered to libraries for under a twenty six check on model or under a multiple seat model or a pay for loan model. Or, you know, you can loan it as many times you can in a year, but then it goes away, it expires and disappears. So it depends on the publisher. It depends on the vendor, yeah. Chris Hayes: Okay, so this is clarifying. So the point is that there is a straightforward market logic here, I mean, someone once said to me, and it’s always stuck with me, that if libraries didn’t exist, there’s no way we could create them now. Kyle Courtney: I fully believe that. I think Brewster might too. I fully believe that. Chris Hayes: Hundred percent. Like, you couldn’t go to the publishers and all of them and say, hey, we’re going to create a non-profit, non-commercial, you know, in some cases subsidized or municipally-owned system that just gives away your product for free. Kyle Courtney: Now it’s not for free. I want to be very clear. Libraries pay through the nose, right. It’s not free. Chris Hayes: Yes. But to the consumers, yes, right. The point being that right now I can, from where I sit right now, right, I can walk to the library and borrow “Trust” by Hernan Diaz, or I can walk three blocks the other direction to my local bookstore and I can buy Hernan Diaz -- Kyle Courtney: Absolutely. Chris Hayes: Hernan Diaz’s “Trust.” And there’s not a ton of products about which that is true. Brewster Kahle: That is true. Chris Hayes: Right? If I want, like, you know, if I want, you know, a new basketball, you know, I’m going to buy a new basketball. There’s nowhere I could borrow a basketball. I mean, maybe I would go to the Y, but like the point is that, and I think the reason that you would say, I’m going to take your side of the argument here, is that like information is just different than other products because it has a social, civic, cultural role, right? Kyle Courtney: I’ll go one further. Libraries are supposed to be immune from market forces like that to provide information to their communities, right, so I agree. There is that marketization of this business model, but libraries are a special slice of the pie. And that’s what we’re trying to get done here. Brewster Kahle: And they’re widely supported. So, it’s about 20% of all trade publishing is the revenue comes from libraries -- Chris Hayes: Wow. Brewster Kahle: -- and what libraries are getting is less and less and less for that. So for instance, uh, the “Diary of Anne Frank” costs $27 per student for a 12-month subscription. Chris Hayes: Wait, that’s not public domain? Brewster Kahle: No. Kyle Courtney: It should be. Chris Hayes: Oh, right. Because the copyright keeps getting extended. Right, right, right. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Or you take Mary Grove College, a college that was focused on social justice and they announced their closure and they had this unbelievably great library. They donated it to the Internet Archive and we digitized 70,000 books, but now these publishers demanded that we take 14,000 of those social justice books, most of them are decades old, off the library shelves so no one can really effectively have access to these. And this is not Chris’s newest book. This is the long tail of books. Libraries support a broad range of authors and what we’re being told is you can only have bestsellers and you can’t even have them. You can just have to make it so that your patrons can go and give over their private information to us, the publisher. Chris Hayes: Just to be clear to loop back around because I think it’s important when I was using the thought experiment in my book. I mean, it’s not a thought experiment. It’s going to come out next year and hopefully you guys can go get it at your local library, I would hope. That that isn’t what’s at issue in the suit because that’s not the CDL stuff. The stuff that’s like the new to the market e-books is already being operated under these licenses that you’re talking about. The thing they’re suing about are the digitized books. Brewster Kahle: Well, we would want to go and buy one copy, just one -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- copy so that it could be put into Wikipedia so people could fact check out of your book and be able to refer to it. Not going through these checkout systems that often cost several dollars per ding -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- to go and even go into a fact check on. That’s what we’d like to be able to do. Penguin Random House has repeatedly refused to sell e-books. This could all be solved by they’re just selling e-books. Chris Hayes: They don’t sell them. They license them. Kyle Courtney: Right. Brewster Kahle: They license them in these draconian terms. But so we end up buying hard cover books that we digitize and then we make one copy available. But through this lawsuit, 500,000 books have now disappeared off of the digital bookshelves. This is a devastating blow for people that would never have bought these books. And the substitute of these books and also like page numbers, if you had a page number reference, I have never seen any book with a page number that you could refer to. So citations fail. We have the equivalent of what we were trying to fix in the web, a fix in the physical book world. And they’re basically saying, nope, that people cannot have access, digital access to the published works of a book form. Chris Hayes: So Kyle, the publisher’s lawsuit was successful at the district court level, right? Kyle Courtney: So the district court found it not to be a fair use. Brewster Kahle: So we lost. Chris Hayes: Well, meaning it was -- Kyle Courtney: Define success. I mean, it’s on appeal right now, right? Chris Hayes: Well, it was successful for the plaintiffs. I mean, the plaintiffs won. Kyle Courtney: I agree. So they wanted the lower court -- Chris Hayes: I’m not saying if they should have, it’s not a normative question. It’s a descriptive question about reality. Kyle Courtney: Sorry. I get very careful with my answers. Chris Hayes: The publishing, they sued. They said that the method you’re using was not fair use. They sued and they were found to be -- Brewster Kahle: Infringement. Chris Hayes: -- it was copyright infringement. And now that’s on appeal, right? Brewster Kahle: Yes. Kyle Courtney: So on Friday, the 28th of June is the oral argument. All the briefs have been filed with the second circuit. And this appeal is focusing on a few things, right? That through the control digital lending process, there are legally and economically significant aspects of physical lending that we want the court to review through the lens of fair use. You know, that it continues to preserve the power of print, right? A library has significant legal usage rights and great fiscal value in its collections and public library systems have spent millions of dollars in building these collections. And so the appeal is about a proper reading of the fair use analysis to control digital lending, but it’s also to reverse something that was stunningly disruptive, I think could be if it continues, which is anyone that has a donate now button or, you know, donate books or donate things, if you’re a nonprofit website, suddenly that’s a commercial action, according to the district court, that may weigh -- Chris Hayes: Oh, wow. Kyle Courtney: -- against your fair use and that cannot stand either. Chris Hayes: Oh, that’s interesting because fair use, right? Because part of fair use right is that we’re not trying to monetize this thing. It’s in the public domain. And so one of the findings of the district court level is that a donate now button is essentially commercial activity that it might vitiate your claim for fair use. Kyle Courtney: Yeah, which is just absolutely wrong on every level. I mean, it ignores -- Chris Hayes: Yeah, it seems wrong. Kyle Courtney: -- the major precedent in the second circuit. And so we’re hoping that second circuit court of appeals will hear that as well. Chris Hayes: Are there broader implications just for like the knowledge universe that we’re entering into? Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: Yes. So obviously, so I’m also a fan of open access and the knowledge economy is very important. I think certainly because we’re talking about control digital lending, you know, the books that we have on our shelves, for 20th century works that are in libraries, especially, you know, we refer to this as a 20th century black hole, right? They’re not available for purchase. No new copies are made. They’re unlikely to make the jump to digital, but they’re important works that need to be read, accessed and utilized by our modern patron. And by the way, our modern patron is younger and younger. And if something’s not digital, it’s as if it does not exist. So I would hate to see the generations be unable to access all of these works that we have preserved. And then the future for them is also bleak because it’s all licensing, whether it’s iTunes or Amazon or Netflix. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So one of the great ironies here, right, to go back to where this conversation started, Brewster, with the notion of the Library of Alexandria, a single repository for all human knowledge and cultural production and, you know, all captured in one place, archived, stored, made accessible. At one level, right, I have more access. I mean, it’s a crazy thing that at any moment I have access to anything and I think about this all the time. You know, when you sit down, I have a long riff on this in my forthcoming book about, you know, the attention forcing mechanism of the video store, which is that you had to go to the video store and you had to figure out what you’re going to watch that night. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And then you were making a committed decision that you come back, you explain to everyone at the house what you’ve gotten. Maybe they like it, maybe they don’t. But that’s what you’re going to watch, right. And at any given moment now, so at one level, we have this sort of overwhelming choice of I have access to so much of the world’s knowledge. I can watch anything at any time. But then there are these black holes emerging, huge swaths of things that are winking out of existence. And I remember, you know, there are movies that you can no longer get. There are, you know, a variety of places have taken shows off their service. And I know showrunners and actors who were on a show that’s now it just doesn’t exist anymore or anywhere. When Turner Classic Movies, there was some discussion in the corporate reordering that that might be taken off. And there was this like rebellion of folks, including, I think, like Martin Scorsese and everyone, because it’s like, this is the only way we can see these films. So there’s a weird paradox, Brewster, here, which is that we have access to more than anything ever before. Brewster Kahle: Yes. Chris Hayes: But the possibility of total death, of black hole, of things winking out of existence is also as present as it’s ever been. Brewster Kahle: Absolutely. It is so easy to get something on everything. And thank God for Wikipedia, another pillar of the open world. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: I love the line from the headline, Current Affairs, said the truth is paywall, but the lies are free. That we basically have this world that we’re coming to, where things are more and more promoted. And if we’re going to have people be educated, be ready for elections, we need to be able to think critically. We need to be able to quote what people have said. We need to be able to compare and contrast it. We need to be able to say whether historical events actually happen. This requires getting access. It’s the wonder of the Internet. It’s so freaking easy. I mean, all of the words in the Library of Congress would fit in two hard drives that cost less than a month’s rent. Our opportunity for educating people on a global scale is with us. And we have money. There’s a support for all this on libraries and things. It’s not going away. But we also have this sort of, oh, my God, I can control and clamp down and sell less for more is an ethos that we’re seeing. The St. Charles City County Library in Missouri is probably going to close this summer because of the e-book budget problem. So we’re having libraries hit with bannings and the like. We’re having them hit by budget shortages. We’re hitting them with license problems that we’ve covered for the last half an hour here extensively. But we’re now having also the judiciary starting to judge against libraries in ways that we haven’t seen in 100 years. I mean, the Carnegie Libraries exist because we have legislature and judicial support for educating a broad swath of people. And I don’t know, the United States that I grew up in is such a steeped in that tradition of the Carnegie thing. It’s really hard for people to fathom that all of these forces, political, judicial, legislative, funding are all going against a tradition that built America out of a set of immigrants and brought us together to be able to know how to work as a populace. And all of that is in, well, some of it is going to be judged again by an appellate group in lower Manhattan, and we’ll see what it is they decide towards the fate of libraries as we know them. Chris Hayes: So that’s a stark way to talk about it. I mean, is that is that how you see this case, Kyle, that like this case will determine the fate of libraries as we know them? Kyle Courtney: I mean, it’s a slippery slope into a licensed-only culture in which libraries cannot exist and missionless challenge. I do agree that a lot of people say, oh, this is just about the Internet Archives Open Libraries program. It’s a narrow focus. I don’t think that’s true. It’s about libraries entering and being supported in the digital space and through the use of either licensing or litigation. That’s a one-two punch, really will threaten the library mission now and in the future. That’s why, you know, I have been fully supporting the Internet Archive in this mission this entire time, because they represent a library that’s doing cutting edge, access oriented programming that was woefully needed. Chris Hayes: Do you think Brewster and I’ll go to you first and Kyle that I wonder also how much the kind of intellectual culture around this has changed? I mean, obviously, there are pecuniary motives for the big publishers, whatever. And that that is what it is. They have the incentives they have, and those are what they are. But it’s interesting to me this model of licensing, it’s amazing how much it’s crept up, like people’s printers, the software that, you know, now you don’t actually store your own information anymore. Like it used to be the case that I would and I do this now still because I kind of reject the, you know, all the cloud stuff, which I use for backup. But I am old fashioned. It’s like I want my files that I own on my physical hard drive, which is right here in my house that I control. And now everything is a license, you know, the software, you don’t buy anymore. Software-as-a-Service. Your hard drive space is essentially licensed. You sign a license and now it says, oh, you want to save this to Microsoft OneDrive? It’s like, wait, what? What are we doing here? What can I save it to my hard drive? I know where my hard drive is. I control my hard drive. Well, no, why don’t you just save it to OneDrive? It’s like, okay, here’s the end user license agreement. Okay, scroll through 5,000 words, click, okay. What did I just sign? I don’t know. Did you just say did I just click yes, that you can take anything in there and sell it or publish it? I have no idea. I just signed some license agreement for you to store my data. And this model is so ubiquitous, just even in like consumer life, Brewster. It increasingly is the life, it is the model for interaction with anything digital. Brewster Kahle: Well, we have things that we can do. The technologists are working on decentralized web technology, which is encouraging and please cover it. You as an author, Chris, can go to your publisher next year and say, I want my books to be sold, really honest to God’s sold in the same sense that my hard copies are sold to a library, I want an e-book sold so that they don’t get a license. They get a receipt, you know, after they pay money for it and just charge the same amount as an e-book is a book. There was this sort of like, oh, everything’s new again. We can repaint all of the rules. The powerful can become even more powerful because of this new technology. And they’re taking advantage of that. But we can also make it so that it’s a much more of a people’s thing where there’s broad support for authors. There’s broad support for publishers. We can have no centralized points of control. That was the dream of the Internet that I signed on to. It is possible. Wikipedia, Internet Archive, there are lots of nonprofits that are doing some of this. It’s a choice. We even have news organizations that are going open access and they’re making it work. The Internet Archive had 150,000 people click donate to the Internet Archive last year. That’s kind of awesome. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: You know, because we’re kind of a back end thing. People know they’re on Wikipedia. They often don’t know they’re on the Internet Archive. But 150,000 said this is important to keep alive. And maybe it’s because they were Grateful Deadheads or they like their flash or their old time radio or their whatever it is that they like. But they know that they have to support the things that they love, that there are mechanisms to make an economy work where there are lots of winners, the people get what they want, but it doesn’t play into one corporate control panel. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: So, of course, I agree with what Brewster said. Chris, I think you have a natural inclination for being maybe a collection development librarian or archivist because you’re like, I want my stuff right here and physically access it. And I talk with a lot of folks across the United States and libraries that are out there. The questions that are coming from patrons and folks that are aware of this case in general and stuff are interesting. But the answer from the publishers and rights holders is always more licensing. That’s the answer to everything, right? No fair use, get a license. No text data mining, get a license. No AI training, get a license. Everything is licensing. And this answer of licensing threatens the purpose, values and missions of all libraries. It undermines the ability of the public, right, the taxpayers to access the materials that are purchased with their money, right, for use in public libraries and state institutions. And further, I think it’s short sighted is what you’re saying, right? You’re like, how come I can’t get this stuff anymore? How can we have access to stuff? We have a 20th century black hole. We have swaths of information that just will never be released again unless you pay a license. So it’s not in the best interest of library patrons, the public at large. But that kind of knowledge economy that you’re discussing, that we need to be able to provide these materials to everyone. Chris Hayes: You know, it’s funny, too, as you talk about the licensing, I mean, on the flip side, on the other side of this question about fair use is AI, right, where now you’ve got this like insane situation where everyone put everything on the Internet for public use. And then a bunch of companies sent their large language learning models and fed it all that stuff, not for the purpose that the Internet Archive exists, which is to make it publicly accessible, but to train large learning models to, you know, talk like people in a chatbot, basically, or do whatever they do. And then monetize it, you know. So, I realize that the publishers are the are the quote, unquote “bad guys” in this lawsuit from your perspective, but they’re now suing. Now, there’s going to be a bunch of lawsuits on the other side. Kyle Courtney: Yes. Chris Hayes: Right? On exactly this, in which you’re already seeing publishers and I think a whole bunch of, you know, entities that publish or produce or own the intellectual property on content, suing the AI people to say you can’t just take this stuff to make your models and be okay with it. Brewster Kahle: Yeah. I would suggest what we need is a rule of law, not rule of contract. Chris Hayes: Yes. Right. Brewster Kahle: What happens when you have a rule of contract is you have very big people just bludgeoning it out with lawyers. Chris Hayes: Right. Yes. Brewster Kahle: And nobody that has lots of lawyers are going to be at that table. So we’ll end up with a deal between these publishers and, you know -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Right. Brewster Kahle: -- the big AI companies. But the idea I’d love to see, we have a new tool in town. It’s kind of cool. Let’s go and use it for some big, hard problems like health care or climate inventions. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: Or there are things that we could go as libraries. It could be the research libraries day. The research libraries have been basically holding on to these materials. Why would you read agricultural records of Argentina from the 1930s? We happen to have them. No human is going to do that, but machines do. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: And unless these lawsuits make it so that it’s taken out of the possibility of the public sphere -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- and only lands with the very wealthy. And people usually don’t think that next step through. The United States the last time that AI came around, it was Google. They basically hoovered up other people’s websites and made a search engine out of it. And they were allowed by law in the United States to do that. Chris Hayes: And it was important they did because if they weren’t, then we wouldn’t have the Internet. Kyle Courtney: Absolutely. Brewster Kahle: Absolutely. The dotcom boom happened in the United States because of law and -- Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: -- judiciary allowing that to happen Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: It did not happen in Europe or Japan. You notice there’s no search engine in Europe. There’s no search engine in Japan. It’s not because they’re stupid. It’s because their laws sided with the publishers. And if we go and do that in this AI round and I’m not, you know, just trying to shill -- Chris Hayes: That’s Internet. Brewster Kahle: -- for the big guys, I want the little guys. I want every library to go and take their collections or take the ornithology information from Cornell and around all of the ornithologists and start training models. If we make that illegal based on this, we will lose out on a major opportunity in the United States. And I’ll tell you, Europe has seen around this corner and they’ve already made regulations allowing cultural heritage institutions and research organizations, nonprofits to train AIs. Japan went further and said, we’re not going to step out of this next level of innovation. We’re going to allow it. Let robots read. In the United States. It’s just a free for all. We don’t have a legislature that’s really guiding things very well. And we’ll see what happens in the judiciary. So it’s a new game. And innovation, is it going to be grassroots or is it only going to be a few gigantic players that have enough lawyers to sue themselves into a deal with these gigantic publishers? Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: That’s where I see this is going. And I’m a big fan of a game with many winners. I want to see libraries and archives be able to bring their materials to bear under the right circumstances. Maybe it’s nonprofit works. Maybe it’s these, you know, nonprofit models to be able to do great things with these tools to help solve some of the big problems we’ve got. Chris Hayes: That’s interesting. It is very interesting. You know, all my feelings about AI are sort of, I would say, instinctual, impulsive, visceral and not -- Brewster Kahle: Careful. Chris Hayes: Yeah, I mean, they are. I mean, I’m thinking about it a lot, but I don’t feel like I have a fixed view on things. I’m sort of open to persuasion on a bunch of things. There’s a bunch of it that I find like weird and crass and like I’m being -- Brewster Kahle: It’s early days. They’re weird. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And there’s a lot of like shoving a solution to me without a problem. Kyle Courtney: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Like you need to buy this solution. It’s like, what is this solving for? It’s like, well, okay. Well, I don’t know if I need it. Brewster Kahle: Oh, you’re talking to archivists. So you remember the dotcom boom? Do you remember when you got warm cookies and milk delivered to your door? It’s just our dog food shipped through the mail. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: It was just -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Brewster Kahle: There was this weird, wonderful things that came about. Most of it made no sense. Chris Hayes: Right. Brewster Kahle: But it was kind of cool. And people believed and they put their dreams into this new technology. And right now, people are putting their dreams and their fears into this AI thing. Let’s shape it to be something that serves us. Let’s go and actually have some rules and guardrails on it by legislatures, not just -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Brewster Kahle: -- corporate rule. Chris Hayes: Yes. That line rule of law, not rule of contract, is a really important one, because you’re right. That’s so much the way this all gets settled in the U.S. is large litigation between powerful entities fighting each other and working out some settlement between tem as opposed to -- Brewster Kahle: Right. The people are not at that table. Chris Hayes: Yeah, we are a culture. Brewster Kahle: They are on there. Chris Hayes: We’re a culture that litigates rather than regulates. Generally, that’s how things work here. Kyle Courtney: Oh, well, that’s why there’s over 30 lawsuits currently in the courts about -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kyle Courtney: --  and by the way, it’s mostly books. Now there’s some music on there, too. You know, just last week, the major music labels sued some AI startup music companies. Chris Hayes: Yeah Kyle Courtney: But again, the answer, I just want to say, it’s the same answer we’re seeing in the CDL case to bring this together for a moment. The answer is licensing, right? So I’ve been in many AI discussions room where they’re like, you want to use our stuff, you want to train, get a license, get permission. That’s the only way to do it. And thankfully, the rule of law is not that, right? We have text and data mining. We have Google Books. We have Google Images. We have all these things where you can copy the entire thing, the whole thing, use it for something new and different and allow that technology to exist. So I think we have our answers through the rule of law already. But all these cases, all this litigation is going to slow down the entry for nonprofit, right -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kyle Courtney: -- research based. And, you know, Brewster and I are waving our arms saying we’re not mega companies We’re not for profit things. We’re researchers that want to do text and data mining. We’re high school students that want to experiment with AI. All of these things should be able to be done in the nonprofit educational standpoint, where libraries have been planting their flag for forever. Chris Hayes: Brewster Kahle is a digital librarian at the Internet Archive. He’s perhaps best known for the Wayback Machine. Kyle Courtney is a lawyer, librarian, director of copyright and information policy for Harvard Library, co-founder of Library Futures, which aims to empower the digital future of America’s libraries. That was a totally fascinating conversation about something I knew literally nothing about. It was one of my favorite kinds of conversations. Kyle Courtney: Oh, my pleasure. Brewster Kahle: Thank you very much, Chris. Chris Hayes: Once again, my great thanks to Brewster Kahle and Kyle Courtney. No decision has been made in this appeal yet. A decision may come this fall.

Unpacking WTH Project 2025 is with Thomas Zimmer: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 11:33 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/unpacking-wth-project-2025-thomas-zimmer-podcast-transcript-rcna160927,"Project 2025, also known as the Presidential Transition Project, is a collection of policy proposals from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The group’s 920-page “Mandate for Leadership” is an extremely granular playbook that includes sweeping policy changes aimed at reshaping and dismantling American government. It’s pretty alarming. With so much at stake, we thought it would be good to do a deep dive into what the document contains and what it could portend for a possible Trump second term. Thomas Zimmer is a historian at Georgetown University. He’s studied and written about Project 2025 extensively, including for his Democracy Americana newsletter on Substack. Zimmerman is also the host of the “Is This Democracy?” podcast. He joins WITHpod to discuss what Project 2025 proponents aim to accomplish, how the plans within the mandate reflect broader American right ideology and more. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Thomas Zimmer: Project 2025 is their declaration of war on this idea of America. That’s what this is. And so in many ways, this is on the ballot in November. Those are the stakes. And I think this is really, you know, in a fundamental way in November, it’s going to be a referendum on whether or not we want to continue down this path towards multiracial pluralistic egalitarianism or not. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Well, as we’ve been saying throughout this campaign year, covering campaigns are always a little bit speculative in this sense. We don’t know the future. And when someone’s elected to be president, you don’t know ultimately what they’re going to do because that lies out in the future. And you can make pretty good educated guesses, but sometimes there’s surprises. I don’t think people that had closely studied LBJ in the, you know, ‘50s and early ‘60s would necessarily have thought this will be the person that pushes through the most landmark civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, but that’s what happened. There were reasons to think that FDR, who at one point ran on austerity and balanced budgets, would sign the new deal. So there are surprises for sure. But as I keep saying, in this context, we have a unique situation where for the first time since the late 19th century, we have two men squaring off who both have records because they’ve both been presidents. And then there’s an additional way in which we have a pretty clear sense of what the future will hold in a Donald Trump presidency. And that is this extremely granular roadmap that has been put together by a bunch of sorts of right-wing activists and think tank folks and ex-government employees that’s called the Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project Mandate for Leadership. And you’ve probably heard about it as Project 2025. Now, interestingly enough, I saw some polling today that suggested only about one in four voters have heard of Project 2025. But it’s a pretty remarkable document because basically the kind of leading lights of the MAGA movement and American Republican conservatism writ large came together to basically say, you know, agency by agency in the federal government, these will be our objectives. This is how we intend to govern. This is what we plan to do with the executive power vested in us should we win the presidency. And it’s really clear and I think really alarming. There’s been a fair amount of coverage of it. “The New York Times” has been running a series about it. A lot of outlets have talked about it. We’ve talked about it on the show. But today it’s not quite a “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes” because we’re not comparing the records here. But it’s in line with that theme because I thought it’d take some time with someone that has spent a lot of time reading and thinking about Project 2025 to talk about what is in there, what does it portend for a possible Trump second term? And a great person to do that with is Thomas Zimmer, who’s a historian at Georgetown University. He writes about and studies the sort of anti-democratic tendencies in the American right since the 1930s. He has a Substack that’s called “Democracy Americana.” And on that Substack he has been writing about Project 2025 extensively. He’s read it and been writing about what it is and what it means and sort of putting it in a broader context of these anti-democratic tendencies, which I think are reflected in Project 2025. So, Thomas Zimmer, welcome to the program. Thomas Zimmer: Thank you so much for having me. Chris Hayes: First of all, just tell me how you got interested in Project 2025, like your entrance point into it. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah, I think I started hearing about it when it was launched about two years ago and then they published this, you know, this 920-page report which outlines their policy agenda. That is what you have been referencing, is what they call it mandate for leadership. That was actually published about a year ago. And at first, you know, it seemed like maybe that’s just, you know, whatever. They have some plans. They’re making plans. Who cares? There was some reporting about it, right, and I felt like maybe I should take a look at it, right, and get some sense of what it was. But I didn’t think it was going to be that important. But then when I started reading, I felt like, wait, they’re outlining their vision for America and how they want to impose it on the country in really the clearest way possible. And this is something that if you want people to know what the American right is all about and what they want to do to the country, this is the best way to clarify that for people. It’s not me telling them. It’s actually me telling people, look, it’s out there. Read it. Right? So I started digging into it. And I think I mean, just to be clear, this policy report is only one part of Project 2025. It goes even well beyond that. This is a massive planning operation. It’s also a massive hat hunting operation. They’re looking for personnel, thousands of people to staff the government. That’s all part of Project 2025. And the deeper you look at, the deeper you dig, the more I became convinced that this really is such a great insight into where the American right is today and really what they want to do to the country. Chris Hayes: So here’s my understanding of the problem that Project 2025 seeks to solve. And I think it’s similar in some ways to 1980, what we call the Reagan revolution. There are some echoes here, although I think this is much more sort of forthrightly anti-democratic and authoritarian than the Reagan revolution. But the basic sense is the structure of the federal government, particularly the federal agencies, are in some ways bound to a vision of governance that is antithetical to right-wing objectives because of the permanent civil service, because of the institutional cultures. This is something that Reagan thought as well, that they’re kind of the enemy. They are, in Trump’s words, the deep state, which is what he talks about a lot, right, in terms of the CIA and FBI. But more broadly, this idea that there’s a sort of set of institutions that are hostile to the most extremist imperatives of MAGA right-wing governance. And so you have to have a plan, both in terms of policy objectives, personnel and internal mechanics, to basically remake these places totally, to transform them ruthlessly. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: So as to turn them, the way that a virus turns a cell into a factory for producing more virus, that basically you need to take these organs, you need to take these cells that are the federal government agencies and turn them into actively places that will reproduce this kind of right-wing governance. Because if you don’t do that, then you’ll fail to achieve your objectives and that’s the general sense about much of the Trump agenda in the first term. Is that your understanding of it? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah, it’s really crucial to sort of understand the diagnosis from which all of this starts. They are convinced. They, meaning the people behind Project 2025. But this goes beyond just those people. The entire American right is very clear about the fact that they see the first Trump presidency as a failure, right? They are extremely disappointed with the first Trump presidency. And they’re extremely clear about the fact that when they first rose to power in 2017, Trump world had no concrete plans. They had no personnel to implement whatever plans they might come up with and just very little understanding of the vast and powerful machine that is the American government. They were not ready. And really, no one understands this more clearly than the right themselves. And they are determined to just not let that happen again and eliminate all of the hurdles that slowed them down or sabotaged them as they see it in Trump’s first presidency. And that is precisely those two levels, which is, one, we need plans. We need to know what we want to do. And two, we need the right kinds of people in place to actually implement those plans and not be, again, sabotaged like the first time around when they were running up against what they see, like a bunch of quote, unquote “woke bureaucrats” who would just, you know, sabotage everything they wanted to do. That is that is the whole plan. And that’s also why when you read about Project 2025 in mainstream coverage, you hear a lot about, oh, they want to dismantle government. And I think that’s really not what this is about. This is about sort of an authoritarian takeover of government. Yes, they want to dismantle certain parts of government, everything that can be used as a tool for like a more egalitarian, fairer society. That needs to go. But other parts of government, they want to mobilize and weaponize and not dismantle at all. They want to turn government into an instrument to impose their vision of society on the country. And I think that’s really something very different from dismantling the government. Chris Hayes: Yeah, that’s really well said and important. And there’s two things I think that are sort of important to note. One is, in some ways, the existence of the vast bureaucracy that is the federal government and the civil service and the Pentagon, for instance, like every administration comes in and is a little bowled over by this. I mean, it really is the case that the federal government is enormous, that it contains all sorts of organizations within it that have their own imperatives, that trying to get things done, even in the most benevolent sense, right, look, just trying to do good stuff. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: You can be really frustrating. I know people that worked in government and there’s a lot of people telling, you know, all the time. There’s a lot of lawyers saying you can’t do that. But at the same level, those are part of the checks, right, that like there’s a kind of, I would say, productive friction that is in some ways kind of the point between the restraining forces of the vast architecture and bureaucracy of the government -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and the imperatives of an administration. And that productive tension, which I think can be frustrating at a personal level to people, whatever your ideological inclination are, right, I know this for a fact. They view it as like a structural flaw they want to get rid of. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And they want to like truly reconceptualize the federal government from, and maybe this is a good place for us to start the Schedule F stuff, which is -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- a huge thing is that most of the people that work for the federal government are civil service employees, which means -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- they are not political appointees, which means you can’t come in day one and be like, you’re fired because we don’t like you, we want to bring in your own people. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And the reason for that is prior to the civil service reforms in the 19th century, the federal government looked a lot more like what a big urban machine, like the Chicago machine would look like. You get into power and then like you appoint all your partisan buddies to be postmasters. At the time, this was like, you know, these post office jobs is the big bank of jobs in the federal government. And then they kick favors upstairs and they go and do stuff for you. And it was basically like an enormous corrupt machine. Civil service reform was a way of doing away with that. It’s embodied in something called Schedule F, which is the -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- tell me a little bit about this structure, before we get to like the ideological -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- there’s a structural goal here, which is to remake the civil service and get rid of it as it’s currently constituted. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. So some people may remember this shortly before the 2020 election, Donald Trump signed an executive order, Schedule F, that’s what it was called, that was rescinded then by President Biden immediately upon taking office before it could really do any damage. But it was intended to fight the deep state and they are now Project 2025. And really, everyone on the right is determined to execute Schedule F as soon as they get another chance. It would convert tens of thousands of career civil service positions into political appointments. So, you know, there are about 4,000 or so political appointees across the American government. And every administration, when they come in, they look at all those political appointees and they usually, you know, they usually bring in about a thousand or so of their own people, you know, plus minus a little bit. But, you know, the vast majority of people who work in government are civil servants and they have job protections, right? And the Trump administration wants to come in and turn, again, tens of thousands of those career civil service positions into political appointments so that they can fire them. That’s the whole point, right? Because that would take away all the job protections that come with civil service because they don’t want any more independent experts and they don’t want competent bureaucrats. They want their own people. They want loyalists. They want ideological conformity because, again, that’s what they feel like sort of hampered them the first time around and they don’t want to let that happen again. Chris Hayes: I just want to, like, put a fine point on this -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- because this can all sound abstract. Like somewhere in the federal highway transportation bureaucracy, there are a bunch of civil engineers who have to evaluate, like, what the safe turning radius for a road is. Like if you’re doing a federal, you know, on a federal highway and on ramp or off ramp, they promulgate regulations. And there are people that are not ideologues or partisans. They’re civil engineers who evaluate this, right. And then there are people who manage those. Like, you don’t want that job, I think. You don’t want someone who’s got 20 years of experience doing that kicked out and replaced with someone who is like a right-wing vlogging influencer. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Because they’re going to be ideologically devoted to Donald Trump and they’ve been handpicked to put in to now run the bureau that’s going to figure out the turning radiuses. You want actual expertise there, but that’s kind of what’s on the table. I mean, I’m making up this specific example, but that sort of thing happens throughout the federal government in a million different ways. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. I mean, again, the whole point about these civil service protections is to say we need the federal government to be staffed with people who are not replaced every four years by whatever ideological criteria, but who are they are because of their expertise and because they can do the job that they are supposed to be doing. But this would change that. Now they’re saying, oh, we’re converting people in policy adjacent positions or policy advisory roles. But those terms are so vague that no one really knows what that means. And really, it would probably go down to even maybe like some administrative assistance somewhere in some agency because, you know, aren’t they also executing policy? So who knows, right? Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: Again, they’re explicitly talking about 50,000 people. All of this, of course, only makes sense if you have 50,000 of your own ideological loyalists that you can replace them with, because otherwise you’re just firing people and you have no one to come in. And that is why, again, part of all of this Project 2025 is also this really unprecedented headhunting operation where they are looking for, they’re vetting thousands and thousands of people, trying to find their type of ideologically pure right-wingers. Chris Hayes: Yeah, there’s this old saying in D.C. and I think it actually is a Reagan era that personnel is policy, right? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: That when you get people in and I’ve watched this in government up close, how true that can be. Maybe this is a good time to talk about, like, who’s doing this? Like, it’s not explicitly the Trump campaign, which they’ll tell you, although it’s a lot of people who are Trump aligned. And the idea is like this is a toolkit for whoever. This actually happened before the primary. So whoever was going to be the Republican president or nominee, it’s now Trump is the nominee. Who is actually doing this? Thomas Zimmer: Right. So we should probably say that planning operations are happening on several factions on the right are sort of coming up with their own plans right now. But what makes Project 2025 really stand out, even in this sort of universe of emerging right-wing planning, is that this is spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. And it stands out because it unites much of the conservative movement and the machine of think tanks and activists and lobbying groups behind this goal of installing a more effective, more ruthless right-wing regime as members of its advisory board. Project 2025 currently lists over 100 organizations and institutions. By the way, this is all online. If you just Google Project 2025, you’ll get right to it. You can click on it and then you can read this for yourself. If you look at the advisory board, it’s a who is who of right-wing actors, Alliance Defending Freedom, America First Legal Foundation, Center for Renewing America, Claremont Institute, Young America’s Foundation, Moms for Liberty. They’re all on there, right? And this is really why I believe this stands out. Again, it’s spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, which for decades has been the most influential, most really the power center of the conservative think tank world. They’re spearheading it, but they have managed to really unite much of the conservative machine behind this. And I think that’s what makes Project 2025 really so both interesting, but also threatening because this is what they what they have agreed to do. Chris Hayes: And Heritage is interesting, too, because it’s been around for decades. It’s always been at the center of conservative politics in Washington. It has taken a very MAGA-esque turn recently. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: Almost in its like tonal, all of its public communication and its president sound like Truth Social posts, like all caps -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- like truculent, trolling, aggressive, aggrieved, like it’s in that like Trumpian register, like everything they’re doing now. It used to be a little more like chin stroking -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- tonal, like we’re serious people -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and now it’s just like F.U. libs. Am I wrong about that or do you feel like that? Thomas Zimmer: Oh, no. No, absolutely. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: So, I mean, Heritage was established in 1973. And for the longest time, it’s associated itself with Reaganism and it was associated with Reaganism. But in recent years, they have gone in a decidedly more Trumpian direction. And Kevin Roberts, who took over as president of the Heritage Foundation at the end of 2021, he has been really key in this development. Roberts is not some moderate imposter who just pretends to be hardcore, you know, to blend in with the MAGA crowd. No, this guy comes from the religious right. He comes out of the world of reactionary Catholicism. He also, by the way, before he became the president of the Heritage Foundation, he also worked for a lobbying group in Texas that made the quote, unquote “moral case” for fossil fuels. So he’s like a hardcore culture warrior, but also fossil fuel industry, that type of thing. He holds a Ph.D. in history, you know, whatever that means. But this guy, again, he is in his own words, he has sort of defined the mission of the Heritage Foundation now as, quote, “institutionalizing Trumpism.” And they don’t mean this as sort of, you know, taming it. They mean it as making it more efficient, making it more effective. And he’s also been entirely clear about, you know, what his politics is. People may remember that in the summer of 2022, in the fall of 2022, the sort of neo-fascists in Italy came to power under Giorgia Meloni, and like Roberts was just ecstatic about that, right. Absolutely ecstatic. He was like, this is it. This is the model for American conservatives. And so, yeah, it’s very clear. These people are true believers. This is not some moderate Republican traditional conservatives. These people are all in. And Roberts is really, I think, indicative of how much the power centers of the right have radicalized towards Trump and Trumpism. Chris Hayes: So let’s stay on this personnel’s policy, because I think the civil service reforms that they envision are one of the biggest sorts of fulcrums here. Can you do that unilaterally? Like it’s just now clear to me that civil service, I think, is set by a set of statutory requirements passed through the years. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So can you unilaterally just be like we’re making 50,000 more political appointees or would that have to go through Congress? Thomas Zimmer: I mean, look, some of this is certainly legally questionable. And I’m certain that Schedule F, you know, if executed, would it would certainly be tested in court, especially now that the administration, the Biden administration, has just really, I think, has enacted a new rule that basically prohibits the kind of intervention that Schedule F envisions. This came down from the Office of Personnel Management basically saying, look, you can’t do this. So, if the Trump administration now wants to overrule that or change the rule, they would have to find a court that agrees with them. They would have to find a federal judge that says, yeah, that’s fine. Or they could ignore maybe the rule and just do Schedule F anyway. And then again, it would be tested in court. But I think, you know, here’s the thing. I think what we’ve learned over the past, if we didn’t know this already, what we’ve learned is that you can do a lot of things if you just ignore norms and precedents. A lot of this stuff doesn’t necessarily run-on law. It runs on norms. And if you are entirely willing to discard those and just do at the very least, you’ll get a lot of time to cause harm and damage. Chris Hayes: Before the courts catch up to you. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah, exactly right. And I think that is the problem here, right? You can say, oh, they can’t just do that. This strikes me as yeah, and maybe again, it will absolutely be tested. Chris Hayes: Well, the other lesson is that the law is whatever five right-wing justices say is. I mean -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- you know, you can make all sorts of preposterous claims and they might get a hearing. I mean, like the president is immune from, you know -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- sending SEAL Team six to assassinate political rivals. So, yeah, I mean, ultimately, this stuff will be sorted out by the courts and I think the courts did a decent job last time around of checking some of these imperatives and I think that’s not at all a foregone conclusion -- Thomas Zimmer: No. Chris Hayes: -- this time around. So my understanding is the parts I’ve read, it sort of breaks it up by agency -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- like different parts of the federal government, right. Thomas Zimmer: That’s right. Chris Hayes: So I think it’d be a little tedious to go through each one. So maybe just like what do you what do you see as the most important things for people to know about what’s being called for? We talked about this sort of structural change -- Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: -- to the way the very fabric of government personnel functions, like Trump toadies in positions way further down into the bureaucracy than were imaginable. I mean, you know, a 25x increase, right, in sort of political appointees or a 10x, I mean, depending on how it all shakes out. What do you see as the other top things to take away from this document? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. So, again, this is the part of Project 2025 that outlines a proper policy agenda. It’s like a 920-page report. It goes agency by agency, federal. Like you’ll find agencies in there that I believe few people have actually ever heard of, probably. And they go chapter by chapter. Again, I think it’s really important to understand, it operates on two level. On one level, this is a program to dismantle the state, right. And you see this, for instance, with Department of Education needs to go out. We don’t want it. They want to just completely abolish it, right? Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: That needs to go. Or for instance, when it comes to the EPA, any sort of climate change regulation, that all is out. It needs to go. We don’t want it. So that is sort of the dismantle part of this project. But then there is the weaponize and mobilize part. And that is sort of the idea to turn government into a tool that you can use for really only two purposes. One is to punish your enemies. And two is to impose this sort of vision of white Christian patriarchal order on American society. Now, you see this, for instance, in the Department of Health and Human Services, which is I mean, if you read it, it’s it has very little to do with public health at all. It’s entirely conceived as an instrument to impose a certain understanding of what, you know, a sort of heteronormative understanding of gender. There’s just man and woman, a heteronormative understanding of marriage, a sort of hardcore, pro-life, anti-abortion sort of approach. And that’s what the Department of Health and Human Services is for, right? It’s not about, oh, you know, public health in the broad sense. It’s about here’s what’s right. Here’s what they call it, the natural order. And here’s how we’re going to use this, you know, this machinery to impose that on society. So, for instance, the CDC, which on the one hand, they really hate because of COVID, right. So parts of the CDC, they want to dismantle and say never again can these bureaucrats, you know, tell us what to do in case of a pandemic. But then also they want to turn the CDC into sort of a sort of an all-knowing departmental institution where information about every single abortion in the entire country, including like the name of the people who are pregnant, the doctors, everyone who quote, unquote “helped” with the abortion, right. They explicitly say we’re going to use the CDC to do something against all this quote, unquote “abortion tourism” by, again, turning this into a repository for detailed information about every single abortion, entire country. And they want to force blue states to give that information to the CDC, which as of right now, California, for instance, doesn’t give that information to the extent it even has that information. It doesn’t give that information to the federal government. But they are saying we’re not going to accept that anymore. Every abortion in the country, we’re going to collect all this information at the CDC. And, you know, this is not a small government vision, right? That has nothing to do with small government or -- Chris Hayes: I got to say, that’s really -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- that’s deeply chilling, sense of saying. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, yes, absolutely. It absolutely is. But I mean, explicitly, again, that is in the chapter on the Department of Health and Human Service. And I think it captures that dichotomy, right? Parts of the CDC, dismantle. We don’t want it. But also, oh, nice, we can turn this into a tool for the kind of society we want to create here. Chris Hayes: So nationwide surveillance of pregnant people. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Chris Hayes: In states red or blue, states where it’s legal or not legal. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: So that we just know who’s getting abortions. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, they’re being sort of ominous or they’re not explicitly saying what they will then do with this information, right. But the entire chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services is all about basically banning abortion through the back door, even without national legislation, because that’s not what they’re talking about. And also, they know that that might not come. They might not be able to enact sort of a national abortion ban. But they’re very clearly saying that they want to outlaw mifepristone. They’re talking about outlawing, again, any sort of medication that is used for abortion. They’re talking about this vision of abortion surveillance. And again, they’re being very explicit about using the Department of Health and Human Services for this of hardcore pro-life. They’re basically saying explicitly the Department of Health and Human Services needs to be a pro-life tool. Chris Hayes: Right. That’s Health and Human Services as an example -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- and you have a background in actually writing about public health through your scholarship. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the Department of Justice, because -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- the place that all this stuff kind of gets the scariest to me and the place that I keep referring to the Department of Justice as sort of like the Chekhov’s gun of American liberal democracy — Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: -- which we’ve seen tested a few times and really was tested during Nixon, which is that the Department of Justice is in the executive. It is part of the Article 2 branch. It reports to the president. The president appoints various people. And at the same time, not really through statutory restriction -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- but through norms and promulgations within precedential findings by the department itself -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- there are all sorts of ways to regulate that power such that it isn’t just turned into a kind of authoritarian police force, right? Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: You signed a petition against my government. The FBI shows up at your door the next day to investigate you about X, Y, Z, right? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And this happens in authoritarian regimes all the time. Presidential dictatorships that are sort of like plausibly democracies, but aren’t really in action. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: This is a key way that those become corrupted. What do they say about all that stuff? Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. I mean, they’re being 100 percent clear. There’s not going to be a Department of Justice with any kind of autonomy from the White House. They’re being very explicit. Now, the Department of Justice has to do what the president tells us to do. And this is one of the biggest frustrations, not just of Trump himself, but also of these people that are behind Project 2025. They believe that in the first Trump presidency, they were hampered by these lawyers in and around the White House who had too many qualms about questions of legality and norm and precedent. And by the way, we’re already talking about even in the first Trump presidency, we’re talking about Federalist Society lawyers, right? Chris Hayes: Yes. These are all right-wingers. Jeff Sessions, and yes, yeah. Thomas Zimmer: Proper conservative/right-wing lawyers. But the people behind Project 2025 are convinced that, you know, they were putting too much of a brake on, for instance, they are convinced they should have invoked the Insurrection Act in the summer of 2020 to suppress the protests in the wake of the George Floyd murder. They are convinced that, you know, there should have been more investigations into Trump’s enemies and they feel like they’ve been, you know, they’ve been sabotaged by these lawyers. So this time around, I mean, there’s been basically a falling out between Trump world and even the Federalist Society. And they’re like, no, we’re not going to do this anymore. This whole idea of a sort of a semi-independent Department of Justice, that’s entirely out. And by the way, I can really recommend reading that chapter on the Department of Justice, because it’s really funny how they kind of try to justify this idea of making the Department of Justice into just a tool that does the president’s bidding. They basically say, oh, the people have lost the trust into the Department of Justice. And if this report is to believe that’s because the Department of Justice didn’t investigate Hunter Biden’s laptop enough and also because it was just not going hard enough after the, quote, “radical agents” of the left like Antifa. It reads like a sort of a hardcore culture war. It could be written by Marjorie Taylor Greene. But this is, again, an ostensibly a policy document in which they are outlining this is what we’re going to do to the Department of Justice. And they’re talking about Hunter Biden’s laptop, and that really gives you a sense of what sort of the spirit is behind these ideas. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And there’s a broader ideological vision here, which we should maybe take a step back to talk about, which is back during the Bush administration, one of the things they would talk about is this notion of a unitary executive -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- which is that the constitutional structure of the country has an Article 2 branch, which is the executive. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And all power flows from the president. And anything that sort of checks that is itself kind of constitutionally suspect. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: So when you have all these kinds of consultative boards, you know, all that are promulgated by statute, when you have administrative procedures, like there has been a hostility to that running through conservatism for a while. It’s also a hostility that is showing up before the Supreme Court and the federal society -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- towards the administrative state, which is basically we don’t like these bureaucrats, despite the fact that they have been given this authority via perfectly like, you know, past statutes signed by a president, right, through the constitutional order. They have been created and given this, you know, authority to decide these questions, right? We just don’t like them. And we’re sort of coming up with a reason why they’re unconstitutional. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And so this idea of basically making the president’s authority within the government itself kind of more dictatorial -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- is something that they kind of are all on the same page against on. We don’t want lawyers and bureaucrats saying, no, you can’t do that. We want the edict of the president to go. Thomas Zimmer: Well, as long as and if the president is a Republican, we should say -- Chris Hayes: Because it’s an important point, because if it’s the wrong president that we don’t want it. Thomas Zimmer: No -- Chris Hayes: Then the government no longer has the power to regulate carbon (ph). Thomas Zimmer: No. If it’s a Democratic president, then everything the president does is a sort of dictatorial overreach. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: But no, absolutely. I mean, again, at its core, Project 2025 envisions a vast expansion of presidential power and hovering sort of in the background of all of this, is this unitary executive theory, this of legal theory. It basically says there are zero limits of presidential power when it comes to the executive. Like the president has absolute king-like powers over the executive branch. And like you said, that’s been around for decades. It’s something that the conservative legal movement has been pushing for a long time. And it does have significant support, not only in the conservative legal movement. Certainly there are at least two, maybe more conservative justices on the Supreme Court who are certainly -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- let’s say, a unitary executive theory interested. And you see this throughout Project 2025, the vision of the president’s sort of basically unlimited control over the government is justified by this. But it’s also justified by something even more profound, by this idea that the president, at least this president, a right-wing president, embodies the true will of the people -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- and that nothing must impede the will of the quote, unquote “real America,” you know, the sort of -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- white patriarchal America, and certainly not some bureaucrats or lawyers or even the law itself. I also want to be clear, you know, they’re talking about this like the unitary executive theory, but it’s really not about a consistent legal theory with these people. Chris Hayes: Yes, it’s not very theoretically developed. Thomas Zimmer: No. Chris Hayes: Right, yes, that’s a good point. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, this is explicitly designed as a response to what they see, what they call the leftist woke threat. And they see what they do as justified because everything, no matter how radical, is justified in defense of, quote, unquote, “real America.” That is sort of the permission structure that governs conservative politics in these circles. And so, yeah, if they can latch onto unitary executive theory to make that sound more or less extreme or more, you know, more legitimate, they will do that. But, you know, they will also do whatever they want to do here, even without that theory. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: You know, one of the things that’s been a little lost to history is that Donald Trump wanted the Department of Justice to prosecute his political enemies and called for them to do so publicly via Twitter all the time. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And they largely didn’t. They had the John Durham sort of special prosecutor who kind of did that and then very embarrassingly failed to secure convictions on the two trials he brought. Both were acquittals, which is like essentially unheard of in federal prosecution. Like no one goes 0 for 2 anywhere in the federal government prosecution. But they used it more as a shield than a sword. And I think the place where the rubber really hits the road and the thing that really concerns me is using the Department of Justice as a as a weaponized tool. And they talk about this all the time because they’re doing this projection now with the cases brought against Donald Trump, that that’s what’s happening to him here and that turnabout will be fair play and that there will be special prosecutors and they’re going to just start prosecuting everyone in sight who stands against them. And I guess there’s no way you could answer this. But given the fact that you’ve embedded yourself in this world, how realistic eventuality do you see that if Trump is elected? Thomas Zimmer: Do you mean specifically the Department of Justice going after Trump’s enemies? Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: Oh, I mean, look, I would say generally they will not be able to implement all of these plans exactly as they have outlined them here. That’s just not how the world works, right? But if you combine the plans with this sort of personnel operation that they’re running, this hat hunting operation, and if you think about who the people are going to be that they will that they will be bringing in and there’s nothing going to stop them from bringing in those people. There’s nothing going to stop them from staffing the Department of Justice with people who are on board with this kind of vision. Chris Hayes: I mean, some are Senate confirmable positions, but they did a lot of messing around with vacancy appointments last time. Thomas Zimmer: Yes, exactly right. I mean, that’s a really important point. In some sense, we’ve already seen sort of a preview of -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: -- what we might be getting ins of the last year or so of Trump’s first term when he was starting to play around with this sort of stuff. Chris Hayes: They basically avoided confirmation battles altogether and everyone was sort of acting under the -- Thomas Zimmer: Acting something, yes. Chris Hayes: Yeah, right. Exactly. Thomas Zimmer: And by the way, all of those acting some things are now among the people who have contributed to Project 2025 -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- a lot of them have written those chapters on this department or that agency. So yeah, I mean, in that sense, it’s absolutely realistic. Again, all of this will be challenged. It will be challenged in court. There might be a public outcry against it. But the idea that we can all just dismiss this as just hot air. I don’t see how that is a realistic take on this, because again, this is not just Project 2025. This is a good example of how Trump himself and the Trump campaign and Project 2025, what they are envisioning, again, while those are two separate kind of planning operations and two separates, although not entirely separate, is a lot of overlap, personal overlap between those camps, but there are two separate camps. But you can see with this point specifically with what they want to do with the Department of Justice and how they want to bring in these lawyers who will just provide, you know, pseudo legal justification for whatever the Trump regime wants to do. I mean, this is entirely compatible what Trump wants to do and what Project 2025 is outlining here. There is no friction. There is no, you know, tension here. Oh, they’re entirely on the same page about this. Chris Hayes: Yeah. One of the big lessons of the period between the election and inauguration in 2020 and 2021 and the run up to January 6th and this aftermath is that ultimately what mattered was what the people with law degrees in positions of power were willing to accept or not. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And enough people in positions of power with law degrees, including the acting head of the Department of Justice, the acting AG, the chief counsel to the vice president of the United States, his chief of staff, all of these people were simply not willing to go along with a coup. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: There were people who were, but they were outnumbered. And if you rerun that experiment in which all the people not willing to go along are willing to go along and are willing to say, yeah, that’s fine. Let’s do this. Let’s send out this DOJ letter on DOJ letterhead saying the results are, you know, called into question and you should convene your state legislature. Like that was a place where this question of personnel is policy and actually more than personnel is policy. Personnel is law -- Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: -- really comes into focus. Thomas Zimmer: And you know what? It’s even worse than that. I think this is maybe to me the biggest mistake that people make that look at these planning operations and say, oh, you know, I’m not going to take this too seriously. We’ve had Trump in power before and we’re just looking at a rerun. It’s just going to be more of the same. But this time, not only are they going to have the plans and the personnel, which again, they did decidedly not have in 2017. They’re also going to be operating under circumstances that are decidedly more favorable to their overall project. They will be working with a supermajority on the Supreme Court, which again, they did not have in 2017. Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: They will be operating with a fully or almost fully Trumpified Republican Party. Like there’s like the Mitt Romneys -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- the Liz Cheney’s, they’ve all been ostracized from the party, right? So, these people are out. This is an entirely different, not entirely different, but a significantly different Republican Party. And also, they’re going to be operating in an environment in which everyone who stands up against whatever Donald Trump wants to do, and I’m not talking about people on the left. I’m talking about whatever level of resistance is even still left within the Republican Party. They have all seen now that they can expect an enormous level of violent threat directed at them, right, because that is what all the election workers are facing across the country. That is what every Republican is facing who has said anything critical about Trump. So we are operating under entirely different conditions. That was just not the case in 2017. Chris Hayes: Or less so the case. I mean, there were some of that. Thomas Zimmer: Less so the case, yes. Chris Hayes: It’s way more widespread and almost sort of priced in as ubiquitous now. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: I mean, you just look at the judges and the district attorneys and the -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- judge’s clerk in a civil fraud trial. I mean, anyone that gets in the crosshairs has to deal with a security situation. They have to deal with doxing. Maybe their phone is going to be overwhelmed. They may have to move apartments. Like, these things are real tangible costs of sort of the threat of violence and the security burden is a tax that is applied to people that cross Trump. Thomas Zimmer: Yes, absolutely. And again, I think if you combine those three elements, right, so different Supreme Court, different Republican Party, and this sort of environment of heightened violent threat, this does not mean that they will be able to do whatever they have outlined here. Again, this is not what I’m arguing, what anyone, any serious person is arguing. But it will mean that the idea that we’re just looking at a rerun of like the first Trump presidency, that is just not a plausible analysis of the situation. Chris Hayes: I feel like now at this point, we have to talk a little bit about the sort of the fascism debate or the authoritarian debate. Thomas Zimmer: All right. Chris Hayes: I mean, the language in this Project 2025, and I have read large parts of it, not all it. I have read the Justice Department section. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: It’s pretty close to fascist language. I mean, it’s a constant paranoid obsession with an internal enemy who is seeking to undo the purity of the nation from within. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: It’s textbook fascistic. Now, it’s also you could say textbook reactionary or textbook conservative, and there’s lines between those. I’m not that interested in this debate -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- that has played out over the last 10 years about the degree to which Trumpism is fascism or not. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: The name doesn’t matter that much to me. But what does matter is models of authoritarian governance. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: And, you know, people talk about Hungary a lot as a sort of model. And Donald Trump has explicitly said, Orban’s great. I like what he’s doing. Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: And one of the things you see there is, you know, the newspaper that is, you know, or the university that is a sort of bastion of dissent and criticism comes under all sorts of regulatory scrutiny or tax scrutiny. Or in Turkey, where Erdogan is also sort of overseeing this kind of presidential dictatorship, which is ostensibly democratic, but corrupted in key ways. You know, you pass a law regulating large media enterprises and then they’re sort of forced to sell to friendly competitors. There are all these ways in which, like, it’s not the tanks roll in. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: But you’re using essentially the mechanisms of governance in a fundamentally coercive fashion directed at constraining speech and against political enemies. And I wonder how much you think what’s laid out in Project 2025 fits with these other kind of presidential dictatorship authoritarian models. Thomas Zimmer: So, I mean, look, the answer to the question of, you know, whether or not this is adequately described as fascism depends on how you define fascism, and there’s no consensus definition of fascism out there. So that’s one of the problems here. But I think you’ve framed this exactly right. It’s not about what label you slap on it. It’s about we shouldn’t get bogged down in labeling fights. To me, I will say this, and I think most serious economic observers, I think, would agree with this. There is Trumpism specifically. Trump and Trumpism specifically represents a specifically American, specifically 21st century version of fascism. That does not mean that everything on the right is fascism. It doesn’t mean the whole Republican Party. If you look historically, so fascist movements and parties have always existed in sort of coalitions and alliances with more established conservative right-wing reactionary forces. And I think that’s also exactly what we’re seeing here, right. We’re seeing sort of an alignment. We’re seeing an alliance, a sort of a coming together, and making common cause between these different strands on the right. The people behind Project 2025, they’re not Trump, although, again, there are strong connections. There are many sorts of Trump alumni, Trump administration alumni among them. But again, granted, they’re not Trump himself. But what Project 2025 offers is a story of a once great nation in decline because of the enemy within and the enemy without, but they are in cahoots, right. It’s like the woke enemy within is in cahoots with and the globalist elites are in cahoots with like communist China. They’re being 100 percent explicit about this, by the way. I’m not just paraphrasing here. And Project 2025 is sort of a promise to restore this former national glory by purging these enemies and these deviants from the nations. It is viscerally -- Chris Hayes: Why did you put it like that? Thomas Zimmer: I’m somewhat, you know, on purpose putting it like that. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: But look, Project 2025, regardless of where you look, regardless of what chapter you read, it offers sort of a visceral disdain for any kind of pluralism and diversity. And all that is channeled into this program, aiming to extinguish that pluralism diversity. Look, again, I think by any reasonable definition of fascism, there’s some key elements of that that are present here. But again, if you’d rather call these people enablers of fascism or making common cause with fascism, I don’t care. I really don’t. What is important here is that we understand how radically anti-democratic this is, how radically anti-pluralistic, and that this is really an extreme reactionary vision of white Christian patriarchal dominance and an aggressive embrace of state authoritarianism in order to impose that vision on society against the will of the majority. And as long as we can agree on that and how dangerous that is, you can honestly call it whatever you want. I don’t think it matters all that much, but the diagnosis matters. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So one of the things that I wrestle with here is that I think there’s a little bit of a psyop being run by Bannon and some people on the right, which is, and you even saw this the other day, Ronnie Jackson, who’s the, you know, ex-White House doctor turned right-wing MAGA Texas congressman, you know, saying people are scared about Trump’s second term, you should be scared. And there’s a little bit of big bad wolf happening. You know, it’s like Steve Bannon is like talking a lot of trash from his microphone, and it’s like, I’m not scared of you, sweaty doofus. Like, you know, I just refuse to be too cowed by these losers. And I wrestle a little bit with balancing two imperatives that are an intention. One is taking seriously the authoritarian aspirations and threat represented by this movement in which they say, I mean, Bannon the other day literally said, we got to get rid of the entire FBI and start over. It’s totally corrupted. And yes, we are going to prosecute. There will be punishment for anti-Trump forces in a Trump term, like not even in coded language, right, like straight up saying this is what’s coming. So one level I’m trying to balance in the way I think about this and the coverage of it being very clear eyed and serious about what a threat this is, but also not letting their like trash talking make them seem more powerful and imposing than they are. You know what I mean? Because that’s part of the game here. Part of it’s like -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you should be scared of us and Trump’s going to rule forever and, you know, it’s the last election in America. And it’s like, no. I refuse to seed all this stuff. Thomas Zimmer: Right. Chris Hayes: I refuse to seed it because if you seed it ahead of time, you say, if Trump’s elected, all these terrible things are going to happen, you may have to wake up on the Wednesday morning after he’s elected and say, like, no, like we’re not going to go without a fight. And I wonder how to think about those two imperatives, because there’s a certain amount of like braggadocio that’s happening here. Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: They really like to talk like Disney villains. Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: Like there’s this like cackling like, I’ll get you. You know, it’s like, all right. Thomas Zimmer: So, I mean, I will be honest with you. I try to ignore Steve Bannon as much as I can -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- because I do not find that very insightful. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: I’m not gaining any insights from listening to whatever he has to say. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: I’ll say this, everything we’re seeing here, this sort of radicalization, this sort of anti-democratic radicalization of the right, of which Project 2025 is a manifestation, it’s not coming from a place of strength. It’s coming from a place of weakness. Chris Hayes: That’s an interesting way of putting it. Thomas Zimmer: Because the reason why they are radicalizing is because they, and I think they’re quite correct about this, they can feel and they can see that American society is moving away from their vision of what America should be. Broadly speaking, over the past two decades, right -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- the country has become less white, more pluralistic, more diverse. Chris Hayes: More secular, certainly. Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: Yes, absolutely. Yes. And that’s mostly for demographic reasons, right. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: So, again, I mean, Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012 with like 40 percent of the white vote or something like this, entirely unthinkable in previous eras of American history. And so in a very real sense, they are reacting to something that’s real. They’re not imagining the fact that the country is becoming more pluralistic and more diverse. And so that is why this of this sense of being under siege that is really that you can grasp. And I really recommend everyone read the full word that Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, wrote for this policy report that Project 2025 put out. It’s only like 15, 16 pages long. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And it’s so tangible, the sense of being under siege and having their backs -- Chris Hayes: Aggrieved. Thomas Zimmer: -- yes, and having their backs against the wall. Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: It’s all about this, we are losing and the left and the wokes and the globalist elites and the progressives, they have taken over all the institutions of government and all the institutions of American life. This is precisely why they say conservatism is no longer enough. That’s now explicitly what you hear on the right. We can’t be conservative anymore. We need a counterrevolution. We have to embrace sort of a counterrevolutionary spirit, right. There’s nothing left to conserve. We need to we need to be much more radical than this. But again, don’t let Steve Bannon tell you that this is because they’re so strong and so manly or all this kind of nonsense. It’s because of out of a sense of weakness. And that is, I think, a sort of a glass half full kind of way to look at the current situation -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- right. In many ways, and I mean this sincerely, in many ways, the country has just never been closer to finally realizing the promise of sort of egalitarian, pluralistic, multiracial democracy, that, I mean, it has never kept that promise so far, but that promise has always been part of the American project. And in many ways, the country has never been closer to realizing that. And that is precisely why they are, again, feeling so much under threat on the right. And I think it’s really important to keep that in mind whenever you hear Steve Bannon like pretend, he’s like the man. Chris Hayes: There’s a line, I think it’s a Benjamin Wittes line of Lawfare who said that, you know, describing the Trump administration or Trump as, you know, malevolence tempered by incompetence, which I thought it was. Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And one thing I think is good to remind people, even though, again, I don’t want to fall into a trap of being like, oh, it can never happen here. It will be fine. I don’t think that. But also the incompetence isn’t just going to go away. Like there’s something woke like they will be more competent this time -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- but it doesn’t mean it’s going to go away. Like Trump is still Donald Trump, and in certain ways, extremely distractible, you know, flawed figure for executing projects in a systematic fashion. I mean, that’s just the truth about him. Thomas Zimmer: Let me take of the other side of this of this debate and push back a little bit against it, although I’m not saying you’re entirely wrong, but look, it is true, right? In some ways, Trump is a less than ideal vessel for the kind of ambitious, comprehensive plans that are emanating from the right. He’s erratic. He’s lazy. He’s volatile. He’s certainly not sitting down and reading his extensive policy memos. I mean, no one believes that he is -- Chris Hayes: Right. Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- like reading 920 pages -- Chris Hayes: Nor does he care about anything except, you know, himself and his own glory, and yeah. Thomas Zimmer: No, that’s right. But in other ways, Trump is especially suited to lead this kind of crusade. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: He isn’t restrained by norms or questions of precedence or forbearance. I mean, that is why the right united behind him in the first place. It really takes a radical leader -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- to implement extremist plans and kind of, you know, that’s Trump. Look, I mean, if you strip it down to its core, what Project 2025 is about is, again, this massive expansion of presidential power and making the executive into a tool for whatever the regime wants to do. And it doesn’t take much sophisticated analysis to explain why such a plan would appeal to Trump. He wants power. He wants immunity. Chris Hayes: Yes. Thomas Zimmer: And he wants the ability to plunder, right? And so, again, while he will not sit down to read those plans, he will look at this and say, oh, yeah, I get more power and I totally go after my enemies. Awesome. Chris Hayes: He doesn’t have a lot of ideological commitments, but he does have a few. The biggest one is his own glory and vanity and power. But he’s genuinely, I think, a bigot. Like I think he -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- he’s not an egalitarian. He really thinks there’s like a small group of people and of certain races and nationalities that are better than others. And he’s genuinely authoritarian at a principal level. Like I think -- Thomas Zimmer: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- he’s really genuinely viscerally deep in his heart, thinks democracy is bad and strong men are good. And I think he thinks that -- Thomas Zimmer: Oh, yeah. Chris Hayes: -- as like a foundational fact, like it’s not a made-up thing. It’s not just an incidental thing. He likes dictatorship affirmatively as a model of governance. And every time he talks about Kim Jong Un -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- or Xi or Putin or whoever, it’s like they’re strong, they’re strong. It’s like that his people salute when he says something. I want my people to say that. He once said that about Kim Jong Un. To his cells, is an authoritarian. Thomas Zimmer: I mean, he is the perfect avatar of sort of aggrieved masculinity -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- and he’s the perfect avatar of sort of a white male grievance. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And he’s not putting on a show. He is not like Kevin Roberts is, again, he’s the president of the Heritage Foundation. That guy’s coming out of this of reactionary Catholicism world, right? Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: That’s not Trump -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- and Trump is not deeply steeped in white Christian nationalism in that way. But again, he is sort of an aggrieved white male alpha who believes the world is not giving him his due anymore -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: -- and that’s not right, because all the women and the brown people and the black folks they’re being a little too loud and too rowdy and why are they not shutting up? And so, again, I think in that sense, I kind of struggle when people say, oh, all he wants is like plunder and enrich himself. No, I mean, there is this sort of aggrieved white male masculinity and that is also very much what he is. And again, in that sense, also, how he sees the world and what he wants America to be is entirely 100 percent compatible with this vision of white patriarchal order that emanates from Project 2025. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Where are you from, Thomas, originally? Thomas Zimmer: I’m German. How about that? Chris Hayes: What brought you to the States? Thomas Zimmer: Well, you know, I was offered a job at Georgetown. And so, and my wife was also at the very same time offered a very good job in D.C. We were offered our jobs within three days of each other and so we felt like that’s too good. We can’t say no to that. So we came over. Chris Hayes: Can I ask as a final question as someone who -- Thomas Zimmer: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- is from a nation whose sort of defining feature of the last, say, 70 years is reckoning with fascist evil and the aftermath of that, like how you feel about being an American or living in America at this moment? Thomas Zimmer: That’s a good question. You know what? I struggle with this a little bit because I’m not an expert on, like, German history. I’m not an expert on Nazism. But it is true, certainly, that the idea that it cannot happen here is certainly not something that you have in your DNA. If you grow up in Germany in the late ‘20s -- Chris Hayes: Exactly. Thomas Zimer: Right? I mean, I was born in 1982. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And so it is the very core of my school education about German history, that it can absolutely happen because it did happen, right? Chris Hayes: Yeah. Thomas Zimmer: And so I do think that this has probably immunized me a little more against the sort of tales of American exceptionalism, the sort of tales of America supposedly immune to this kind of stuff and America supposedly has 250 years of stable, consolidated democracy and stable, consolidated democracy do not fall to authoritarianism. I mean, first of all, it’s not 250 years of stable, consolidated democracy. Chris Hayes: Correct. Thomas Zimmer: The first time America had any right to call itself a multiracial democracy in any sense of the word is in the 1960s after the civil rights legislation of the ‘60s. And even then, this has been the defining political fault line in American history, whether or not the country should actually continue on this path towards becoming, again, which it has often promised to be, a multiracial, pluralistic, egalitarian democracy. That’s what all people are created equal ultimately means, right? A country that is not defined by sort of, you know, discriminatory hierarchies of race and gender and wealth and religion, but something where the individual is, again, not measured by, you know, who you are and what you look like and who your parents were and all of these things. America has never been that. But since the 1960s, there has been this sort of struggle over should we continue down this path towards becoming that, finally realizing that promise? And I think, again, when I hear people who are confidently telling their audience and these are people with like big platforms writing for mainstream media outlets, confidently telling their people that, you know, it’s all just hysteria and liberal alarmism and like democracy in danger, stop with this alarmism. Like Project 2025 is immensely helpful, at least in this one respect. You don’t have to trust me, some lefty liberal like -- Chris Hayes: Right. Thomas Zimmer: -- professor or whatever, who cares? Or you, right? The lefty liberals over here, like, okay, if people don’t want to trust us, fair enough. Chris Hayes: (inaudible) Thomas Zimmer: These people could not possibly be clearer about what they want for the country. So at least trust them and believe them when they say they are just fundamentally not on board with this vision of an egalitarian, pluralistic democracy. Project 2025 is their declaration of war on this idea of America. That’s what this is. And so in many ways, this is on the ballot in November. Those are the stakes. And I think this is really, you know, in a fundamental way in November is going to be a referendum on whether or not we want to continue down this path towards multiracial, pluralistic, egalitarianism or not. And this should be read as a reminder of the fact that those are the actual stakes in the election. Chris Hayes: Thomas Zimmer is a historian at Georgetown University. He writes a Substack called “Democracy Americana.” He’s co-host of the “Is This Democracy?” podcast. Thomas, that was fantastic. Thank you so much. Thomas Zimmer: Thank you so much for having me.

"Discussing criminal justice, faith and politics with Rep. Jasmine Crockett: podcast and transcript",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/discussing-criminal-justice-faith-politics-rep-jasmine-crockett-podcas-rcna160922,"Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett is one of the most interesting figures in Congress. You may have been introduced to her in recent weeks following a House committee during which Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene insulted her appearance. The verbal spat between the two took the internet by storm and became a viral moment. But that exchange, and her clapback, is only one part of her story as a rising star within the Democratic Party. She joins WITHpod to discuss the impetus for her political work, how her faith keeps her grounded in the often vitriolic world of politics, serving as a criminal justice advocate and more. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Rep. Crockett: A lot of times people try to act like Democrats are the Antichrist. And so then I’m like, my daddy’s a preacher, go look him up, you know. And so I think that it allows me to engage in the conversations and really be a good representation for what actually a lot of black folk are. I mean, when you think about politics and advocacy in general, so much of it was born out of black church and it really is centers to the core of who we are. It’s how we were able to get so much. I mean, when you think about the leaders, whether you’re talking about Martin Luther King, who comes from more of the traditional Baptist background, or whether you’re talking about Malcolm X, who comes from the Muslim faith. It always, for black folks, somehow our leadership came directly out of the church for moving us forward. And I don’t ever want that to be lost at all. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. You know, Congress doesn’t make a lot of headlines these days unless something’s going sideways, I think I would say. And partly that’s the news media. There’s an expression we have in the news media, we don’t cover the planes that land. We tend to focus on, you know, disaster and conflict. Also, this Congress, particularly the House, has been historically unproductive. There’s a whole bunch of, kind of objective metrics you could use, and it’s been one of the least productive Congresses in a very, very long time in terms of moving legislation. It’s also a Congress where there’s a very razor-thin Republican majority and the defining feature of that majority has been dysfunction, factional infighting, multiple ballots to elect the Speaker Kevin McCarthy the first time, and then deposing that Speaker, and then an interregnum in which no one can get the votes, and now Mike Johnson, and threats against Mike Johnson, and battles between various factions for a Republican caucus that seems mostly devoted to sort of signaling their fealty to Donald Trump. There was a viral incident a few weeks ago. I say all this because the context is there was a viral incident a few weeks ago in a committee hearing where two members of Congress kind of went at it. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican member of Congress from Georgia, and a representative from Texas who represents Dallas and parts of Tarrant County named Jasmine Crockett. Now, you may have seen this go viral. We’re going to talk about what happened and play you some of the sound of what happened in this conversation. But when I saw it, I thought, oh, you know, I saw a lot of people commenting. It got a lot of life on social media, and there was a little bit of like, oh, these clowns in Congress debasing themselves, or a little bit of when you’re dealing with folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene, you can’t escape but being brought down to her level. But when I saw it, I thought that the congresswoman involved, Representative Jasmine Crockett, is a really, really interesting figure in Congress. I’ve had the opportunity to talk to her a few times on the show and had done a little research on her background and think she’s a really interesting member of Congress. And again, if you listen to the show, you know that I’m always interested in members who are coming from backgrounds that aren’t the sort of standard backgrounds that a lot of representatives come from. And Congresswoman Crockett is one of those people. And so I thought a great person to talk to would be Jasmine Crockett herself about both what it’s like to serve in Congress now, what her path was to becoming the United States congressperson, and of course, the by now infamous viral moment. So, Congresswoman Crockett, it’s great to have you in the program.   Rep. Crockett: Yeah, it’s great to be with you, Chris. Chris Hayes: You and I have talked a bunch before and I’ve known a bit about your background and you were a criminal defense attorney, civil rights attorney. You served in the Texas Statehouse before becoming a member of Congress. A lot of people probably were introduced to you by this crazy moment that happened recently in the House Oversight Committee. And before I get into it, I want to just say up top that you’re, I think, a really interesting politician. There’s a lot I want to get into, so I don’t want to reduce you to this moment. But I do want to talk about it first because it got out there and it went viral and a lot of people had reactions to it and I wanted to sort of start with that. And so first, before I play some of the sound, I would love for you to just take me through. This is an oversight committee hearing. James Comer is the chair of the oversight committee. Jamie Raskin from Maryland is the ranking member. The oversight committee has been the site of a lot of the most, kind of the Fox News on Capitol Hill center. It’s where James Comer sort of produces content for Fox News, chasing after Hunter Biden, promising an impeachment that ultimately they didn’t have the goods for, constantly promising these huge explosive revelations about the quote “Biden crime family” that never bear fruit, but always with the intent of sort of producing fireworks that can then be rolled into the Fox News evening programming. And so this took place in that committee. Tell me what happened. Just you take me through it before we play this out.   Rep. Crockett: Yeah, so it was already a very frustrating hearing as most oversight committee hearings are. Definitely didn’t think that I would walk into Congress as a freshman and almost immediately find out that I was going to have to engage in a faux impeachment kind of exercise of sorts. But nevertheless, these folk are basically using this committee to campaign for Donald Trump. And so on that day, we were supposed to have our committee hearing at 11:00 a.m. The committee hearing was about hopefully for them, jailing Attorney General Merrick Garland, not because he went out and fondled women inappropriately or sexually assaulted any women or committed some type of fraud or engaged in anything that would be by law a crime that required him to be jailed.   But instead, because they were upset because they wanted the audio recordings of the interview, the voluntary interview that was taken of the president as he was being interviewed about the documents that he ultimately had in his possession, that special appointee Hur decided not to go forward on. Unfortunately, we could not have our hearing at 11:00 a.m. where they were trying to hold the attorney general in contempt for not turning over the audio, even though they had the transcripts for this, because they decided they wanted to take a field trip to New York because they needed to stand with their man. They needed to be by his side. Chris Hayes: Oh, so they postponed the hearing to go after Garland for not turning over the audio, despite the fact of the transcript, because they wanted to go to New York to do the thing where they stood with Donald Trump in his criminal trial. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. So they had to stand with Donny as he was going through what he was going through. And so ultimately, they rescheduled our hearing for 8:00 p.m. So we as Democrats have been at work all day working and now we have to have this late night  hearing. Chris Hayes: I didn’t even know that detail. Rep. Crockett: Oh, yeah. No, no. We had to have this late night hearing because they went on their field trip. So, it was really kind of like I was already annoyed because here it is, I’m going to be at work. Chris Hayes: You’re within your rights to be annoyed, I think. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, I was super annoyed. So anyway, so we’re in the hearing. And of course, they have their grievances against Merrick Garland. Fine. Air your grievances. Say what you got to say. I know what the vote is going to be. We know that you’re going to vote to move forward with the contempt. So like say what you have to say. But it was so much more infuriating because they were still stuck on court that day and still stuck on doing their service to Donald Trump and making sure that they could get around the gag order and be his mouthpiece. So here it is. Marjorie starts talking about Judge Merchan. Chris Hayes: This is Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s a member of Congress you might have heard of, a Republican from Georgia. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. Chris Hayes: So she’s talking about Juan Merchan in a hearing ostensibly about Merrick Garland. Rep. Crockett: Correct. They have nothing to do with one another. And this is at 8:00 p.m. at night. So, I’m like, I’m so upset, and like say what you got to say about Merrick Garland, but like, I’m tired. And don’t remind me that you skipped out on work today to go and play in New York. So I was like, do you realize why we’re here? Because like her not knowing the purpose of a hearing, absolutely, that could be a thing with her. And ultimately, when I asked her the question, that is when she decided to lash out against me. Chris Hayes: And she said some nasty things about your appearance, I believe. And that violates House rules, right? I mean -- Rep. Crockett: Yes. Chris Hayes: -- the normal thing is these House rules exist for a reason. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And they go all the way back, I think, to pre-Civil War when there -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- was actually famously violence on the floor of the House, which is that you can’t talk to people directly. You’re supposed to evoke them, the gentleman or the gentlewoman. And it’s out of order, I think, usually if you just directly address someone. Is that right? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So it’s called engaging in personalities. So, like it’s all about like making sure that you are maintaining a decorum, right? So you’re like the gentlelady. Like there’s nothing gentle about half these people, right. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: You’ve got to use like the language and you’re supposed to be polite enough, like you can go on Fox News and Newsmax and say what you got to say, go on Twitter, wherever, go on Truth. You can do whatever you want to outside of the chambers, but we’re supposed to remain somewhat respectful. And so you’re not supposed to do things that would normally be considered offensive and directed at a member while you’re in the chamber or in committee.   Chris Hayes: So she says this thing about you. There’s an objection that it’s out of order, right? Rep. Crockett: Right. Exactly. Chris Hayes: And the objection is overruled by the committee. Rep. Crockett: Ultimately, Chairman Comer overruled it, yeah. Chris Hayes: And everyone votes to say it’s fine for her to say this nasty thing directed at you. Rep. Crockett: Well, actually, the chair just makes a decision. Chris Hayes: I see. Rep. Crockett: So, essentially she asked to basically remove her words from the record. And you can do that if there’s unanimous consent. And the deal was we would not object to unanimous consent so long as she apologized. So we just simply wanted her to apologize for being offensive. And then no one would object. She’s like, well, I’m not going to apologize, but I’ll go ahead and say that, you know, you can just remove my words from the record. Well, no. Now, we want a ruling because if we get a ruling saying that you were wrong, which is the only reason that she agreed to say, okay, fine, I’ll remove what I said, is because if the ruling came down the way that it was supposed to, then she was going to be kicked out of committee for the rest of the day, which meant I didn’t have to hear from her. And it also meant that Comer was going to lose one of his votes. Yeah. Chris Hayes: So he didn’t want to do that. So he ruled them in order. And then your colleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was like, wait a second, you can’t do that. That’s not in order. And then you posed a hypothetical question.  Rep. Crockett: Yes. Chris Hayes: As a question about whether what would be in order or not order. And that hypothetical question got some traction. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. So essentially, AOC actually kicked off the objection. So she was at the very beginning. And then Raskin was negotiating and the parliamentarian was advising the Chair. And the agreement was that there would be an apology and Marjorie decided she wasn’t going to do that. So ultimately, when I found out that the Chair was ruling against me, that was when I decided to pose a hypothetical so that he could see that this committee could devolve into certain things. If they’re going to throw punches, just know you may end up having a few thrown back at you. Chris Hayes: All right. So we’ve stitched together a little bit of this committee, I don’t know if you want to call my highlights or the lowlights or the latter, but --   Rep. Crockett: Yeah, the lowlights. Chris Hayes: -- take a listen to folks that were not familiar with this. (BEGIN SOUNDBITE) Rep. Greene: Do you know what we’re here for? I don’t think you know what you’re for. Rep. Crockett: Well, you’re the one talking about -- Marjorie Taylor Greene: I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you’re reading. Rep. Crockett: No, ain’t nothing -- Rep. Comer: Hold on, hold on. Rep. Crockett: Listen -- Rep. Comer: Order. Rep. Lynch: Mr. Chairman -- Rep. Raskin: That’s beneath even you Ms. Greene. Rep. Lynch: -- you need to regain order of your committee. Rep. Comer: Order. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: I do have a point of order and I would like to move to take down Ms. Greene’s words. That is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person. Rep. Comer: Hearing will suspend. Hearing will suspend. Rep. Greene: Are your feelings hurt? Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Move her words down. Rep. Greene: Oh. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Oh girl, baby girl. Rep. Greene: Oh, really? Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Don’t even play. Rep. Greene: Baby girl? I don’t think that -- Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: We are going to move and we’re going to take your words down. Thank you. Rep. Raskin: I second that motion. Rep. Comer: Well, you ready to strike your words? Rep. Greene: Yeah. I’ll do it. Rep. Comer: Okay. Ms. Greene agrees to strike her words. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: I believe she needs to apologize. No, no, no. Rep. Comer: Hold on. Then after Mr. Perry you’ll be recognized then Ms. Greene -- Rep. Greene: I’m not apologizing. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: Well, then you’re not striking your word. Rep. Greene: I am not apologizing. Rep. Comer: Well, let’s not. Come on, guys. Rep. Crockett: It’s me. Rep. Comer: Ms. Crockett. Rep. Crockett: I’m just curious just to better understand your ruling, if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody’s bleach blonde, bad built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct? Rep. Comer: A what now? (END SOUNDBITE) Chris Hayes: Now, needless to say, bleach blonde, bad built, butch body went viral on TikTok. There were cultural remixes of it. People made songs about it, country songs. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: House music. Rep. Crockett: Gospel. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Dance songs. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: I think the Biden campaign put an e-mail out that was like six B’s in a row. Rep. Crockett: They did. They did. Chris Hayes: I have a few questions about this. Rep. Crockett: Okay. Chris Hayes: One is I have had the phrase bad built in my head since hearing it because as an arrangement of words, I have never encountered it. But there’s something very cutting and specific about the phrase bad built. Where did bad built come from? Rep. Crockett: It came from my granny. So, my granny and if anybody knows anything about older Black women, they say a lot of stuff like they just don’t care. And so my granny was good for saying that somebody was bad built. And so while she probably was my favorite person on the face of the planet and I miss her every single day and I could only imagine, you know, what she would think of me now. But it’s amazing when you think about how important people like my grandma has been to my life. And even when they’re gone, they’re always still with you. And so I have been able to share my granny with the whole world. But no, that was something that my granny used to say. Chris Hayes: All right. The second thing I want to ask is what the reaction was like to this, because obviously, like, I think in a in the sort of Drake v. Kendrick Lamar sense, like you got the Kendrick Lamar half of it. Rep. Crockett: Absolutely. Yep. Chris Hayes: So like, I think you had the kind of final word.  Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But then at the same level, people were like, there’s a certain like, oh, this is what Congress has come. This is what it’s descended to and I saw a lot of that. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And I was sort of torn because I don’t like to be too pearl-clutchy. But also there is a reason those rules exist so that it doesn’t devolve into this. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Exactly. Chris Hayes: What was your sort of takeaway from this episode? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So here’s the deal. We were trying to do what Democrats try to do all the time. We were trying to follow the rules because the real party of law and order is the Democratic Party. And so this is why AOC jumped in. She’s the vice ranking member on the committee. And then Jamie Raskin was right there talking to the chairman. He is the ranker on the committee. And there was an agreement that was made, which is why, you know, she’s like, yeah, I’ll strike my words, but it has to be by unanimous consent. And so we understand the rules. We try to play by the rules. We honor the rules of decorum in this body. We’ve seen a devolution of Congress and people call it a circus and things like that. But it’s all been the MAGA folk. It’s all been the right. We know that they were engaged in physical altercations from the Speaker of the House, elbowing one of his members. There was another situation where somebody got chased down in the hall. I don’t remember exactly who that was, but it was during fight week is what I call it. And then we also had the situation on the Senate side where Senator Bernie Sanders had to interject. We also have had Marjorie Taylor Greene disrupting the president in the State of the Union address this year, as well as last year. She was yelling at him. There’s the images of that and the audio of that. We also know that Marjorie Taylor Greene got into it with the other MAGA darling, Lauren Boebert, and she called her the B word on the floor and they got into it. It was all about who filed to impeach the president of the United States first. And so they had their own spat. But it was all kept on that side. This was the first time that they crossed over or any one of them crossed over and attempted to bring it to this side. And, you know, for me, it wasn’t so much about doing a tit for tat, even though that’s how people have described it. That’s not what I did. Number one, I never addressed her at all. I asked a question. Chris Hayes: You asked a hypothetical. Rep. Crockett: I asked a question that was parliamentary in nature to seek clarification and also kind of send like a warning to the Chair, like, just know, I got bars. Like, so this is not the smoke that you all want. Like, we can do this if this is what you’re going to turn this committee into. And I don’t expect Marjorie to ever honor the rules of decorum or respect who we are supposed to be when we’re within the halls of Congress. But the question is, Chairman, how are you going to conduct your hearings? Is this what you want? And so it was more so for him. And that’s why I addressed it to him. And I still stayed within the rules. So not only did I respond, but I responded in a way that also was reflective of the fact that, again, Democrats can actually do this game better while also staying within the rules of decorum. And I think that that was really important for me to do instead of kind of like, you know, going back and forth and being as grade school as some people want to say we were. I could have been like your mama. That’s like the grade school thing, you know? Chris Hayes: Right. Right. Right. Rep. Crockett: But I didn’t do that. Chris Hayes: This is your first term in Congress, right? Rep. Crockett: It is. Chris Hayes: So you just you just got there in ‘22. Rep. Crockett: ‘23. I was elected in ‘22, yeah. Chris Hayes: That’s right. You were elected in ‘22, right. You got there in ‘23. Okay. So, this is your first term. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Let’s zoom out one level from this interaction, but just the broader context of what it’s like to work in that House. You’re coming in having never been in the majority. You’re coming in having never served in the body, never having served under previous Congresses so this is all you know. And the first thing is, you know, a historic multi-ballot speaker vote and then the first ever, you know, vote of no confidence essentially in the Speaker to topple him. And then -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- a long period of interregnum, and then Mike Johnson. What is it like to work in that body as the first time that you’re ever serving and only knowing this? Rep. Crockett: It is wild. It’s interesting because coming out of the State House, I obviously was in a significant minority being in Texas. But, you know, the idea is that you level up when you go to the big house. And it seems like I actually went down a little bit, right? Because even being in the minority in the Texas House and granted, you know, I disagree with the vast majority of the agenda that has been moving very swiftly through the chambers in Texas. But somehow they figured out how to function. So I was used to like a functioning majority. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: And like it absolutely is to the benefit of the American people that these people can’t function. Chris Hayes: Right, right, right. Yeah, right. Probably better they can’t. Right. Rep. Crockett: Correct. It’s a lot better that they can’t, but I expected to walk into a situation where they were trying to function. And considering the fact that the Democrats have the White House and the Democrats have the Senate, I thought these people will know how to function in this divided government, and they can’t. They are unable or and or unwilling. Chris Hayes: Well, it’s interesting because the Texas State House for years has operated under a kind of like almost tripartite and Texas Senate as well, factions. There’s a Republican supermajority in both houses. There’s a Democratic minority. But the Republican supermajority has both kind of normal Republicans. I mean, is any Texas Republican normal? But there’s the more Republicans who have some kind of set of tangible objectives in terms of getting stuff done. And then there’s like the real wing nuts. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And they sort of functions with a kind of tacit, sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit partnership between the Democrats and Republicans on the kind of the functional part of the caucus as opposed to the wing nuts, right. Is that a fair -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah, it is. So, interestingly enough, as you brought up the speaker fight, no Democrat defected when it came down to it. Everyone was voting for Hakeem Jeffries. On the state level, that’s not what it was. There’s like two kind of factions that are trying to like -- Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: -- and Democrats jump in and they pick the lesser of the evils. And so then you also end up in a situation where Democrats have chairmanships over committees. It’s not a matter of it’s all Republicans as chairs and things like that. And much like we see in the U.S. House, the House tends to function wildly differently than the Senate. And so I will say there was more of a cohesiveness in the House. It definitely ain’t good for sure, but like, you know, when we saw the impeachment of our attorney general, that was Democrats and decent enough Republicans coming together and saying, well, this guy has like gone too far. Now, mind you, he’s been under federal indictment for almost a decade at this point, but it took him trying to take taxpayer dollars to go ahead and pay off a settlement for them to say, okay, now you went too far. Now, granted, I believe that he went too far a long time ago. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: But that was kind of the breaking point for some of the people. And they spent a lot of money. You know, we don’t have limits in Texas. And so a number of those Republicans that voted for the impeachment of our corrupt attorney general, they ended up being primaried and they lost. So, the Texas House is going to move further to the right. And I wonder if they question the heavy gerrymandering that they did in this last session or the session that I was there because if it wasn’t so heavily gerrymandered and there were more normal lines, they would probably be in a better position -- Chris Hayes: To survive those primary challenges. Rep. Crockett: Exactly, exactly. Chris Hayes: Yeah, I mean, it’s interesting because it’s an interesting training ground. How long do you serve in the in the Texas ledge? Rep. Crockett: Just one crazy freshman term. Chris Hayes: Just one term. How old are you, Congresswoman? Rep. Crockett: I am 43. Chris Hayes: Okay. Rep. Crockett: And Chris, your people need to tell you, don’t be asking those questions. No, but it’s all good. It’s only because people can Google and get it. Chris Hayes: It’s on Wikipedia. Rep. Crockett: Exactly. Chris Hayes: Well, you’ve had a very quick rise. Tell me first what your background is, where you grew up and how you became a lawyer. Rep. Crockett: Yes. So, from St. Louis, Missouri, originally born and raised there. And after I graduated high school, I went to undergrad in Memphis, Tennessee at Rhodes College, who’s definitely gotten more so a bad rap because of one of the Supreme Court justices, Amy Coney Barrett. Chris Hayes: Oh, right. Rep. Crockett: So, interestingly enough, I don’t think that we ended up getting the same education, but nevertheless -- Chris Hayes: Is that like a Bible college? Rep. Crockett: It is.  Okay, fine. Yes. Yeah. Chris Hayes: No, I don’t mean that disparagingly. I mean, that descriptively.  Rep. Crockett: It is. Chris Hayes: I mean, there are many throughout the South. There are, you know, largely they’re Southern Baptists, not always exclusively -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah.  Chris Hayes: -- but often Southern Baptists are called Bible colleges. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, we’re not Southern Baptists, but yeah. Chris Hayes: But it was. And did you like it there? Rep. Crockett: I actually did. I did. But I did endure some hurdles. The very first time that I ever felt or experienced racism was actually on my campus. And it is a part of the fabric of who I am and why people see the fight that they see. And it’s actually what really propelled me on this legal journey. So, I was always a math and science girl. That’s what I was always great at. I never took a political science course a day of my life. I wasn’t really big on history. I wasn’t big on English either. I was always into math and science.  And so for me, it was going to be become an anesthesiologist or a CPA or an engineer. And ultimately, I thought that I was going to become a CPA. So I majored in business. And I went through this experience where I was a junior, myself, along with other African-American students on campus. We were the targets of hate crimes, direct targets. They put hate mail into our on-campus mailboxes. They were keying various people’s cars with the N-word. And I felt something that I never felt before, and I definitely felt like I was a little lost in a space that I felt safe. When I entered Rhodes College, I was one of 18 Black students in my class. Chris Hayes: Out of how many? Rep. Crockett: It was close to 400. Chris Hayes: Oh, wow. Okay. Rep. Crockett: And then by the time I left, there were probably only about 10 of us left. But, you know, we’re in the heart of Memphis and we’re in North Memphis, not necessarily Lily-white. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: So, you know, it really made me question who my real friends were. And it was just a different feeling, even coming out of St. Louis, Missouri. And so they brought in the Cochran firm to try to investigate and figure out what was going on. A Black female lawyer who graduated from University of Houston School of Law was assigned to me and she became my shero. They never really figured out what happened. But having someone that was there and advocating and trying to fight for me, it really kind of changed my trajectory a bit so, that was kind of the beginning for me. Chris Hayes: When you got there, were you raised in a religious Christian household? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. My dad’s a preacher. Chris Hayes: Your dad’s a preacher. So -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- that meal (ph), you must have felt familiar and comfortable. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: But those first two years before this happened, junior year, what was your experience of campus, like the levels of, you know, friendship, social life, racial tension, et cetera? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. I never felt any racial tension at all on campus. I was very good friends with everybody. I was a bit of a social butterfly. I kind of always have been until now. I’m actually a little less social now, which is really weird. But nevertheless, they had started a gospel choir. I did that. I played softball for a second, did the dance team for a little bit. So, I mean, I was really engaged. And even when this happened, I actually did a musical on campus, which was “Little Shop of Horrors.” So I’ve always loved singing and not really that good of an actress. But nevertheless, I always have loved singing. And it was actually the mock trial coach. So I usually tell people that if I tried at my life, it would look nothing like it currently is, but God kind of finds a way to yell at me. And so him recruiting me to do mock trial combined with my experience were kind of the two things that made me say, okay, fine, I’m listening. Chris Hayes: I mean, it sounds like a horrible and traumatic experience. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And this was directed at other Black students, not just you, you’re saying. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And it was actual mail being put in your mailboxes? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So if it’s the on-campus mailbox, that information just isn’t public. And it made me really question like my friendships because no one from outside could come and get that information. And it was only two Black students. Yeah. Chris Hayes: So it’s someone on campus who’s putting this in your mailbox. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: It was never resolved. The perpetrators were never found or punished. Rep. Crockett: No. Chris Hayes: And you had this lawyer who was there who sort of inspired you. So you went to law school afterwards. Rep. Crockett: I did. So I was recruited to do mock trial. So the mock trial coach, I wouldn’t do it my junior year because kids were crying, saying they won’t get into law school and I wasn’t going. And he told me to promise to go back my senior year. I went back my senior year. I became a national All-American. He said, well, you trust me now and just apply to law school. I applied to law school, got a full ride with a stipend to attend law school in Houston. I actually got waitlisted for University of Houston. And so I ended up at Texas Southern, ended up top 10 percent of my class. And then they were having some money issues with finding my money. And so I then applied again to University of Houston. And after showing that I had great ability to do well, they accepted me and I transferred. And so ultimately I graduated as a Cougar. Chris Hayes: And what kind of lawyering did you do when you got out of law school? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So, interestingly enough, I mean, what got me to law school is absolutely not the way that I decided to go. I found out I could make money -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Rep. Crockett: -- and so I was like, oh, I want to go where the money is. Chris Hayes: That happens to a lot of people in law school. Rep. Crockett: So, yes -- Chris Hayes: When you interview them first, you’re like, well, criminal defense, environmental law -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- you know, and then it’s like, I’m going to summer at WilmerHale and they have very good hors d’oeuvres and cocktails. And they took us on a boat. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, I know. Yeah. You lose your way a little bit, yeah. Chris Hayes: No, I honestly I’m not saying that. Rep. Crockett: No, no, no. Chris Hayes: I mean, first of all, people have a ton of debt. So that’s a huge factor. Rep. Crockett: It is. But I just realized I could make money. Chris Hayes: Right, yeah.   Rep. Crockett: I didn’t quite realize this. So, I ended up doing class action defense work for a firm. And I really wanted to be in the courtroom. I clerked for Shook, Hardy and Bacon, which has a large presence and I thought for a while that I would go back to the Midwest. So I went to their main location right there in Kansas City. And then I was like, never mind. I remember why I left the Midwest. And so I ended up at a small firm that was really running point for so many big cases that were coming through at that time, they call the Rocket Docket, which was in the eastern district of Texas. So behind Silicon Valley, it was the fastest moving kind of docket for so many intellectual property cases and things like that. So we were always hired by the big guys. But it gave me a chance to kind of get engaged in litigation a lot earlier.   But pretty early on in my career, I was like, wait a minute. Why did I go to law school again? Like, I just like, I don’t think I like this. The hours were long. I didn’t really like defending some of the stuff I was defending. And I just felt like, yeah, I don’t want to do this. And I almost quit law completely. But they decided to open a public defender’s office in Texarkana. And while I had said I would never deal with criminals because I was like, I don’t want somebody trying to come kill me if I mess up. So I was like, I don’t want to do that. I did decide that it was still a better way for me to really get the trial experience that I wanted. And so I went and interviewed with my boss at the time. His name was Charlie. And I remember walking in and he was like, you have no experience and I was like, that’s okay because I’m smart. And he was looking at me like, what? You know, and I was like, I’ll figure it out. And I was like, I will study, I will read. And I was like, but the one thing that you’ll get out of me that you probably won’t get from anyone else is that I’m black. And he looked at me and I was like, listen, I know the numbers. I will walk in with an instant rapport with so many of the criminal defendants that you guys are going to be charged with defending. And that’s something that no education can give you. And I was the only black female lawyer in I don’t even know how many. Chris Hayes: In the office. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Well, in the office and in the cities. Chris Hayes: Wow.  Rep. Crockett: And so it really did make a difference. It brought so much value to the office, but he took a chance on me and it really worked out really, really well.  Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: What was the most surprising thing to you from practicing as a criminal defender about the way the criminal justice system functions? Because I imagine that you had not had a lot of interaction with it up until that point. You were doing civil litigation, you’re at a small Christian college. And, you know, the system it’s an enormous entity with its own sort of set of internal logic and internal rules and institutions and patterns and practices and traditions. And what struck you about it as you were coming to learn this system? Rep. Crockett: Yeah, man, so much. I was incredibly green. So, as a kid that grew up in the 90s, I mean, I could rap almost any 90s rap song that you like put in front of me because my older cousins were listening to all of it. But for me, it was just a song. It wasn’t anything other than a song, but it definitely brought color and informed me so much more about the experiences that people were having with law enforcement and otherwise. I was like, oh, is that what you meant? Like, this is this is a very real thing. And so it brought to life so many lyrics of the experiences that so many of those that were rap about were saying. And so I really ended up in the belly of the beast, in my opinion, because when you start talking about criminal justice and what it looks like and the inequities, especially when you start talking about in small towns, it is even more ridiculous. And you start talking about small towns in Texas and Arkansas because I practice on both sides. I mean, you could see just the stark difference in how prosecutions were sought and the types of time that was sought and the lack of compassion and understanding that existed. And even the juries, I mean, the jury verdicts were just off the charts. I’m like, this would never happen in Dallas, you know, by the time I started practicing in Dallas. And so it also gave me my real taste of some of the struggles that exist that cause people to be caught up in the system.   And it is why I will always be kind of a fighter for those that have been ignored, forgotten or even targeted. Because the average person has not had those conversations to better understand why did you decide to sell drugs. Tell me what was going on, because I have to know this if I’m going to adequately defend you. Chris Hayes: Right. Rep. Crockett: Or learning the stories of the cycles of abuse that people endured or learning the stories of the cycle of what some would call the generational curses, where it’s like everybody’s in prison. My mama, my daddy, my stepdad, like everybody’s been in prison. And it’s kind of been all I’ve known. And it really brought me, in my opinion, the closest that I’ve ever been to the real struggles that exist in this country. Chris Hayes: I had you on the program the other night and we talked about this, but I want to talk about a little more here because I’ve been thinking about what you said. You’re sort of a perfect person to ask about Donald Trump’s conviction because you practice criminal law. You are a public defender in Texarkana. You’re a black woman from the South. And there’s this very strange thing happening where Trump is sort of, I mean, he doesn’t really have an option, right? He just got convicted of 34 felony counts. It’s, you know, if it were anyone else, that would be you’d say, well, that’s bad. So he’s kind of trying to lean into it. And he did this rally in the Bronx where he had these two rappers with him on stage who are both been indicted for a sort of widespread conspiracy that includes murder and drug trafficking, if I’m not mistaken. And he’s kind of like there’s this discourse of him and his allies being like, this will help us with black voters -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- because they’ll see themselves in me, Donald Trump. And as someone who represented black clients caught up in the system as one of the few black women in Congress, like, what do you think about that? Rep. Crockett: It really is infuriating for me. And, you know, when I was on with you and playing some of the clips and it was almost like a pile on of emotions for me because I have had people that have been treated so much worse than this guy. And he believes that somehow they will see him and say, well, just like MAGA is, you know, like that’s our orange Jesus. Now, all of a sudden you’re going to be our savior. Like, miss me. Talk to me about policies, like policy changes that you want to make. I think he could get so much further if he’s saying, listen, these are policies that I want to implement because now I have gone through the system that he may end up, you know, having the ear of people, but just trying to play people and saying, well, I’m just like you. No, you’re not. You know, I can tell you stories that led me to decide that I wanted to run for higher office, that I wanted to make a change to the laws, because, you know, one of those situations was even as I was running for the State House, I had a 17-year-old that was accused of being an accomplice to murder, which means he was facing murder. They don’t say accomplice in the charge. Chris Hayes: Like felony murder. It was a felony murder charge. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, because it was capital murder. So here it is, he’s facing capital murder. He’s 17-years-old. Texas is one of only five states that says at the age of 17, you’re an adult only for criminal justice purposes. And here it is. His mom was on felony parole. His dad was in prison and his stepdad was also on felony probation or parole, right. And he’s got a public defender because they don’t have money, or I’m court appointed. I was doing a court appointed case. And this kid could not afford to get out pretrial. His family couldn’t afford to get him out pretrial. And so he sat in custody for two years, two years waiting to go to trial. And this kid was incredibly courageous because his family is saying, listen, they’re going to mess you up. They’re going to send you to prison. You just need to take a -- Chris Hayes: Take a deal. Rep. Crockett: And I’m sitting there like there is no evidence, like there is no evidence. I’m not saying he did anything wrong or not, but I’m saying there is no evidence that the state has. And I’m fighting with the state. And they’re literally looking to take his entire life. And so here it was, my initial offer was 30 years day for day. This meant that this kid would come out of prison at the age of 47. And they never, ever alleged that he had actually done any of the killing anyway, right. Forty-seven-years-old. So we fight, we fight, we fight. And basically about a week before trial, they said, we’ll offer you 10 on murder. So that meant he would be eligible after five years. So his family is like, yo, take it. Now, if we went to trial and we lost, he was facing mandatory 40 years day for day. That is what he was facing. And he had to put his trust in me as his court appointed attorney. And I started to get nervous because I’m like, well, wait a minute. Five years is better than 12 jurors who will look at you and know that you have pending drug charges against you, who will find out at sentencing that you have this juvie record. I just don’t trust it. And he said, I believe in you. Let’s fight it out. And I got to the day before trial and the state dismissed the case. Chris Hayes: Straight up dismissed. Rep. Crockett: Straight up dismissed. And there was this, oh, you won. And I’m like, did I? Because I had a kid who lost two years of his life, who did not finish high school because he was sitting behind bars because he could not afford to get out because the presumption of innocence did not work for him. So when Donald Trump starts talking this noise, I literally look at it as noise because that’s not the real experience. And honestly, he’s not taking two seconds to go and try to find out what is it to be black in America and to go through the criminal justice system. And it looks nothing like what he experienced. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One of the points that drives me crazy and you highlighted here is who is benefited by delay completely flips based on whether you are incarcerated pretrial or not. And this is really the change in the whole thing. If you are incarcerated pretrial as your client was, then delay is bad for you because they’re just locked up and you’re locked up. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And the system goes so slow. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And prosecutors come and say, we’re not ready yet, judge. Could we roll it over? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: I’m going to be on vacation in August. Rolls over, winds its way slowly.  Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: On the other hand, Trump was out. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Right. Delay works for him. So the entire way the process works and delay benefits has been completely put on its head. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And in fact -- Rep. Crockett: Yeah.  Chris Hayes: -- the delay is the tool by which pleas are produced, which is the tool by which the whole system functions because there is no capacity to try everyone. So you have to have pleas. Rep. Crockett: Exactly. That’s exactly right. And this idea of speedy trial, right, and how you define it and what it looks like. And the rules were basically people that were incarcerated and it went from most serious offense on down. That is supposed to be the priority. And so people that were out on bond, they never want to go to trial, especially if they knew they didn’t have a good chance. You know, like it was hard to get them. Like, they’re not -- Chris Hayes: Right, exactly. Yes, so you’re on a bond. You don’t like delay. Rep. Crockett: No. Yeah. You’re like, forget that. Like they’re like, oh, if I pay you more money, can you get me another continuance? And it’s like, that’s not how it works, guys, right. But that’s very, very true. And we see that there is this kind of breakdown and all of the norms when it comes to trying cases, because you know what, none of my clients had the benefit of putting three people onto the highest court of the land or into any of the courts. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And they didn’t have any interlocutory appeals to send up to that court. Rep. Crockett: They did not. And they didn’t have the benefit of running for office and raising money to pay their very expensive attorney’s fees. Like they don’t, like they’re not going to have 50 appeals before you even get to trial because they’re going through every interlocutory appeal. You know, he’s been convicted. It’s not a final conviction. He’s going to go through as many appeals after appeal, after appeal as he can. The average person does not have that money. So, again, when you started talking about Black folk can understand me. No, they can’t, because that has not been their existence. They make decisions. And we’ve seen so many people that said, I took a plea because it was what I had to do for my family -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Rep. Crockett: -- because they couldn’t afford it and I needed to get out as soon as possible and minimize the fact that I’m going to be gone. Those are the real decisions that a lot of people have had to make in this country. And Donald Trump has never had to make a decision that comes close to that.  Chris Hayes: So what made you want to run for office the first time? Rep. Crockett: Yeah. So doing the criminal work, definitely there’s a significant overlap with the civil rights work. You find out about who the bad cops are and you hear these stories and they’re told over and over and over. And, you know, one of the places I felt like I was losing too much in both of these arenas where I may have people that are taking pleas because they just don’t believe that they’ll ever be given a fair shot when they go to trial. And I’m asking them to trust me and they literally have lost belief in the system. As well as those mothers that I’ve had to talk to and say, while I know you lost your baby, we’re going to do everything we can, but our hands are a bit tied from things such as qualified immunity. Chris Hayes: You’re saying lost your baby at the hands of police? Rep. Crockett: At the hands of police, yeah. And so, you know, you start to think, am I really doing enough fighting one case at a time? I can’t be everywhere and I can’t fight every case. And so for me, I was like, I need to change the laws in this state. We’ve got 254 counties in the state of Texas, 30 million people. Maybe if I can effectuate change to how prosecutions come about or what a stop looks like, I can, number one, hopefully save lives. And number two, hopefully we can see a little bit more parity between what happens to say that kid that’s caught with a brownie and the big city versus the kid that’s caught with a brownie that’s laced with marijuana in the small towns. In the small towns, they’ll give them the felony conviction. In the big city, they’ll reduce it down to a misdemeanor and give them an opportunity to go to college, to get the financial aid that they need and to be the amazing, you know, citizens that we know that they can be. And so I just wanted to bring about a bigger change and hopefully save some lives at the same time. Chris Hayes: So you ran in 2020, is that right? Rep. Crockett: Yes. Chris Hayes: So that was your first race. Rep. Crockett: It was not. That was my first race for the State House. Actually, my very, very first race that nobody ever talks about, I try to bring it up when I’m encouraging candidates was actually I ran for the district attorney position when I was 28 years old in Texarkana and the state of Texas had not elected a black woman DA. Chris Hayes: They were like, we’re going to keep that streak going. Rep. Crockett: Yeah, pretty much. But that level of frustration, again, wanting to do more. And I felt like I need to make the decisions. So I actually raised a whopping $7,000. You could not tell me anything. And I won the early votes and ultimately lost on election day. They spent close to $60,000 to beat me. Chris Hayes: What year was that? Rep. Crockett: 2010. Chris Hayes: 2010. So, at 28 you run for district attorney, you lost -- Rep. Crockett: And then I said I would never run for office again. Chris Hayes: So you lost in (inaudible). It must have been crushing. Rep. Crockett: I was okay with it. I mean, I don’t know what I expected. I consulted with my pastor at the time and I was like, I think this is what God is leading me to do, but I don’t want to do it. And so I ran, I educated people. I actually informed policy changes within the DA’s office based on things that I proposed. And ultimately, it’s just not where I was supposed to be. But the lessons that I learned from actually having run a race before allowed me to be successful when I ended up running a decade later for the State House. Chris Hayes: Right. Because you had you had some reps. You kind of knew what you were doing. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. Absolutely. Chris Hayes: You just mentioned your pastor. Are you still religious? Rep. Crockett: I am. And, you know, you played that clip and it’s interesting because my pastor texts me while the hearing was going on. He actually called me. He ultimately texted me, but he called me and I was in that hearing. And it was after this exchange had taken place. And I text him. I said, I’m in a hearing. He said, I know. And I mean, why are you calling me in the middle of a hearing? And he ends up texting me and says, I need a warning before you say. And then he said, like, be six. And I was like, huh? I was like, I guess my team -- Chris Hayes: I guess this were -- escaped. Rep. Crockett: -- must have -- Chris Hayes: It’s escape the room. Rep. Crockett: Well, I thought my team clipped it and put it online. And that is not what happened. Everybody else was clipping it. And so it was going immediately viral because I was still sitting in committee when he called me about the interaction. Chris Hayes: How do you think about your faith and how it informs what you do? And particularly in a time when certain forms of Christian faith, including, you know, the Amy Coney Barrett, who went to your same school. She’s Catholic, so it’s a little different. But so much of the presence of pious Christian faith, devoted Christian faith in public life is coded with conservative republicanism and increasingly support for Trump. Rep. Crockett: Yeah. You know, I think that it is great because a lot of times people try to act like Democrats are the Antichrist. And so then I’m like, my daddy’s a preacher. Go look him up, you know. And so I think that it allows me to engage in the conversations and really be a good representation for what actually a lot of black folk are. I mean, when you think about politics and advocacy in general, so much of it was born out of black church.  And it really is centered to the core of who we are. It’s how we were able to get so much. I mean, when you think about the leaders, whether you’re talking about Martin Luther King, who comes from more of the traditional Baptist background, or whether you’re talking about Malcolm X, who comes from the Muslim faith, it always for black folks somehow, our leadership came directly out of the church for moving us forward. And I don’t ever want that to be lost at all. And I think that, you know, there are those that are trying to get us back into finding our voice and our leaders in black church. And my pastor is absolutely one of those. Freddie Haynes is very well known throughout the country because he is an activist and I like to call him a throwback preacher. But when somebody tries to, quote, unquote, “out Christian me,” it’s a little tough when you’re coming at me like that. And I think that what we see out of this Christian nationalism movement is probably what I would imagine those Christians who justified slavery to have been. Those are those kind of people. And I don’t think that they love the same Jesus that I love. I think that tolerance and respect and compassion and empathy is who my faith instructs me to be. I don’t have to agree with you to love you, respect you. And I think that I can bring more people to Jesus by how I live. And so, you know, even when it comes to working together, I say a lot of times, I’m like, listen, if you want to do good by the people, I’m down. I don’t really care if you’re MAGA, if you’re just a general Republican or otherwise, I want to do the work and I can work with anybody. And I know that we will definitely disagree on tons of things, but where we don’t disagree, I don’t hate you. I hate your ways. I hate some of your policies, but I really am a very loving person.  And, you know, for me to get angry enough that I needed to prove a point with the Marjorie Taylor Greene situation, you know, that’s not what I want to happen on a daily basis at all because I don’t think name calling gets us anywhere. And I’d rather build relationships and open hearts and get them to kind of start to be the Christians they proclaim to be than to engage in kind of that level of back and forth. Chris Hayes: Representative Jasmine Crockett is the representative for Texas’s 30th congressional district. She’s serving her first term after one term in the Texas State House. She’s a civil rights attorney and criminal attorney. That was fantastic, Congresswoman. Thank you so much. Rep. Crockett: Thank you, Chris. Chris Hayes: Once again, great thanks to Representative Crockett. I learned a ton. I still can’t get over the fact that she and Amy Coney Barrett went to the same small Christian school for college.

The Top 10 reasons Joe Biden should (and shouldn’t) step aside,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/top-10-reasons-joe-biden-2024-election-trump-rcna160907,"Democrats hoping to keep Donald Trump from returning to power currently have a handful of options, each of which carry a significant amount of risk. The party is largely united on the basics — the presumptive Republican nominee poses an extraordinary risk to democracy and the future of the American experiment — but divided on how best to move forward. There’s no shortage of relevant questions Democratic officials, donors, insiders and voters are confronting right now, but at the heart of the matter is a straightforward line of inquiry: Is President Joe Biden the best option for the Democratic ticket in 2024? If the answer is “yes,” the least risky thing the party can do right now is simply stay the course and stick to the status quo. If the answer is “no,” then Democrats might have a narrow window of opportunity to improve their chances. So, what’s the correct answer? I have plenty of opinions on the matter, though I’ll concede that both camps have made credible arguments in the wake of Biden’s dreadful debate performance 12 days ago. In fact, while organizing my thoughts on the matter, I managed to pull together two contradictory Top 10 lists — one making the case for the Democratic incumbent to pass the torch, and another making the opposite case. Let’s start with the pro-Biden case. 1. If you want to defeat Trump, it makes sense to nominate someone with experience defeating Trump. 2. Biden has an impressive record of success that warrants a second term. 3. Biden’s ideas, goals and priorities enjoy broad public support, which seems like a relevant detail in a national campaign. 4. Post-debate polling has been discouraging, but his support hasn’t completely collapsed, and his current deficit is hardly overwhelming. 5. Biden easily won nearly all of his party’s presidential primaries and caucuses, and it would be undemocratic (and arguably un-Democratic) to discard those results. 6. There are legal and procedural measures in place that make it extremely difficult to replace Biden on the ticket. 7. Removing an incumbent president, four months before Election Day, would signal to the public that Democrats are in a state of chaos and disarray. 8. The intra-party fight over replacing Biden would be divisive and tumultuous at a time when Democrats want and need to be focusing their political fire at the GOP ticket. 9. Plenty of experienced observers and political professionals are convinced that voters simply won’t re-elect Biden given the circumstances, but their assessments have been wrong before — remember when the “Access Hollywood” tape was supposed to doom Trump’s candidacy? — and the whole idea of political “deal-breakers” is probably overdue for a reassessment. 10. It’s simply too late in the process for a new candidate to vet and choose a new running mate, while launching a national organization. And then there’s the case against Biden. 1. The incumbent president was struggling in the 2024 race before his debate failure, and now things are worse. What’s more, Biden is the first Democratic candidate in the 21st century to be trailing at this stage in the race. 2. Public opinion research has been consistent for quite a while: Most voters believe Biden, who'll turn 82 in the fall, is too old. In fact, a New York Times/Siena poll conducted after the debate found that 74% of the country sees the Democrat as “too old to be an effective president.” In campaigns, some problems are relatively easy to fix. The fact that Biden, if re-elected, would turn 86 in his second term isn’t easily cast aside, and denying the problem won’t make it go away. 3. Polling averages suggest Biden’s approval rating is down to nearly 37%. When was the last time an incumbent president won a second term with an approval rating this low at this stage in the process? Never. Since the dawn of modern American polling, it’s simply never happened. 4. Neither Biden nor his team have articulated a compelling strategy to help turn things around. 5. Biden excelled four years ago, not by barnstorming the country, unveiling an exciting new agenda, and being an inspirational voice, but by leveraging his relationships and years of experience. In 2024, however, with Trump’s lead growing, Biden’s skills are incompatible with what his party needs to prevail. 6. Republicans desperately want Biden to remain atop his party’s ticket, and given the stakes, it’s folly for Democrats to give the GOP what it wants. 7. The Democratic plan for 2024 was to turn the race into a referendum on Trump. As Biden struggles, it’s quickly become a choice between two unpopular candidates. Similarly, the more the president’s age becomes the centerpiece of the cycle, the less oxygen there is for everything else, including Trump's and his party's many vulnerabilities. 8. A Biden defeat wouldn’t just cost Democrats the White House: The party’s latest polls suggest the president’s difficulties are on track to create a drag on the party’s down-ballot candidates, making it nearly impossible for Democrats to take control of Congress. 9. The Democrats’ problem appears to be largely Biden-specific: In key states, the president is running behind his own party’s other statewide candidates. It suggests Democrats could still excel in this cycle with a new candidate that voters might get excited about. 10. There’s reason to believe things will get worse: Biden’s campaign has already invested millions of dollars in battleground state ads, in the hopes of moving the needle. It hasn’t worked. (Another part of the strategy was the early debate, and that didn’t work, either.) Trump, meanwhile, has narrowed the financial playing field, and will soon start competing in states where Biden has had the airwaves largely to himself. Which case will prevail? Watch this space."
The stakes for antitrust with Timothy Wu: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/stakes-antitrust-timothy-wu-podcast-transcript-rcna160877,"We’re sharing another episode in our WITHpod 2024: The Stakes series, in which we choose specific areas of policy and talk to an expert about Trump and Biden’s records on the topic. We couldn’t think of a better person than our guest this week to help unpack the two candidates’ stances on antitrust. Timothy Wu is the Julius Silver professor of law, science and technology at Columbia University. He’s known as the “architect” of the Biden administration’s competition and antitrust policies. Wu joins WITHpod to discuss Trump and Biden’s different views on corporate power, the current antitrust landscape, major mergers being challenged this year and more. This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Timothy Wu: You know, in some ways, President Biden noticed and learned from the fact that Trump had noticed something. People were mad. But, you know, there’s some ways we disagreed with the Trump administration. We certainly disagreed with the corrupt way it was done. But we also noticed that they had their finger on something that the Democrats were kind of ignoring, which was the rise of corporate power was making a lot of Americans very angry. Chris Hayes: Hello, welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Well, we’re back for another edition of our recurring series this year “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes,” in which we take a look at the records of the two previous presidents, well, the current president, the previous president, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who are running against each other. It’s the first time we’ve had this setup of two incumbents facing off in anyone’s lifetime. It’s a rare thing. Usually in presidential elections, you’ve got to speculate about, you know, what’s this young senator from Illinois going to do as president of the United States or this former governor from Massachusetts? In this case, no speculation required. Obviously, the future is unwritten and things can change, but we do have solid records of both of these individuals as president and what they did. So we’re taking specific policy areas. And this week, a policy area that is, I think, a little off the radar, although occasionally pops in the headlines. For instance, recently a headline in “The New York Times” and “Dealbook” that reads the following, “U.S. clears way for antitrust inquiries into NVIDIA, Microsoft and OpenAI. It’s news the Justice Department, the FTC are teaming up to investigate the AI industry, particularly those three companies, NVIDIA, Microsoft and OpenAI, to see whether they are in violation of antitrust law.” The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are the two main entities of the federal government that investigate antitrust. And you’ve seen more and more headlines about this in recent years because the Biden administration has been one of the most active antitrust administrations in recent memory, definitely in decades. You may have seen the news about Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which are the sort of huge concert venue enterprise of Live Nation and the ticket enterprise of Ticketmaster, which combined, which has led to a lot of headaches for consumers. That’s being challenged and investigated by the Biden administration.  And so I thought antitrust would be a fascinating place to turn our attention on “The Stakes,” partly because this is something that I’ve talked about a little bit over the course of this series. When you’re talking about domestic legislative policy, it’s contingent on Congress to a great degree, right. What kind of laws you pass and sign into law. And we’ve done stuff on that. We have definitely looked at, for instance, taxes was one of our “WITHpod: Stakes” conversations. We looked at taxes and taxes are, you know, set by Congress and then the president signs it. There’s things you can do in the sort of administrative side with the IRS. Antitrust is really interesting because it’s really in the executive domain. You don’t really have to depend on Congress that much. And so it’s a place where presidential prerogatives are kind of at their height. And so I thought it would be great to compare the antitrust records of these two presidents. And so I thought there’s no one better to have this conversation about antitrust with than Timothy Wu. Timothy Wu is the Julius Silver professor of Law, Science and Technology at Columbia University. He’s a public intellectual as well as a legal academic. He’s written on a variety of topics, including books that I think are some of the best books on sort of tech, monopoly, tech culture capitalism. I’ve read “The Attention Merchants” and “Master Switch,” which are particularly excellent. Tim’s been on the program before, so he thinks about this. He’s been studying this and thinking about it for literally decades and also was a practitioner. He actually went into the Biden administration and in the Biden administration was known as one of the key architects of the competition antitrust policies. So he has a sort of inside outside perspective on this. Tim, it’s great to have you in the program. Timothy Wu: It’s great to be back. Chris Hayes: So when we’ve done other topics in this series where we compare the records of Donald Trump and President Biden in their time in office, I think the issue set itself has been a little more self-evident than competition policy and antitrust, which is slightly more obscure. So what I want to sort of just start out with is a kind of one on one about antitrust competition policy. Like, what is it? What are the major tools that a given president has to pursue it before we get into any type of sort of comparative look at the two? Timothy Wu: Yeah, no, that’s a great question. Well, you know, just starting at the basics, it’s the antitrust progressive era policy that I kind of think is almost like the private version of constitutional law. It’s sort of ultimate checks on corporate power and monopoly. It’s a big economic lever. I think the president, in some sense, using antitrust is deciding how concentrated or unconcentrated the economy is going to be by who they appoint. You know, it’s the big difference between a merger friendly and non-merger friendly administration, and also basically how the big monopolists are treated, I think, differs. Is it like monopolies are our friends are going to solve all our problems or, you know, is it more like we’ve got to break these guys up or have some control over them? You know, that’s at the sort of the biggest 10,000 foot view. Chris Hayes: And there’s sort of two places that this really comes into play, as my understanding, which is the Department of Justice, which can pursue lawsuits, right, backed by the U.S. government to break up companies or to stop mergers and the Federal Trade Commission, right. Is that fair to say those are the two main areas where this policy is enacted? Timothy Wu: I’d say yes. But in my time in the White House, one of the things we made a major effort to do was to put the presidency a little more forward and central in the question of announcing what the policy should be. And also we tried to recruit. We created something called the White House Competition Council that tried to involve all the other agencies that have authority. Chris Hayes: Interesting. Timothy Wu: Yeah. And one of the good examples, Department of Transportation. So we got, you know, Secretary Pete involved and said, roughly, you know, you’ve got to be a little harder on the airplanes here and, you know, not just let them merge whenever they want and like shrink streets. You know, things have gone too far in the airline industry. We got the Pentagon, the Department of Defense got more involved in mergers. They ended up blocking a major missile merger that would have combined like the last two missile producers. Yeah. So, more technically would have allowed the bigger (ph) producer to own the engine maker. But we tried very hard in the Biden administration to say, you know, it can’t just be about a bunch of lawyers sitting in Justice and FTC and their economists kind of making these huge decisions. The presidency, at some level, popular opinion has to play a little more of a role here. Chris Hayes: So let’s also sketch a little bit. Let’s do a little bit of the history of antitrust, because I think you need that background in order to kind of appreciate where we are right now and particularly appreciate how much the Biden administration has done or attempted to do and even in some ways the break that Trump represented from his predecessors because I think there’s a real intellectual and ideological movement, political movement. So the birth of antitrust is industrial capitalism in the 19th century. Tell us a little bit about just the origins of the both intellectual and policy regimes of antitrust.  Timothy Wu: Yeah, the origins are sort of mixed very closely with the Gilded Age and the birth of a new form of business, the monopoly trust. So late 19th century, you see for the first time companies that have something like the power of countries or, you know, just an unrivaled level of power and wealth, much greater than anything that I’ve ever seen before in a private enterprise. You know, Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, men like J.P. Morgan, John Rockefeller and the public. And during that time, particularly workers, farmers and some consumers, felt like, you know, this is terrifying. We’ve seen something new in the United States, inequality. This is kind of a much more, particularly in the north, obviously, much more even handed sort of small business kind of country, what’s going on here? And, you know, these have seemed to have no limits on their power and are really changing America in fundamental ways.  So the antitrust movement, late 19th and early 20th century, was an effort to change the structure of the U.S. economy, break up the monopolies and create much more limits on their power. Probably Louis Brandeis, one of the most famous figures involved during this period. Theodore Roosevelt brings the first big cases and they are successful. They do restructure the U.S. economy. We don’t accept monopolization of every sector. There’s a big difference here between the course taken by the United States and other industrialized countries, particularly Japan and Germany, which were much more comfortable with the concentration of their industrial economies. So, yeah, that’s the origins. And it has a sort of progressive populist origin that I think matters because from the early days it was tied to public fear of giant monopolies. Chris Hayes: And my understanding is that the logic as articulated by Brandeis and Teddy Roosevelt and the progressive crusaders for trust busting was sort of twofold. There was an economic logic and there was a political logic. So the economic logic was the basic idea that when competition goes away, prices for consumers go up and you get all sorts of inefficiencies. Monopolies can essentially exert total price control. And if you have vertical monopolies like Standard Oil, which owned railroads and distribution and oil, and they can basically charge whatever they want. And then there’s a political argument that any private entity that gets big and concentrated enough is going to pose some kind of fundamental threat to liberty, as we understand it, which is akin to the constitutional structure argument you were making before, that this is a means of restraining private power in the same way that divided government and checks and balances restrains public power. Is that a fair way to talk about the two?  Timothy Wu: Yes, very fair. I think that Theodore Roosevelt and Louis Brandeis and Woodrow Wilson, those figures were very explicit about the sense that monopoly was a danger to democracy, and Brandeis said this a lot, sort of the American character. Brandeis once said, you know, the question is not whether U.S. Steel is efficient or not, it’s whether it’s consistent with a country in which people want to be free. And they had a very visceral sense that there was extraordinary incompatibility with companies that are as powerful, more powerful than political actors that have extraordinary influence over the political system, like who’s really in charge. So I think that was much more of a factor then than now. You know, to go on a little bit, Theodore Roosevelt, when he launched his first big case against J.P. Morgan. In a letter, he wrote, he said, you know, the people want to know who runs this country and they want their, you know, their president and they want their government to stand up to powers greater than they are. So we have to bring this case. You know, I think he’s an okay guy, JPMorgan, but, you know, the people want this done. So there was that. If I can add one more thing, I think it was less about prices back then and more about, you know, small businesses, farmers, sort of regular Americans, their opportunities to start a business. Brandeis was very concerned that if everybody was an employee of a giant company, we’d all sort of be like a new version of serfdom. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: They were very worried more about that than like, oh, no, they’re going to raise the prices on milk or something. They’re worried about that. But I think they were more worried about these structural things. Chris Hayes: Right. So the structural idea is that, like, if you have a country where there’s two grocery chains, that like no one can start their own mom and pop grocer and that actually starting your own mom and pop grocer and having mom and pop grocers has some like small d democratic value. It’s this sort of entrepreneurial spirit. The fact that people can have kind of a stake in their own community, like all this kind of localism, small business. This was all heavily part of the ethos that was driving this intellectual movement. Timothy Wu: Yes, absolutely. And, you know, we should not neglect labor. Brandeis, to give him credit again, was very prescient in seeing these big businesses are just going to crush labor. I mean, actually, he saw it. He watched Carnegie Steel, you know, hire private armies and gunned down labor workers who were on strike. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: And he’s like, it’s one thing when it’s a, you know, business. But these businesses are so powerful that there’s no way labor can stand up to them either, even organized in union form. So, yeah, I think they’ve thought fundamentally about power and thought that you need the federal government as a countervailing power against entities of this size. I want to say those days, small business and unions were in much better terms. We can talk about that later, but, you know, they saw this as sort of everyone against the monopoly trust. Chris Hayes: Right. That’s a good point. So, this vision, I think it’s fair to say, you know, it’s not like every administration is the same. There are huge variations in the level of concentration they allow, which mergers they allow, which they go after, which companies they try to break up. But that general antitrust consensus, let’s call it, held until around the ‘70s when this new thinking about antitrust emerges, particularly coming from the late Robert Bork and the law and economics movement that’s coming out of the University of Chicago associated with Richard Posner, among other others. Tell us about that sort of challenge to the old consensus of antitrust. Timothy Wu: Yeah, there’s a big turn in the starts of the ‘60s, but becomes politically effective in the ‘70s and ‘80s, particularly after the election of Ronald Reagan. And the intellectual component suggests that the government’s gone too far, that we shouldn’t fear big business, but we should understand the efficiencies possible in big business. And the overriding presumption is Chicago, a very kind of laissez faire school that if business is doing something, it’s probably for a good reason. That’s kind of the intellectual. We’ve been too suspicious. And so, you know, if they have this highly vertically integrated corporate structure, it’s probably for a reason that isn’t fully understood, but it’s probably efficient. And the kind of core of it was this new idea called the consumer welfare standard, which said, you know, the antitrust laws shouldn’t be concerned with democracy, shouldn’t be concerned about power or bigness or, you know, labor relations or unions. They should be concerned just about the question of prices. It’s a very economic, microeconomic focus. Is this merger clearly going to make prices higher? Has this monopoly abused its power such to increase prices? And if you can’t prove that, you don’t have a case. Chris Hayes: And that standard leads to a new regime of antitrust from Reagan. I think it’s fair to say through Obama, although I’m curious if you think so, where that’s the kind of default operating conditions, this sort of consumer welfare standard. We’re not worried about like, do we have enough small business mom and pop grocer entrepreneurs? Are we worried about bigness, qua-bigness and its role in the political economy of American democracy? We’re not interested necessarily in these labor questions. Really, it’s a purely economic question, which is, A, let’s default to the economic logic of these firms that we are assuming making self-interested decisions in favor of efficiency. And two, we’re going to analyze whether we think there’s a likelihood of this ending up in price hikes for consumers. And if it’s not, then we’re basically not going to get involved. Timothy Wu: Yes, I think that’s exactly the right summary. Chicago School of Antitrust is, one way or another, the dominant school of thought from the ‘80s, and I would date it to the end of the first Obama term. So, you know, there’s variations and the Democrats are a little more likely to bring cases than the Republicans. But, you know, a good example is a switch between the George W. Bush and the Obama administration, which, you know, in many ways seem like a watershed. But in antitrust, nothing happened for the first four years, you know, that Obama appointed people who were, I guess, slightly more inclined to bring cases. But the ideology was more important than the personnel at that point. And, you know, jumping ahead a little bit, the Obama administration didn’t stop any mergers either. Larry Summers was in the White House, very critical of antitrust, didn’t really believe in it at all. So there’s some of that. But, you know, ideologically, I think things only really started to shift at all late in the Obama administration and then only slightly. Chris Hayes: Okay. I mean, I don’t think you can overstate this. Like, it’s almost a Copernican revolution that takes place intellectually, like the degree to which the Bork-Posner law and economics use Chicago view of this, which was a challenge to the old consensus becomes a new consensus. You almost can’t overstate it. I mean, it is what antitrust law is. It’s what is taught in schools. It’s like you learn the consumer welfare standard. It is the corpus of antitrust law that people learn as the as what we do now, right? Timothy Wu: Yes. You know, maybe not in my class as much. Chris Hayes: Right. Yes.  Timothy Wu: But it’s no question it became absolutely ideologically dominant. The older concerns about power, democracy, workers, farmers, small business were seen and almost targeted as out of date, obsolete, backward looking. I want to say a thought crime. And many of this, even the statutes were kind of excised from the collective memory. You know, there are entire statutes designed to protect small business like the Robinson-Patman Act. And so strong is the ideological hold that no one will enforce them. It was a famous conference where someone showed up at a discussion of the Robinson-Patman Act in a clown outfit. He just showed up and he said in a clown outfit, you know, this statute is like an imaginary creature and doesn’t work. And if you read the antitrust case books from the ‘90s and onwards, they have a little brief section on the early days, but then they skipped the price theory pretty quick. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: So there’s a kind of counterrevolution represented by this school, Bork et al. And then a challenge to that really starts to form. You’re at the center of one of the people who I think is thinking in these new ways that’s kind of revived and furthered a vision of antitrust far more broad in its concerns and vision of what it’s there to do, right? Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think, you know, my myself, I was in the Obama administration first term in the Federal Trade Commission working on enforcement, and I think that was a radicalizing experience. Great people, very hardworking, but there was not a merger that we could find a problem with. You know, they would work really hard. They would do the numbers. It was incredibly, you know, this weird way you can be inside an institution and everyone inside is working hard, so you’re satisfied. You’re not lazy, but you’re not actually doing anything.  And we didn’t stop. I mean, it’s egregious some of the things we let go. That’s when Facebook bought Instagram and we let Google buy Waze. We let Zillow buy Trulia, and before me, we had just let Ticketmaster buy Live Nation. You know, this stuff was pretty much merger to monopoly. Like, it’s hard to know how we got to this position. But even the Democratic administration, that was a very radicalizing period for myself. Chris Hayes: And one of the things that’s also happening during this period, and there are different empirical metrics by which this might be measured, but a lot of concentration happens during the period in which the antitrust consensus shifts to letting mergers happen, to allowing concentration, except in totally extreme circumstances. I mean, it’s striking to me the other day, it is amazing to me, you know, Barry Lynn, who wrote this book, “Cornered,” opens with this amazing anecdote about the pet food when there was like, I think about a decade ago or so where there was a pet food factory in China that was producing pet food that was making pets sick and had to be recalled. And the recall was across like every single brand of pet food, more or less, because it turned out that like the amount of concentration of pet food is like there were very few actual distinct companies making pet food. There were a bunch of brands that are all been integrated into the same company. You find this out. The other day I walked over to get to my local Walgreens, which is now Dwayne Reed Walgreens. And I was like, wait, I thought those were like the last two, I mean, CVS, but the last two left now. Now they’re the same? You know, Zillow, Trulia, like there has been an enormous amount of concentration, right? We’re not imagining that over the last several decades. Timothy Wu: No, not at all. I think that, you know, across industries, you see this pattern of everything going down to, you know, two or three big guys, maybe four big guys. Some of the industry is very dramatically affected. Our hospitals is a very good example where you across the country, you see and maybe listeners experience this, like what used to be three or four hospitals in a town become like one hospital. Chris Hayes: Yep. Timothy Wu: Airlines merged down. I already talked about Live Nation, Ticketmaster. Ticketing becomes a monopoly. Broadband, the cable companies merged together. There’s a few little challenges here or there, but basically it was what called the green light era for antitrust or conversely the, you know, the winter for antitrust law enforcement. And, you know, a bunch of us started to wonder, you know, what was going on. There were always a number of people who were questioning of the Reagan view, but they’d been pushed to the side and treated as like weirdos and ostracized and not given government positions. Guys like Bert Foer, Frank Foer’s father, he kind of was carrying the flame. But, you know, took some Barry Lynn. I give him a lot of credit. You know, he wrote this book in, I guess, ‘08t or so, “Cornered” saying, like, what’s going on here? He wasn’t even a lawyer. He just like had noticed everything. I got into this. Zephyr Teachout and I ran a political campaign. We ran for lieutenant governor against Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul, and we made antitrust a big part of our campaign. And, you know, on the campaign trail, people were like, yeah, why the hell is our hospital merged? You know, what’s going on here? Why is my broadband provider, you know, hiking my rates? There’s no competition. So we got a lot of traction for that. Lina Khan was part of that campaign. She was our advisor. So there’s this like small group of people. There’s other names I probably should mention, but relatively small kind of dissenting groups who start to think like we have gone terribly wrong here somewhere. Chris Hayes: And we should say Lina Khan is the head of the FTC now under the Biden administration, had been at Yale Law and was also one of the people writing in this space about this sort of reviving this view of antitrust, this broader view of what it was there to do and why it was important to enforce existing statutes. So all this set up now to talk about characterizing the Trump administration. Part of the reason I wanted to do this, this topic on “The Stakes,” which is this series we’re doing, “WITHpod 2024: The Stakes,” is I’m really trying not to like make this a hackish enterprise in which we tell you why Donald Trump is bad and Joe Biden is good, but we genuinely try to be like pretty clear eyed about like what the different priorities are. And I do think antitrust is a place where Donald Trump’s legacy is interesting and kind of complicated for the Trump administration. How would you describe it? What would be your top lines to characterize the Trump administration’s antitrust policy? Timothy Wu: If you don’t mind going personal to being in the Obama, I was in the Obama White House the very end of it. And, you know, the campaign was ongoing and we started to realize we had a problem. You know, the economy was consolidated. The White House had done all these own studies about inequality and there was a little like, what the hell happened here over eight years? We let the economy get a little too unfair here. And in its own way, I think Trump has, whatever you want to say about the guy, he has political instincts. And, you know, he noticed that a lot of Americans were also angry about the economy and the sense that, you know, a couple of big companies on the east and west coast seem to have more power than seem fair. So I would characterize him. I’ll say two or three things. I think he is a populist and I think he has, to his credit, an instinct for what the public fears and is concerned about when it comes to big business. It’s often expressed in very strange ways, you know, like somehow immigrants are running these companies or whatever or -- Chris Hayes: Right, globalist elite.  Timothy Wu: Yeah. Or sometimes again, anti-Semitic in weird ways, although now that’s gotten more complicated, but whatever. So, he has his finger on that. And one thing that Trump did is he broke the sort of total freeze on antitrust cases. He refused to hire people who would just sit there and do nothing. So it was a break from the George W. Bush administration, which did almost nothing, very close to nothing. But on the other hand -- Chris Hayes: Yes, what’s on the other hand? Timothy Wu: -- like many Trump things, the whole enterprise was idiosyncratic and personal and seemed to have a lot to do with who his enemies were and who his friends were. So, you know, during the Trump administration, it started to feel like, well, you go in to see Trump to see if your merger is going to get approved or not. Chris Hayes: Yes.  Timothy Wu: You know, this was the impression. And some of the mergers that seemed obviously illegal were nonetheless approved. A good example is a Sprint T-Mobile, you know, two phone companies who have merged and since then raised prices. Chris Hayes: Shocker. Timothy Wu: You know (ph), it’s shocking. It was obvious to anyone that that would happen. But, you know, they seem somehow to have special regard for them. In fact, his head of the Justice Department negotiated a deal. He got involved in negotiating the deal between them. He got involved -- Chris Hayes: The attorney general?  Timothy Wu: No, not the attorney general, the head of the antitrust division. All this stuff came out about his texts as he was like trying to broker a deal. Very inappropriate to like try to make -- Chris Hayes: While being the head of the antitrust? Timothy Wu: Yeah. He used his position of examining the merger to set merger conditions and broker a deal and have them give assets to another company. The whole thing was terrible. Yeah, the whole thing was terrible. Chris Hayes: Wow. Timothy Wu: Yes. Chris Hayes: And there was some reporting to suggest that I think, I forget which of those companies was held at large part held by SoftBank, right? Timothy Wu: Yeah, that’s right. Sprint. Chris Hayes: Sprint was held by SoftBank and the owner of SoftBank, I believe, was a Trump supporter. And there was some reporting to suggest that they were looked upon favorably for that reason.  Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think that there was a lot of smoke, how much fire there was. But, you know, I think there’s a lot of evidence. There was very much the question of favorites, you know, what’s this going to do for me and enemies? One of the first things that the Trump administration did was attack an AT&T Time Warner merger. You know, no one’s fully, completely proved that Trump ordered that merger. But of course, he hated Zucker, hated CNN, hated everything about Time Warner. Lo and behold, his enemies end up having their mergers challenged. His friends get their mergers appealed. So we kind of went from this do nothing kind of law, which was bad, to something which arguably is worse, which is the antitrust law is the cat’s paw of the king kind of situation. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Right. I want to stay on this for a second because I think people don’t quite appreciate how much this was the case, that there was a break with the ideological antecedents of conservative antitrust policy under Trump. No question. Timothy Wu: Yeah. Chris Hayes: It was far more activist. And yet it remains to be definitively determined how much this was the case. But there were indications, genuine bits of evidence, indications and a widespread perception amongst, I think, Fortune 500 corporate elite, that this was essentially if you were with Trump, if you were his friend, you can get the merger approved. And if you were his enemy, you’re going to have a problem. And that this became this kind of incredibly powerful, almost unilateral lever for Trump to wield against people he didn’t like. And in the most notorious case being, and I think it was somewhat surprising when the DOJ announced it would be blocking a proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger. There is some evidence to suggest that at least partly it was born of the animus Donald Trump had towards Jeff Zucker and CNN’s coverage of him. And to the extent that’s true. That’s pretty bad, right. Timothy Wu: Yeah, I used think it’s one of these things where Trump didn’t think there was any problem with it. Chris Hayes: No. Timothy Wu: I mean, I think -- Chris Hayes: He’s just like, oh, I can do that? Yeah. Timothy Wu: I think he thought it was fully within his rights to, you know, order breakup of any company he didn’t like. And I think his White House counsel sort of restrained or slightly done that. But there’s so much circumstantial evidence that the White House, the presidency were involved in antitrust decisions that it’s hard to sort of deny it. And, you know, over drinks, over beers in ways that can’t fully be reported that I hear it even more about it. You know, a good example, a good evidence came from a whistleblower at the DOJ, a guy named John Elias, who’s a friend. And, you know, he witnessed the attorney general, Bill Barr, asking or ordering that the antitrust officials to take a hard look at the marijuana industry and investigate their mergers. And anything else was going on, I guess, based on a personal animus against marijuana industry, cannabis industry. So, you know, it was it was up and down like this. And I think it became understood, as you said, that corporate executives understood that the antitrust law was something where you went to plead your case in the White House and to the president, if possible, you know, which is the opposite of what you would hope would happen in a real democracy. Chris Hayes: And we should be clear, too, that because we did recently a podcast on Project 2025, I think you said Trump didn’t see a problem with this. I think there are people around him, if we think about an ex-Trump administration, who basically think there’s no problem here. In fact, they think the problem is these bureaucrats as intermediaries that the executive is vested in the president. If the president wants to block an antitrust, he’s been empowered by the people to do that. And we don’t need all these civil servant bureaucrat nerds like Tim Wu and Lina Khan, all these people running these analyses to come up with some kind of even handed notion of the president could do what he wants. He wants to block mergers, he blocks mergers. He wants to say okay, it’s okay. He’s elected. Ultimately, he’s accountable to people. So I think there’s a view that like what we’re describing as like appalling and corrupt, you know, if confirmed, I think there are people on the other side who say that’s fine. Timothy Wu: Yeah, there are people who say it’s fine. There are people who see the Justice Department as a group of lawyers who are supposed to work directly for the president. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: You know, this is kind of a pre-Nixon view -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Timothy Wu: -- that they are the government, the president’s lawyers, and he can fire them if they don’t do what he says. So, you know, if he hates Jeff Bezos and wants to order his department to break up Amazon, well, you know, he was elected by the people and they know he’s a little bit hot-tempered. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: But that’s what they voted for. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: There is that position. I think, you know, maybe the risks are stating the obvious. It’s dangerous. I do think the president should have a role in staying policy, like maybe say big tech is a problem. But the idea that, you know, whoever donates more money to the presidency, you know, is safe seems to me obviously pretty dangerous to democracy, too. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: Just in terms of the Trump record, there’s the Sprint T-Mobile, which they allow, DOJ blocks the AT&T-Time Warner, which ends up having huge ramifications because then there’s subsequently another merger that does go through and has changed the media landscape in important ways. In the last year, there’s actions against Google and Facebook, and again, I think both of those. kind of like the AT&T-Time Warner. could be justified in the merits as good antitrust enforcement and also were colored by a perception that this was part of a broader animus against big tech, which he felt had betrayed him. Timothy Wu: Yes, I think that’s right. And that’s the problem with having a personality driven antitrust law. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: Yeah. You know, you want people to trust in the rule of law, not in the rule of men. Let’s put it that way. Chris Hayes: And one more thing about the Trump administration seems important to me is that all the things we’re talking about are coming out of the Department of Justice. There’s an antitrust division at the Department of Justice. There’s also the Federal Trade Commission, FTC. That’s where you worked in the first Obama administration. They also have tasked competition policy. They can bring actions on mergers and things like that.  My understanding is that the FTC, unlike the DOJ, which was more activist than its predecessors, although arguably in ways that raise suspicion, the FTC was pretty silent during the Trump years and didn’t do a ton. Timothy Wu: Yes, that’s right, other than the Facebook case. The FTC did break up Facebook. So they didn’t do nothing. Sorry to -- Chris Hayes: All right, that. Good point. Timothy Wu: Can I say another thing about the Trump years? Many, you know, experience in the White House is when you look carefully at most things the Trump administration did, there was a big difference between the facade and then like what was behind the scenes. You know, it was often like going to a Hollywood film set where you notice that just the front is there. Chris Hayes: Right. Timothy Wu: And the front in the in the Trump antitrust enforcement was the big case against Google, the big case against AT&T-Time Warner, and the big case against Facebook, sort of big celebrity defendants. But behind the scenes, there was a lot not happening. Like it was sort of --  Chris Hayes: Interesting. Timothy Wu: Yeah. And a good example, really one of the most troubling was a great reduction in the criminal investigation of cartels. So, you know, price fixing cartels are criminally enforced. And this is when people get together in smoke filled room, old school style and say, all right, let’s raise the price of wheat or something or, you know, this component you never heard of. And it’s not famous companies or anything like that. Well, for whatever reasons, during the Trump administration, behind the scenes, criminal enforcement cartels went way down. And, you know, maybe the guys he appointed just like were kind of like him. On the one hand, wanted to say and make a big splash. But the other hand, were quietly like letting business have what they want. A lot of much lower profile mergers were passed on, even troubling ones and they’re including a bunch of Defense Department stuff, you know, all the kind of slightly less visible kind of corrupt feeling industries. They seem to get all their mergers through. So, you know, telecom and defense, those kind of things. So I just want to say at the core was this highly lax attitude, which was sort of masked by a high profile side to it. It didn’t go deep. It did not go deep is what I want to say. Chris Hayes: That’s a great summary. So that brings us to the Biden administration -- Timothy Wu: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- which I think is really quite a break with its predecessor and with predecessors in Democratic administrations and you have first person account. You were brought into the White House, right, in a White House position to sort of oversee and advise on anti-competition policy. He appointed Lina Khan, who is, you know, one of the most outspoken intellectuals, writers, theorists of this kind of new antitrust in the country, arguably, which is a huge deal, and business hated it and fought it. So, what is the Biden administration’s antitrust vision and implementation been like? Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think there was a conscious explicit decision by the president to go back to FDR and Theodore Roosevelt and Brandeis style antitrust to revive progressive era antitrust, new deal antitrust, and make it as it once was, oriented less towards prices, more towards small business workers, and this question of corporate power. So there was there was a major turn. The president himself blessed this. He gave a speech announcing that we are going back to the FDR style doing things. You know, we pitched the president on this. The president said, you know, what are we going to do to make the economy fair again? But, you know, in some ways, President Biden noticed and learned from the fact that that Trump had noticed something. People were mad. But, you know, there’s some ways we disagreed with the Trump administration. We certainly disagree with the corrupt way it was done. But we also noticed that they had they had their finger on something that the Democrats were kind of ignoring, which was the rise of corporate power was making a lot of Americans very angry.  And so, you know, Biden comes in, gives this big speech, writes an executive order, creates the White House Competition Council. He then appoints Lina and also Jonathan Cantor, who is a figure, very pro enforcement figure. And, you know, we wanted to make not a little adjustment like the Obama administration or Clinton, but to turn the ship 90 degrees. And, you know, I think we’ve had some success. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Tell me about some of the cases and some of the areas where you can point to that success. Timothy Wu: Yeah, I think a big one, not always in the headlines, is this merger and consolidation policy. Jonathan Cantor, Lina Kahn have blocked over 40 mergers already. Chris Hayes: Wow. Timothy Wu: They’ve challenged some big ones. Stuff that happened during Trump or during Obama is not happening. I think it’s a totally different atmosphere if you talk to people on Wall Street about what it, you know, trying to get them trying to merge the monopoly looks like. You know, it’s not like Facebook’s trying to buy TikTok or anything like that. It’s a totally different story. I think it was clear in the 2010s, particularly in tech, they felt they could just buy any competitor and that would be the answer. So I think merger environment has changed. If you talk to anyone on Wall Street, they’ll agree with that. And another big thing, very visible, is we have broadened the attack on big tech and the effort to sort of, you know, have a reckoning with the power of big tech. So there’s a lawsuit against Facebook seeking dissolution, which we restarted. We have had a trial against Google. The verdict will be coming out soon.  Chris Hayes: And that’s on its ad pricing?  Timothy Wu: No, this is on the deal with Apple to prevent Apple from going into search. Chris Hayes: All right.  Timothy Wu: And in exchange, take $20 billion a year. That’s a short form of it. So this kind of, you know, deal to keep Apple and other competitors of a search in exchange for money. Lawsuit against Amazon. Lawsuit against Apple. That’s basically almost every company in big tech. And those are, you know, big old style, you know, Theodore Roosevelt style antitrust suits. Chris Hayes: And those are coming out of DOJ? Timothy Wu: And Federal Trade Commission, a mix. Chris Hayes: Okay. Cool. Timothy Wu: They kind of divide them up. You know, in the federal government itself, I mentioned earlier we founded the Competition Council. So every six months, all of the secretaries or heads of agencies who have something to do with competition policy come in front of the president and like, what have you done lately? What are you doing to kind of move the economy? And I think it’s had some big results. If you haven’t noticed, the Department of Transportation is finally being a little harder on the airline industry after essentially being in some version of their bedroom for the last 40 years. The Defense Department has finally started to think that it might need more than one person building some of our most important defense equipment, including missiles and airplanes and other things. Chris Hayes: That’s such an interesting area, too, right? Because you’re talking to go back to Trump about the sort of these kind of celebrity defendants, right? So the idea of like, if you bring some big actions against companies, everyone knows and their faces with every day. And that’s, you know, that’s true in Biden as well. Amazon, Apple. But a huge part of the economy is happening within companies that you’re not necessarily thinking about or interfacing with every day. Timothy Wu: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And that’s particularly true about weapons and the provision of like no consumer buys missiles. There’s only one entity that’s going to buy missiles here in the United States. And that’s the Department of Defense. It is the sole purchaser. Timothy Wu: Yes. Chris Hayes: And so the question of how diversified do you want this sort of military industrial base to be? Do we need more than one company providing our missiles? Should there be three or four? It just exists in a totally different universe than consumer goods. Timothy Wu: That’s right. And it’s pretty dangerous, I guess, should say to have just one company for anything truly essential. And also, then they charge whatever they want. Chris Hayes: Right. Yeah. Timothy Wu: I mean, the cost of American taxpayers, hundreds of billions of dollars when you have single source contracts. I mean, the numbers are crazy in defense. The difference in the Biden administration is we went deep. We spent a lot of attention on the little stuff that doesn’t make the headlines, but, frankly, has billion dollar price tags, whether it’s in defense, whether transportation, the shipping industry. We got very concerned with trains, blocked train merger. A lot of stuff is, as I said, not going to make a lot of headlines. The effort to break up Ticketmaster, Live Nation, which launched just a few weeks ago, is high profile, but we didn’t just want to make this a show and a dance. Chris Hayes: Tim Wu is a Julius Silver professor of Law, Science and Technology at Columbia University. He’s the author of a bunch of books, all of which I’ve read that I’ve recommend. And he’s known as one of the chief architects of the Biden administration’s competition antitrust policies. Tim, it’s great having the program. Timothy Wu: Pleasure. It’s great. Thanks a lot. Chris Hayes: Once again, great thanks to Timothy Wu. He really is one of my favorite public intellectuals. I think he’s just an incredible writer and thinker. And his books are great. I really highly recommend them. You can e-mail us at withpod@gmail.com. Get in touch with us using the #WITHpod. Search for us on TikTok by searching WITHpod.

Jon Stewart’s ‘told you so’ about Biden was the scolding we needed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jon-stewart-tried-warn-us-joe-biden-rcna160914,"Monday night, “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart power-washed, rinsed and then blow-dried advocates of President Joe Biden who have tried to spin his abysmal debate performance against former President Donald Trump as just an off night, or no big deal, or insignificant given the magnitude of the authoritarian apocalypse that may loom ahead. It was a well-earned victory lap for Stewart who’d been roundly criticized, including by me, for some of his routines about Biden’s age and fitness for office.  “Get on board or shut the f--- up,” Stewart demurred Monday, “is not a particularly pro-democracy bumper sticker.” “For a campaign based on honesty and decency,” he opined, “the spin about the debate appears to be blatant bulls---.” And if Stewart seemed more animated than usual, then, again, perhaps he was impelled by (justified) indignation at his critics. Back in February, Stewart endured his very own digital rinse at the hands of Mary Trump, Keith Olberman, assorted internet randos and, yes, this writer right here. The claim — our claim — was clear: Dude, now’s not the time for symmetrical yucks, or bothsidesism. Train your comedic flamethrower on the unambiguous orange threat to our democracy. Or, make a d--- joke. Those are funny. Do that! And stop, we implored him, stop! likening Biden to Colonel Butters, an oldster who seems to inadvertently shamble onto the set of a 1970s sitcom.  Monday, an  agitated Stewart bristled at the notion that by criticizing Biden he was “enabling facism.” He mocked Biden’s resigned response to ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that if Trump wins, he’ll console himself as having done his best.  After showing a clip of Biden saying, “As long I gave it my all and I did the goodest job that I know I can do. That’s what this is about.” Stewart responded angrily: “THAT’S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT!” Riding that rage, Stewart fumed: “There are no participation trophies in end-game democracy.” He dutifully reminded his audience that Democrats could work this all out at, let’s say, a convention. In a place like Chicago, perhaps? In like, six weeks maybe? While there, the Dems could reflect upon their options after, for example, visiting the restaurant featured in the FX series “The Bear.”  In the flurry, Stewart clarified “I am not saying Biden should drop out; [but] can’t we open up the conversation?” That sounds reasonable to me. So here we are. In retrospect, Stewart was likely correct to light up Biden a few months back. He did so not in the name of bothsidesism, but to warn his viewers of a serious vulnerability, a vulnerability Republicans and their comms people were already pouncing on. Comedy isn’t always “correct” or” factually true.” Actually, it rarely is, and we wouldn’t like it if it aspired to be so. But in this case it was and, though damning for some of us, Stewart is vindicated as having tried to warn America about a Biden weakness we were trying not to see."
Biden's doctor says neurologist's White House visits were not for the president,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 9:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-neurologist-white-house-parkinsons-rcna160839,"Hours after a White House press briefing turned combative over questions about a neurologist's repeated visits to the White House, President Joe Biden's physician said that those appointments were not related to the president. In a letter released by the White House on Monday night, Kevin O'Connor, the president's physician, said Biden has only been examined by Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders and Parkinson's disease, in each of his three annual physicals and on no other occasions: O'Connor's letter was released after a testy White House press briefing earlier that day in which White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped questions about Cannard’s repeated visits to the White House. Several news outlets reported that visitor logs showed Cannard visiting the White House eight times in eight months. Jean-Pierre said she could not confirm details about Cannard's visits due to “security reasons.” But she denied that Biden was being treated for Parkinson's disease or that he is taking medication for it. Cannard did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, and the White House subsequently issued a statement that a “variety of specialists from the Walter Reed system visit the White House complex to treat the thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds.” Biden's last annual physical was in February. In his report at the time, O'Connor deemed the president ""a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male"" who is fit to serve in office, but did not mention an evaluation of Biden's cognitive ability. At the time, Jean-Pierre said Biden's doctors determined he did not need a cognitive test. It’s unclear if such an evaluation, on its own, is adequate to assess whether a person is fit for office. Biden himself has recently dismissed the idea of taking such a test. In an interview with ABC News last Friday, he said his duties as president are, in themselves, a test of his mental acuity. “Not only am I campaigning, I’m running the world,” Biden said.   Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have ""aced"" a recent cognitive test, though his campaign has yet to make public any such results. Biden, already struggling with voters’ concerns about his age, has faced immense pressure from his party since his poor debate showing in late June. The president has remained defiant about staying in the race, saying he believes he’s still the best person to defeat Trump. Congressional Republicans have sought to capitalize on the discussion about Biden’s age and mental fitness. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, whose impeachment inquiry into the president has largely fizzled out, asked O’Connor to appear for an interview about the president and has attempted to connect him to Biden’s relatives."

The margin grows to 6 points with third-party candidates in the mix. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * The same poll, however, found incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leading Republican Eric Hovde in Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race by 5 points. (Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * A variety of Democratic senators continue to appear quite skeptical of Biden’s electoral future, including Sen. Patty Murray, a member of Democratic leadership and the chair of the Appropriations Committee. The Washington state Democrat said in a statement that despite her “strong respect” for the president, “we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job.” Murray added, “At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.” * On a related note, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, went public yesterday with his belief that Biden should abandon his re-election bid. * Trump told Fox News last night that he has delayed his running mate announcement because he’s waiting to see whether Biden will remain his opponent. “You know, we wanted to see what they’re doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,” the Republican said, referring to Democrats. * In Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race, Republican David McCormick claims to have created “hundreds of jobs” in Pittsburgh. The evidence suggests otherwise. * And in Arizona, failed Senate candidate Blake Masters is now running for the U.S. House and keeps suggesting that he enjoys Trump’s support — despite the fact that Trump endorsed his primary rival, Abe Hamadeh. Politico reported that Team Trump has reportedly contacted Masters “to urge the Arizona Republican to pull or change ads that falsely or incorrectly imply that he has Trump’s endorsement in his congressional campaign.”"
"Zelenskyy, U.S. allies bristle at the prospect of Trump’s return",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 8:10 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/zelenskyy-us-allies-bristle-prospect-trumps-return-rcna160868,"For Democratic officials and voters, this is a time of extraordinary anxiety. Donald Trump appears to be the worst presidential candidate imaginable, but he’s nevertheless winning the 2024 race — and his advantage is growing. The prospect of the felonious Republican wielding power alongside a far-right Congress and radicalized Supreme Court is very real. The intensifying fears, however, are not limited to the United States. As NATO leaders prepare to meet in Washington this week, NBC News reported that Trump’s possible return is “casting a shadow over the summit.” Officials from U.S. partners are keenly aware of the fact that the former president, if returned to power, could endanger the future of the alliance, among other radical departures. After all, as a report by The New York Times reminded readers overnight, “Mr. Trump once declared NATO ‘obsolete,’ threatened to exit the alliance and more recently said he would let the Russians do ‘whatever the hell they want’ to any member country he deemed to be insufficiently contributing to the alliance.” A Politico report added that U.S. allies in NATO want President Joe Biden to win another term, but they no longer believe that’s likely to happen, fueling international fears. But as concerned as NATO members are about the future of American leadership, unease in Kyiv is at a whole other level. The Times reported over the weekend: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to Bloomberg News last week, for example, and was rather candid about his fears. “If there are risks to Ukrainian independence, if we lose statehood — we want to be ready for this, we want to know,” the Ukrainian leader said. “We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S. or will be all alone.” “If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,” Zelenskyy added. That said, it’d be an overstatement to suggest every prominent foreign official is fearful about Trump’s possible second term. The Times’ report added that Russia’s Vladimir Putin recently delivered public remarks and “seemed to relish the prospect of Mr. Trump’s return.” Imagine that."
Why Trump keeps demanding credit for Biden’s insulin breakthrough,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 7:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-keeps-demanding-credit-bidens-insulin-breakthrough-rcna160858,"It’s not a secret that Donald Trump spends a great deal of time watching television, which means he occasionally sees Democratic campaign ads — many of which note President Joe Biden’s accomplishments. If I had to guess, I’d say the former president saw just such an ad yesterday afternoon, leading to this item by way of his social media platform: If the message sounded at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. About a month ago, the presumptive Republican nominee published this item, insisting, “Low INSULIN PRICING was gotten for millions of Americans by me.” He added that the Democratic incumbent “had NOTHING to do with it.” Soon after, during the first presidential debate of the 2024 cycle, Biden briefly referenced his success in making insulin more affordable. Trump was outraged. “I’m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors,” the former president claimed. “I took care of the seniors.” The day after the debate, Trump held a rally in Virginia and repeated the lie. “I was the one that got you the inexpensive [insulin], not him,” the Republican said, adding, “I did the insulin!” Even by Trump standards, this is pretty weird. Indeed, while the GOP candidate clearly hopes to score a few campaign points, especially with seniors, the truth is unambiguous, whether the former president understands it or not. In reality, it’s true that Trump said he would address insulin costs while in office, but he didn’t. The issue then fell to Biden, who signed the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act — which included the policy on insulin costs. As a result, American consumers are benefiting from a policy that caps the cost of insulin at $35. Complicating matters, Trump isn’t just claiming credit for one of Biden’s accomplishments, he’s also planning to undo the Inflation Reduction Act, which would necessarily mean the end of the price caps that the Republican is falsely attributing to himself. It doesn’t help that the former president might not know what insulin even is. At an event four years ago, for example, the then-Republican president said, “I don’t use insulin. Should I be? Huh? I never thought about it. But I know a lot of people are very badly affected, right? Unbelievable.” To this day, I still don’t know what point he was trying to communicate. Nevertheless, the issue has returned to the fore in an unexpected way, and Trump’s rhetoric is plainly bonkers. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
The far-right House Freedom Caucus continues to shrink,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/far-right-house-freedom-caucus-continues-shrink-rcna160840,"As the current Congress got underway, members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus probably felt a degree of optimism about their power and influence. The radical faction was largely unified; it had relatively specific ambitions; and thanks to then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s desperation, Freedom Caucus members were positioned to have an impact. A year and a half later, the far-right contingent hasn’t just failed to secure any accomplishments, it’s also shrinking. A year ago this week, for example, members of the group agreed to oust Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia from the Freedom Caucus. It was the first time the faction had ever chosen to kick out one of its members. But it wasn’t the last time. Republican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas was reportedly pushed out of the conservative group earlier this year because he hadn’t attended enough caucus meetings. Soon after, the Freedom Caucus voted to remove then-Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, too, because of his willingness to occasionally break with party orthodoxy. More recently, Republican Rep. Bob Good of Virginia — the chair of the House Freedom Caucus — narrowly lost his re-election bid, coming up short in a GOP primary. Though there will apparently be a recount, if the certified results hold, it means the contingent’s top leader will soon no longer be in Congress. This week, the Freedom Caucus’ roster grew even smaller. Politico reported: But wait, there’s more: Axios reported that Rep. Troy Nehls didn’t approve of the way the group ousted Davidson, so he quit, too. “I will continue to support their conservative agenda, I just won’t be a member,” the Texas Republican said. Some might be tempted to argue that the Freedom Caucus will be better off with members who are more closely aligned, but on Capitol Hill, there’s strength in numbers — and right now, the far-right faction’s membership list is moving in the wrong direction. If recent history is any guide, this is usually around the time the faction’s members do something dramatic to remind the political world of their relevance. Watch this space.

"The new Republican platform is special, but not in a good way",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 9, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-republican-platform-special-not-good-way-rcna160824,"The fact that the Republican National Committee has written a platform suggests the party has finally cleared a low bar. It was, after all, just four years ago when the RNC — for the first time since 1856 — skipped the platform-writing process altogether and instead declared that it simply wanted whatever Donald Trump said he wanted. With this in mind, the fact that Republicans actually bothered to write down their principles, priorities, values and goals certainly looks like progress — at least until one actually reads the document the party produced. USA Today’s Rex Huppke made the case that the Republicans’ new platform reads as if it were generated “by an authoritarian-leaning AI that was fed a Trump rally transcript.” What, specifically, makes the Republican platform so extraordinary? Let us count the ways. The preamble: Before the blueprint begins in earnest, there’s a preamble, spanning nearly three pages, which appears to have been written by Trump himself. It’s filled with vapid, all-caps, bumper-sticker-style declarations, featuring a combination of vague goals and proposals that President Joe Biden has already delivered. The contents: Some of the reporting about the new RNC blueprint has suggested that it was made deliberately more “moderate” than some far-right partisans preferred. Don’t believe it. As American Bridge’s Brandon Weathersby summarized in a statement, “The Republican National Committee platform is one of the most extreme party platforms ever in the history of modern presidential elections.” From immigration to education, taxes to law enforcement, there should be no doubt that this assessment is correct. The omissions: Hoping to avoid campaign-season attacks, the Republican platform no longer calls for federal prohibitions against abortion and same-sex marriage, but as the editorial board of The Washington Post summarized, “The former president wants the 2024 GOP platform to be anodyne, but don’t be fooled. He has an extreme agenda.” The language: It was hard not to notice that the new Republican platform condemns “Christian-hating Communists,” which is a phrase with a deeply ugly history. The length: The party’s platform in 2016 was nearly 60 pages. There were some reports indicating that this total, at Trump’s insistence, would be cut in half. Those reports understated matters: The actual text of the 2024 platform spans roughly 10 pages — reinforcing the fact that the contemporary Republican Party just isn’t serious about governing and policymaking. The process: While Republicans have spent decades crafting the party’s platform in public, this year, the process was moved behind closed doors. Even more incredibly, Politico published this report on the way in which the platform was approved: “Representatives from Trump’s campaign walked around the room with a ‘vote yes’ sign as voice votes were being held. ... One RNC member who was present inquired about why staff of the Trump campaign and RNC were taking photographs of delegates as they voted.” For now, the document is still a draft platform: As NBC News reported, the blueprint “still must get approval from the full Republican National Committee.” Watch this space."
