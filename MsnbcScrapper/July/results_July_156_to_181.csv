Unfortunately, Earth being hot is nothing new: Our planet has seen over 550 consecutive months with temperatures above the 20th-century average. A run of all-time temperature records, including over a year of months registering record heat, is unusual, perplexing and worrying.” * In Iowa: “An Iowa law banning most abortions in the state will take effect Monday, roughly one year after Gov. Kim Reynolds signed it.” * A story worth watching: “Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is pushing for the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether Elon Musk’s X improperly prevented users from following an official presidential campaign account for Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday.” * A worthwhile effort that won’t pass: “Democratic senators plan to introduce legislation Tuesday that would effectively overturn a Supreme Court ruling last month that imposed new limits on federal agencies when they issue regulations about a wide variety of issues, including the environment and consumer protection.” * A case I’d kept an eye on: “A defamation suit against Fox News by a government official who served on a short-lived U.S. government media disinformation board was dismissed Monday by a federal judge. The lawsuit from Nina Jankowicz alleged that Fox News had defamed her on numerous occasions, leading to waves of online attacks and threats of violence after the formation of the Disinformation Governance Board, where she served as a director.” See you tomorrow."
Trump creates new uncertainty about possible debate with Harris,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:49 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-uncertainty-debate-kamala-harris-election-2024-abc-rcna163310,"Donald Trump spent the better part of a year begging for a debate against President Joe Biden. The former Republican president worked from the assumption that he’d fare well against the Democratic incumbent — and as it turned out, Biden’s stumbles during his showdown with Trump were so significant that they helped push him from the 2024 race. In theory, there’s no need to dramatically alter the schedule, since the GOP nominee can simply debate Vice President Kamala Harris instead of Biden. In practice, it’s proving to be a bit more complicated than that. A few hours after the incumbent president ended his re-election bid, Trump published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC News in September. He apparently has a problem with that: The Republican called the network “fake”; he deliberately misspelled George Stephanopoulos’ name in a juvenile way; and he concluded, “I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.” Soon after, Politico reported, “One GOP source tells me he doubts Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris — he’ll likely call her an illegitimate candidate.” Trump doubled down on his original message shortly after midnight this morning, again attacking the network. “ABC Fake News is such a joke, among the absolute WORST in the business,” the former president wrote adding that ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” It’s a far cry from the “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE” message Trump pushed while pleading for a debate with Biden. This afternoon, however, the Republican nominee participated in a press call and said he’s “absolutely” prepared to debate Harris — more than once — though he’s “not thrilled” about ABC hosting the event. As part of the same comments, Trump told reporters, “Well, I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden. But I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different.” So, which is it? Will Trump face off against Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, or not? One possibility is the former president is scared of the Californian and looking for excuses to bow out. Another possibility is that Trump is engaging in a mind-numbing “work the refs” exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff. Either way, the Republican appears a lot less eager to share a stage with the incumbent vice president than he did with Biden."
Black men backing Kamala Harris fuel another fundraising spree,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-win-with-black-men-fundraising-rcna163280,"Thousands of Black men joined a virtual conference Monday night to fundraise for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, according to the event's organizers. The massive turnout helped dispel toxic myths about Black men’s willingness to back a woman candidate.  The event was hosted by “Win With Black Men,” a collective of organizers modeled after “Win With Black Women,” the activist group that held its own, massive Zoom call to fundraise for Harris on Sunday.  Journalist Roland Martin; activists Michael Blake, Khalil Thompson and Quentin James; and political commentator Bakari Sellers hosted the men's conference. Sellers gave a passionate endorsement of Harris while explaining how she was one of the first people to call him when his baby daughter was very ill. In various corners of social media, there’s been speculation — fueled by social media chatter and, in part, by conservatives who are hardly authorities on Black voters — that Black men will largely be averse to voting for Harris because she's a Black woman. Similarly offensive suggestions were made about Black men in Georgia’s 2022 gubernatorial election when Stacey Abrams was on the ballot in a rematch against Republican incumbent Brian Kemp, but those speculations never came to fruition. And Monday was a powerful show of Black men’s broad support for the Harris campaign. A “Win With Black Men” organizer reported more than 53,000 Black men joined the virtual event on Monday and raised $1.3 million in four hours. The organizers say half of that will go to the Harris campaign, and half will go to organizations that specialize in mobilizing Black men to vote. MSNBC hasn’t independently verified the fundraising numbers. The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. The energy surrounding the event was palpable enough to inspire organizers to commit to similar, pro-Harris conferences geared toward other demos — like white women.  There was an array of speakers at this virtual conference, including actors Don Cheadle and Bill Bellamy; comedian Bill Bellamy; Democratic lawmakers Raphael Warnock, the senator from Georgia, and Maxwell Frost, the congressman from Florida; faith leaders Bishop William Barber, Pastor Jamal Bryant, and the Rev. Mark Thompson; Mayors Brandon Scott of Baltimore and Brandon Johnson of Chicago; as well as labor leaders and community organizers.  But the message was essentially the same from all of the speakers: They may be men, but they aren’t MAGA men who want to be conscripted into Donald Trump's hypermasculine crusades. Speakers took turns bigging up Harris’ leadership qualities, dispelling myths about Harris’ prosecutorial record in California, encouraging Black men voters to reject racist and sexist attacks on Harris, and calling on viewers of the conference to reach out to other Black men who may feel disaffected by the political system and may be considering not voting.  For all the breathless talk in the media and online about Black men allegedly swinging in Trump’s favor this election cycle, Monday’s meetup underscored the political reality: There are many Black men — like there are many Black women — firmly in Harris’ corner. And they're putting their money where their mouth is, adding what's already been a massive fundraising haul for Harris in the first few days of her campaign.

Biden ends 2024 ticket saga with 'Game of Thrones' finale,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:38 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/harris-biden-game-of-thrones-2024-rcna163206,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 22 episode of ""The ReidOut."" If you live long enough and observe politics long enough, you’re liable to see some amazing things. Over the weekend, political observers, journalists and historians got to witness one of them.   It was an event in the style of a ""Game of Thrones"" finale: a clash between two of the most powerful figures in modern political history, Nancy Pelosi — arguably the most effective House speaker of the modern era and the current speaker emerita — and Joe Biden, the president of the United States. Pelosi, who ceded the leadership of the House Democratic caucus to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries more than a year ago, led what could be described as a political coup d’etat against Biden, whose performance in a debate three weeks ago literally sent his party into an existential panic. A panic that became the fixation of the media, and a cause among rich Democratic donors, op-ed writers, thought leaders and elected Democrats on Capitol Hill. Collectively they came to see Biden as a liability, not just for the general election against Donald Trump, but their own re-election chances as well. The increasingly vocal and urgent calls for Biden to step aside and make way for a younger candidate who could more effectively take the fight to Trump divided the party along racial lines, with Black and Latino members seeing a deeper play at work — to oust not just Biden but Harris, too. As the fury inside the party heated up, Democratic donors began to make the money dry up, threatening not to put another penny into the race until Biden was no longer the nominee. Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Hakeem Leader Jeffries appeared to let it become public that the party believed Biden should go — Olenna Tyrell-style: “I want him to know it was me.” Over the weekend, as Biden recovered from Covid, holed up in his Delaware home with his family and close friends around, came the coup de grace. Biden’s closest aides shared catastrophic internal polling with him and first lady Jill Biden that showed a certain defeat in November, not just for Biden but for Democrats down ticket, too. And so, Biden relented, putting his country before his ambition and announcing he would no longer seek a second term. The Pelosi coup had succeeded. But Biden — a man who has been in politics since he was 29 years old as a senator and committee chairman, a two-term vice president, and the president of the United States, a man who has endured excruciating and repeated personal loss and tragedy and allowed it to fuel his determination to save the soul of this country — had one more card to play. Less than a half hour after he announced his withdrawal, Biden exercised what in many ways is the greatest power any leader has: the power to choose your own successor. Biden bypassed the rumored wishes of the Pelosi and donor crew and fully endorsed his historic vice president to be the Democratic nominee. He threw his support behind Harris, the would-be first woman, first Black woman, and first Asian American president, on the very day state party delegations were meeting to work out the votes in the upcoming Democratic convention. The Biden endorsement sent a lightning bolt through American politics, unlike anything I’ve seen since then-Sen. Barack Obama made his debut at the 2004 Democratic Convention, prompting Oprah Winfrey to declare him “the one.” The Biden nod prompted state parties and over 200 Democratic lawmakers, one by one, to follow their president’s lead and endorse Harris. As did the various governors whose names have been tossed around as possible rivals for the nomination. As each one endorsed her, they effectively took their names off the list of competitors, allowing Harris to bask in the glow of a captivated media and unbelievable, record-breaking fundraising. Almost exactly 24 hours after Biden’s announcement, Pelosi also fell in line, giving her full-throated endorsement to Harris. In other words, Joe Biden, at what looked like his moment of greatest political weakness, reasserted himself as the leader of his party, from his sick bed. He checkmated the former speaker's gambit by writing the epilogue to his own legacy in the history books: Her name is Kamala Harris, first of her name.

Trump's choice of JD Vance suddenly seems a lot riskier,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jd-vance-catastrophic-kamala-harris-rcna163199,        
We studied attacks on women candidates. Nobody got it worse than Kamala Harris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 12:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-racist-sexist-attacks-disinformation-rcna163265,"On Sunday, when President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, I already knew what vitriol would be unleashed against her online.  Four years ago, I led a study investigating gendered abuse and disinformation against female political candidates. Over two months, we found 336,000 pieces of abuse or disinformation targeting just 13 candidates across six social media platforms. Whether Democrat or Republican, young or old, urban or rural, these women were subjected to sex-based falsehoods and hate that their male counterparts weren’t. Of all the abuse and disinformation that we identified, 78 percent targeted Harris, then a U.S. senator from California seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Why? In part, because she was a high-profile woman running for the highest office in the land. But Harris is not only a woman; she is a Black, South Asian woman. Across our dataset and other research in the space, it is clear that women of color and other intersectional identities receive more abuse, and more vitriolic abuse, than their white counterparts. In 2020, we observed three groups of abusive or false content targeting Harris. In the minutes after President Joe Biden’s endorsement, and the days since, such content has again flourished across social media. The most prevalent were sexualized narratives falsely claiming that Harris had “slept her way to the top” because she had a relationship with California politician Willie Brown in the 1990s. The relationship, which was not a secret and occurred long after Brown had separated from his wife, ended eight years before Harris sought elected office. This narrative includes the use of graphic, misogynistic keywords and nicknames. It also includes image-based abuse, “cheap faking” Harris into lingerie and suggestive positions. The most prominent deep fake pornography website also hosts more than 10 pages of videos that insert the vice president into pornography. The intent of this content is clear: to humiliate Harris and undermine her credibility and fitness for office. In our 2020 study, we found that users engaging with this disinformation and abuse were more likely to engage with other abuse and disinformation about Harris.  And there is plenty. Harris’ detractors promote transphobic disinformation, which is frequently employed against women in positions of power. In 2020, users claimed Harris couldn’t possibly have risen to prominence without having secretly been a man. They edited photos of her to make her appear more masculine, and QAnon conspiracy theorists even created an elaborate backstory about her past life. Those narratives have surfaced again this week, along with racist allegations, claiming Harris is not eligible for the presidency because her parents were immigrants. Now, as in 2020, users frequently claim Harris isn’t Black enough or Indian enough to claim those identities. Our foreign adversaries are watching and happily exploiting American misogyny and racism to their own advantage. The same false, gendered and sexualized narratives that Americans engaged with in 2020 were reflected in Russian propaganda outlets as well. One Russian state media outlet, Zvezda, wrote in 2020: “Kamala claims to be the descendant of oppressed African Americans, but how many slaves did her great-grandfather have? How did having an affair at work help her advance her career?”  Other Russian outlets also made a mockery of the Biden administration’s attempt to create a diverse administration, describing these attempts as “the smirk of political correctness” and “quotas for women and colored people.” As diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts have become a lightning rod for the American right wing, Republicans are echoing that narrative and claiming that Harris is a “DEI” candidate, ignoring her track record as a district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president. It’s important to label these lies for what they are: an attempt to undermine a powerful woman’s decades of public service because of her gender, her ethnic background and her skin color. Sadly, Harris’ experience is not unique: By virtue of simply being women in public life, female politicians across the political spectrum are subjected to vile gender-based hate, lies and even violent threats. This isn’t “just part of the job” because the job looks entirely different if you happen to be a man. Let’s be frank: The Republican Party, which appears to be scandalized by a consensual relationship that Harris had over 30 years ago, seems not to care one iota about its nominee’s multiple affairs, credible allegations of sexual misconduct assault, or a jury finding him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll.  Harris’ candidacy and the abuse that targets her offer women of all political stripes a warning. Gendered disinformation and abuse — which happen on both sides of the political spectrum — undermine women’s participation in public life. They dissuade generations of young women, who may not want to face such hate, from seeking public office.  But her candidacy also offers us hope. If Democratic and Republican women both condemn the gendered and sexualized attacks against Harris, then we would send a powerful message that there is no place for misogyny in American politics and chart a course toward equal representation. A Harris administration won’t end the online abuse of women overnight, but it will deflate its perceived power. Online misogynists are loud and ugly, but they are outnumbered, and they can’t stop progress. "
"Following jury’s verdict, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez to resign",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 11:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jurys-verdict-democratic-sen-bob-menendez-resign-rcna163295,"A week after a jury found Sen. Bob Menendez guilty on 16 corruption counts, it was clear that the New Jersey Democrat’s future was bleak. Indeed, the question wasn’t whether the senator would resign, but when. The answer has now come into focus. NBC News reported: The longtime senator didn’t have much of a choice. Senate Republicans have been silent, but Senate Democrats have been firm in arguing that Menendez needs to step down. Some, including Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, raised the prospect of expelling their criminal colleague if he failed to resign. Now, evidently, that won’t be necessary. The developments mark an extraordinary fall from grace for the once-powerful chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Revisiting our earlier coverage, federal prosecutors first indicted Menendez in late September, alleging that the New Jersey Democrat received “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in bribes and used his influence to benefit the Egyptian government, among others. Though the senator has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty in court, it was difficult to deny the seriousness of the allegations. According to the Justice Department, Menendez received cash, gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low- or no-show job and a luxury vehicle. Complicating matters, the longtime lawmaker struggled to present much of a public defense. Roughly three weeks later, the senator was indicted again, and those charges accused him of providing sensitive information to the Egyptian government in exchange for bribes. What’s more, prosecutors alleged that Menendez acted as a foreign agent while serving as the chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That was in October. In January, the incumbent lawmaker faced another round of criminal allegations, with prosecutors claiming he took improper actions in support of Qatar as recently as 2021 and 2022. In March, Menendez confronted still more charges, alleging that he and his wife conspired to obstruct justice. It was against this backdrop that the Justice Department — the one that Republicans claim is targeting the White House’s opponents — successfully prosecuted the Democratic lawmaker ahead of his re-election bid. As for Menendez’s seat, Democratic Rep. Andy Kim already appears well positioned to win this year’s Senate race in the Garden State. In the interim, The New York Times reports that New Jersey’s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, is expected to appoint a replacement who would serve until January. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Kamala Harris has a lot of VP options. She should choose Josh Shapiro.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 10:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-josh-shapiro-vp-pennsylvania-rcna163093,"Now that President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, it seems increasingly likely that Harris will be the party’s choice to run against former President Donald Trump in November.  After all, a wave of endorsements immediately flooded in. The Clintons, John Kerry, 32 senators and 181 House Democrats quickly voiced their support. Given these endorsements and Harris’ ability to swiftly incorporate Biden’s campaign infrastructure, she’s the clear front-runner for the nomination at the August convention. As Harris solidifies her position, attention turns to her potential running mate. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro stands out as a compelling choice, bringing political acumen, intelligence and relevant skills to the ticket.  Despite his relatively short tenure as governor, Shapiro has already made significant strides. He demonstrated interstate cooperation by partnering with New Jersey to form a task force strengthening labor law enforcement and worker protections. This showcases his ability to collaborate across state lines to achieve progressive goals.  As attorney general of Pennsylvania, Shapiro rooted out sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Combine his background in fighting for survivors of sexual abuse with Harris’ background as a prosecutor protecting victims of sex crimes, and the choice between the Democratic ticket and one headlined by Trump, a sexual predator, is a stark one for voters. Shapiro’s initiatives in Pennsylvania have not only bolstered his popularity but also solidified his standing as a leader capable of bridging partisan divides. His approach to governance emphasizes practical solutions and effective communication, qualities that are increasingly valued in today’s polarized political landscape. Shapiro’s success in navigating complex policy issues — such as labor law enforcement and infrastructure projects — underscores his ability to deliver tangible results while maintaining broad public support.  Shapiro also has a skill the White House desperately needs right now: showcasing government achievements.  As we saw when Shapiro handled the I-95 bridge reconstruction this year, Shapiro knows how to show off the great work the government does. From the moment of destruction to completion, Shapiro documented the rebuild, effectively demonstrating how the government works for its people. This skill is crucial, considering recent polls indicate many voters are unaware of major legislative achievements of the Biden-Harris administration, like the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act.  Harris needs a political ally who is not only skilled in governance but also adept at communicating these achievements to the public. Politically, Shapiro brings advantages that could prove vital in securing the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.  While Biden’s 2020 win was great, his margins in key states like Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were narrow. Shapiro’s popularity in Pennsylvania could help secure this crucial swing state. A Quinnipiac University poll in January found Shapiro with a 59% approval rating, well ahead of the 40% approval rating Biden had in the same poll.  When he ran for governor in 2022, Shapiro won in Erie County by 15 percentage points, a key battleground for Democrats who won it twice in 2008 and 2012 with Obama. Erie County is a crucial battleground for the state, where turnout can be a make-or-break factor; just ask Hillary Clinton. If Democrats do not win these key Pennsylvania communities, they will struggle to win the state and consequently the White House. Shapiro’s successes in Pennsylvania can also be extrapolated to other swing states, like Michigan and Wisconsin.  Moreover, Shapiro has experience running against the radical MAGA movement; when he ran for governor, the Republican nominee, Doug Mastriano, was a right-wing fringe candidate who espoused wild conspiracy theories about chemtrails and vaccines. Shapiro was quick to defeat this MAGA-aligned candidate by focusing on kitchen table issues and uniting Pennsylvanians, leveraging his success in the attorney general’s office. A Harris-Shapiro ticket presents the best way for Democrats to win. It combines Harris’ federal experience and prosecutorial background with Shapiro’s proven track record in state governance and his ability to communicate government achievements effectively. This pairing has the potential to secure crucial swing states like Pennsylvania while also appealing to a broad spectrum of voters in Rust Belt states with similar political landscapes. The Harris campaign, by bringing in Shapiro, can effectively demonstrate how the government positively affects the lives of people in rural communities like Pennsylvania, thereby broadening the pro-working family message of the Biden-Harris administration.  As the Democratic Party looks to retain control of the White House, a Harris-Shapiro ticket would offer a blend of experience, youth and political savvy ready to pull off a historic victory that protects our democracy and ends the era of MAGA madness once and for all.  Kamala Harris must soon pick a running mate — one of the first major decisions of her 2024 presidential campaign. As part of our series on some of the top contenders, read the case for Andy Beshear here. "
The Kamala Harris veepstakes has no bad options,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 12:06 PM PDT / Updated July 23, 2024, 10:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-best-running-mate-candidates-rcna163054,"UPDATE (July 23, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET): Kamala Harris' presidential campaign has requested vetting materials from five potential vice presidential contenders, NBC News reported on Tuesday. After President Joe Biden announced that he’s ending his re-election campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, there’s speculation about whom Harris might pick as her running mate in the likely scenario that she wins the Democratic nomination. NBC News has a list of potential picks, all of whom bring something unique to the table. As I see it, none of the picks mentioned would be bad by any stretch of the imagination. But there are some who I think stand apart from the rest. Narratively speaking, Kelly might offer the most upside. He’s a former naval captain turned astronaut who made a foray into politics after his wife, then-Rep. Gabby Giffords, was severely wounded in a mass shooting in Arizona. He’s a popular senator from a crucial swing state that has been trending toward Democrats in recent years. He also has been a longtime Harris supporter, having endorsed her Senate candidacy in California in 2016. His military background and outspokenness on behalf of veterans give him credence among people who have served; he would counterbalance the presence of Sen. JD Vance, a Marine veteran, on Trump’s ticket; and he also would help undermine right-wing nonsense about diversity measures being a top issue plaguing the military. Furthermore, Kelly has been vocal on the matter of immigration — a salient political issue in his home state — and earlier this year denounced Trump’s successful effort to tank bipartisan immigration legislation. Shapiro is another popular governor of a potential swing state. His 2022 defeat of MAGA extremist Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania’s gubernatorial race showed that he’s unafraid of highlighting Trumpian attacks on democracy in plain speak, and he has shown charm and deftness in interviews that could further distinguish Harris’ ticket as the youthful and exuberant one relative to Trump’s old-fashioned authoritarianism. He would also be just the second Jewish vice presidential nominee, after Joe Lieberman, which could send a powerful message in response to the documented antisemitism within the MAGA movement. Cooper, who previously served as North Carolina’s attorney general, is about to be termed out but has maintained popularity in his state despite its trend toward Republicans in recent years. Despite the GOP’s efforts to curtail his powers as governor once he was elected, Cooper has shown an ability to achieve long-sought reform — like Medicaid expansion — in a state where Republicans control the legislature. Having Cooper on the ticket with Harris could give Democrats more confidence in competing for North Carolina, particularly if — as some have predicted — extremist-friendly candidates like Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, drive Democratic turnout. At 46 years old, Beshear is the youngest potential veep pick on my list of possibles. Like Harris and Shapiro, he served as his state’s attorney general before becoming governor. Beshear’s father was a governor, so he has a political lineage in Kentucky despite the state’s conservative leanings and has won elections over MAGA candidates while being a vocal supporter of abortion rights. It seems unlikely that having Beshear on the ticket would put Kentucky in play, but he has exhibited an ability to speak to white rural voters that could certainly help Harris in key battleground states."
What the Kamala Harris 'coconut tree' meme is all about,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-meme-rcna163177,"Just two days into Vice President Kamala Harris' run for the presidency and ""coconut tree"" memes have consumed the internet. “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” Harris says, laughing before she turns dead serious. “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.” The line is from Harris' speech at a White House event for Hispanic leaders in May 2023. In fact, the Republican National Committee's GOP War Room YouTube account may have been the first to isolate that moment from her speech, posting a clip of it that very same day in an apparent attempt to paint her in a negative light. The clip gained renewed attention over the past few months, and it had become a viral meme long before President Joe Biden’s debate performance or any sincere talk about his withdrawing from the race had begun. But the meme gained real momentum in the wake of the debate as the Democratic Party started to reckon with Biden's age and fitness for office. For younger people especially, the cynicism they reported around Biden's candidacy was suddenly replaced with a hope that someone else might take over the top of the ticket. Harris' emergence as a leading contender supercharged the meme, and thus you had people online earnestly admitting to being ""coconut-pilled."" I’ve previously questioned the Biden campaign’s attempt to engineer memes to appeal to voters. Harris is different from many politicians in that she seems innately meme-able — a nebulous quality that her presidential campaign is already capitalizing on. Part of why the coconut tree meme works is because it developed organically on the internet and coincided with Harris’ abrupt and historic rise to the current top of the Democratic presidential ticket. But its stratospheric ascent in recent weeks also comes with a risk of oversaturation, especially as other politicians try to get in on the joke. After Harris announced Sunday that she intended ""to earn"" and ""to win"" the nomination, some Democrats who rushed to endorse her referenced coconut trees in some way. Harris herself has not acknowledged the meme or tried to make a funny reference to it — a move that would almost certainly curdle its charm quickly."
"Old habits die hard: Even now, Trump can’t stop going after Biden",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/old-habits-die-hard-2016-election-trump-cant-stop-going-biden-rcna163266,"During the 2016 presidential election, it made sense for Donald Trump to go after Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state was, after all, his rival at the time, and over the course of the campaign, the two traded plenty of rhetorical shots. But after Election Day 2016 had come and gone, common sense suggested that the Republican would shift his attention. He’d won the race. Clinton had exited the stage, transitioned to retirement, and expressed no interest in pursuing office again. Trump had every reason to focus on governing, and no reason to target his former rival. He did it anyway — repeatedly. In fact, when Trump launched his 2020 re-election campaign, he devoted much of his speech to Clinton, despite the fact that she wasn’t running. With just weeks remaining before Election Day 2020, Trump not only pushed then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to uncover and release Clinton emails, he also lobbied then-Attorney General Bill Barr to prosecute Clinton for reasons unknown. (This was before the GOP pretended to care about the “weaponization” of federal law enforcement.) None of this made any sense — she was neither on the ballot nor on the campaign trail — but Trump couldn’t help himself. He’d invested so much time and effort into hating Clinton, he apparently found it impossible to end his offensive. And now it’s happening again. After President Joe Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the 2024 race, it stood to reason that Trump would curtail his attacks for a painfully obvious reason: The Democrat would no longer be his opponent. There was little to be gained from additional rhetorical barrages. But just as the Republican couldn’t shake his hatred for Clinton, as The New York Times reported, he’s still ranting about Biden, too. The GOP nominee responded to Biden’s news on Sunday with ugly tirades and conspiracy theories. It was in Trump’s interest to take the high road, but he apparently didn’t care. A day later, the former president kept going. “It’s a new day and Joe Biden doesn’t remember quitting the race yesterday!” he wrote to his social media platform on Monday morning. This morning, Trump offered more of the same. I won’t pretend to know what’s on the Republican’s mind, but if Democrats are lucky, he’ll keep up the anti-Biden hysterics indefinitely."
"As Biden stands down, spotlight turns to Trump’s age and fitness",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 8:25 AM PDT / Updated July 23, 2024, 9:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-spotlight-trumps-age-fitness-health-2024-election-rcna163226,"In the wake of last month’s presidential debate, much of the 2024 race shifted to questions about President Joe Biden’s age, health and fitness. Republicans wanted to speak of little else; Democrats fearing Biden’s electoral defeat felt compelled to go public with their concerns; and media professionals covered the conversation in granular detail. For some of Donald Trump’s detractors, this seemed wildly unfair. If the incumbent’s age and occasional difficulties are under the microscope, they asked, how is it that Biden’s rival is avoiding similar scrutiny? Isn’t the nearly-as-old Republican, who routinely seems unable to tell the difference between fiction and reality, equally deserving of the same questions? It was, and is, a fair point — and as a new Washington Post report makes clear, the spotlight is turning in ways the GOP nominee might not like. The Post’s report went on to note that Trump is “a 78-year-old with a history of heart disease and obesity,” who “has not shared any updated bloodwork results or other specific information during this campaign to help experts assess his ongoing medical risks.” To be sure, the Republican has long had a problem with transparency. He promised to release his tax returns, for example, and then went back on his word. His White House also abandoned public access to visitors’ logs. Team Trump was also less than forthcoming when it came to readouts of the then-president’s conversations with foreign leaders, and at times, those close to the Republican even tried to hide information about his golfing habits. But it’s Trump’s secrecy surrounding his health that’s relevant anew — not just because he’s now the oldest presidential nominee in American history, and not just because he’d turn 82 while in office if elected to a second term, but also because he was recently shot during an assassination attempt, and Trump and his team have been reluctant to share even basic details about the care he received after the incident. It's against this backdrop that the former president, just this morning, published an item to his social media platform that read, ""I don’t know who said it, or where it came from, perhaps the Radical Left, but I never discussed, or thought of, Jamie Dimon ... for Secretary of the Treasury."" It was just last month when Trump sat down for an interview with Bloomberg and said he'd consider JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary. I think we know how the political world would respond if this happened with Biden, which is all the more reason to take seriously questions about Trump's fitness. What's more, there’s no reason to assume these questions will go away as the new presidential race unfolds."
"Tuesday’s Campaign Round-Up, 7.23.24",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/tuesdays-campaign-72324-rcna163242,"Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country. * Two days into the new presidential race, a majority of pledged Democratic delegates have now endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. She has no rivals for the party’s 2024 nomination. * On a related note, the Democratic National Committee confirmed that the party will choose its presidential nominee in a virtual, online voting process by Aug. 7, which is two weeks from tomorrow. With this in mind, there’s a very good chance that Harris will choose a running mate next week. * In an extraordinary development, Harris’ new presidential campaign raised a whopping $81 million in the 24 hours following President Joe Biden’s decision to end his re-election bid. Not surprisingly, this smashed all previous records. * Speaking of fundraising, it turns out that none other than Donald Trump was a Harris donor — once in 2011, and then again in 2013. * I’d recommend taking preliminary polling with a grain of salt, but a new national survey from Quinnipiac University found Trump with a narrow, two-point lead over Harris, 49% to 47%.(Click the link for information on the survey’s methodology and margins of error.) * Harris has quickly embraced Biden’s campaign operation as her own, and the vice president asked Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign chair, to stay on and run her campaign. O’Malley Dillon accepted the role. * Biden is canceling scheduled campaign events, but he’s also promised to hit the trail in support of his party’s ticket. * What happens to the millions of dollars Biden raised for his campaign now that he’s passing the torch? Reuters had a good summary. * And during an appearance on CNN, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis was asked if he’s open to serving as Harris’ running mate. “Look, if they do the polling and it turns out they need a 49-year-old balding gay Jew from Boulder, Colorado, they’ve got my number,” the Democratic governor replied."
Biden’s Historic Exit,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 9:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-bidens-historic-exit-rcna163251,"A rocky few weeks for the Democrats culminated in Sunday’s extraordinary statement from President Joe Biden, announcing an end to his candidacy. , As he did so, he made space for the next generation of Democratic leaders, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to head the ticket. As the dust settles, former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri react to the president’s decision, and take stock of what’s next after Harris announced her intent to run and bring the party together to win.  Note: this is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Monday, July 22, about 9:00 a.m. on the East Coast. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m back here on a Monday with my co-pilot, Claire McCaskill. Oh my God, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, it’s really been something. We’re going to take a little time to talk about Joe Biden and how wonderful he is. But I just want to say, even though this has been an emotional roller coaster, I feel really blessed that I’ve had a front row seat. As somebody who loves politics and who is a major in political science, these are incredible times to live in. And -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- you know, I don’t know how all this is going to turn out, but, you know, I’m buckled in now and I’m ready for a wild ride because, you know, the first two loops on the roller coaster -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- are so big, but then it builds to the great big one at the end. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Claire McCaskill: I’m ready for the great big one. And I think it’s going to feel great getting to the top and fun sliding down the other way after we beat Donald Trump. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, I mean, yeah, that part of the roller coaster, I’m all down for. It is not even Labor Day, you know, because I know Labor Day is where you really buckle in to say like, okay, we’re inching up on the roller coaster and this is where it’s going to get crazy. But when we last spoke on this podcast on Friday, all eyes were on President Joe Biden and whether he’d decide to leave the race or stay in amid the deafening calls to rethink his candidacy. Claire McCaskill: And Sunday, yesterday, we all bore witness to this important next chapter of history. The president released a letter mid-afternoon announcing that, quote, “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.” Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I mean, it was stunning, right? Plus, I had talked to a lot of people at the White House on Saturday just to check in with you because I know how it is when you’re totally under siege and like all of a sudden all of your friends and all the people who wanted things for you for the last three and a half years just ghost you, right? So I wanted to check in and see how everybody was doing. And I don’t think people were misrepresenting the situation to me. I really think they thought there was no decision. He can’t speak. You know, he’s in Rehoboth. He’s recovering. People should not expect anything soon. I hope things get resolved one way or another. But there was no sense of certainty that this was going to come down on Sunday. And it didn’t even occur to me that the president could put out a piece of paper announcing this as opposed to doing a real statement. But let’s talk about why he felt the need to just go ahead and do it. I know Steve Ricchetti is really close aide, good friend of mine, I think a friend of yours too, Mike Donilon, been with him for decades and had them come to Rehoboth and talk this all through with them. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, on Saturday night. And I think the other thing that happened was there was internal polling that was done in the campaign. And I think that Ricchetti and Donilon had that data for the president on Saturday night and showed him in stark terms what was happening in the battleground states. Because there really are two races that are run, as you know very, very well, Jen. One is, yes, you want to get every vote in every state, but you have to get to 270 electoral votes. So the battleground states become dominant, especially in the closing months of the campaign. And I think when the president saw that not only had he had significant slippage with a large delta between the Senate candidates and his presidency on the ballot in the battleground states, that he was losing significant ground in states that we had considered safe -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- like New Jersey, like New Mexico, like Minnesota -- Jennifer Palmieri: Virginia, yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- like Virginia, like Colorado. These had gone from purplish-tinged to blue, really, since Barack Obama. And the fact that they were in play, I think that the culmination of all that data is what really showed him in very stark terms that what he had said, if he was shown that he could not win, he would stand aside. And I think that data told him that he could not win and so he did just that. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And the three of them sat up and wrote this letter. And just imagine how emotional that must have been for the three of them. You know, I always think in literary terms and I’m like, oh, that would be an incredible play, just that discussion, you know. And it’s something more symbolic than just a president stepping aside in this race. It is that generation, you know, the very beginning to the baby boomer generation, an older white man, being what he said he was going to be, the transition to a new generation. And not just giving way to a new candidate, giving way to a new generation, you know, a woman, a woman of color. As it feels the same way as you do, Claire, it’s a very big moment in American history and I feel lucky that we get to. I mean, some days I’m like, why do we have to live through all of this? But it is a remarkable thing to see. And I am proud of our party that unlike the Republican Party, not that there’s any comparison in any universe between Joe Biden’s, situation that he’s dealing with and Donald Trump, but still, we had a leader that was not up to the job and our party rose to the occasion and did something about it and had a leader who was, you know, was a true patriot and put his own concerns about his own future. And then even his legacy, although his legacy, I think, you know, has really been buoyed by this to do the right thing. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think his legacy will be legend in the history books at this point. Jennifer Palmieri: Legend. Claire McCaskill: It will be legend. Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, the vice president to the first black president, the president that picked a black woman as his vice president and then accomplished so much and then step aside. I mean, he’s going to be this incredible figure. Claire McCaskill: Yes. And I was proud of the fact that everyone, especially the leadership, took a day to not focus on the vice president, that most people that I watched on television and most of the statements I read and most of the traffic on social media was all about Joe Biden yesterday -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- which is appropriate. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It is appropriate. You know, I know, Jen, that a lot of us who reported accurately on what we saw at the debate have taken in a lot of negativity from a lot of Democrats who felt that we were being unfair to the president. I completely understand. I don’t discount those feelings and I get it. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It was not easy. It was really hard. But I do think it’s really important for people to realize that age was always an issue for Joe Biden. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: The debate didn’t make it an issue. It always registered in the polls. And the way that Joe Biden had to overcome that was with performance. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: It was his only path to the presidency for another four years, was to overcome the concerns that voters, not necessarily the voters that are all in living on X or Insta or any of the other TikTok, but for a whole lot of Americans, it was a wait and see. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And the debate crystallized those concerns in a way that really impacted how people were responding on polls and ultimately, I believe that was the tipping point. For those people who say accurately talking about an obvious problem in our presidential candidate is what caused this, then I got to tell you, maybe they need to think about that because what our party did was 180 degrees from what the Republican Party has done. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: The Republican Party has looked at unbelievable disqualifying flaws in a very messed up man and said, yeah, that’s our guy. Yeah, no -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- he’s a felon. No, he’s a serial adulterer. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: They’re all in. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I’m proud that our party had the courage to step up and talk about the obvious. And I’m even more proud, so proud that we elected Joe Biden in the first place -- Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Claire McCaskill: -- because there aren’t very many leaders that would have done what he did for his country. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. So, another thing I want to say is Jill Biden has come under a lot of criticism that I think has been unfair in the last few weeks. You know, this is something that happens. People don’t like what’s happening and they blame the wife. And her communications director put out a statement on her behalf last night that I think gave us a sense of what was really going on. Down to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose. She’s his biggest believer, champion, and always on his side. And that trusted way only a spouse of almost 50 years can be. She’s just been like a huge and she’ll continue to be a huge benefit, I think, campaigning, but just like an incredible support of an incredible first lady. So what do you think about Biden going forward, Claire, and what he can do in the campaign? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, really essential. You know, I think this is the way it’s going to game out. I think you’re going to see more and more people endorsing Kamala Harris and you’re going to see more and more delegations. A lot of them are meeting today. Some are meeting tomorrow. I think she will quickly amass the number of delegates she needs for the nomination. Then they’ve got to figure out how do you intersect needing to introduce her to the country with a biography and actually nominating her. But make no mistake about it. Joe Biden is going to be very important at the Democratic National Convention, celebrating him, honoring him, giving him the love and affection that we all feel for him, and also him signaling to the country the reasons why he selected Kamala Harris in the first place. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: He had a lot of choices for vice president. There were many that he could have chosen. And she is the one that got the nod. And I think he is very important in the campaign, really to build enthusiasm in the Democratic base. I don’t think he helps with that last two percent that we need in those battleground states. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: But frankly, right now, Jen, I do believe this race is turnout, turnout, turnout. I think it is getting our folks out. And that’s why this change at this moment has really injected jet fuel into what I believe will be one of the most robust turnout operations that our party has ever seen. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. One thing I would note that I think was probably was really effective and understanding humans file in the back of their mind, the Clintons and how they handled this, okay. You know, I think everyone played their role here. Obama put his one statement out saying I have his back. And then he stepped back, right. He didn’t say more. The Clintons continued to make phone calls to donors throughout this process saying you need to continue to give to Joe. They were supportive behind the scenes and calls that they gave to Joe. Sometimes, you know, you need all of these things. You need people pushing him to do the right thing. But you also need people that just have your back, right. And I feel like that probably helped, too. But let’s explain like kind of what’s going on behind the scenes. I think some people are like, how can Barack Obama not endorse or why is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries still saying there should be an open process? And I think that, first of all, there’s no mechanism by which there’s not an open process. The vice president will have to in some form go before the delegates and be nominated as the next nominee. And that is an open process and other people can decide to run if they want to. So far, no one has. But I think what these leaders are trying to do is make sure that that people understand that there’s integrity to this process. There’s this thing like, oh, she can’t just be anointed that she’s earned it, not that she hasn’t earned it by virtue of 14 million votes that she has gotten in the Democratic primary as part of the running mate, as being the running mate, as being the vice president, as being the best prepared for the job. But these leaders are making space. And I think it’s smart. You know, this is a high class problem she has now, having so many endorsements. But these leaders are stepping back for now to let there be a process that has legitimacy to show that unlike, you know, rigged elections on other sides, that there is a process here by which she will earn the nomination and that’s why those leaders are holding back. And I think that assuming that this continues to go on the path that we are on, they will come and endorse her at the at the right time. You do want to stage these things. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I mean, they didn’t want the appearance of this being shoved down anybody’s throats and they wanted it to happen organically and now it has. And it will continue to happen that way and they will endorse not as the first, but as well, some of the last, and that’s great. And I do think it’s important to remember, this is not a coronation. It’s the Constitution. A vice president is selected for the reason that there would be someone to step in if for any reason the president steps aside. That is exactly what is happening here. So we’re going to take a quick break here. When we get back, we’re going to look at what’s next after President Biden endorsed Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Welcome back. Soon after Biden released his statement withdrawing himself from the race, he released another endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee. Let’s take a moment to review what happened subsequently. First, she said, I’m honored -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- to have his endorsement. And it is her intention to earn and win this nomination. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: That is the first thing that happened. She led with earn. Smart. Jennifer Palmieri: Yep. Claire McCaskill: And then she basically spent all day on the phone. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: I think she called 100 people, literally, yesterday. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And that’s a lot as somebody who’s had to do call time. A hundred is a lot, especially since you have to keep your energy level up. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You have to face every phone call like the first phone call you made. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You have to listen. You can’t cut people off. And you have to say the same things over and over again. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: I don’t think people understand how exhausting that can be. So, she’s already showing a work ethic that she will need to draw upon in the next hundred and what is it, 102 days now, 101? Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I think so. Claire McCaskill: It’s close. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s like, yeah. Yeah, next Sunday, I know is 100 days because you and I have to do some sort of special, as I recall, so. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Next Sunday is 100 days. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. I even talked to people who had voicemails from her. It’s like, yeah, so she was busy doing all that. It is interesting. The president put his statement out. He thanked the vice president in his original statement for her patience, her support. And I was like, oh, wow, he’s not endorsing her. And then, you know, it’s like maybe 20 minutes later, half hour later, you know, which I think is smart, like stage these things. And then said, you know, separate and apart from that decision, I have made the decision to endorse her. And then, you know, those next 12 hours were super important and she just like, wow, did she lock down a ton of support. By the way, every single state party chair has endorsed her in the party, all 50. That’s different than every delegation. But every state party chair has endorsed her. Clyburn, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Clintons, Senator Warren, the SEIU, the Farm Workers Union -- Claire McCaskill: AFT. Jennifer Palmieri: --AFT. So, a ton of support behind her. No rumblings of anybody getting in. Oh, my God. Joe Manchin raised his head for a brief moment to say that maybe, I mean, I was like, oh, my gosh, do it. That’s like such a favor to her. Go ahead. Change your party registration back to Democrats and try to challenge her. That would be helpful to her. But then I think this morning he was on CBS and he said that he wasn’t going to do it, but somebody should. But I don’t know that anybody is. And so now if I were in the room, if I were in the Vice President Harris for president campaign, I would try to slow this down, you know. Honestly, this is what Bill Clinton would describe as a high class problem. So many endorsements coming in so quickly. You want to I think now you want to stagger them. There are some Midwest governors that have not endorsed yet. Walls, Evers, Whitmer, like, you know, hold them back, do something with them, go to their states so that you can show some deliberation in the way that you are earning support of, you know, in different states and maybe of different demographics. You know, the labor unions go out with them, you know, do things so people are seeing that the endorsements are happening for a reason. It’s not just panic that everybody needs to get on board with whoever the Democratic nominee that they are selecting, that they are choosing to endorse Kamala Harris because of her record as vice president. You know, I know a lot about the labor unions in particular, and they have so much that this administration has done for labor that, you know, they want to endorse her because of that. We want to endorse her because of this and her record. And this is what she’s going to do as president. And also in the lead up between now and the convention, you want that kind of roadmap, I think, that’s building that, you know, now that they’ve gone through the chaos of the first day, I think you want to be more methodical about lining this up. But like, wow, it’s a high class problem. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And the most important thing to note here is that no one of substance has surfaced to challenge her, even though they could. You only have to have 300 signatures to become a candidate and no one has. All the people mentioned -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- have either endorsed her or maybe will endorse her over the coming two or three days, every single one. And let me just say this about Joe Manchin. This is a phrase. It’s well-worn, but bless his heart. You know, I mean, lordy. It is just so typical of him that he pokes his head out, like anybody, hey, anybody. Hey, look at me, look at me. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s just that basic with that guy, isn’t it? Claire McCaskill: I know. Jennifer Palmieri: Sometimes I make things more complicated than they need to be. It’s like no peace, he’s just an attention hog. That’s just like what’s going on. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And so we know the DNC rules allow for anybody to gather signatures and be placed in nomination. And when they do the roll call, whether it’s virtual, here or, you know, the first weeks of August or whether it’s at the convention, those names can be placed in nomination and the delegates could vote. So, this notion that there is no way anybody has a chance is based more on the practical realities than on the process, because the process certainly allows for anyone to step up if they want to. But, you know, what’s really happening here, Jen, and I think it’s important that we really put an exclamation point behind this. There was such stress. Literally, most Democrats I know had been holding their breath for days. It was like, oh, please, you know, we cannot. This is just untenable. We can’t go on like this. We can’t continue to not know for sure. We can’t continue to wait for a slip up or, you know, a moment where we are revisiting -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- his ability to make the case. And now it’s just like this unbelievable rush of relief. Jennifer Palmieri: $49.6 million dollars rush of relief. Yeah, I know. So much money they’ve raised. Claire McCaskill: And people need to know that is not big money, people. That is $25 contributions. That is $50 contributions, maybe $100. Jennifer Palmieri: Those are my sisters. I heard from so many members of my family, who do I donate to? Claire McCaskill: Me too. I heard from friends that I’m pretty sure never gave to me that said, how do I give to Kamala Harris? And it was like, okay. Well, I’ll help. So, I think the amount of money that came in from low donors, first of all, I like it because it really puts the big donors in their place. They should be at the back of the parade, not at the front of the parade. And the front of the parade are folks that are showing an outpouring of support for Kamala Harris. And I think that’s very, very, very exciting. And I think now, Jen, if I were in the room, she’s got to spend some money right now, especially in the swing states on a really powerful biography spot. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Plouffe was saying this morning, I couldn’t agree with him more, you’ve got to do biography. You’ve got to do it serious and you’ve got to do it, sustain it with a lot of weight behind it, both online and in traditional media forums, and then move into the contrast. The media is going to be focused on the contrast and not her bio. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: She’s going to have to let people understand what she has overcome. Every race she’s made in her life, she was underestimated. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And this is no different. And I love it that she would come at this as an underdog, an underestimated underdog, but a courtroom prosecutor who knows-- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- how to take it to the witness in a way that I’m not sure we’ve had a presidential candidate be able to do in a long time. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. I mean, here’s what people need to know. And if you want to shorthand it and help her, prosecutor, attorney general, senator, vice president, president. Like, how’s that for a good resume, people? You know, I think people, because she, you know, has been sort of new in the national scene for the last five years, like that is her resume. By the way, prosecutor, attorney general, the biggest state of the nation, senator, biggest state of the nation. But yeah, agree with that. So like now you have the time. Bio ad, use your endorsements to kind of, you know, slow the endorsement downs, use them to reaffirm things in your bio, what you’ve accomplished to help introduce you. And then, you know, we know prosecutor versus the felon. She’s phenomenal. Like she’s phenomenal on the debate stage. She’s phenomenal in prosecuting an argument on abortion, on democracy, on rights. But you get a few weeks now to introduce yourself and that’s what, yeah, that’s what they should do. Claire McCaskill: I think everybody needs this lesson. This is what you need to remember. You know, in a sentence, when you put that little half circle there, it’s a comma. It’s Kamala. Jennifer Palmieri: La. Claire McCaskill: Kamala. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Because I worked with her sister, Maya, on Hillary’s campaign, that’s what she would say. Kamala. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Kamala. So, yeah, VP, what do you think? Jennifer Palmieri: Oh my God. I mean, oh boy. Okay. I mean, the auditions on “Morning Joe” were hilarious. Here’s the list that’s like been reported as being vetted. It’s Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. I think those are the four most serious that I believe we know are actually being vetted. And what that means, people, is like a team of lawyers descend on you and produce a really scary binder of, you know, anything that they can find out about you. And it’s a very serious, very intense, very uncomfortable process. Other ones that could be, are rumored to be, considering Maryland Governor Wes Moore, California Governor Gavin Newsom. You can’t have two Californians. I mean, he’s great and obviously you can’t have two Californians. J.B. Pritzker, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. He is one of the governors that has not endorsed yet. Like I said, sort of like a swath of Midwest. I forgot about him. Whitmer, Evers, Pritzker, Walls of Minnesota. I think Josh Shapiro is the most serious candidate at this point. You know, if he can lock up Pennsylvania, that’s great. I know labor really likes him. He’s a phenomenal candidate. I’ve interviewed that guy a lot. He’s just like a really good campaigner. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Gretchen Whitmer. What do you think of the list? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I think that’s the list. I think the top four are the ones you mentioned. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: Mark Kelly has a lot to recommend him. His background, he also would help in a state that is important, not as important as Pennsylvania, but nonetheless important. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I just think there’s a sense in many ways that getting somebody from outside of Washington helps. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah,. Claire McCaskill: And since Mark is a sitting United States senator, although he doesn’t feel like it. You know what I mean? Jennifer Palmieri: He doesn’t feel like a senator at all. Claire McCaskill: Right, right. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, he feels like a senator, but he feels like what he’s done in his life is bigger -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Claire McCaskill: -- than even maybe being a senator. Jennifer Palmieri: Did you say he’s an astronaut? Should we remind people of that? Let’s remind people who he is. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. He was an astronaut, but really flew a lot of combat missions. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: You know, J.D. Vance did PR for the Marines in Iraq. Mark Kelly was in the plane that was being shot at and that was delivering weaponry in the war effort. So a big difference in terms of their backgrounds. Jennifer Palmieri: And his wife. Claire McCaskill: And his wife, Gabby Giffords, one of the first real true victims of political violence in our country. Not the only obvious, but in modern times, since the Kennedy assassinations and Martin Luther King, really the first person to be seriously wounded in an assassination attempt. I love Josh Shapiro. I think he’s great. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I think it’s for a lot of reasons. I think he makes the most sense. Jennifer Palmieri: Kelly makes a lot of sense, too. Claire McCaskill: Kelly does, too. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And I don’t mind either Andy Beshear or Roy Cooper. Jennifer Palmieri: True. Claire McCaskill: You know what I love? I love the fact that all of the people being talked about have had to run in states that they could lose to a Republican. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, for sure. Claire McCaskill: I mean, that’s really important, you guys, because -- Jennifer Palmieri: It is. Claire McCaskill: -- I mean, don’t get me wrong. Kamala Harris has fought maybe the toughest battles you ever fight, which is primary wars in California. But because those primaries in California are brutal -- Jennifer Palmieri: Terrible. Claire McCaskill: Terrible. But I like the idea that all four of these nominees have had to get votes from people that don’t have a D behind their name. They know what it means to speak to the electorate, not on partisan terms, on terms of what matters to people, what you can do to address the real life problems they have. And I just think all four of these are great choices. I think she’ll be served well by any of them. I give a little bit of a front runner status to Josh Shapiro just because he comes from Pennsylvania. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. And he’s really good. I mean, he is a very effective campaigner. Okay, so money. We talked a little bit about money, but I want to explain something else. The Harris campaign announced this morning that they have raised $49.6 million dollars since Biden dropped out. It’s the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle. The other thing people should know about that’s helpful if the nomination goes to Harris is that because she is on the ticket with Biden, she can assume the infrastructure of the campaign and the resources of the campaign. And that would not have been true for somebody that had not been on the ticket. Let’s take a quick break here and when we come back, I want to nerd out on the DNC rules for nominating Kamala Harris. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, let’s explain the craziness about the timing of the nomination and what those rules are. I’m kind of up to speed on this. Are you up to speed on this? It’s so complicated. Okay. Claire McCaskill: It’s too boring for me. Jennifer Palmieri: But it matters a lot. All right. So -- Claire McCaskill: I know. I know. Jennifer Palmieri: It matters. It matters. It matters. Okay, the convention starts on August 19. The party, the DNC, the Democratic Convention has continued to say that there should be a virtual nomination to have the nomination done sometime between August 1st and August 7th because in order to make sure that the candidate can be on the Ohio ballot, their rule is that they need to know who the nominee is by August 7. Ohio passed a law that said that they would wait. The law doesn’t take effect until September 1. Most lawyers I talk to say that doesn’t matter. You don’t actually need to have the virtual nomination by August 7 in order to worry about Ohio. It’s fine. Some people say it’s risky to not do that. Let’s just assume that it’s fine to not worry about Ohio. The other problem is that Washington State starts printing. They need to know who the nominee is on August 20. They start printing ballots. Then California starts printing ballots on August 22. The convention starts on August 19. And so what has to get decided in the next week is how the nomination is going to happen. Will they pursue, move forward quickly, like in the next, you know, two weeks from now, I guess, and then that window of August 1 to August 7, and do a virtual nomination of the vice president? Or will they wait, you know, create a rule that allows them to wait and do this actually in Chicago and nominate her there, you know, as you would in a traditional convention? I think they need to figure this out and like let her have a real nomination and not have a Zoom call, you know. Like figure it out, people. You’re in charge of the rules. Jay Inslee is the governor of Washington. If you need to ask him to like print his ballots a week later, I bet you can figure that out. Let’s have a real convention and, you know, particularly when we’re reintroducing a new nominee to the country. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, and Mark Elias put out a statement yesterday as the definitive Democratic lawyer saying, do not worry, the Democratic nominee will be on the ballot in all 50 states. There is nothing that can be done to change that. Since Mark has spoken, I am comfortable with that. Jennifer Palmieri: Me, too. Claire McCaskill: Let’s do this in a way that gives those double haters, those disengaged voters, those voters that have not been paying attention because it was just two old white guys, let’s speak to them in a way that is meaningful and I think you’re right. I think it’d be better to do it at the convention if they can figure it out. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes. Do it for real. It’s ridiculous. Claire McCaskill: By the way, if we’ve figured all this out, surely we can figure that out because it seems a lot less difficult than what we’ve just been through. Jennifer Palmieri: I mean, also the party controls the party, right? So like I just don’t understand why they can’t, like it’s ridiculous. So anyway. Wow. Okay. I mean, a way different Monday than I expected that we would. You know, we just recorded on Friday. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And guess what? We’ll be back on Thursday. Jennifer Palmieri: We will be back on Thursday. Yes, with Dave Wasserman. I’m super excited about that. He is the analyzer from Cook Political Report, and there’s no one who goes deeper into the data of what’s actually happening in all of these states and districts. So that’ll be great. So historic day, friends. Thanks so much for listening. As we said, we’ll be back on Thursday for our regular weekly episode. If you have a question for us, this will be good.

Secret Service director resigns after backlash over Trump rally security failures,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 8:02 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/secret-service-director-resigns-kimberly-cheatle-rcna163146,"Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after facing bipartisan pressure to step down during a House hearing, NBC News reported. Republicans at the hearing used the assassination attempt against Donald Trump on July 13 as a Trojan horse to push their anti-diversity agenda.  Republicans and Democrats at the hearing were largely in agreement that Cheatle should resign over the Secret Service's failure to prevent the attack. Later Monday, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and the committee’s top Democrat, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, signed a joint letter calling on Cheatle to step down. But ever since the shooting, conservative activists, benefactors like Elon Musk and some lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Johnson have baselessly sought to blame the shooting in part on liberal rhetoric or diversity, inclusion and equity measures. The DEI thing became a talking point among far-right influencers online, after they noticed that some members of Trump’s Secret Service detail on the day of the shooting were women.  For his part, Trump has thanked the Secret Service agents who protected him. His sons have defended the women in their father's detail. And Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita has condemned right-wing criticism of the women, which shows that these attacks are viewed as beyond the pale even for some at the center of the MAGA universe. So it's remarkable that several House Republicans kept pushing that angle during the hearing.  One can detect more than a hint of condescension in Wisconsin GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman’s questioning, for example.  “You’ve spent some time trying to change the makeup of the Secret Service,"" Grothman said. ""OK, you feel there — whatever — too high a percentage are men. Um, does this affect at all who you are hiring for the Secret Service?” The congressman went on to ask whether Cheatle was ever “not hiring men because of your desire to hit certain targets,” a seeming reference to hiring goals set by some organizations that right-wingers kvetch over in their attacks on diversity efforts. Cheatle said the agency only hires the most qualified candidates. But after briefly deviating from this misogynistic line of questioning, Grothman asked, “Can you elaborate why you want one-third of the Secret Service to be women?” Cheatle denied ever saying this. Grothman, who told a reporter earlier this week that he feels Democrats are backing Harris ""because of her ethnic background,"" sure seems eager to ascribe someone else's success to their gender or ethnicity, which is quite rich coming from a white man in Congress. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., also appeared to question the diversity and qualifications of Secret Service agents, asking why someone shorter than Trump or incapable of physically carrying him should be allowed to serve on his security detail.  Perry didn’t mention women specifically, but his remarks sounded like an allusion to the female Secret Service agents bashed by bigoted, right-wing social media trolls. Cheatle yet again affirmed that she’s only hired people who are qualified and capable of doing the job, and Perry responded by claiming this was the sign of a “culture” in which “the primary objective here seems to be something other than securing the site, securing the principal, and securing the people at the site.” Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett was the most overt in his bigotry, calling Cheatle a “DEI horror story” during the hearing. And he told CNN on Monday that he believes Harris was a ""DEI hire"" by the Biden campaign in 2020. When asked by Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, whether the security failures had to do with DEI, Cheatle said they had “nothing to do” with such initiatives. You can watch Crockett and fellow Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, respond to the baseless, bigoted attack on DEI here. As I wrote last week, House Republicans are risking dooming their probe into the Trump assassination attempt by politicizing it in the way they already have. Using this investigation to push cheap political crusades undermines its seriousness."
Harris campaign contacts five Dems in search for running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 7:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-campaign-contacts-five-dems-search-running-mate-rcna163207,"On the first full day of the new 2024 presidential race, it quickly became apparent that Vice President Kamala Harris was likely to be the Democratic nominee. It was equally evident that she’d need a running mate — and she wouldn’t have much time to find one. With this in mind, multiple news organizations confirmed that former attorney general Eric Holder and his law firm would oversee an intense vetting process And who, pray tell, will they be vetting? The answer is just now starting to come into focus. NBC News reported that the Harris campaign has requested vetting materials from five potential vice presidential contenders, according to two sources familiar with the list (in alphabetical order): It’s worth emphasizing that this shouldn’t necessarily be seen as an exhaustive list. We know from previous election cycles that some who make short lists like these fall out of favor, while others are sometimes added to the list as the process unfolds. The eventual Democratic vice presidential nominee might very well come from this quintet, but there are no guarantees. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, for example, has been rumored to be in contention for the job, though he’s not on this list. That doesn’t mean, however, that he’s out of the running. As for the list itself, these are, by any fair measure, five strong contenders. Shapiro claims he hasn't been contacted as part of the running-mate search, but the Pennsylvania Democrat is nevertheless a popular governor in a key battleground state, who also happens to have a background as a prosecutor who took on the Trump administration. Cooper and Whitmer are also popular governors from battleground states, and while the latter suggested that she’s not interested in serving as her party’s vice presidential nominee, perspectives change when opportunities are no longer abstractions. Kelly, the only senator on the list (so far), has an impressive background in the military, and is a former astronaut. What’s more, while Democrats would hate to see Kelly leave the Senate, Arizona has a Democratic governor who’d appoint his successor and keep the seat “blue.” Walz’s inclusion on the list might seem surprising to some, but I’d recommend keeping a close eye on the Minnesotan. He’s an excellent speaker, a successful governor in a Midwestern state, a former well liked congressman, and perhaps most importantly, Walz is a decorated military veteran. As the process advances, spare a thought for the researchers who have a daunting and expedited task ahead of them. Politico reported that delegates to the Democratic convention could begin voting on the party’s presidential and vice presidential nominees as early as next week. The report added, “Such a timeline, if it were implemented, could result in Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden’s endorsed successor, selecting her running mate by the middle of next week.” Watch this space."
Ohio Republican forced to scramble after ‘civil war’ comments,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 6:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ohio-republican-forced-scramble-civil-war-comments-rcna163189,"It was just 10 days ago when a gunman shot Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, and while the shooter’s motives are still being investigated, Republicans responded to the assassination attempt by blaming Democratic rhetoric. As far as the former president’s GOP allies were concerned, Democrats weren’t just responsible for the gunman, they had a responsibility to “lower the volume” in the public discourse. All of this came to mind watching a Republican campaign rally in Ohio yesterday. Politico reported: In context, Vance had not yet taken the stage at the official campaign event, though a local state senator was warming up the crowd before introducing the Republican vice presidential nominee. “I’m afraid if we lose this one, it’s going to take a civil war to save the country, and it will be saved,” Lang said. “It’s the greatest experiment in the history of mankind, and if we come down to a civil war, I’m glad we got people like ... Bikers for Trump on our side.” It’s important to emphasize that while the GOP legislator made these comments — out loud, on camera, in front of a large audience — and he appeared to mean what he said, Lang did issue a written statement soon that walked it all back. “Remarks I made earlier today at a rally at a rally in Middletown do not accurately reflect my views,” Lang said via social media. “I regret the divisive remarks I made in the excitement of the moment on stage.” Nevertheless, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said in a statement, “Donald Trump and JD Vance should denounce George Lang’s calls for violence and apologize for platforming this kind of violence.” There has been no such apology. “Donald Trump and JD Vance are running a campaign openly sowing hatred and promising revenge against their political opponents,” the Harris campaign added. “That’s why a Republican official was empowered to predict a civil war while introducing these candidates.”"
An emboldened Trump is threatening to sue those who indicted him,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 6:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-sue-mar-a-lago-raid-cannon-rcna163118,"As many major news outlets continue to digest President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race and the Democratic Party’s swift rallying around Vice President Kamala Harris as its standard bearer, you would be forgiven if you had turned your attention away from the person who commanded last week’s news cycle: Donald Trump. But almost 24 hours to the minute after Biden announced he was leaving the race, Trump took to Truth Social on Monday with what could be a significant post of his own, suggesting it’s his “time to sue” an unspecified “them for illegally breaking into, and raiding, Mar-a-Lago” in the wake of federal District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case. Yet, that case — which concerns Trump’s alleged possession of classified and other national security related documents at Mar-a-Lago and both his and his two co-defendants’ alleged obstruction of the federal investigation of the same — was not thrown out because of any finding that the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago was legally defective. Instead, Cannon dismissed the case for a wholly unrelated reason: She ruled that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith and the funding of his office violate two distinct clauses of Article II of the U.S. Constitution. Nonetheless, the former president-turned-GOP-presidential-nominee is now not only insisting that the Mar-a-Lago search and seizure of evidence broke the law, but also that he intends to sue prosecutors and/or the FBI for violating his rights. And his post therefore begets two questions: One, is Trump serious about a civil lawsuit against federal prosecutors? And two, assuming he is, would that suit have any chance of succeeding? Let's start with whether Trump truly intends to sue. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but if past is prologue, the answer is likely yes. Recall that the nation was first introduced to Cannon not as a result of the indictment against Trump, which was randomly assigned to her, but through the civil case Trump himself filed two weeks after the Mar-a-Lago search and used to secure the appointment of a special master to review the evidence collected ""to preserve the sanctity of executive communications and other privileges."" The second and more significant question then is what such a lawsuit would look like. Let's assume Trump is going to sue and that what he's after is a damages award that would hurt and embarrass the government. Whom would Trump sue and what claims might he advance? Ordinarily, under Supreme Court precedent, the federal government and its agencies are immune from damages unless they waive sovereign immunity. Yet a federal statute — the Federal Tort Claims Act — does exactly that. It specifically allows lawsuits for torts such as false arrest, abuse of process or malicious prosecution where those claims are rooted in the acts of federal investigative or law enforcement officers, a category broadly defined to include ""any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law."" That doesn't, of course, mean Trump is filing any such suit in the immediate future, especially as the special counsel's office has indicated its intent to appeal Cannon's dismissal of the case. Nor does it mean any lawsuit Trump files will necessarily be one for malicious prosecution. In part, that's because it's at best unclear whether Trump could establish the elements of malicious prosecution under Florida law, which would govern in this case. Under a 1994 Florida Supreme Court ruling, claims of malicious prosecution in the state require proof not only that the plaintiff — here, hypothetically Trump — obtained a dismissal in his favor, but also that the case was dismissed because of his innocence. Plus, that plaintiff must also show, among other factors, proof that prosecutors lacked probable cause and acted with malice. Here, by contrast, the case was dismissed on procedural, not substantive grounds, and there are no conclusive judicial findings from the litigation before Cannon that the Mar-a-Lago search was inappropriate or legally defective. On the contrary, late last month, Cannon found Trump failed to make even a preliminary showing that the affidavit submitted by the Justice Department to obtain the Mar-a-Lago search warrant contained any material false statements or omissions, a showing required to obtain any further hearing about the warrant's propriety. So should we take Trump at his word that he intends to sue? Sure. But can we expect Trump to launch this newest legal effort soon, much less successfully? That's both more dubious and murkier."
Trump allies reconsider: Is JD Vance the right running mate?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-allies-reconsider-jd-vance-right-running-mate-rcna163172,"As Donald Trump and his team evaluated potential running mates, there were plenty of “safe” choices for the former Republican president. Sen. JD Vance wasn’t necessarily one of them. The 39-year-old Ohio senator — the least experienced major-party running mate in nearly nine decades — has no accomplishments to speak of. He has a record of extremism on key issues. He comes from a state the GOP ticket is almost certain to win anyway. He actually hated Trump in the recent past. As the public was reminded at Vance’s first solo rally since joining Trump’s team, the guy doesn’t exactly radiate charm and charisma, either. Even in his home state, Vance is hardly a powerhouse. In 2022, as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine cruised to a landslide, 26-point re-election victory, Vance appeared on the same ballot — and won by six points. As a recent Washington Post analysis summarized, the young senator “underperformed every other statewide Republican on the ballot by a large margin. Ohio went strongly for Republicans; it did not go strongly for Vance.” So why in the world did Trump pick him as his new running mate? Why choose a Republican with little appeal beyond the former president’s far-right MAGA base? At least in part because Trump assumed he was poised to win anyway. As the former president saw it, with an inevitable 2024 victory in hand, there was no harm in running up the ideological score, satisfying the base and establishing greater control over the Republican Party’s vision for the foreseeable future. That, of course, was when the GOP nominee expected to defeat President Joe Biden. As the incumbent stands down, the party’s recent moves are being reassessed and recontextualized. Tim Alberta wrote for The Atlantic: That luxury is now gone. Alberta added via social media, “[The] most striking thing I heard from Trump allies yesterday was the second-guessing of JD Vance—a selection, they acknowledged, that was borne of cockiness, meant to run up margins with the base in a blowout.” Oops. I’ve long argued that the running mate selection is the most important choice a presidential candidate will make during his or her campaign. Trump did not choose wisely — and it’s apparently not just Democrats who’ve noticed."
It's not enough for Kamala Harris to not be Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-presidential-campaign-policy-trump-rcna163002,"President Joe Biden’s historic exit from the White House race and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him marks a thrilling turn of events for many Democrats. Biden’s re-election prospects had been looking terrible. Harris has injected an air of new possibility into the race, and she instantly benefits from not being dogged by questions about her mental acuity. Harris is taking control of Biden’s campaign operation, garnering endorsements from across the party and positioning herself as the favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. But it is imperative that she not allow her candidacy to be defined purely in negative terms as a generic alternative to someone undesirable: It is not enough to not be Joe Biden. It is not enough to not be Donald Trump. If Harris wants to make a splash, re-introduce herself to the public and have a decent shot at beating the former president, then she must embrace a compelling policy vision and sell it with gusto. This is an arena in which Biden largely failed. Harris needs to avoid making the same mistake. The Biden-Harris campaign had focused mostly on selling re-election as a way to protect democracy and abortion rights. Those are deeply important ideas that can fire up the Democratic base. But most American voters are not the Democratic base, and Democrats need to get their attention and secure trust their trust by unveiling policies that pique their interest. This is a realm in which Harris can improve upon Biden’s platform and shore up her potential weaknesses against Trump. The Democratic Party must not just stand against things. It must stand for things.  Less politically engaged voters and swing voters have an outsize interest in economic issues, and polling data indicates that Trump tends to poll better than Biden on the economy. A set of recent surveys from The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer found that a large majority of voters in five battleground states want sweeping change in our economic and political systems. And even though inflation has subsided, Americans persistently believe that the cost of living is too high. Big, bold proposals that acknowledge that there are big structural problems in the way our economy distributes wages, wealth and freedom can engage and excite people. It would be negligence of the highest order for Harris to not adopt the language and policy vision of economic populism as a focal point of her campaign. Big policy swings can help Harris renew and build coalitions on the left, as well. Buzzy policy commitments and rhetorical emphasis on issues such as increasing the minimum wage, expanding the child tax credit, creating a public option for health insurance, universal child care, free higher education options, tackling skyrocketing housing prices and cracking down on tax cheats, among countless others, would allow Harris to engage activists and specific constituencies and motivate them to work to elect her. Biden unveiled some eye-catching policies on banning medical debt, controlling rental costs and reforming the Supreme Court in the final weeks of his campaign. But his pivot was too little, too late. Those policy announcements mostly came about as concessions to the left wing of the party as Biden scrambled to secure support from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the progressive House members known as “the squad” as his support fell after his debate against Trump. It remains to be seen how Harris will approach those policies, but one hopes she considers them alongside other potential headline-generating policies. A bold economic populism can also serve as a shield for Harris. Unfortunately Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and their GOP allies are likely to use the kinds of racist and sexist tropes to try to tear her down just as they have done in the past. Even more unfortunately, those lines of attack could persuade voters even outside the MAGA camp who are amenable to bigoted messaging. But if Harris hammers home social and economic policies that would benefit all people regardless of background, then she can help keep the conversation grounded in universal terms and help ensure that she sounds grounded in the struggles that working people face across all demographic backgrounds. Additionally, Harris can use economic populism to help rebuff the MAGA world’s increasingly sophisticated courtship of unions and call out the ruse of right-wing populism, which claims to champion working-class people even as it prioritizes the desires of corporations and the rich. Harris is an experienced, energetic and competent candidate suited to take the torch from Biden in an emergency. But with Trump looking unusually strong in polls this year, Democrats must remember that fear of Trump is not a strong enough strategy for winning the election. Harris can shut down shallow theorizing about whether she is “electable” by getting to work and doing what Biden failed to do: making a bold case for how to make America better for everyone."
Joe Biden can be proud of his record,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 23, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-presidential-term-record-rcna163132,"This wasn’t how Joe Biden planned to end his career. He wanted to be president for his entire adult life, clearly loved having the job and hoped desperately to hold on to it for another four years. But Biden can take comfort in this: He may be America’s best one-term president ever.  For progressives like me, Biden’s tenure has been a pleasant surprise. For nearly 50 years before reaching the Oval Office, Biden positioned himself as a moderate within the Democratic Party. Many liberals rightly looked askance at the less admirable parts of his long record in the Senate, such as his tight relationship with the credit card industry and his mishandling of Anita Hill’s testimony during Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court confirmation hearings. We feared that his commitment to conciliation and procedural norms was ill-suited to facing down an increasingly radical Republican Party. But again and again, Biden exceeded expectations. It’s important to remember how unlikely some of the president’s victories were, especially when it came to passing new laws. During the 2020 election, Biden argued that his decades as vice president and senator made him uniquely capable of getting meaningful legislation passed by his former colleagues. But there was reason to be skeptical of what he could accomplish in Congress. He has faced a Republican opposition increasingly judged not by what it achieves but by how venomously it fights Democratic presidents. While Barack Obama began his administration with huge congressional majorities — including, briefly, a filibuster-proof 60-vote bloc in the Senate — Biden had essentially no margin for error in either chamber from the start. Add in some troublemaking Democrats like Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and it was reasonable to expect Biden would struggle to accomplish anything.  Yet he did accomplish plenty. The enormous American Rescue Plan helped carry the country through the terrible economic effects of the Covid pandemic. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was the first meaningful gun safety legislation in decades. The bipartisan infrastructure law — something Donald Trump never got passed in four years despite years of promises — and the CHIPS and Science Act represent extraordinary investments in American industrial capacity. And his industrial policy was a key break with the neoliberal approach of the past. Instead, the Biden administration aggressively intervened in the economy to promote new manufacturing, especially in areas that have experienced tough times in recent years. The results speak for themselves. Whether you want to give any president credit for job creation that happens under his watch, Biden’s record in that area is unmatched in any presidential term in history. There are nearly 16 million more jobs today than when Biden took office. Under Donald Trump, less than 7 million jobs were created before the pandemic tore through the country, during what Trump absurdly claims was the greatest economy in human history.  The Biden legislation that may have the most significant long-term impact, though, is the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed the Senate via Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote after an excruciatingly long and complex process. The IRA had many components, but most importantly, it’s the most significant climate change legislation ever enacted. The IRA promotes clean energy production across a variety of economic sectors and geographic areas, offers subsidies for electric vehicles and reduces carbon emissions in multiple ways.  Unfortunately, most voters know next to nothing about the IRA or Biden’s aggressive executive actions on climate. As Robinson Meyer of the climate news site Heatmap (where I am also a columnist) wrote of Biden, “Again and again, he would pull off some difficult domestic policy — and then fail to communicate it to voters.” That’s meaningful — part of the president’s job is to bring the public along with what he’s doing — but it doesn’t change the impact of Biden’s practical accomplishments.  There are many other parts of Biden’s legacy to praise. He brought long-needed diversity to the federal judiciary, appointing unprecedented numbers of female and nonwhite judges. After four years of Trump’s praising dictators and demeaning U.S. allies, Biden restored a foreign policy consistent with both security and American values. He was the first president to join a union picket line, and his administration was consistently, strongly pro-labor. And despite unceasing Republican efforts to obscure Trump’s almost infinite corruption, his administration has been remarkably free of scandal.  That isn’t to say that Biden hasn’t made mistakes; every president does. There are decisions he made that I disagreed with. He hasn’t done nearly enough to restrain the Netanyahu government in its disastrous war on Gaza. He could have moved more aggressively to expand access to health care and retain the Covid-era expansion of the child tax credit. And I wish he had embraced Supreme Court reform years ago, not just before he dropped out of the 2024 campaign. But in the big picture of Biden’s term, two takeaways stand out. First, he displayed a remarkable and admirable adaptability for someone who has been in politics for half a century, adjusting to changes not just in his party but in the world. How many young people would have said a politician in his 80s would do more on climate than any president before him? Second, Biden took governing seriously. He showed that knowledge of how Washington works does, in fact, matter a great deal. When Biden claimed that his long experience would make him better suited to handle the complexities of the legislative process and the sprawling executive branch, some scoffed. Yet he was right.  In the end, age came for the president, as it comes for us all. In Biden’s case, it left him unable to fight off Trump a second time. But he was a better president than almost anyone expected."
Kamala Harris wants to 'earn' the nomination. That's only half the battle.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 4:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/harris-nomination-battle-2024-trump-biden-rcna163129,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 22 episode of “Morning Joe.” I’ve had the privilege of working for President Joe Biden. I worked on his 2020 campaign, and once he took the White House, I had the honor of serving as a deputy assistant to the president. From my time with the president, I can tell you he is a remarkable man, he is a selfless man, and, frankly, what he did on Sunday is something very few elected officials in this country would ever be willing to do. I’ve also had the honor of serving Vice President Kamala Harris as both her chief spokesperson and senior adviser. I can tell you that throughout this entire process, there have been very few people more loyal to the president than the vice president. After Biden threw his support behind Harris on Sunday, the vice president made it clear that she plans to earn the Democratic Party’s nomination. It is my understanding the vice president was on the phone all day long, asking people for their support, not just expecting to get it. By my count, she has already secured the support of over 100 House Democrats, a dozen Senate Democrats, most of the country’s Democratic governors and several complete state delegations. That’s what I would call working to earn the nomination. As we look to the weeks ahead, there’s no doubt in my mind that Harris is well-poised to lock up the nomination. But that’s only half the battle. After that comes the hard part: campaigning and winning. This will not be an easy race. Much has been made about concerns over the president’s age, with many arguing that’s why the race was so close. However, I would argue this race was always going to be close. It was close in 2020, and no matter who is at the top of the Democratic ticket, it’s going to be close this time around. Now it’s time for Democrats to do the hard work and defeat Donald Trump, not just for the sake of their party, but for the sake of our democracy. Join Symone Sanders-Townsend, Rachel Maddow and many others on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Brooklyn, New York, for “MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024,” a first-of-its kind live event. You’ll get to see your favorite hosts in person and hear thought-provoking conversations about what matters most in the final weeks of an unprecedented election cycle. Buy tickets here."
Why the mayhem caused by CrowdStrike failure could happen again,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 3:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/crowdstrike-outage-safety-update-rcna163127,"Airlines grounded planes across the world on Friday, not because of a problem with the airplanes themselves but with the computers that help them navigate the complexity of scheduling, display flight schedules to passengers, and monitor flight paths. Some hospitals canceled scheduled surgeries and medical appointments because their staff couldn’t use their computers to access patients’ medical records. Even grocery stores were impacted. I couldn’t buy groceries just outside London on Friday because the payment processing system used at my market was down. We can trace all those disruptions to cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike. A minor error in its software caused computers running the code to fail. Even after the code was patched, each and every computer affected had to be manually restarted by a human being, which meant fixing the problem took a lot of time. How did a small mistake in a company most of us had never heard of create such a mess? Centralization pressures have consolidated many industries, and, in software, the result has been that Microsoft Windows is the default operating system controlling everything from 911 systems to banks to elevators. Corporations around the world trust Microsoft to help them smoothly run their businesses. Microsoft’s security team deploys updates automatically on a schedule. Many users have probably forgotten or weren’t even born during the widespread malware attacks (as early as 1988 and especially in the 1990s and 2000s) which repeatedly brought down much of the internet. What we saw on Friday exposes the tension between safety and security. Safety means ensuring that software runs as expected and does so dependably every time. Safety gives us the confidence to use computers to handle hospital medical records and airline scheduling and know that they will be reliable. Security, on the other hand, is ensuring that software is free from attacks from those who want unauthorized access. Security allows us to connect computers to the internet and know that cybercriminals will not be able to use our computer to make money or access private information stored. For software like Microsoft Windows, which is ubiquitous in our national critical infrastructure, we need safety and security. But focusing on one can come at the expense of the other. To ensure safety, we need enough time to audit the code and test it properly. That allows experts to examine the code and run it in a variety of scenarios to give them the confidence the code will run as expected. To ensure security, though, we need to be able to update the code quickly to minimize harm against potential attacks. Cybercriminals are regularly targeting computers using new ways to get in. Quick updates allow us to block threats as soon as they arise. An error in a CrowdStrike update didn’t run as expected, which caused worldwide frustrations Friday. Due to the complexity of modern computer systems, even systems that were not running CrowdStrike were affected. If they used a third-party service dependent on CrowdStrike, then they would still be equally affected. For instance, I don’t know if my grocery story runs its own payment processor or if it contracts with a payment processor that uses CrowdStrike. It’s irrelevant. If a single component of an interconnected system is directly affected, then the rest is rendered unusable until the affected systems are back online. Security software like CrowdStrike’s needs to be able to run updates on a fast pace to ensure the security of the systems it runs on. However, by allowing CrowdStrike to autoupdate without outside inspection, too much trust is put in this company and its software. Such a process doesn’t sufficiently safeguard safety, and we need a complete review to see if CrowdStrike followed all relevant safety norms. If they did, then those those safety norms need to be updated. What happens next? We need security software to be able to update quickly, but better mechanisms need to exist to ensure the safety of the underlying systems. In the weeks and months to come, expect changes within companies as they adjust their systems to include security critical code in their normal safety processes. But this is not enough. Governments regulate software systems, particularly in certain critical industries. This extra layer protects their citizens from undue harm. Software systems are certified by external companies providing compliance checks on a regular basis. This ensures that they comply with the regulations. In many sectors, systems are required to run proper security software and CrowdStrike was a default option here. By giving a single vendor privileged access to many Microsoft corporate systems around the world, a ripe environment was created for a single failure to bring down a large part of the computer-powered infrastructure we rely on across the world. There are a large number of centralization pressures in the software industry. Outsourcing information technology is a cost-effective way to outsource legal risk if issues arise. Choosing known good vendors makes the compliance-checking processes quicker and easier. These pressures can’t be overcome if there isn’t substantive changes in how we regulate systems. We have now seen one of the repercussions of the lack of diversity of software. If nothing changes, such a catastrophic event will inevitably happen again."

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) that panel members have voted to ‘initiate an adjudicatory review of his alleged violations of Senate Rules,’ setting the stage for a possible future vote to expel or censure him.” * Stay tuned: “U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday a long-sought cease-fire between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas was within sight, saying negotiators were ‘driving toward the goal line.’” * Philadelphia’s latest mass shooting: “Three people were killed and six others were injured at a shooting in west Philadelphia early Sunday morning, according to police. ... All of the deceased victims were men, according to the news release, including a 33-year-old who was pronounced dead on the scene. A 23-year-old who was shot in the chest, leg and stomach was taken to a medical center, where he died.” * In Iowa: “The Iowa Supreme Court on Monday denied a rehearing request for Iowa’s six-week abortion ban, meaning enforcement of the law will likely begin soon. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland filed the petition for a rehearing to the Iowa Supreme Court earlier in July, asking justices to reconsider the 4-3 decision on the law in June that paved the way for enforcement of the law. The ruling ordered the district court to lift a temporary injunction on the measure restricting abortions, as well as setting a lower legal standard for testing the constitutionality of state abortion laws.” * Despite the political tumult, the Biden administration is still governing as it should: “The Environmental Protection Agency is awarding $4.3 billion in grants to fund projects in 30 states to reduce climate pollution. The money will go to 25 projects targeting greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, electric power, commercial and residential buildings, industry, agriculture and waste and materials management.” * In related news: “President Biden announced a new goal Friday to phase out the purchasing and use of single-use plastics across the federal government by 2035. ... The announcement follows a 2022 U.S. Department of Interior Secretarial Order aimed at phasing out single-use plastics in national parks and other public lands — including Yosemite, Yellowstone and Grand Canyon — as well as a rule issued last month by the General Services Administration to reduce single-use packaging in federal purchasing.” See you tomorrow."
How Trump beat a motion to dismiss his Pulitzer defamation claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 1:31 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-russia-pulitzer-lawsuit-defamation-rcna163060,"Donald Trump has won a court battle in his defamation lawsuit against members and staff of the Pulitzer Prize Board, a lawsuit stemming from an award given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for stories about Russia and his 2016 campaign. The former president has alleged that board members and staff conspired to publish a defamatory statement in 2022 affirming the veracity of the newspapers’ prize-winning journalism. The Florida state judge’s decision denied the defense motion to dismiss Trump’s complaint, which lets the case move forward. Here’s the 2022 Pulitzer statement at issue: The Florida judge, Robert Pegg, found that the statement wasn’t “pure opinion” — as the defense argued — which wouldn’t be actionable by Trump. Rather, the judge said that the statement “withheld information from their audience that would have provided an adequate factual foundation for a common reader to decide whether to agree or disagree with Defendants’ decision to let 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting stand, and whether the awarded reporting had in fact been discredited by facts that emerged from the Mueller Report or the other government investigations that had been made public since the conferral of those prizes.” Basically, the judge ruled that the defendants couldn’t escape the case at this stage of litigation. The bottom line for now is that Trump’s complaint survived a motion to dismiss, but whether he ultimately prevails remains to be seen.
