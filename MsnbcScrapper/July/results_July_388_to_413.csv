"Addition, Not Subtraction",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-addition-not-subtraction-rcna161378,"Senator Claire McCaskill is away this week, so former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri tapped another former co-host to join, veteran GOP strategist and creator of “The Circus”, Mark McKinnon. As President Biden hosts a NATO summit at the White House, all Beltway eyes are focused on whether he has staying power as the Democratic nominee. So, Jen and Mark zero in on how keenly lawmakers and pundits are tracking the shifting winds on that calculation. And NBC correspondent Vaughn Hillyard previews the Republican Convention set to begin Monday, and the many unknowns still hanging in the air—including who is speaking, how strongly they embrace Project 2025, and who Trump will choose as his running mate.   Note: Next week, we’ll be recording and releasing on Friday so we can break down the  Republican Convention as a whole. In the meantime, we’ll be sharing audio of MSNBC’s coverage in this feed for people to stay up to date during the convention next week.  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello. Welcome to “How to Win 2024.” We’re taping this episode on Wednesday, July 10th. I’m Jennifer Palmieri and my usual partner in crime, Claire McCaskill, is away this week. So, I’m here with a very special co-host, Mark McKinnon. Yay. Also known as MKat. Hello, Kat. Mark McKinnon: Hello, JPalm. Jennifer Palmieri: Friends of Showtime’s “The Circus” might remember that Mark and I were co-hosts in a previous life. The show was Mark’s idea. He was a co-executive producer, co-host for all eight seasons, and veteran campaign pro. I mean, you’ve had the most interesting life of any friend I have, honestly, starting with a music career in Nashville. For real, people, I’m not making that up. And then a campaign consultant for Democrats, then moved to be a campaign consultant for George W. Bush as governor, helped get him elected president twice, and then the presidential campaign of John McCain, all along pushing this idea of we should have a very cool show that shows you what’s really going on in politics. Thank you, Kat. Mark McKinnon: Well, thank you. You made “The Circus” great, Jen. Jennifer Palmieri: No, it was fun. Mark McKinnon: It was a ton of fun. It really was. Jennifer Palmieri: So this week, Mark and I are going to talk Biden strategy, Trump’s veepstakes, and we’ll also preview the Republican convention set to kick off this Monday with NBC’s own Vaughn Hillyard. But first, continuing fallout for Biden. So this is where we’re like, okay, if we were in the room on the Biden campaign, what would we be doing? This is Wednesday morning. Let me tell you like my assessment and see where you are, Kat. So I felt like Sunday, the Biden campaign sort of turned a corner. Good appearance of the black church president had. Some members of Congress started coming out against him. They were all white members of Congress. Black members of Congress were having his back. The CBC comes out and says, you know, this is, of course, Sunday, Monday, they’re going to be for him. And, you know, he’s able to say sort of the elites in the party are against me, but I’m listening to voters and I’ve always had their back and they have mine. That worked for a while. But then I feel like the big thing today was, well, first of all, last night it was reported that Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado in a meeting of the Senate Democratic Caucus said that he did not think President Biden could win. It was also reported that Senator Sherrod Brown and Senator Jon Tester also said that. Michael Bennett went ahead and went on CNN last night to say, yes, I said that, and I’m not going to say one thing privately and one thing publicly. We’re not going to do what the Republicans do. We’re saying it out loud. I don’t think he can win. And then former Speaker Pelosi was on “Morning Show” this morning with a very tepid support for the president. (BEGIN AUDIO) Nancy Pelosi: It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. The, I think, overwhelming support of the caucus, it’s not for me to say, I’m not the head of the caucus anymore, but he’s beloved. He is respected and people want him to make that decision, not me. Jonathan Lemire: He has said he has made the decision. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run? Nancy Pelosi: I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that’s the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with. (END AUDIO) Jennifer Palmieri: She kept saying we want him to make his decision, even though we all know he’s already made a decision to stay in and kind of noted that the NATO summit was happening and sort of a takeaway is maybe, you know, I think if you’re a member of Congress, you’re trying to read the tea leaves here and thinking, okay, it sounds like Pelosi is saying everybody hold your fire until the summit is over, but there’s still some pretty serious concerns here. What’s your take? What do you think the Biden campaign should do? Mark McKinnon: Well, I agree with you. I think the Biden campaign did an artful job of trying to shore up, you know, what little support they had and really threaded the needle with the congressional black caucus and -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: -- with his schedule calling in the “Morning Joe,” all of that was, you know, pinpoint perfect exactly what they needed to do to shore up the dam. But -- Jennifer Palmieri: And like, just live for another day. I mean -- Mark McKinnon: Live for another day, exactly. I think that’s it. Jennifer Palmieri: We have both been in these situations. It’s just like get through that. Mark McKinnon: Get to tomorrow. The problem is tomorrow -- Jennifer Palmieri: Get to tomorrow. Mark McKinnon: -- tomorrow has not been any better. In fact, a lot worse, particularly, and especially because of Nancy Pelosi. I mean, you don’t have to be a deep student of the game to understand, first of all, how formidable she is and how nuanced. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: I mean, she is the Zen master and her statement that it’s up to the president to decide if he’s going to run. Well, what? I thought he said that. Jennifer Palmieri: Could he be more clear? Mark McKinnon: Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Could he be more clear? Mark McKinnon: She’s just giving him more runways. Like, okay, we’re good. We’re good here a little more time. And the problem is that, yeah, I mean, the whole elites and the media are after us is fine -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Mark McKinnon: -- but there’s more and more data coming in and it’s worse and worse and worse. Voters. Jennifer Palmieri: And this is the thing I want to pause for people. You know, we’ve been on a journey with our listeners in the last two weeks and this podcast is like, I’ve been very convinced by my former Republican friends, not my former friends, but my friends who are former Republicans, like Stuart Stevens. You’ve been in a different place. So we’ll talk about the place you’ve been in, but like Michael Steele, who were like, why would you not have the president’s back. Have his back. He’s your guy. It’s crazy to try to switch somebody out at this point. The only time people lose is when incumbents back out. This is crazy. I don’t see any use of like beating up on the president and doing harm to him while we were in this sort of like two weeks suspended animation period where you’re trying to figure out how’s he really doing -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- and how are the American people absorbing this. And you know, we’ve been saying, you got to wait two weeks for the American people to really sort of absorb what happened and reflect their sentiment and polls. And that’s why you see people like Michael Bennett going on television to say he can’t win now, where he wouldn’t have done that a week ago. That’s why I think Speaker Pelosi said what you said today is because it seems like maybe the bigger risk is keeping him, you know, there’s all sorts of risks and we can talk about them, about having a new person, but where you have an electoral map that looks like Trump winning in a landslide and it’s not, you know, a one-off. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, exactly right. I mean, the data is sort of incontrovertible now. I mean, you got a few days ago, Biden was sort of arguing with George Stephanopoulos, oh, you know, we’re within the margin of error. Well, not anymore. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, not anymore. Okay. So I think we’d have to switch this topic from if I were in the Biden campaign headquarters, what I would do as opposed to if I were in charge of the Democratic Party, not that there is such a person, like, what do you think should happen now, Kat? Mark McKinnon: I’m with James Carville, you know, he was the guy who -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh my God, the Democrats have talent ideas. Okay, explain the idea and then explain the idea. Mark McKinnon: Well, listen, I mean, broadly the idea is you have two options. You either have what appears to be a sure loss and perhaps a devastating one that takes out the House and the Senate, just takes everybody down. That’s one alternative. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Mark McKinnon: Or you have -- Jennifer Palmieri: You mean by keeping President Biden? Mark McKinnon: -- by keeping President Biden. Or you have what is certainly and admittedly a chaotic, unknown nomination of somebody, and we’re not sure exactly how it happens, but it can happen. I mean, you just make it happen. And there’s lots of different ideas about it. Carville has this kind of weird mini convention idea, and I’m not sure about that. But what I will tell you is that it would be dramatic, it’d be interesting, it’d be compelling, it’d be exciting. You know, Democrats would be all tuned in. I mean, the alternative is just this horrible, depressing slog. God, you know, imagine how great it would be for “The Circus” to be covering a Democratic open convention. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Mark McKinnon: And so, you know, I’m for anything other than sure death. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. The James Carville idea, what I think is not workable about it, his idea is that President Obama and President Clinton would select four sort of tickets that could be possible nominees, and then the two of them would host town halls as sort of a mini primary. Like, Obama and Clinton are not going to play that role. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: There’s just no scenario. Obama and Clinton are like, if people want to run -- Mark McKinnon: You’re going to piss off everybody but eight people, yeah. No, that’s not workable, but just the general principle of opening it up on four, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Right, right. Yeah, like, they’re like, if people want to run for president, they should do that. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: They don’t need President Obama, President Clinton to select them. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, he overcomplicated it. He put too many ingredients in the stew. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, yeah. And I think one question people are wrestling with is, how did we get here? Like, how did the Democrats find themselves in this position? You wrote about this a few times, sort of, you know, raising the alarm about where you thought this was headed. You predicted, and you’re like, something’s going to happen that’s going to be a huge deal and shake up this race, and here we are. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: I think it’s worth saying, like, what do we think should have happened? Mark McKinnon: Well, I’ll just roll back the tape a little bit to just say, you know, I think, like, a lot of people, and certainly a lot of never Trump Republicans, I supported Biden in ‘20, and I think there is an inarguable case, there’s lots of data points to prove it, that Biden was likely the only Democrat that would have won in ‘20. Now, I think he may be the only Democrat that could lose to Trump. And the great tragedy of all this is that it not only, you know, will hurt the Democratic Party, hurt the country, it hurts Joe Biden and his legacy. He could have gone out a hero. And you know, Jennifer, there’s, and again, just, you know, there’s receipts for this about how he said pretty explicitly, I intend to be a one-term president. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Mark McKinnon: And there was nothing but upside for that for Biden. He had a lot of good stuff that he did, could have just gotten the gold watch, been great Uncle Joe presider over the convention, been the hero, and gone out with a great legacy. And he has risked all of that. And by the way, and this is an interesting point, you know, his sort of fundamental message was Trump’s all about me and I’m about you. Well, now because of all this, everybody say, well, I guess Joe Biden’s just about himself too. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. It is like, I don’t, I don’t love being in the situation of, you know, I try not to be too precious about this, right, because you can say, well, it doesn’t seem like the president is up to the job and we can’t be just like the Republicans. So we should push him to, to step back from being the nominee. That’s just a big gamble when there’s a lot on the line for this country, particularly, you know, obviously very worried about democracy, but there’s people in the country that’d be far more impacted than I would -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- by a Trump presidency. But I think we are at the point now where the bigger risk is looking like holding on to him. The other thing that, and John Stewart made this point on Monday, that four months is a lifetime. The other thing that I think people sort of come to terms with today is like, we’re all holding our breath now about the NATO press conference. How’s he going to do in the NATO press conference, which is on Thursday, and it’s like, okay, the polls are not good. We can’t be holding our breath every time he has to do an event and it’s still his decision and that’s still like, I’m not clear on how it would actually happen. But in my mind on, you know, Wednesday morning, it’s been like a 51-49 decision all along in my head about like, what’s the thing to do here with an integrity? What’s the responsible thing here to do? What’s the thing that honors President Biden, but protects the country? And it’s, you know, it’s feeling like that 51 is now on him leaving as opposed to saying. But now there’s a question about Vice President Harris. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: So piled on for four years and still her polling’s not so bad. Mark McKinnon: Well, she’s polling better than Biden. And I -- Jennifer Palmieri: Do you know what I mean, though? Like the coverage has been, you know, she’s covered intermittently. As you know, I’ve written two books about this. There’s way too much gender and race bias. Mark McKinnon: There’s just something about her. Jennifer Palmieri: There’s just something about her I don’t like. So, like a room to grow, very effective in making the argument against Trump. We saw that in the rally she did last night, very effective prosecutor versus a convicted felon. Talk about her as a nominee. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. I think in Trump world, you know, the smartest writers saying, be careful what you ask for. I think that her stock is really low and her value is really, really high. And what I mean by that is just, I think that she’s been subject to a lot of very critical press, a lot of it unfair, some of it fair, but the point is that people don’t really know her and she’s formidable. I mean, she’s the vice president of the United States. She didn’t get there by accident. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: And you know, you’ve been around her. I’ve been around her. When I’ve been around her, I’m like blown away by her. I think she’s really impressive. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: And a lot of the stuff is such inside the beltway. Management stuff, she’s not a good manager. Well, you know, some -- Jennifer Palmieri: That’s a female trope. People think women aren’t good managers. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, a hundred percent. So I think what’s going to happen is that, it’ll have a huge ballast effect when people actually kind of see her, if she were leading the ticket and go, oh my God, that she’s way better than I heard. You know, they’re going to be like, oh shit, this woman was, you know, and she’s a woman which helps the Democrats and she’s a former prosecutor. So if you like -- Jennifer Palmieri: I love you for thinking women help Democrats-- Mark McKinnon: -- if you just put on paper, like who would be great, just, you know, generically without a name, you say a black woman, a former prosecutor, a former vice president of the United States, that’d be perfect, right -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: -- to run against Trump. That’s exactly what you’d want. Jennifer Palmieri: It is. I mean, everybody else is like, you want the opposite of Trump. That is, you know, but it’s pretty good about the opposite of Trump. Mark McKinnon: Yes, hundred percent. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. So there’s two scenarios for how this can go down. One is the president steps aside and he, you know, endorses vice president. And I think, you know, sort of in that scenario, like we’re all just, we’re kind of guessing, but I’ll lay out two scenarios for people so that you can talk people through the relative merits of both. Maybe the president says, you know, and I endorse my vice president and she goes to Chicago. Presumably people don’t challenge her or situation, president is like I’m stepping aside and the party will decide in which case maybe people do challenge her. I don’t know. But what do you think? Mark McKinnon: I think the best outcome for him and for her is for him to say, listen, we’re Democrats. We compete. I love my vice president, but go out there and compete. And then I think she’ll win it. I mean, I just think the physics are such that -- Jennifer Palmieri: She would win. She would win big. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, she would. Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Go to Chicago, win it. Mark McKinnon: Then she’s stronger for having won it. Jennifer Palmieri: Then she’s starting off with a win. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. And it makes her stronger. So I think that’s the way to go. Jennifer Palmieri: A little palate cleanser. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, exactly. Jennifer Palmieri: I don’t mean to be irreverent. These are serious matters. Yeah. You know, we got a question from Bethany about, you know, some people, a fear of market convention, but whether that might give Democrat’s momentum. Mark McKinnon: I think it’d be one of the most interesting events historically ever. Can you imagine the audience -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: -- and people tuning in to see what would happen rather than, you know, slogging through the next few months with Joe Biden? It’d be electric and -- Jennifer Palmieri: Trust democracy, man. Right. Trust democracy. Mark McKinnon: We’d have to bring “The Circus” back. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my God. Yeah, man. Yeah we would, I’m for that. Amen. Mark McKinnon and I are going to take a quick break. When we’re back, NBC correspondent Vaughn Hillyard stops by to pre-game the GOP convention with us. Back with Mark and Vaughn in a minute. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. We’re less than a week away from the 2024 Republican convention, because that’s happening. And though Trump apparently thinks Milwaukee is a, quote, “horrible city,” the home of Brewers, brats and beer will play host this cycle. So what should we be watching for? What are the party’s expectations? And what has Trump been up to while everyone in the Democratic world has been obsessed with President Biden? To give us some pregame analysis, Vaughn Hillyard, yay, joins me and my excellent co-host this week, Mark McKinnon. Vaughn is an intrepid NBC News correspondent covering the Trump campaign. Welcome, Vaughn. Thanks so much for joining us. Vaughn Hillyard: Hi, guys. I appreciate you having me. This forum is a little different than being on the campaign trail, I’ll say with you guys. Mark McKinnon: You know, the thing about Vaughn, Jennifer, is I always, wherever I was on the campaign, if I’d see Vaughn, it just brightened my day. It’s like, all right, Vaughn’s here. Jennifer Palmieri: First of all, brightens your day. Second of all, you run to him and you say, Vaughn, what is actually happening here? Whether that was -- I mean, I did that so many times, whether that was CPAC in Maryland, Vaughn, what is happening? Mark McKinnon: Yeah. He’s the guy who’d actually done his homework, was working hard up at the crack of dawn. Vaughn Hillyard: I appreciate that. Jennifer Palmieri: Particularly Arizona. What is going on with the Maricopa County vote counting situation, Vaughn? It’s like that one -- Vaughn Hillyard: It seems like our meetings are always under dire circumstances. And the least we can do is smile at each other. Mark McKinnon: Always got a smile. Jennifer Palmieri: This is true, this is true. Mark McKinnon: That’s what we love about Vaughn. Jennifer Palmieri: So the GOP convention’s next week. So we want to talk about like how that is. I mean, I’ve heard nothing about it. Just nothing. I’ve heard that on Monday, they’re going to talk about the economy. Somewhere along the way, I came across that. Vaughn Hillyard: We’re still waiting for the speakers. We don’t know who’s speaking yet. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. You know, it’s been sort of eight years since there was a normal-ish Republican convention. But last time I went to it, I think McKinnon did too in D.C. It was at the Department of Commerce, and it was just kind of like a rolling Trump variety show. And each day they would decide, oh, today we’re going to do this and that and bring this person up to the stage. Almost like a telethon back in the days from like the ‘80s. Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: Can you preview it? What do we know? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. We know they have some themes that they’re going to strike on. The idea is Monday is going to be make America safe once again. They’re going to have these themes that they are going to have each day programmed around, and the speakers should accompany that. But it’s going to be a Milwaukee here. There’s a lot of question marks. This is a moment in which Donald Trump is reshaped the Republican Party in his image. There are some outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, Turning Point, others who helped craft that Project 2025 policy document -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- that now Donald Trump is suddenly trying to distance himself from. But this is all coming to a head because there are so many conservative right-wing groups that see the potential in four months’ time of a transition that they get to be a part of in a potential second Trump administration. So this Republican convention, it’s not even just about Donald Trump and about beating Joe Biden, but it’s about what could four years of Trump administration and Republican majorities in Congress accomplish. And that’s what I’m expecting a lot of that discourse to be about come next week. Mark McKinnon: I’ll tell you who’s not going to be there, Bruce Springsteen or Beyonce or any entertainer worth a nickel. I was the guy at the Republican conventions who got the worst job in the world, which was get entertainment for the Republican convention. And I’d make a thousand phone calls, you know, the list of people everybody wanted. They got turned down 999 times, except for Lee Greenwood, the Oak Ridge Boys, and Wayne Newton. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, man. Vaughn Hillyard: Kid Rock, too. Kid Rock, too, right? Mark McKinnon: Kid Rock, yes. Kid Rock was -- Jennifer Palmieri: And half of Journey. Not all of Journey, just half of Journey. That one guy is like, don’t associate me with these crazy people. Vaughn Hillyard: Well, a lot of people are going to be left off the list, and that includes those people can stand by Nikki Haley, because to our understanding, Nikki Haley did not even receive a convention invite. So there you go. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, so who is speaking? Do we know anything? Vaughn Hillyard: I mean, we’ll know whether he has a VP pick. We still don’t know that answer yet. And so I think that there are some who would obviously like jobs in the administration. We have watched the Republican Party coalesce around Donald Trump once again, because as we all know from having covered politics, been in politics, that the access to power is, that scent is strong. And the Republican Party of today is Donald Trump’s. And so you’ve got to cozy up and you’ve got to do your part if you want a job at an agency or a department. Mark McKinnon: Listen, I think the big thing here is the dogs that aren’t barking, right, on everything, on the convention, on Biden. I mean, they’re just strategically have this thing buttoned on 2025. I mean, it’s all like, let’s just hold our fire. Nobody talks out of turn. Nobody leaks. I mean, this is just such a different Trump operation than we’ve ever seen before, right? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. That’s absolutely right. I mean, look, there has been no campaign staff turnover. He launched this campaign back in November of 2022. And I’ve talked to a lot of people directly in the campaign, outside of the campaign. They say the reason it’s so effective this time around is that nobody is being kept away from Donald Trump. So, the top senior advisers, Susie Wiles, she is somebody who is running a tight ship for this Trump campaign in 2024. But if Stephen Miller wants to call up Donald Trump, if Steve Bannon, when he’s not in jail, wants to call up Donald Trump, anybody’s able to do that. We’re past iterations. They tried to be the gatekeepers. You can’t visit Donald Trump in the Oval Office, right? Stay away. Jennifer Palmieri: So Susie is like to smarts, she’s smart enough to realize, don’t even try to do that. And if you have, if you make a more open campaign, the backdoor folks, the folks that try to go through the backdoor, just open the front door, let them in. And it’s going to be more productive that way. Is that -- Vaughn Hillyard: That’s absolutely. We’ve talked about let Trump be Trump for so many years. This iteration 2024 is truly let Trump be Trump and that’s what you should expect from the White House in 2025 if he wins. Mark McKinnon: You know, the funny thing is you remember, like 2015, you know, as a former operative, I was watching a lot of people, you know, go around to the different campaigns and interview. And as you recall, there were 18 candidates. If you were interviewing and you were, you know, up and coming Republican operative, your 18th interview was Donald Trump, right? You got turned down 17 times first. Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Mark McKinnon: So that was the caliber back in 2016. It was broken toys, but it is a different show this time for sure. Vaughn Hillyard: Totally. I mean, Jason Miller is his top really communication senior advisor. And I remember Jason Miller had been working as the comms director for Ted Cruz. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, right. Vaughn Hillyard: And in that spring of 2016, Jason, you know, was referring to Donald Trump being a tornado and tweeting up a storm. And then two months later, that was the first time when he went and joined the campaign and made all of us turn our heads. It was like, oh, we see where the Republican party is going. And eight years later, Jason Miller is still at the forefront of this operation and has the deep trust of Donald Trump to this day. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: So, okay. We don’t really know who’s going to speak. Normally you would be like, oh, have the runner up speak. And then there’s a nice coming together of the party. But like, you know, obviously we’re well past that because this is Trump’s Republican party. I do want to get to Project 2025 because I think that one thing, even as the Democrats have been distracted by our own problems, that I think Project 2025 as the Republican blueprint for what Donald Trump will do in a second term is breaking through. I will like laud my former colleagues, the Center for American Progress. I was supposed to be there yesterday and I got sick, but they did a day long forum about what it would mean. There are good resources on their website. You know, the Republican party, the platform, Trump himself is trying to back away from Project 2025. I do think the Democrats, I mean, obviously there’s four months to go and a lot of work to do, but they’re doing a good job driving this message. It’s like, no, this is the agenda -- Mark McKinnon: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: -- but tell us what’s actually happening with Project 2025. What’s the right way to think about it? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans have really latched on to the idea of what Project 2025 is. On paper, Project 2025 is a 900-plus page roadmap of policies for departments and agencies that the Heritage Foundation, several close Donald Trump advisors and allies wrote in the lead up to, if there were to be a second Trump administration, they could turn over to the individuals that will fill out those personnel roles to ultimately execute on those policies. And then, you know, some of the policies written about including, right, making sure that it’s federally enforced, that no abortion medication can be sent through the mail. That’s one of the policies in there. And that is where Donald Trump understands that some of those policies were not popular among a majority of the American electorate. And so over the weekend, he put out, I don’t know anything about Project 2025. I don’t know who’s behind it. Let’s be very clear. That’s not true. He knows who is behind it. Russ Vogt, who was his former OMB director, is not only one of the authors of Project 2025, but was also one of the authors of literally the Republican Party platform that Donald Trump just signed on to as the proposed platform this very week. And so it’s really tough for him to disassociate with people like Ben Carson, who is another one of the authors of Project 2025. And this is coming at a time where, I’ll just tell you, I had an interview lined up with Paul Danz, who is a former personnel chief of staff in the Donald Trump White House, lined up for this Monday, and they called and canceled that interview after the social media post by Donald Trump saying he wanted nothing to do with Project 2025. So suddenly the conservative apparatus around Donald Trump is sort of in a holdup situation because Trump understands that some of the policies that are being proposed are not popular with the majority of the American public. Yet those who would fill out the personnel and fill out the administration are those individuals who are the ones writing these very policies. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay, for both of you all, the interesting thing is that whereas maybe at a different time Trump could walk something back, like Project 2025, I think because we have seen the Supreme Court, you know, come out with the immunity decision, usually the best-case scenario for Trump, the worst-case scenario for democracy seems to follow any policy that Trump proposes and also what the Supreme Court rules. So I think the Democrats will have success in hanging this on them if we could ever get to making that argument. But for both of you all, what do you expect? I have noticed the former President Trump has sort of held off on really attacking Biden. And while Biden’s going through his thing, rally last night, how much do you expect to see of like bashing the vice president at this convention? This is for both of you. How much do you think it’s about bashing Biden? Is this where the gloves come off and they really start hitting Biden and not being up for the job? What do we expect in terms of how they define the opposition? Mark McKinnon: Listen, I think until literally it is impossible to switch out Biden, they’re going to be careful about just how much they attack Biden because their worst nightmare is that it gets switched out to anybody, including Kamala. I expect there to be sort of a general attack on the policies and what have you. But I think the full-throated kind of, you know, the debate clips and that sort of thing, if I’m around Trump, I’m saying, hold your fire, hold your fire, hold your fire because again, the smartest thing that I’ve seen them do in this whole campaign is don’t catch a falling knife. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: Just let it go because what we don’t want is, you know, the X factor. We know Biden, we know it is, we know we got, we know how to do this campaign. What we don’t want is the unknown. And Kamala’s, you know, somewhat known, but again, it’s an X factor. And, you know, look at the data right now with Biden and man, that’s exactly what we want. The main role is don’t screw that up. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Vaughn Hillyard: And Donald Trump, this is the matchup he wants because for eight years, he has tried to convey to the American public, this idea of strength versus weakness, right? It was Marco Rubio, eight years ago, who literally referred to him as third world, strong man rhetoric, who somebody who says, put your faith in me, I’ll make things better and -- Jennifer Palmieri: As if it was a bad thing. Vaughn Hillyard: -- as if that was a bad thing, right? Jennifer Palmieri: And now Rubio like runs around saying it in worship in his, part of it, yeah-- Vaughn Hillyard: He’s on the stage with him. And so for Donald Trump, I alone can fix it, right? Dictator on day one, greater use of the executive office. That is the type of idea of strength that Donald Trump wants to convey. And so the extent to which he can draw a contrast with somebody who he conveys as being weak, that is a matchup politically, characteristically that Donald Trump feels comfortable with. Jennifer Palmieri: So do you think that they’ll go after the vice president then? Because even if President Biden stays as the nominee, you know, she’s going to be a big factor, you know, as it’s already made a successor. Vaughn Hillyard: Absolutely. At the rally in Doral, Florida, he gave her a nickname and he began to go -- Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, and good for you for not repeating it. Vaughn Hillyard: He began to go on the attack -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- against her. And I think that this is the part where, right, he referred to her as insurance policy and trying to degrade her -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- in the public’s mind that the only reason Joe Biden picked her is because, right, he knew that they wouldn’t replace him with her, right. Which, of course, there’s just nothing to that. But this is the message that Donald Trump is going to try to convince the great share of the American population. Mark McKinnon: I expect a lot of that because what they want to do is say, don’t switch horses, because if you do, here’s what you’re going to get. Here’s what’s coming. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Yeah. But she is pretty formidable in making the argument against him. We saw that. Also, I can trust that whatever they do to critique the vice president, they will overshoot and manage to hurt themselves. Mark McKinnon: Yeah. You can count on that. Jennifer Palmieri: I think we can count on that. Okay, we’re going to take a quick break here. But Vaughn Hillyard, please stick with Mark McKinnon and me. When we’re back, we’re going to look at Trump’s veepstakes as his campaign says, he’ll be deciding on a running mate in short order. Also, he needs to because this person has to be nominated by the convention next week. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. While Claire is living her best life on a well-deserved vacation, although is she? Because she just texted me asking me if I could talk to catch her up on what was happening. So maybe she’s actually not living her best life. Anyway. Mark McKinnon: Step away from your iPhone, Claire. Jennifer Palmieri: But I’m thrilled to have my co-captain Mark McKinnon joining today and our guest, NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hillyard is also still with us. Okay, so Vaughn, Mark, let’s look at Trump’s veepstakes. We’re recording this on Wednesday morning. So if this happened already, you can go ahead and skip ahead to the part where we do listener questions. But tell us, you know, Vaughn, starting with you, who’s it down to? Anything you know about timing? Vaughn Hillyard: He could wait all the way to the convention at this point, right? I mean, let the Biden news cycle play out. And for him, try to draw attention to the Milwaukee Convention in a somewhat splashy way. Right now, this is not the VP shortlist that I thought that he was going to come down to, like the three finalists being fluttered about here. You’re talking about J.D. Vance, somebody who called him literally an idiot in 2016, who said he was reprehensible and suggested he would vote for Hillary Clinton before Donald Trump. He is now the Ohio senator, largely got into the Senate with Donald Trump’s endorsement. He is somebody who is on that shortlist here. You’ve got Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, who just one year ago told NBC’s Chuck Todd that he would never go into business with Donald Trump. He’s on the shortlist. And then you’ve got Marco Rubio, who we have gone over about their vicious relationship in 2016. Mark McKinnon: Small hands. Vaughn Hillyard: And, you know, I was told by somebody, don’t rule out somebody like Ben Carson, though, somebody from Michigan, somebody who is not going to be a threat that wouldn’t want to run for president again. You still have Elise Stefanik, the New York congresswoman, who has been perhaps his best and most ardent defender, somebody who is impeachment manager to defend him, somebody who clearly has aspirations herself. But, you know, I think the question here for Donald Trump is he threw Mike Pence off the cliff because ultimately, he wasn’t loyal to him on January 6 and certified the election results. And so each of these individuals, if you’re Donald Trump, there are reasons to still question. There is not a natural fit at this point for him as a VP, understanding what Donald Trump wants out of one. Jennifer Palmieri: Kat, what do you think about, like, who would be best for him? Mark McKinnon: Well, you know, I look at it completely politically, which, you know, I mean, you really as Karl Rove says, you should pick the person who would be the best vice president. But, you know, I would look at, you know, how do you add votes? And I think that’s a no brainer. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: Pick Nikki Haley. I mean, you had 20 percent of Republican voters staying at home or voting for Haley when she technically wasn’t even on the ticket. So to me, that’s just a place where you, you know, addition, not subtraction and -- Jennifer Palmieri: A little bit, maybe. But like that vote, don’t you think that vote was mostly just an anti-Trump vote, not like a pro-Nikki Haley vote? Mark McKinnon: Yes, and yes. But I think also it’s additive. Again, I think it’s a sign of the strategic smarts of the campaign this time around that it’s not a bunch of MAGA celebrities on the list. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: There would be no addition of a MAGA celebrity and -- Jennifer Palmieri: You mean like who’s a MAGA celebrity, like Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene? Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Yeah. Any of those, you know, any of those. Jennifer Palmieri: Kari Lake. Mark McKinnon: Yep. Yep. Exactly. I think that, again, of the list that’s there, the person I pick is Rubio. Because again, I’m looking at it politically. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, me, too. Mark McKinnon: How do you expand the tent? Well, you know, show that you’re more of a more diverse party. You know, I think it should either be a woman or a minority. That’s what I would do. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Right. Mark McKinnon: Again, it’s a very political consideration, but, you know, that’s what I would get paid to do is, you know, figure out how do you win the election. And to try to figure out how to win the election, not govern, then, you know, get somebody who’ll bring more votes. And of course, the Trump Republican Party has made huge inroads with Hispanics. So a Rubio pick, I think, would be a home run. Jennifer Palmieri: And Vaughn, like, are they going through the normal sort of vetting process or that’s just like not a thing with these people, right? So it could be, I think that’s when they’re like, oh, who’s on the list? And I was like, anyone’s on the list, right? He could just -- Vaughn Hillyard: Right. Eight years ago, I mean, Mike Pence went through the longtime formal process that Republican VP candidates have typically gone through, go through the law firm, turn over all relevant documents. Mike Pence, even there was a rally in Indianapolis the night before that Donald Trump ultimately offered him the running mate slot there. It was kind of a final tryout for Mike Pence to come and take the stage alongside him and really show his political chops in front of the crowd. And that’s why it was interesting last night. Rubio spoke before the event, like two hours before Trump took the stage, but Trump never actually invited him onto stage, which if we’re looking for echoes of the past time, we went through this, he did do that with Mike Pence and never afforded any more time to that stage to Marco Rubio. So I thought that was unique. Jennifer Palmieri: That is very interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: And if he chose Rubio, I don’t think Mark is wrong on political advantages. Marco Rubio, they’re both residents from Florida. And I have a hard time believing that Donald Trump would give up his residency in Florida. And so if Marco Rubio, because of the understanding that Florida electors -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Vaughn Hillyard: -- you can’t have the VP and president from the same state, suddenly you would be looking at Marco Rubio giving up his residency in Florida and therefore no longer being a senator, so. Mark McKinnon: But that’s an upside for Trump. That means they get a Senate pick. Vaughn Hillyard: There you go. He gets to pick somebody in his mold. Jennifer Palmieri: And do you think it matters, like say, if the vice president, do you think that she, like Kamala Harris, weighs in on this decision at all, right? Either the matchup of a debate with her and the running mate or the notion that she may be, the possibility of her being the nominee? Mark McKinnon: Well, again, if I’m if I’m one of the strategists around, I say pick a woman. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: You know, the one advantage that Democrats have is Harris and the abortion issue. Let’s take it off the table or let’s minimize it. Let’s neutralize it. Vaughn Hillyard: Trump said two weeks ago that he had made up in his mind who the VP pick was going to be, but was waiting to announce. But then here just this week, he has suggested that he is now waiting to see whether Biden stays on the ticket and ultimately that could play into his determination. So in Donald Trump’s own words, to provide credence to that. Jennifer Palmieri: And Vicky’s asking me about Katie Britt. Like what happened there? I mean, what I had heard was that President Trump, that he initially liked -- Vaughn Hillyard: Oh, listen, I’ve never seen anybody’s stock fall so fast. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, but then I was at an event and he brought her up. He’s like, Katie Britt, what about her? And people were like, yay, didn’t seem to focus group well with this crowd. Mark McKinnon: Well, I mean, she was a disaster in her State of the Union response. I think that’s when her stock fell. Again -- Jennifer Palmieri: I’m glad that that seems to be the collective view because -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah, she would have been great, right? I mean, horrible from your point of view. Jennifer Palmieri: Well, I know enough to know that in her normal life -- Mark McKinnon: She’s normal, right? Jennifer Palmieri: -- as I know her well. Yeah, she’s a normie, as Sarah Longwood would-- Mark McKinnon: She would have been a Mark McKinnon pick for sure. Yeah. You know, appeal to independent suburban housewives. Jennifer Palmieri: I’m glad you’re no longer on their team, Kinnon. A closing question to you both. There is such this media frenzy over Biden. What stories, narratives are being missed right now in the two weeks that we’ve been obsessed with how our president is doing? Vaughn Hillyard: I think it’s wild, but it’s policy. You know, Joe Biden keeps coming back to the message of, look what I’ve done. Look at the last three and a half years. Look at all the legislative achievements we’ve had. The economy has come back. You know, we had the largest job growth ever for an administration. Donald Trump is talking about his first administration and yet lost. And a lot of this is ultimately what policies would either administration enact in the second term because it’s been very much clouded over either’s ability to actually run Washington in an effective way. Number one for Biden over age and for two for Trump purely coming off of January 6 and his respect for our institutions. There are serious questions as to just the basic governance of what Washington could look like as opposed to what actual legislation and policies could best help the American people. Mark McKinnon: Yeah, I think that’s right. I think it’s a policy, you know, bounce back to policy where you have some real credibility. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: And the big disconnect for me has been, you know, the reality of the economy versus the perception of the economy. And I would just be banging that like a drum as hard as I could every single day. Jennifer Palmieri: The thing that struck me about the Stephanopoulos interview that I really have not heard commented on is he asked zero policy questions. Mark McKinnon: Oh, interesting. Jennifer Palmieri: Zero. Mark McKinnon: Interesting. Jennifer Palmieri: That’s not what I expected. I mean, I’m not criticizing him. I was like, oh, I thought the interview was to show if the president was up to the job. So, like, ask him about, you know, dealing with NATO, ask him about -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- what’s next with Gaza. I mean, I really, particularly with George, you know -- Mark McKinnon: That’s true. Jennifer Palmieri: -- I really thought that’s what we were getting and instead it was all -- Mark McKinnon: Yeah, exactly. And I heard somebody commenting on that this morning to say that somebody who knows Biden really well. And they just said, you know, the problem is that if it were just the question whether or not Biden could be president, he’d kill it. It’s just can he be a candidate for the office? That’s where the problem is. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. And it’s like, I mean, it’s a very tough situation to be in. Like, well, why aren’t you dropping out for 22 minutes as opposed to like seeing him parry questions that are actually about the job? Okay, anyway, switching gears to listener questions. So we love the notes and e-mails that you have been sending. It really helps to know what’s resonating with y’all as voters and questions. And, you know, it helps us to formulate how we’re putting the show together. So please keep them coming. And Vaughn has happily agreed to stick around with me and Mark. So this is interesting. This is from Mike in D.C. Kat; I’m going to -- let’s go to you. Is anybody in a position of authority within the party mentioning Governor Roy Cooper as a possible replacement for President Biden? He may be a little older than I’d like, 67. Oh, that’s tough. That’s tough, Kat. But he’s a whippersnapper compared to Trump. And he’s won again and again in a red state. He’d also bring North Carolina into play. What do you think about Roy Cooper? Mark McKinnon: I love him. I think he’s very much along the sort of Clinton model of, you know, a more sort of centrist Southern Democrat, which I think is great for the party. That’s why I think Beshear is talked about a lot in Kentucky. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Mark McKinnon: A younger Southern Democrat. But yes, I think Cooper is a big talent and, you know, won in a Southern state. And so those are precisely the sort of people that I’d look to, to expand the appeal of the Democratic Party. We talked about what Republicans need to do. Jennifer Palmieri: But as a running mate. I mean, this Mike was asking as the actual nominee. I don’t think any scenario where Roy Cooper becomes the nominee. You know, but like a running mate for Vice President Harris. Mark McKinnon: Harris, Cooper would be great. Yeah. Harris-Cooper. Harris-Beshear. Yes, a hundred percent. Yeah, balance the ticket with somebody from the South. You know, he’d be top three for me. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. So Bethany wrote, since the debate, Trump has not dominated headlines. Trump has used negative media to his advantage in the past. I think she means, right, like, you know, here’s no bad press for Donald Trump, right? He just embraces everything. Since Biden has a lot of negative media right now, is there any way to use this to his advantage? Similarly, could a drama at the Democratic Convention dominate the headlines and work in the Dems’ favor? I’m going to answer the first part of that question, because I think that the Biden campaign has done, I mean, look, they’re in a very difficult situation and I think the campaign has done just about everything they can to get the president in a good place to, you know, announce him to the president to prove that he can do this, right? But I think that one thing that they did a good job with was taking, you know, over the weekend, you saw this start to happen on Sunday when the president went to that black church and got a good response. And meanwhile, some white members of Congress and other elites, definitely like “New York Times” columnists, I saw that George Clooney just wrote a “Times” column saying that he should drop out. And it’s like, you know, Ari Emanuel, another, you know, Hollywood agent. So it’s like Hollywood, big donors, white members of Congress, not the Congressional Black Caucus calling on him to resign. And so then it’s like Joe Biden versus everybody. Joe Biden versus the elites. And that, I think for a while, I’m not sure that that sort of threat, you know, that this exists, but it did seem to give him a boost, at least in the short term, of a different kind of fight. Like, it’s me against everybody and I’m fighting for you and I’m not on the sides of the elites. And, you know, in his mind, he has never been on the side of elites his entire life. This has given him an opportunity to do that. Vaughn, what do you think? Vaughn Hillyard: Right. I think that this is one of those moments where, I think it was Bernie Sanders this week, who was on the front lines of saying the messaging for the party needs to get back to its roots, the working class. What are we fighting for? And that is with every passing day, this is already going to be a difficult enough race. But the party is distracted from convincing the American public that Donald Trump’s version of populism is not the right one for in terms of actual execution here. And, you know, Donald Trump in the meanwhile, right? Like, everybody kind of knows what to expect out of him at this point. And that’s where, like, the lies that he said on the debate really didn’t come as a shock to, I think, us or most Americans. But even in Doral, at his campaign rally in Florida this week, he, again, called for the release of the so-called hostages, January 6th attackers, saying they’re unfairly imprisoned. And I think that so much of that, which he repeats over and over, gets lost in all of this. And so I think he has sort of flooded the zone with bad headlines Donald Trump has over the years. It’s sometimes hard to disentangle them because he almost in so many ways embraces being convicted, embraces the fact that he wants to pardon January 6th attackers. And so it’s hard to wade through that messaging while also trying to have a forward-looking vision if you’re the Democratic Party. Jennifer Palmieri: But I do think that’s partly why Democratic members stopped calling on Biden to resign, largely, because I think what they understood, if they actually wanted him to not be the nominee, that they were fueling his fire by being a Washington insider, continuing to say that he should drop out. And I think that’s part of the reason why you largely saw people step back on Monday night, Tuesday, until Mikey Sherrill and Michael Bennet. And, Bethany, the Dem convention dominating the headlines covered that in the first segment, but that is a big thing on everybody’s minds right now. Thanks so much to Vaughn Hillyard, NBC News correspondent covering the Trump campaign. Look forward to seeing your coverage at next week’s convention. Vaughn Hillyard: I appreciate it, you guys. Jennifer Palmieri: So fun to have you. Vaughn Hillyard: Thanks. Jennifer Palmieri: And I want to give a special thanks to my co-host, Mark McKinnon. Mark and I were co-hosts in a previous life on Showtime’s “The Circus.” Mark was the, do we call him the co-creator? I call him the creator, co-executive producer and co-host of all eight seasons of the show. It was a glorious indulgence for eight years, and I got to be part of it for four years. And it was Mark’s idea and he worked 10 years to make it happen. And he’s a veteran campaign pro. He was previously an advisor to George W. Bush and John McCain, among with others. He also played guitar with Kris Kristofferson when that was a thing, people. Mark, thanks so much for hanging out with me today. Mark McKinnon: Kick it, sister.

Alabama Republican Party chair: Democracy ‘leads to socialism’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 8:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/alabama-republican-party-chair-democracy-leads-socialism-rcna161355,"In recent years, the Republican Party has been credibly accused of becoming hostile toward democracy. The evidence to bolster the allegations has been overwhelming: From voter suppression measures to election denialism to rejecting the certification of vote tallies, the contemporary GOP has been unsubtle in suggesting that Americans may no longer resolve our differences at the ballot box. But there’s another dimension to this that’s even less opaque: Some Republicans have been explicit in their rejection of democracy. AL.com’s Kyle Whitmire, for example, took note of the latest rhetoric from John Wahl, the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, who shared some odd thoughts during an appearance on a local radio program last week. To be sure, that’s quite a conspiracy theory. Rascally journalists, we’re apparently supposed to believe, have secretly launched an effort to convince Americans that they live in a democracy — not just to deceive them, but to advance the cause of “socialism.” As best as I can tell, Wahl wasn’t kidding. But the Alabama Republican isn’t alone. A few months ago, GOP officials in the state of Washington assembled for an election-year convention and passed a resolution that read in part, “We encourage Republicans to substitute the words ‘republic’ and ‘republicanism’ where previously they have used the word ‘democracy.’” The same resolution added that Republicans in the state of Washington “oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature.” One delegate to the state GOP convention declared at the event, “We are devolving into a democracy. ... We do not want to be a democracy.” Such thinking has even popped up on Capitol Hill. About a month before Election Day 2020, for example, Sen. Mike Lee raised a few eyebrows by declaring via social media that the United States is “not a democracy.” The Utah Republican added soon after, “Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity [sic] are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.” Nearly a year later, Sen. Rand Paul made a related argument. “The idea of democracy and majority rule really is what goes against our history and what the country stands for,” the Kentucky Republican argued in June 2021, despite reality. One need not be a hysterical partisan to accuse the Republican Party of growing increasingly hostile toward democracy; one need only quote Republican officials."
Why did GOP’s Jim Banks dodge questions about armed rebellion?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 7:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-jim-banks-dodge-questions-armed-rebellion-rcna161342,"Up until fairly recently, the “Appeal to Heaven” flag was a relatively obscure symbol, at least in contemporary times, though as a New York Times report recently noted, it’s become “a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump, for a religious strand of the ‘Stop the Steal’ campaign and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.” Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick added, “That flag is not merely another January 6 signifier but also rooted in John Locke’s ‘appeal to heaven,’ meaning ‘a responsibility to rebel, even use violence, to overthrow unjust rule.’” With this in mind, it was rather unsettling when the public learned that the Appeal to Heaven flag, also known as the Pine Tree flag, was hoisted above Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s vacation home in New Jersey last year. This week, the same symbol became politically relevant anew, thanks to the latest reporting from NOTUS’s Haley Byrd Wilt. Let’s back up and review how we arrived at this point. Hours after a jury convicted Trump of 34 felonies, Banks published an image — without text or a caption — of the Appeal to Heaven flag to his social media platform. (As of this morning, it remains the Indiana Republican’s pinned tweet, suggesting he places special significance on the symbol.) This led NOTUS to note that some commenters were speculating the image meant that the GOP congressman “might view what was happening to Trump as dire enough to warrant some new kind of American revolution.” Banks has been given a variety of opportunities to reject the idea of armed rebellion. He’s chosen not to take advantage of those opportunities. “I’ll let you make your own conclusions,” he told NOTUS. The outlet also asked the Republican lawmaker whether he condemns any kind of violent insurrection. Instead of saying “yes” or “of course,” Banks said he condemns “the Democrats for what they’ve done to weaponize the federal government against their political enemies.” (There is literally no evidence of Democrats weaponizing the federal government against their political enemies. There is, however, overwhelming evidence of Trump trying to weaponize the federal government against his political enemies — which Banks has never publicly criticized.) Asked whether he believed his promotion of the Appeal to Heaven flag, on the night of Trump’s conviction, could be misconstrued, Banks added, “I’m not sure what there is to misconstrue.” It seems like it would’ve been quite easy for the Indiana Republican — who’s all but certain to be elected to the Senate in the fall — simply to express his opposition to armed rebellion. For reasons he has not yet explained, Banks apparently doesn’t want to deliver such a message."
Michael Cohen asks Supreme Court to take up appeal alleging Trump retaliation,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 7:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/michael-cohen-supreme-court-trump-retaliation-rcna161107,"Michael Cohen wants the Supreme Court to take up his appeal seeking damages against Donald Trump and others for alleged retaliation during the former president’s administration. But while the petition from Trump’s former fixer serves to highlight the potential dangers of a revenge-packed second Trump term, he faces a tough road getting the justices to review his case. The appeal, filed Wednesday, stems from when Cohen was serving federal time for Trump-related crimes and he started writing a book that would be unfavorable to the then-president. He was released to home confinement in 2020 after the Covid pandemic broke out, but his lawyers say that when Cohen “did not agree immediately to waive his right to free speech, he was summarily sent back to prison and thrown into solitary confinement.” In addition to Trump, Cohen seeks damages against former Attorney General Bill Barr and other Trump-era officials. (Trump attorney Alina Habba has called the lawsuit frivolous.) His lawyers added in the petition that “the possibility that the federal government has the power to retaliate against critics with imprisonment, without any consequence for or check against the officials engaged in such retaliation, is a chilling prospect.” No doubt. But the problem Cohen faces is that the legal mechanism he invokes for his lawsuit is one that the Supreme Court has all but abandoned. In a 1971 case called Bivens, the court allowed a damages claim against federal officials for alleged Fourth Amendment violations. But the court has taken a stingy view since then, routinely rejecting so-called Bivens claims. In a 2022 decision, Justice Clarence Thomas’ majority opinion cited Bivens while noting: “Over the past 42 years, however, we have declined 11 times to imply a similar cause of action for other alleged constitutional violations.” Thomas wrote that the court will deny claims “in all but the most unusual circumstances.” Cohen’s petition attempts to convince the justices that his case presents such a circumstance. His lawyers wrote: Still, it’s difficult to imagine the court caring. The justices have discretion to grant or deny Cohen’s petition. It takes four justices to grant review. That would have seemed an unlikely prospect even before the Roberts Court bestowed Trump with broad immunity for criminal conduct while in office. But in the wake of that ruling reaffirming the court’s priorities, it’s clear that the prospect of accountability for powerful officials — presidents in particular — is not among those priorities."
"On Project 2025, Trump keeps inadvertently helping Democrats",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/project-2025-trump-keeps-inadvertently-helping-democrats-rcna161328,"Democratic officials recently settled on a specific goal: They would inform the public about Project 2025, a right-wing policy agenda being crafted by the Heritage Foundation with the assistance of several prominent Donald Trump associates. It posed a messaging challenge — many Americans don’t know what the Heritage Foundation is and are wholly unfamiliar with its lengthy governing blueprint — but Democrats decided to try anyway. Last week, Trump unexpectedly gave them a hand: The former president published an odd item to his social media platform claiming to “know nothing” about Project 2025. The Republican went on to claim he has “no idea who is behind it,” he disagrees with some of its provisions, and he has “nothing to do with” the initiative. As a strategic matter, this was incredibly unwise. For one thing, the GOP candidate’s statement let Democrats know that their efforts were having an effect. For another, Trump’s statement prompted a round of fact-checking, which left little doubt that his claims were absurd. But just as notably, Trump helped bring attention to the Project 2025 plan, which is what Democrats were hoping for. Shortly after midnight, he did it again. The former president published an online follow-up statement that read in part: For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that the Republicans’ 2024 platform has not, in reality, been “very well received.” Instead, there are two other angles of interest here. The first is that Trump’s efforts to distance himself from Project 2025 are difficult to take seriously. “I literally don’t have enough time to list every connection between Donald Trump and Project 2025,” MSNBC’s Ali Velshi told viewers over the weekend. “But I can absolutely confidently say that Donald Trump’s claim that he ‘knows nothing about Project 2025’ and has ‘no idea who is behind it’ is, how do we say it in Canada? Complete and utter B.S.” A CNN report published overnight went into striking detail: What's more, NBC News tracked down a 2022 speech in which Trump spoke at a Heritage Foundation event and said, ""This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” Remember, reports like these were instigated by a Trump missive that he didn’t need to publish. All of which brings us to the overarching point: The Republican made a tactical mistake by bringing national attention to Project 2025, elevating an issue that Democrats wanted people to know more about. Six days later, in his infinite wisdom, Trump unnecessarily did it again. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"Republicans advance ‘Save Act,’ a solution in search of a problem",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-advance-act-solution-search-problem-rcna161316,"Three months ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson made an obligatory pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to kiss Donald Trump’s ring and hold a joint press conference with the former president. It was not, however, a simple photo-op: The Republicans unveiled a proposal they appeared to be rather proud of. The GOP duo pitched legislation that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. The absurdity of watching two notorious election deniers pretend to be deeply concerned with the integrity of elections was a detail the political world was apparently supposed to overlook. Soon after, House Republicans followed through, introducing the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act” (or “Save Act”), and as Politico reported, the measure cleared the lower chamber late Wednesday afternoon. Republican support for the bill was unanimous. The vote was held the day after Trump published a ridiculous item to his social media platform, which read in part, “Republicans must pass the Save Act, or go home and cry yourself to sleep. Non citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians who are not being stopped by an equally dishonest Justice Department. ... The Justice Department is CORRUPT and won’t do a thing to help. They have no shame!” None of this was true. Nevertheless, GOP officials and their allies pretended that their legislation was of great significance. “This will be one of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take in their entire careers,” the House speaker declared on the floor ahead of the vote. It followed an online item from conspiratorial billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote, in reference to the Save Act, “Those who oppose this are traitors. All Caps: TRAITORS. What is the penalty for traitors again?” All of this is deeply bizarre, it’s worth understanding why. The principal problem with the legislation is that it’s a solution in search of a problem. To hear Republicans tell it, policymakers must prevent noncitizens from voting, which probably sounds reasonable. In fact, it’s so reasonable that the Save Act is redundant: There are literally zero locations in the United States where noncitizens can vote in federal and/or state elections. GOP lawmakers have also argued that legislation is needed to curtail the scourge of noncitizens who are already voting. Except, Republicans have gone searching for evidence of this problem and found effectively nothing. Johnson, while touting the Save Act in May, said Republicans “intuitively” know that “a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,” which was a hilarious way for the House speaker to effectively say, “We have no evidence to bolster our beliefs.” At this point, some on the right might argue that the Save Act is worthwhile anyway. Sure, noncitizens are already prohibited from voting in federal elections, and yes, evidence of noncitizens casting ballots is nearly impossible to find, but maybe there’s no harm in simply passing the legislation anyway? Just to be safe? Except, that’s wrong, too, because the legislation would add new and entirely unnecessary hurdles for Americans who want to participate in their own country’s elections — forcing them, for example, to produce documents such as a passport or birth certificate to register to vote. As House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries explained during the floor debate, “[T]his extreme MAGA Republican voter suppression bill is not designed to solve any problem on behalf of the American people. It is designed to jam people up and prevent Americans from voting.” For good measure, let’s also not overlook the ugly motivation behind the GOP leaders’ push. Johnson recently argued that an influx of immigrants is “one of their designs” that Democratic officials created “because they want to turn these people into voters.” That’s absurd for all sorts of reasons, including the years-long process in which some of these immigrants might be able to become citizens, but it served as a reminder that the Save Act is, as a Washington Post analysis summarized, “the ‘great replacement’ theory ... in legislation form.”"

Boeing’s extraordinary ‘sweetheart deal’ is a slap in face to the victims,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/boeing-plea-deal-737-max-crash-rcna160894,"Earlier this week, the Boeing Company pleaded guilty in federal court to defrauding federal regulators about its role in two fatal crashes, in 2018 and 2019, of 737 MAX aircraft in which 346 people were killed. Three years ago, Boeing agreed to enforce “compliance and ethics,” saying it would commit to prioritizing safety over profits. This plea deal and an accompanying $243 million fine came about because Boeing failed to do that. It’s an extraordinary turn of events for one of America’s largest companies, once the crown jewel of its aerospace industry. Frankly, the stipulated fine — less than 0.5% of Boeing’s 2023 revenue — and the company's acknowledgment of guilt are far from enough. The victims’ families have certainly made clear — often speaking through tears — that this plea agreement is a “sweetheart deal” and woefully insufficient for the lives lost due to Boeing’s irresponsibility. Given Boeing’s longstanding problems, a more significant fine — not to mention pursuing jail time for senior executives — was appropriate. Today, the company is still being investigated by an alphabet soup of federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company’s issues go far beyond two fatal crashes and encompass a systemic failure to enforce safety protocols during design and production, and repeated refusals to respond when in-house whistleblowers voiced their concerns. Boeing, to date, shows little sign of having learned any lessons. After a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 high over Portland in January (miraculously not killing anyone), 2024 has seen endless headlines chronicling shoddy workmanship, rampant outsourcing, frequent stonewalling and overall tone deafness from the company. What went wrong? Once, there were multiple major aircraft manufacturers competing against Boeing for airline contracts, both domestically and overseas. But over the years, nearly all exited airline manufacturing and competition dwindled. In 1993, the Clinton administration even called a post-Cold War “Last Supper” at the White House, forcing Boeing and other Pentagon suppliers to consolidate. Today, just three companies — Boeing, Airbus and Embraer — control nearly 98% of the global airline market. Boeing’s merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997 sowed the seeds of the former’s downfall. The engineers with decades of experience in Boeing’s executive ranks were replaced with MBAs with a fanatical focus on slashing costs. Boeing’s headquarters — embedded near Seattle since 1914 — was twice moved eastward recently, first to Chicago and then Virginia, in part to reduce commuting time for its army of Washington lobbyists. Unsurprisingly, the shift from building safe and reliable metal tubes that hurtle through the troposphere to prioritizing quarterly profits, stock buybacks, union busting and creating new forms of executive compensation wasn’t feasible in the long term. This mix of cost-cutting and a “shoot the messenger” approach to safety warnings from employees bred endless production delays, manufacturing defects and scandals. Even casual readers of the door plug saga have learned the name Spirit AeroSystems, a former Boeing subsidiary spun off in 2005 to build aircraft fuselages. The result was a shocking lack of support and oversight from Boeing itself for such a crucial portion of the manufacturing process. Boeing recently agreed to reacquire Spirit, but its outsourcing difficulties remain. Thousands of employees work for more than 50 outsourced contractors suppling 70% of Boeing’s design, engineering and manufacturing.  And it’s no coincidence that Boeing’s 787 is built in “right to work” South Carolina as an end run against unionized employees in Seattle. Recent congressional hearings with chilling whistleblower testimony have demonstrated Boeing senior management’s cluelessness about the quality of such work — and the retaliation against workers who speak out. You may be wondering at this point where the government was in all this. The aviation consolidation in the 1990s — among aircraft manufacturers and airlines alike — came at the worst time, because the Federal Aviation Administration has been notoriously understaffed and underfunded since the Reagan administration. The FAA’s fallback solution was to launch the office of Organization Designation Authorization, which allows industry employees (such as Boeing’s) to oversee and inspect work on its behalf. In other words, under ODA, Boeing employees are expected to tell their bosses to shut down assembly when there are problems, even though those same bosses again and again ignored those problems and even retaliated against employees who raised them. Boeing’s impact not only on aviation but on America itself cannot be overstated. The company had revenues of $77.8 billion in 2023 and directly employs 145,000 workers in more than 65 countries. It is among the United States’ largest exporters. Boeing remains one of the largest defense contractors; last year it ranked fifth among Pentagon suppliers. Whatever is in store next for this once-titan of the American industry, one conclusion is clear: self-policing is not enough. The victims of Boeing’s irresponsibility know it, lawmakers know it, and American passengers now anxious to step on a plane know it. It’s crucial that we fully resource the FAA's ability to provide thorough oversight and inspections. That means funding in-house FAA Safety Inspectors, sunsetting ODA and revamping ticket tax funding and FAA oversight procedures. But it’s also crucial that we once again insist on real punishments for wrongdoing. Only true accountability stands a chance of forcing Boeing to reject reckless ""financialization"" and return to making things that work. And even then, we’ll be talking about the Icarus-like fall of Boeing for decades to come."
Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy case could be dismissed entirely,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 11, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-case-dismiss-rcna161126,"Rudy Giuliani’s bankruptcy case could be thrown out entirely, after a judge said Wednesday that he is inclined to dismiss it. “I’m leaning toward dismissal, frankly, because I am concerned that the past is prologue,” said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane, who added that he will make a final ruling Friday. The judge’s remarks came at the end of a turbulent hearing as he weighed several proposals to deal with the case. Just hours before the hearing began, Giuliani’s lawyers asked that the case be dismissed. Giuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after he was ordered to pay nearly $150 million to two former Georgia election workers for spreading lies about them in the 2020 election. His bankruptcy proceedings prevented the election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, from immediately collecting the money. For months, Giuliani has submitted confusing and conflicting reports to the court about his spending and earnings. His creditors have accused him of providing false and misleading information about his assets, and they claim he is using bankruptcy to avoid paying up. “Since day one, Giuliani has regarded this case and the bankruptcy process as a joke,” his creditors wrote in a filing Monday, “hiding behind the façade of an elderly, doddering man who cannot even remember the address for his second multimillion dollar home and claims impending homelessness if he must sell that second multimillion dollar home.” Although a committee of Giuliani’s creditors initially called for a Chapter 11 trustee to be appointed to control his assets, Freeman and Moss split from the group and requested that the case be dismissed so that they can begin to collect their money. Giuliani, meanwhile, requested converting his bankruptcy case to Chapter 7 so that his assets could be liquidated. But in an eleventh-hour filing Wednesday, his lawyers agreed with Freeman and Moss’ proposal to dismiss the case entirely. An attorney representing the creditors committee urged the judge Wednesday not to dismiss the case, arguing that doing so would only benefit Freeman and Moss and leave the other creditors hanging. But an attorney for the Georgia women argued that their case took precedence and that appointing a monitor to control Giuliani’s finances would be a waste of time and money."
Rep. Ted Lieu urges media to dig deeper into Trump-Epstein ties,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:06 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/ted-lieu-trump-epstein-files-rcna161105,"California Rep. Ted Lieu wants to know why Donald Trump’s ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein aren’t getting more media coverage. At a news conference on Tuesday, Lieu brought up newly unsealed court documents that he suggested highlight Trump’s relationship with Epstein, the convicted sex offender. “We hear a lot from our constituents on different issues, but something I’ve heard that doesn’t seem to be getting covered are the Epstein files. These files were released. And, like, Donald Trump is sort of all over this,” Lieu said. “Y’all might want to look at that, because that’s highly disturbing. And again, it shows that Donald Trump is unfit for office.” Lieu also pointed to Trump’s felony conviction for falsifying business records and the finding of civil liability for sexual abuse as indicators he is unfit for the presidency. Lieu has taken some heat for overstating the contents of the Epstein documents in his remarks. The most recent document to be released came out earlier this month, a 176-page grand jury transcript that does not reference Trump. Previous document releases in January 2024 made passing references to Trump but didn’t implicate him in anything nefarious. (For the record, New York Magazine has a more thorough breakdown of what document releases have already revealed about Trump and Epstein’s ties.) Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said those releases “thoroughly debunked” any claims about Trumps ties to Epstein. Trump has always denied any wrongdoing. But the congressman has a point: For three consecutive presidential elections now, Trump hasn’t been pressed enough by reporters on the campaign trail about his relationship with Epstein. There is video of Trump partying with Epstein at Mar-a-Lago in 1992; Trump said in 2002 that Epstein was a “terrific guy” who “likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” Trump wished Epstein’s co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, well in her failed attempt to stay out of jail during her trial, and a court-ordered document released in 2021 revealed Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane between New York and Palm Beach seven times in the mid-’90s — despite Trump’s claims that he had never flown with Epstein. There’s also the 2016 lawsuit filed against Trump by a woman who claimed the former president raped her as a teenager at Epstein’s apartment. A Trump attorney at the time called the claim “frivolous” and “categorically untrue,” and the accuser dropped her lawsuit days before the 2016 election after her lawyer said she had received death threats. Trump himself has seemed ambivalent about what information about Epstein might ultimately be revealed. When asked on Fox News this year whether he’d work to unseal some of the Epstein documents if he’s elected president this fall, he seemed to have reservations. “I guess I would,” Trump said, “I think that less so because, you don’t know, you don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phony stuff in there, because it’s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would.”  All things considered, I agree with Lieu that Trump’s civil liability for sexual abuse and his criminal conviction in New York suggest his unfitness for office. Trump’s ties to Epstein seem deserving of further scrutiny, though, and that he’s been allowed to avoid addressing them is a media failure."
The real reason a Kamala Harris presidency is unfathomable to her critics,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 3:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-dei-president-racist-sexist-comments-rcna161043,"The headline of a recent New York Post column deriding Vice President Kamala Harris says, “America may soon be subjected to the country’s first DEI president.” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, later used that same language, telling Fox Business that Democrats have “got to choose between a mentally incompetent president and a DEI vice president.” At a speech at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Florida on Tuesday night, former President Donald Trump said: “If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago. But they can’t, because she’s got to be their second choice.” Democrats suggesting an open convention or looking past Harris as they imagine who might run on the top of the Democratic ticket if Biden can’t are also (in a less offensive way) demeaning Harris’ political skills and competence. This disrespect for the vice president isn’t a surprise. Neither are the racist and sexist attacks that aren’t so much dog whistles as they are deafeningly loud barks. In 2020, Biden selected Sen. Harris of California as his running mate after their contentious debate exchanges and after her hopes of winning the presidential nomination then quickly faded. It seemed obvious that he was selecting Harris to appeal to the Democratic Party’s most reliable voting bloc: Black women. They are the voters who have supported and lifted up the party in races across the country. In his speech announcing Harris as his pick, he said, ""This morning, all across this nation little girls woke up — especially little Black and brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — but today, maybe they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way: as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents."" Biden made it a point to say that Harris would bring a level of energy to the ticket that he lacked. That’s what presidential candidates have routinely done. They choose as their running mates people who can appeal to or excite parts of the electorate that they don’t. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence because he had the white evangelical bona fides that the thrice-married former casino owner needed to appeal to religious conservatives. When a young, energetic Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, he chose Biden as his running mate because Biden had decades more experience in Washington and ties to the Democratic establishment and he could allay the concerns of those who worried that Obama was too inexperienced. In 2020, Biden — an old, white Washington insider — similarly chose the much younger Harris, who’s Black and Asian and had been in Washington only three years, to run by his side. Diversifying a ticket is good politics, but the New York Post column and Rep. Roy would have you believe that Biden’s decision to appeal to his party’s most loyal voters was something sinister.  Harris isn’t new to politics, nor is she unfamiliar with the insults hurled her way. As one of the more “objectively attractive” politicians, she has had to deal with insinuations that former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown “made” her career, that her degrees from Howard University and the University of California Hastings College of Law somehow left her insufficiently qualified to be California’s attorney general, a U.S. senator or vice president. Now we’re hearing talk that even though she has been vice president more than three years she’s unqualified to be president. Let’s be clear (as Obama likes to say), the idea of Harris, a child of two immigrants, at the top of the ticket makes some people downright apoplectic. As vice president, Harris has had big issues, including the border crisis, Covid, voting rights and civil rights, on her docket. I wrote years ago that such a large and diverse policy portfolio was a trap. Meaning if Harris didn’t solve the myriad of crises placed within her purview, and fast, then in conversations about her ascending to president, critics would try to shroud their racist and sexist beliefs under the guise of “policy concerns.” I was right and wrong. We are seeing critiques of Harris’ not “accomplishing” what was set out for her. But the racism and sexism toward Harris isn’t shrouded. It’s blatant. With Trump at the helm, Republicans have learned that parroting his racist and sexist language is a way to appeal to their base. As more Black women and women of color ascend in the electoral politics space, questions pertaining to their “qualifications” are ever present ... as are denigrating comments about their hair, their clothes, their weight and their speech patterns. Just think back to some of the egregiously offensive comments made about Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams during her runs for governor, including the 2018 robocall that began “This is the magical Negro Oprah Winfrey asking you to make my fellow Negress Stacey Abrams the governor of Georgia” and went on to refer to Abrams as a “poor man’s Aunt Jemima.” Think of the mischaracterization of Rep. Val Demings of Florida as an anti-cop radical after a nearly 30-year law enforcement career that included her serving as chief of the Orlando Police Department. North Carolina Chief Justice Cherie Beasley, who was running a Senate campaign, was maligned as being tolerant of child molesters. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, who rightly called out Rep. Roy’s description of Harris as a DEI pick, is considered too loud, as evidenced by her House colleagues’ telling her to “just calm down” when she is merely asking a question during her allotted time. As for Harris, in a New York Times story that included Democratic insiders’ downplaying her political skills and benefit to Biden, a member of her own staff complained that she was devoting too much time to caring for her hair. Little has changed since the days of Shirley Chisholm. We’ve never had a Black female governor, and Harris was only the second Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate in history. Voters have tended to like their Black female elected officials tucked neatly under the glass ceiling. We’ve had a woman of color this close to the most important office in the nation for nearly four years, but since last month’s debate between Biden and Trump, Harris as president has become a much more tangible possibility — or predicament, depending on your perspective. Knowing what we know about Fox News, Trump, the Republican Party and even members of the Democratic Party who are envious of Harris’ position, we must prepare ourselves for the even more racist and sexist barking we’re about to hear, directed not only at her but at the very idea that somebody who looks like her could ever be qualified to lead."
What Black women really think about calls for Kamala Harris to replace Joe Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 2:55 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/black-women-voters-harris-biden-rcna161178,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 9 episode of ""Alex Wagner Tonight."" Black voters are extremely pragmatic. Most Black women in America are pragmatic, hence why they show up at the ballot box in the various ways they do. Last week, Melissa Murray and I traveled to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, the suburbs — yes, Black women live in the suburbs — to discuss the upcoming election. We talked about a range of things, including Vice President Kamala Harris. All the women I spoke to said they liked the vice president. One woman asked the group how they would feel if the party skipped over Harris should Joe Biden be replaced on the Democratic ticket. The group said they would be upset but also noted that in this next election, our democracy is on the line — a pragmatic and practical answer. What we’re witnessing in this ongoing debate over the vice president’s possible place at the top of the ticket is a fundamental misunderstanding, as my former boss Sen. Bernie Sanders would say, of two things. First, the process itself: It’s not politicians or party leaders that pick the president, it’s the people. And the people selected Biden. Now people can have qualms about the primary process and say they didn’t feel like it was open, but we can’t say that the primaries weren’t had and that ballots weren’t cast. Secondly, there’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the Democratic Party’s base voters and Black voters. I was at the Essence Festival this weekend talking to Black women and they brought up the issues of health care, abortion and the economy. Based on the conversations I had, the chief concern for Black women in this country is the economy, and they want a candidate who’s going to speak to that. However, there is a problem with outrage at even the suggestion that Harris’ name could appear at the top of the Democratic ticket. Some are questioning the audacity of the vice president, and the audacity of her supporters to believe she should be first in line to the presidency. Well, she is the vice president — literally there to be the president in case the commander in chief is unable to do the job, whether they are under anesthesia, whether the 25th Amendment is implemented, whether whatever. That’s what a vice president is for. The president selected her because he believed that in the event he could not carry out his duties, she could. But this is the reality of the moment we’re in, in discussions I've had with folks who are members of the Democratic Party and have pledged their support to Biden, I have not heard many Black women voters say that they are walking away from him. Right now, it’s still President Biden’s name at the top of the ticket — it’s the Biden-Harris ticket and Democrats should act as such."
"Nikki Haley bowed to Trump again, just for him to humiliate her",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 2:40 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/nikki-haley-delegates-trump-convention-rcna161203,"On Tuesday, Nikki Haley officially released the delegates she won during the Republican presidential nominating contests and encouraged them to vote for Donald Trump.  Alongside Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, Haley was staunch in her criticism of Trump throughout her campaign. But she faced a barrage of sexist smears and personal attacks on her family from Trump and his allies. And yet in the end, she did what Trump’s spokesperson Stephen Chung predicted she would: “kiss ass when she quits,” and endorsed his candidacy.  And that total capitulation didn’t even earn her an invite to the Republican National Convention. She won’t even be afforded the opportunity to witness Trump absorbing her political power in person.  The scenario reinforces my theory that Haley embodies a sort of dead end for Republican women — or perhaps it's a Trump-imposed glass ceiling. Back in February, The 19th published an article titled “What Nikki Haley’s run means to Republican women who don’t love Trump,” which makes the case that, to some conservative women, Haley personified a position within the MAGA movement that wasn't wholly devoted to Trump and his selfish ambitions. Which is why some conservative women were distraught by attacks on her from the right.  As Mel Leonor Barclay reported: Several other articles framed Haley’s presidential campaign as trailblazing or pioneering. And while I suspect some were glorifying what often looked like a desperate grasp at relevance or a half-hearted attempt to steer the Republican Party away from overt fascism, some voters may have bought into that framing: that Haley was attempting to model a way for women to exist within the MAGA movement while retaining a modicum of self-respect and self-determination. So I wonder what the women who were truly Trump-averse and Haley supporters are thinking today, now that Haley has fallen back into lockstep with the rest of the GOP. If someone blazes a trail right into a brick wall, is that inspirational? Or just a warning? Because the message to MAGA women seems clear following Haley’s debasement: Support the man in charge, or get out."

Biden’s comments came as Lt. Gov.

Yulia Navalnaya, who lives abroad, would face arrest if and when she returns to Russia.” * A legislative effort worth watching: “A bipartisan group of senators announced a deal Wednesday on a congressional stock trading ban aimed at preventing members from profiting from insider knowledge. Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Gary Peters, D-Mich., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., announced their legislative proposal, dubbed the ETHICS Act, on Capitol Hill.” * Trump’s pal in Sao Paulo: “Brazil’s Federal Police allege former President Jair Bolsonaro embezzled jewelry worth 6.8 million Brazilian reals (about $1.2 million) during his time in office, according to the investigative report unsealed Monday by the Supreme Court.” See you tomorrow."
How a second Trump term could destroy Medicare as we know it,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 1:34 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-trump-medicare-advantage-rcna160896,"As soon as Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for a second Trump administration, began to receive significant negative publicity earlier this month, the former and perhaps future president quickly denied all knowledge of it. “I know nothing about Project 2025,” he said on Truth Social, adding he believed that (unspecified) ideas in the proposal are “abysmal.” He’d certainly like us to believe that. But that statement shouldn’t be the end of the matter, and not simply because more than two dozen former Trump administration officials are involved in Project 2025. It’s because many of its planks read like a continuation of his first term. That includes the section on Medicare and other health care initiatives, which is not getting the attention it deserves. Project 2025 recommends making Medicare Advantage — the private insurance offering in Medicare — the default option for enrollment. Currently, there is no default option, though what’s called “Original Medicare” is presented first.  That may sound like a minor change, particularly if you’re not familiar with Medicare’s offerings. But this plan, should it come to fruition, will likely degrade not only Medicare, but health care for all Americans, no matter our age. Ever since he announced his first presidential run, Trump has promised to “save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.” That was a lie. Even before he became president, his own staff and supporters were saying it wasn’t true. While he was in office, each of Trump’s budgets called for Social Security and Medicare cuts. Trump himself encouraged enrollment in Medicare Advantage, while his Department of Health and Human Services, the agency responsible for the program, sent out promotional emails during one sign-up period with headlines like “Get more benefits for your money.” This statement is, again, a lie. Medicare Advantage costs the government billions of dollars more annually than the traditional offering, while delivering less in the way of necessary care. Giant health care insurers game the Medicare system, profiting at the expense of taxpayers and patients alike. The government pays insurers a minimum fee per enrollee based on each enrollee’s health — something done to discourage companies from cherry-picking the healthy. But insurance companies do their darndest to make their enrollees appear as sick as possible to the federal government, so they can collect more money for them. As a result, the government spends more than 20% more for people enrolled in Medicare Advantage than they do the traditional program. But all this upcoding doesn’t mean Medicare Advantage enrollees receive more in the way of care. In traditional Medicare, patients can see almost any doctor and few services need prior authorization. Neither is true under Medicare Advantage. Medical networks are narrow and limited, while everything from an MRI of the aching knee to chemotherapy for recommended cancer treatment -- not to mention doctor-recommended nursing home and rehab stays -- can be subject to insurance company second-guessing. While only a little more than 10% will appeal if they do not receive pre-authorization, if they do, four out of five will see the decision overturned.  Why, in 2024, does Medicare Advantage cover more seniors than the traditional offering? Trump, to be clear, is far from the only reason. Traditional Medicare can seem complicated, and most experts recommend its users also purchase Medigap insurance, which covers some of the out-of-pocket costs Medicare pushes to the user. That combo can be more expensive up front for seniors, many of whom are cash-strapped. Medicare Advantage plans seem simpler, and also frequently offer enticements like gym memberships and dental care. The downsides aren’t as obvious until the enrollee needs lifesaving medical care — when it can be cost-prohibitive to seniors to switch back to the traditional government program. Given that lifesaving care is hardly an uncommon need for the elderly, it’s little wonder the program has acquired the nasty nickname “Medicare Disadvantage.” You would think an outfit like the Heritage Foundation, which complains regularly about both the federal budget deficit and supposed restrictions on economic freedom, would want to do the exact opposite of a program that increases government spending and reduces Americans’ choices. But many conservatives have a way of going quiet about government spending when it fattens the bottom lines of big corporations. And Medicare Advantage is excellent at that. Insurers are so flush with profits that they’re using this excess federal money to create vertical monopolies, hoovering up everything from physician practices to pharmacy benefit managers and stymying competition by steering their customers to their own, not infrequently higher priced, offerings. The result is that the worse care and reduced choice of Medicare Advantage spills over to the rest of America. All of these issues could worsen if Medicare Advantage is made the default option. “Pushing people into Medicare Advantage is a recipe for further enriching corporate health insurers at the expense of older adults, destroying Medicare as we know it. It compounds health inequities. Vulnerable Americans are likely to lose access to their choice of doctors and face barriers to getting the care they need,” says Diane Archer, president of Just Care USA. This isn’t just impacting the millions of Americans on Medicare. It’s running up all our bills. If you are trying to save the government money while offering up better care for the money spent, pushing Medicare Advantage is the exact opposite of what the doctor ordered."
The 3 good ideas in the 920-page Project 2025 playbook,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 12:32 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-president-trump-second-term-good-ideas-rcna161099,"If you're still waiting for George R.R. Martin to finish the next sequel to ""A Game of Thrones,"" I have another suggestion for a work of fantasy that's just as long, complicated and brutal. It's called Project 2025 and, at 920 pages, it has more words than several of Martin's novels. It also has a similar approach to governance: The proposal rhapsodizes about leaders using unchecked power to pursue their enemies, including thousands of government workers who try to make sure your water is clean, your food is safe and your prosecutions are fair. But you have to hand it to the Heritage Foundation, the far-right think tank that dreamt up the plans for a second Donald Trump administration: Project 2025 certainly has a lot of ideas, even though most of them aren't very good. While reading through the proposal recently, I found a lot to criticize: granting the president vast new powers, politicizing federal agencies, reversing efforts to fight climate change, reducing legal immigration, making it dramatically harder to get an abortion, and on and on. Some of these ideas would leave Americans less free and more financially insecure; others are entirely unworkable. But within those hundreds of pages, a few reasonable suggestions snuck through. I came across a handful of smaller ideas that are worth considering, even if you disagree with their broader aims. Project 2025 calls for streamlining the regulatory requirements and licensing process for new nuclear power plants. To be clear, this is part of a section that also calls for making it easier to drill for oil and natural gas and even promoting the use of fossil fuels in developing countries while rolling back efforts to fight climate change. But more nuclear power could help the U.S. transition away from fossil fuels by replacing coal and helping fill the gap when wind and solar aren't available. Project 2025's authors may not want to fight climate change, but this idea would help do it anyway. On education, Project 2025 proposes consolidating various income-driven repayment plans for student loans. Surprisingly, the authors acknowledge that these plans, in which monthly payments are tied to your income level, are ""a superior approach"" compared to fixed monthly payments, which hit people with lower incomes harder. (In other sections, the authors are much less concerned about making the tax code progressive.) To be clear, their end goal is a repayment plan with tight limits and paltry benefits. But the idea of clearing up the current tangle of student loan repayment plans in favor of a single, straightforward program is commendable. In the chapter on the Treasury Department, the authors suggest creating a new universal savings account that would allow Americans to sock away up to $15,000 each year, making withdrawals on any gains tax-free. These accounts would be similar to Roth IRAs, allowing people to invest in various ways, but without the retirement-related withdrawal restrictions those have. Unfortunately, this is part of Project 2025's broader plan to cut taxes on the wealthy. But the idea of simple savings plans that anyone can use has helped increase savings rates in Canada and the United Kingdom, and it would be a smarter approach than the current mishmash of health savings accounts, IRAs and state-based college savings plans that end up being used mainly by wealthier Americans. Each of these ideas reflect the old conservative impulses to cut red tape, streamline government and give individuals more responsibility for their own futures. These arguments are trotted out so frequently on the right that they're easy to tune out, not least because they're often cited in bad faith by politicians who just want to shield big businesses from regulation or to cut benefits that help everyday Americans. But there's a reason why these kinds of arguments are successful: they make intuitive sense to many people. Among the many losses of our polarized era is that the two parties don't work together on big pieces of legislation as much anymore. That's unfortunate because both parties can have insights into how to craft effective policies that can get overlooked when only one party is involved. That also leads partisans to dismissively reject proposals that come from the other side. (Look no further than ""Obamacare,"" which was modeled after ideas championed by the Heritage Foundation and first implemented by a Republican governor, before becoming a conservative bogeyman.) But a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from — even if the source is Project 2025. And we should all be looking for ways to make government work better."
Trump’s promise to ‘take over’ Washington is a dictator’s dream,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 12:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-washington-dc-take-over-military-crime-rcna161177,"In Florida on Tuesday, Donald Trump doubled down on a dictatorial threat to “take over” the nation’s capital if he wins in November, suggesting he’d usurp power from local officials in Washington to run the city as he and his MAGA acolytes please. Trump, a convicted criminal himself, made the ominous vow at a rally in Doral while delivering an unhinged rant about purportedly rampant crime in Washington. He claimed that his administration will “take over the horribly run capital of our country,” which he said is a “nightmare of murder and crime” where you go to see tourist attractions but “end up getting shot, mugged, raped.” It’s funny how MAGA men like Trump portray themselves as tough guys, yet make simple excursions in cities sound like harrowing ordeals. In reality, the violent crime rate in D.C. has fallen dramatically since last year, when conservatives led a hysterical push to overturn criminal justice reforms in the city. And Washington’s overall crime has shown similar decreases in 2024. Nonetheless, this takeover threat from Trump matches one he made at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, where he said the feds should take control of D.C. and added that he “wouldn’t even call the mayor.” He has made similar threats toward other cities — and threatened to send in the military. The impression he has tried to spread is that these cities are incapable of governing themselves. And this fits a dubious trend of trying to install conservative rule by fiat: Republicans nationwide have tried — sometimes successfully — to strip power from liberal officials (often Black officials). As for Trump, his vows to use military-style crackdowns that resemble martial law are particularly disturbing in light of two things: the recent Supreme Court decision granting presidents immunity for things deemed “official acts,” and the conservative movement’s idolization of brutal dictators like El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele, who is known for deploying torture and arbitrary detention under the guise of fighting crime. If Trump wins and is empowered with the conservative justices’ newly contrived idea of presidential immunity, we could see similar scenes playing out in cities nationwide, all at his behest."
"George Clooney says Biden must withdraw from race, weeks after hosting star-studded fundraiser for him",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 11:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/george-clooney-biden-withdraw-election-rcna161174,"President Joe Biden appears to have lost another major supporter: Actor George Clooney, a longtime Democrat and prominent fundraiser for the party, has joined the chorus of calls for Biden to withdraw from the race. In an op-ed in The New York Times on Wednesday, Clooney echoed the remarks of the Democratic lawmakers who have urged Biden to step down from the ticket. Clooney praised the president and his character, but said that he was simply too old to run in an election with such high stakes. “I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. ... In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced,” Clooney wrote. ""But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.” Clooney wrote in dire terms about his belief in Biden's chances in the election: Clooney did not call for Vice President Kamala Harris to take over the top of the ticket as some lawmakers have. Instead, Democrats seen as potential successors — including Harris — should make the case for themselves, he suggested, “Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.” The actor’s op-ed comes amid serious disarray among congressional Democrats about Biden’s insistence on running in the election and how that could affect down-ballot races. It also comes just weeks after Clooney hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden’s campaign in Los Angeles, raising almost $30 million for the president’s re-election bid. (Biden had flown from Europe to Los Angeles for the event, and he said his intense travel schedule in the weeks leading up to the debate contributed to his exhaustion and poor performance.) Clooney is a Hollywood powerhouse in Democratic politics, raising significant amounts of money for liberal causes and Democratic candidates. He supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. He also supported Biden's 2020 campaign — and, until Wednesday, his 2024 campaign. Clooney himself had previously ruled out a career in politics. In 2021, when asked by the BBC if he would ever consider running for office, he said, “No, because I would actually like to have a nice life.”"
"AOC files impeachment articles targeting Justices Alito, Thomas",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 11:37 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/aoc-files-impeachment-articles-targeting-justices-alito-thomas-rcna161188,"In the wake of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in Trump v. U.S., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York issued a statement condemning the high court’s “corruption crisis beyond its control.” But the congresswoman — who’s sometimes known by her “AOC” initials — didn’t stop there. “Today’s ruling represents an assault on American democracy,” the New York Democrat added, referring to the immunity case. “It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture.” To that end, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to introduce articles of impeachment against Supreme Court justices after Congress’ Fourth of July break. Evidently, she meant it. NBC News reported this afternoon: AOC has already picked up some allies: Her impeachment resolutions are backed by eight original co-sponsors: Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Delia Ramirez of Illinois, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Jamaal Bowman of New York, and Jasmine Crockett of Texas. The move also comes against a backdrop of several related efforts on Capitol Hill. Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden, for example, have asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel as part of a potential criminal investigation into Thomas. Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, meanwhile responded to the Trump v. U.S. ruling by vowing to introduce a constitutional amendment that would reverse the Supreme Court’s “harmful immunity decision and ensure that no president is above the law.” Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey added in a written statement that read in part, “We must take all available measures to reign in the increasingly unfettered power of this radical court, including ... expanding the number of justices.” Circling back to our recent coverage, I continue to think there are a couple of ways to assess efforts like these. The first is on the merits, and on that front, it’s easy to be sympathetic to the Democratic proposals. The Supreme Court’s radicalized Republican majority has taken indefensible steps in recent years, but to elevate the presidency above the law is a uniquely pernicious act. This, coupled with recent ethics scandals, put Democratic efforts on firm ground. The second, however, is more pragmatic. No sitting justice has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process, and the last time such a case even went to the Senate was 220 years ago. Given the Republican majority in the House, the earliest such a move could even be considered is next year, and if Democrats fall short of a majority, the idea would again be off the table. Relatedly, the Constitution has never been amended to reverse a misguided Supreme Court decision; and while Congress has expanded the Supreme Court before, it’s been 155 years, and the odds of such an effort clearing Capitol Hill anytime soon are extraordinarily remote. Or put another way, Democrats are taking the broader issues seriously, as they should, but those hoping to see their efforts amount to meaningful changes should probably lower their expectations. But if Congress can’t fix what Republican justices have broken, what is the remedy? There is “very little we can do except elect a Democrat [as president] who will appoint vacancies if Democrats hold [the] Senate,” Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee recently told Axios. In other words, those looking for a near-term recourse shouldn’t look to Congress, they should look to voters, who now have an added reason to choose wisely in the fall. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Democrats just gave Republicans a gift ahead of next week's RNC,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 11:12 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/democrats-chaos-republicans-rnc-platform-rcna160977,"This is an adapted excerpt from the July 9 episode of “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” Unlike the chaos that’s consuming the Democratic Party, Republicans are not divided over the competence of their standard-bearer. Republicans seem all-in on Donald Trump. Next week, at the Republican National Convention, the party will have formalized the elevation of a man convicted on 34 felony counts, a man found liable for sexual abuse, and a fraudster. That’s the nominee of the Republican Party — my party. I don’t support that individual, nor do I support the direction that this platform purportedly lays out, particularly on immigration. Republicans and Trump are also lying to the country about where the party stands on women’s rights. Despite what you may read Republicans aren’t backing off a national abortion ban. That’s still very much on the table. The best way I can sum up the party’s platform is this: it’s all a lie. That’s my expectation going into the RNC, and you’ll see it play out in full-color next week. What we should watch is how the American public takes this all in while Democrats engage in a circular firing squad pointed at President Biden. Democrats took what should have been no more than a weekend story on the debate and turned it into a full-throated existential crisis within their own party. It’s an interesting twist going into this convention. What should have been a week focused on the Republican Party’s lies and the threat posed by their nominee will now only play out as a backdrop to what’s happening with the Democrats. "
"Weighing Biden’s 2024 fate, the Dems’ pendulum keeps swinging",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 9:50 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/weighing-joe-biden-2024-fate-democrats-election-rcna161152,"At roughly this point 24 hours ago, the Democratic Party’s 2024 pendulum appeared to have swung in President Joe Biden’s favor. Axios published a report with a headline that read, “Biden rebels in Congress see their revolt crumbling.” The article quoted one unnamed House Democrat who said, “As someone who wanted the reckoning and is really disappointed that it’s over, trust me: It’s over.” It’s not that congressional Democrats met behind closed doors and came to the conclusion that Biden was the party’s best and strongest choice for the November ballot. Rather, the members felt stuck: They don’t think the president can win re-election, but they also don't think he’ll quit. The result was an awkward dilemma for Democratic lawmakers: Either take the pressure campaign to an aggressive new level and hope Biden reverses course, or grudgingly fall in line and accept the status quo. At this point yesterday, a variety of Democratic members appeared to embrace the latter option. The president’s position had strengthened, at least in his own party, in ways that seemed difficult to predict a couple of days earlier. But the funny thing about pendulums is that they keep swinging. NBC News reported this morning: During an MSNBC appearance, the speaker emerita said, in reference to Biden, “It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.” Asked in the same interview if she wants the president to move forward with his re-election plans, Pelosi added, “I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that’s — that’s the way it is.” The significance of the comments was obvious: Biden has told Democrats that the discussion about his electoral future is over, while Pelosi left little doubt that the conversation remains ongoing. If the headline yesterday was that the party was prepared to move on, the former House speaker’s on-air comments — delivered on a program the president is known to watch — suggested otherwise. The California Democrat isn’t alone. Despite the incumbent president’s declarations, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey announced late yesterday that she wants Biden to stand aside for the good of the country. Around the same, Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic Senate nominee in New Jersey, expressed “concerns” about Biden’s candidacy, adding that he’s open to discussions about a new party nominee. A few hours later, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado appeared on CNN and said in no uncertain terms that he does not believe Biden can win a second term. This morning, Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan, who represents a competitive swing district in New York, also publicly called on Biden to forgo his re-election plans. In case that weren’t quite enough, The New York Times published an op-ed from actor George Clooney, who last month co-hosted the largest fundraising event ever for any Democratic candidate, and who now believes the president should stand down. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,” Clooney wrote. “Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw.” The actor added, “We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” I won’t pretend to know what’s likely to happen, but it’s clear that the debate that Biden tried to shut down isn’t over, and uncertainty about the near future reigns."

ABC's George Stephanopoulos says he regrets Biden comment to passerby,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 8:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/george-stephanopoulos-biden-interview-comment-regret-rcna161094,"ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, who interviewed Joe Biden last week in a pivotal moment in the president's political career, was recorded telling a passerby on the street that he doesn't think Biden can serve another term in office. A video of the interaction, which TMZ published Tuesday, shows a person surreptitiously recording Stephanopoulos on a street in New York City as he approaches the veteran journalist and asks if he thinks Biden should step down. Stephanopoulos' voice is muddled in the audio, but he seems to say: ""I don't think he can serve four more years."" The comment was a remarkable slipup from Stephanopoulos, who just days earlier had landed a high-stakes interview with Biden as the octogenarian president struggled to quiet internal party opposition to his nomination. The interview was widely seen as a make-or-break moment for Biden following his lousy debate performance, but it did little to stem concerns about the president's age and fitness for office. Stephanopoulos later confirmed the encounter. “Earlier today I responded to a passerby. I shouldn’t have,” he said in a statement from ABC News. The network distanced itself from Stephanopoulos’ comment, saying the anchor “expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.” Stephanopoulos, who began his journalism career in the late 1990s after serving as White House communications director under President Bill Clinton, drew praise for gently but steadily pressing Biden last week on his mental acuity and chances at re-election. Biden has adamantly refused to step down from the Democratic presidential ticket. In a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, he dismissed calls for him to withdraw, telling his colleagues: “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it’s time for it to end.”"
Trump keeps emphasizing Jan. 6 lies as part of his 2024 pitch,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 8:11 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-election-jan-6-lies-part-2024-pitch-rcna161116,"At the presidential debate two weeks ago, Donald Trump lied uncontrollably about a great many things, but the Republican’s rhetoric about the Jan. 6 attack stood out for its detachment from reality. The former president claimed, for example, that there were a “small” number of rioters, which wasn’t true. He said the insurrectionists attacking the U.S. Capitol in his name were “ushered in” by police, which also wasn’t true. The presumptive GOP also said he offered 10,000 National Guard troops to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which wasn’t true, before claiming that Pelosi said, “I take full responsibility for January 6,” which is something the California Democrat never said. In case that wasn’t quite enough, at the same event, Trump said some of the imprisoned rioters are “so innocent,” which (a) isn’t true; and (b) is contradicted by the fact that many of the convicts pleaded guilty during their prosecutions. A New York Times report noted soon after that for many of the former president’s critics, Trump’s “embrace of Jan. 6 and his refusal to agree to unqualified acceptance of a democratic election” were worse than President Joe Biden’s unnerving performance on the same stage. “It’s a concerted effort to try to de-weaponize Jan. 6,” former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who served on the Jan. 6 committee, told the Times. “It’s part of creating this utter confusion where the average person is, like, ‘I know what I saw on Jan. 6, but maybe I didn’t see what I saw.’” Two weeks later, Trump is still at it — as we were reminded overnight at the former president’s rally in Miami. Reading from his teleprompter, the GOP candidate told his followers: If you watch the clip, note that the creepy music was played at the campaign event; it was not added afterward to make the remarks sound more ridiculous. To the extent that reality still has any meaning, the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol was not made up of “people who love our country” engaged in “protest”; to call incarcerated felons “hostages” is an insult to both the justice system and actual hostages; and while the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that will affect some Jan. 6 cases, the idea that convicted rioters and insurrectionists “should be out soon” is just plainly wrong. Nevertheless, Trump has referenced the ruling to call for the release of all Jan. 6 criminals and suspects. In other words, when it comes to Jan. 6, the former president still has no idea what he's talking about. Stepping back, Trump hasn’t exactly been subtle in recent months with his focus on Jan. 6 rioters, offering them praise, support and vows of future pardons. A recent Associated Press report noted that the former president has positioned “the violent siege and its failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House.” This coincided with a related Semafor report on the degree to which the Republican has put Jan. 6 rioters “at the heart of his campaign.” That report was published in March. It’s worse now. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Immunity Fallout,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 10, 2024, 7:51 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/prosecuting-donald-trump/prosecuting-donald-trump-immunity-fallout-rcna161114,"As last week’s historic Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity continues to be absorbed in the public sphere, the majority’s expansive view of what is considered exempt from prosecution comes into stark relief. Given their unique perspectives, veteran prosecutors Andrew Weissmann and Mary McCord explore the knock-on effects the ruling will have on Donald Trump’s ongoing cases in Florida, New York and D.C.  Listeners can send questions to: ProsecutingTrumpQuestions@nbcuni.com  Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Andrew Weissmann: Hi, welcome back to “Prosecuting Donald Trump.” It is Tuesday, July 9th. I’m Andrew Weissman, and I’m here with my co-host, Mary McCord. Hi, Mary. Mary McCord: Morning, Andrew. Andrew Weissmann: So, this is going to be -- Mary McCord: I said this could be such a chipper attitude, and I don’t really feel all that chipper, so okay, so I’m faking it. Andrew Weissmann: Okay, well, this is like a great way to be like, okay, you should really listen to this because it’s going to be a downer. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: How’s that for a tease? You know, I actually think what we have planned for today, I think is kind of great because we’re going to take the immunity decision that was issued last week and we’re going to talk about what the ramifications are for three of the trials where it’s so far come up. Mary McCord: And probably some listeners are saying, what is the fallout? What is the relevance to these other cases? But we’ll talk about newly filed motions by Mr. Trump and his legal team in the Mar-a-Lago case, talk a little bit more about something we raised last Tuesday. It was just, you know, hot off the presses on Tuesday that the sentencing in the Manhattan case has been postponed to allow briefing on the effect of the immunity decision. And then, of course, there’s the obvious question. What impact does this have on the January 6th case? Because things are now going back to Judge Chutkan here in the D.C. District Court. Andrew Weissmann: So, Mary, why don’t we take that in the order that you just said, which is we’ll talk about Florida, then New York, then D.C. So I’m going to ask you a question which I know the answer to, but I just think it’s a good sort of, as they say in Washington, level set. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: So we’re all on the same page, which is some people could be saying to themselves quite naturally, and frankly, all of us would have said it before this opinion came out, which is, I don’t understand. Well, if the Supreme Court is deciding a case involving presidential immunity for a person taking actions while they are president, how in God’s green earth, a phrase that I use all the time, which people know is a euphemism for keeping this a PG program. Mary McCord: Clean. Andrew Weissmann: So how is it in God’s green earth that the decision’s even relevant to a case that is by definition happening after the person is president? Because remember, this case is about two types of charges, illegal retention of documents post-presidency. It was not taking them from the White House illegally. It wasn’t stealing them from the White House. It was about illegal retention post-presidency and obstruction of justice post-presidency. How could a decision involving presidential immunity have any relevance to the Mar-a-Lago case? And frankly, before the decision came out, I think you and I, what’s the right phrase? Blew it. Because we thought, well, of course the decision won’t be relevant to that. And we also thought it wouldn’t really be relevant to New York. And we’ll talk about New York in a moment. But how is it that this decision from the Supreme Court is suddenly relevant and in fact does raise issues that Judge Cannon will have to deal with? Mary McCord: Well, I guess I would not assume it’s relevant. I say Donald Trump’s team is arguing that Judge Cannon should stay everything, meaning stop the presses, stop all of the motions hearings and motions due dates that includes the CIPA litigation, Classified Information Procedures Act. That includes briefing on other motions, designating experts. Mr. Trump’s team is saying stop everything and let us brief the impact of the immunity decision on this pending case, and I want to get into what they’re arguing about. But to your point about people asking how on God’s green earth could this be relevant, I would note that counts 1 through 32, right, which are about illegally retaining national defense information and failing to turn them over to the FBI and federal agents who sought them and were entitled to receive them, the date of each offense begins January 20th, 2021, which as of noon, Mr. Trump was no longer the president through the time period when that document was eventually obtained by the government. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: The obstruction counts, you know -- Andrew Weissmann: Way later. Yeah. Mary McCord: -- are way later, right. So there’s nothing charged that is even charged from the period of time that Mr. Trump was president. Andrew Weissmann: So what’s the argument? What language in the Supreme Court case are they relying on that makes this at least potentially relevant? And then I’m going to flag a couple of things, which I do think raise evidentiary issues. But why is this decision suddenly something that the defense can’t raise as a potential issue? Mary McCord: Yes. So, first of all, the motion for a stay has very, very little in the way of legal analysis or argument about how the presidential immunity decision actually applies here. That’s what they’re asking for supplemental briefing on. But just to go back to that decision, recall, this is where the Supreme Court said, look, when you are prosecuting a former president of the United States, he is not immune from prosecution from purely personal or what they call unofficial acts. He is absolutely immune for exercising core constitutional powers and they take an extremely expansive view of what those core constitutional powers are and that’s something we’ll come back to later in the episode because it actually has consequences, I think, beyond just criminal immunity from criminal prosecution. But, you know, classically, we think of those core powers as the powers that are in the Constitution, the power of a pardon, the power of a veto, the power of appointing ambassadors. The Supreme Court takes a broader view, at least according to the opinion of what are core powers. So there’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for the exercise of those core constitutional powers. And then there’s this middle area, which are actions within the outer perimeter of a president’s official acts. And those are things that are something that’s not part of his core responsibilities, but nevertheless relates to official acts. And that is something where the Supreme Court has said there is immunity for that and we’re not going to decide now whether it’s absolute or whether it’s presumptive. But we can let this case go back to Judge Chutkan for her decide, in the first instance, whether certain things in the indictment are official or unofficial. And even if official in that middle category where there’s not absolute immunity, decide whether the government can rebut this presumption by showing that a criminal prosecution would have no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch. Okay, so all that basic stuff still doesn’t answer your question. Andrew Weissmann: So that’s that sort of tripartite framework where there’s sort of official versus unofficial. And with the unofficial, there’s core, which is absolute, and other outer perimeter where it’s not clear. We’re clearly impersonal. Mary McCord: Post-presidential conduct. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. When you’re dealing with Mar-a-Lago, we are clearly in the different buckets. What I was hearing is we’re in the unofficial. And so what’s the answer? Mary McCord: Yes. So that the real zinger here, in fact, the place where Justice Barrett dissented from the majority is the majority -- Andrew Weissmann: So it became 5-4 -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- on this issue that we’re about to talk about, it’s not 6-3, it’s 5-4. Mary McCord: That’s right. With Justice Barrett joining the three dissenters. This is where the -- Andrew Weissmann: The men versus the women. Mary McCord: You’re right. The men versus the women. Okay, we’re going to come back to that another day. And this is where the majority, except for Justice Barrett, held that the government may not introduce evidence concerning official acts, even just as proof of the criminality of purely unofficial acts. So in other words, you got personal -- Andrew Weissmann: And why is that? Why? Mary McCord: Well, in their view -- Andrew Weissmann: What does the court say? Mary McCord: Yeah. This entire majority opinion is permeated from the beginning, including the expansive view of core constitutional powers through the concluding sentence with this notion that the president needs to be so protected in everything he ever does, anyone he ever talks to, so that he can be bold and fearless in taking action as the president without worrying about successor presidents prosecuting him. Now, they could have taken the opposite tactic, which is abiding by the law, particularly the criminal law, is an important thing for presidents to do. And they should be reined in from violating the criminal law by knowing that they’re not immune. They could have taken the opposite view, but their entire opinion is permeated with this notion of bold and fearless presidential action. And so in their opinion, it seems, although I would say that they’re vague on this, it would be far too disruptive to a president’s exercise of his executive powers if he was worried that his conversations with others within the White House and his actions would be probed, even if it’s just for use as evidence in a prosecution for unofficial or purely personal acts. It’s very much hamstringing a prosecution, even for personal acts, because it means, as Justice Barrett pointed out, bribery is a personal act. You could have the promise of an ambassadorship in return for money, and you would not be able, in the majority opinion, to delve into the conversations about that quid pro quo. You could put on evidence of the ambassadorship, public records, somebody got one, and some kind of evidence about the receipt of something by the president, if it were public, but you couldn’t dive into conversations that took place. And that’s really hamstringing the government. But even still, why does that matter for Mar-a-Lago? I know you’ve asked me this. I’ve not answered it. Basically, what they’re saying in one paragraph is, I mean, they don’t point out what those official acts would be, but they’re saying, you need to give us time to brief, Judge Cannon, how things that are being charged in this Mar-a-Lago indictment, all things after Mr. Trump was no longer president, still might be impacted by this ruling because of things that are relevant to when he was the president. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So, essentially, the court created an evidentiary rule that says that, yes, you can prosecute for personal, what they call, as you said, Mary, unofficial acts. So you shoot somebody after you left the presidency or you illegally retain classified documents or national defense information and obstruct justice all post-presidency. That’s all unofficial. But they said you can’t use any evidence of official conduct to the extent that that would help you prove the case. So for instance, if the president had made comments in his official capacity to advisors saying this is what he intended to do -- Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: -- those admissions wouldn’t be able to be used if they were made in official conduct. So they essentially are doing something that I thought it was certainly ill-conceived. It was terribly articulated in terms of the justification. It’s like a paragraph that just says, oh, of course you can’t do this. And Justice Barrett, as you said, really takes them to task, but they essentially create a speech and debate clause provision for this. So in the speech and debate clause, the Constitution says that when you’re members of Congress and you’re debating and speaking about something on the floor of Congress, it’s actually been interpreted to be even broader than that. But that material, what you say, you can’t be charged with it and it can’t be used in any way. But what’s crazy to me is that the Constitution explicitly provides that. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So here’s the Supreme Court, the so-called originalist Supreme Court deciding, oh, we’re just going to create another speech and debate clause, but this time for the presidency, where it’s obvious that the framers knew how to create this kind of evidentiary rule in the speech and debate clause, and they didn’t do it with respect to the presidency. But that is the real issue for Judge Cannon. And the reason I think there is at least an evidentiary issue, I don’t think it should preclude the prosecution at all, but this decision, the five justices who say you can’t use evidence, is that if you look just at the indictment in this case, the indictment in the Mar-a-Lago case in a whole series, I counted them in six paragraphs of the indictment, there are references to statements that Donald Trump made not as a candidate pre-presidency, but while he was president. And so those materials seem pretty clear that there’s a very good argument that those are statements that the president made in his official capacity. And so I think that there will be arguments about that is no longer something that would be admissible. But that’s an evidentiary issue. That’s something down the road that, yes, they can make motions now to say they should be precluded or you should be able to strike certain parts of the indictment as surplusage or inadmissible. So I think that -- Mary McCord: I mean, what they say they want is they want the same kind of fact-bound hearing that Judge Chutkan is going to have to go through to sort of -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- separate official from unofficial. Andrew Weissmann: But I do think there are some things in the indictment, for instance, paragraph 20, if people want to sort of follow along, which relate to things that Donald Trump said or did while he was president that would help prove the case so that -- Mary McCord: Well, let’s just say what that is. That is kind of giving background about, I think, really trying to show that when president, Mr. Trump was well aware of -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: -- what classified information was, what national defense information was. That paragraph 20 says as part of his official duties as president, Trump received intelligence briefings from high-level U.S. government officials, including the director of the CIA, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, et cetera. He regularly received a collection of classified intelligence from the U.S. intelligence community, noted as the president’s daily brief., right? So to your point, this is really all background kind of context to show, again, his knowledge, right, of classified information -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- the importance that it be kept close hold. But that is important to proving up his knowledge that he was not authorized to have classified information or national defense information at Mar-a-Lago after he was no longer president. So that is where I think, you know, you’re right that there will be some things there that they’ll make arguments about. Andrew Weissmann: But, Mary, doesn’t it strike you, just taking that example of paragraph 20, it’s like an exhibit to how insane -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- the Supreme Court position is and why I thought it was very important for Justice Barrett to dissent on that point -- Mary McCord: Yes, absolutely. Andrew Weissmann: -- because to say that this is really, just makes no sense whatsoever. And how are you possibly infringing on the vigorous presidency by introducing evidence that he would know what is classified and the importance of classified information? I mean, that doesn’t interfere in any way. But they didn’t, you know, you would hope that they would have said it’s a balancing or that that there’d be more to this than simply the court saying, you know, the majority basically is like black and white. Mary McCord: But so actually, I will disagree with you on that, Andrew, because I think that it is basically public knowledge and public record. It is probably said by his own press person multiple times. The president receives a daily brief from his intelligence community. So I think that is admissible because what Justice Roberts said in that footnote is public records can come in. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I agree that there’s a way around it. I mean, in other words, if the information that just, you know, Mary, just so our listeners know, Justice Roberts has this footnote saying, well, of course, if something is public, then that could be used. So a way to deal with this, what I’ll call paragraph 20 problem, and that’s just an illustration, is if it turns out that that information has also been made public, then the government can try and use the Justice Roberts footnote about this being public. But if it hasn’t been, it’s really unclear that they’re going to be able to find something in the majority, which is so poorly reasoned, that’s going to allow this to come in. And of course, Judge Cannon is not going to be reading the Supreme Court decision in a way favorable to Jack Smith, to state the obvious. Mary McCord: Yeah. So, a couple of last points before we take a break and move on. Again, there’s very short motion for a stay and the judge is not even going to rule on it yet. She’s set a schedule for Jack Smith to respond and then there’d be a reply again just to try to decide whether to stay the case for then a more full supplemental briefing. So it’s like briefing to talk about briefing. But they’ve thrown a few other things out there with almost no explanation. One is that they say the presidential immunity questions implicate important presidential powers discussed in the Supreme Court case, such as foreign relations responsibilities, meeting foreign leaders, overseeing international diplomacy and intelligence gathering, matters related to terrorism, et cetera. How they’re going to connect that up exactly with Trump’s post-president conduct, I don’t know. Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: The other thing they do, and I think we previewed this last week, is say, oh, and also regarding the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, Justice Thomas has written a concurrence where he calls very much into question the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith under the appointments clause of the Constitution and the court should take that into consideration in ruling on the outstanding motion to dismiss based on this appointments clause issue. So they’re throwing, you know, kind of like spaghetti at the wall here in this motion. And we’ll see what ends up getting fully briefed if the court grants the motion to stay. And she’s already sort of partially granted it. She’s stayed a bunch of immediate deadlines -- Andrew Weissmann: Yes. Mary McCord: -- but hasn’t granted a full stay. Andrew Weissmann: So just to be clear, Mary, what you’re saying is Donald Trump has said in light of this decision, there should be further briefing and the case should be stayed. And the court said, okay, I’m setting up a briefing schedule on the motion for a stay. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: So we’re having briefing to decide whether it should be a stay. And in the interim, I’m staying a whole bunch of obligations that the defense has to do things. So she, in effect, has granted a partial stay. This is all a way of saying this case, we knew this before -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- the Supreme Court decision that it was never going to go to trial. But this basically was talk about sand in the gears. This is like a beach full of sand being dumped into the gears of the Mar-a-Lago case. And there’s no way this is going forward. And this is a perfect segue to talking about screwing up a case that we’re going to take a break, but we’ll come back and talk about the New York case because there you’d think, okay, we’re talking about unofficial acts, which is clearly not done as the president. And yet, Justice Alito, in my view, because he’s sort of articulated this view during the oral argument, has figured out a way to gum up this case as well, even though there was a unanimous jury verdict on this case. So let’s take a break and we’ll come back and talk about the pernicious nature of the, again, this evidentiary piece of the Supreme Court ruling. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: Welcome back. As promised, let’s shift north from Florida to Manhattan. Although I don’t know, I think it’s been just as hot in Manhattan as it has been in Florida for the last week. It certainly has been just as hot here in Washington, D.C. This seems to be like a full week worth of upper 90s and it’s absolutely horrible outside. But anyway, other horrible things happening. Andrew Weissmann: Yes, other hot things that are happening. Mary McCord: And I’m realizing we did talk last week because it had just happened about Mr. Trump’s request to postpone the sentencing, which otherwise would have been two days from today. It would have been this Thursday, to postpone that sentencing in order to brief what impact, if any, the Supreme Court decision has on the Manhattan case. And so I am looking back at Judge Merchan’s letter to counsel and realizing that tomorrow is the day for Mr. Trump’s team to actually file their more fulsome motion. So next week we’ll be able to talk in more detail about what they’re arguing. But I think we can guess about some of those arguments right now. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And then there’s two weeks for this state to respond. And then the judge has put the sentencing or next appearance, he said, for September 18th. And he says that’s for sentencing if necessary or other proceeding, meaning he may have a factual hearing. So we have to see what’s going to happen on the 18th. Mary McCord: Well, hang on. Don’t forget that he also said he will make a decision on the 6th, September 6th. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: Without it being in court -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- we’ll have to be in court. So we will know on the 6th -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- what will be happening on the 18th. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And I’ll talk for a moment about why I think the 18th is actually smart. I don’t know if it was intentional, but I know an effect of it, is that by putting it off to the 18th of September, I don’t know if this was intentional or not, but it does make it harder for Donald Trump to get back to the Supreme Court. If your view is that the Supreme Court has basically thrown out law here and is just looking to do whatever it can to hurt these prosecutions. By deciding this on the 18th of September, it makes it pretty hard, not impossible, but pretty hard because the normal rule, but see, this case doesn’t seem to follow any normal rules if you’re Donald Trump, but the Supreme Court is that you have to appeal things within the New York system and then go to the Supreme Court if they would even take the case. So by doing this on September 18th, it does sort of shorten that ability of Donald Trump to have that relief. Mary McCord: Although just to remind listeners, the Supreme Court doesn’t start sitting until the first Monday in October. So even if somehow this decision was being made this week and sped through the New York courts of appeals, the fastest that the Supreme Court would ever be able to take things still wouldn’t be until October. Andrew Weissmann: Presumably. Mary McCord: Yeah. They don’t have to do it that way -- Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: -- but it’s exceedingly rare that they don’t sit starting the first Monday in October. Andrew Weissmann: Well, right, as a group, but they do have -- Mary McCord: Motions. That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: They still do hear motions. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. For instance in death -- Mary McCord: Think about things like death penalty. We both -- Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So I think by the terms of the (ph) death penalty litigation, I’d done it on the defense side. And so the court’s always open for that. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Just like in Mar-a-Lago, people are probably thinking, how’s this relevant? It is clear that the charges here are unofficial. Paying money to a porn star or reimbursing the money to a porn star so that information doesn’t come out that would hurt your candidacy is just not going to be viewed as presidential activity. But just like Mar-a-Lago, the issue is whether any official acts of the president came into the case when they shouldn’t have. And whether there is sort of, one, this decision, whether it’s retroactive and whether it should apply to this case that that happened before the decision came out, that’s one issue. There’s an issue of waiver. But before we get to that, the question is, what is the argument for any official conduct that came into the case? And there are certain tweets that were offered. There are certain forms, a form that was filed by President Trump while he was president that came in. But I think all of that sort of embroidery. But the critical piece is that Hope Hicks, when she testified, she testified to lots and lots of information as a candidate. And that’s going to be very hard to argue that that is in any way covered. This was before Donald Trump ever became president. So that’s just not going to be a problem. But she did testify about conversations with Donald Trump in 2018 when the Stormy Daniels story surfaced publicly. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And she said, I had conversations and the conversations weren’t just with Michael Cohen, they were with Donald Trump. And she said -- Mary McCord: I can read it. Andrew Weissmann: -- that in 2000 -- Mary McCord: I have it up. Andrew Weissmann: Oh, I like it. Okay, because there are two key pieces. Mary McCord: Yeah. She said he, meaning Mr. Trump, wanted to know how it was playing and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story, a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment. And I think Mr. Trump’s opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. That was actually the very last testimony she gave in her direct — Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- examination, before cross-examination. Andrew Weissmann: And then she cried. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: Before that piece, Mary, I don’t know if you have that up also. Donald Trump says to her, according to her testimony, that Michael Cohen made the payments to Stormy Daniels on his own without telling anyone. And she is asked, essentially, is that consistent with how you understood Michael Cohen would behave? And she says, no, he essentially is not a sort of I’m happy to do something out of the goodness of my heart. The import being that she didn’t believe Donald Trump when he said that Michael Cohen did this on his own. So those two pieces that Michael Cohen did it on his own and -- Mary McCord: Out of the kindness of his heart is what she said -- Andrew Weissmann: Right. Mary McCord: -- that the Trump told her that he spoke to Michael. Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation and that, you know, Michael felt like it was his job to protect him and that’s what he was doing and he did it out of the kindness of his own heart. That was her testimony. Andrew Weissmann: Just to be clear, that sort of exculpatory testimony. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: So it’s sort of hard for Donald Trump to complain about it. But the problem is that she then said words to the effect of I didn’t believe a word of it. I mean, she didn’t say it that way. Mary McCord: Yeah. I would say that would be out of character for Michael is what she said. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. Mary McCord: He was not a charitable person or a selfless person. Andrew Weissmann: Right. So those two pieces, I think, will be the linchpin of what Donald Trump argues. And as we said, the other point is that, by the way, on that is that the state correctly, when they argued this to the jury in summation, pointed this out to the jury and said this was devastating evidence from Hope Hicks, who had no reason to fabricate this story. She was aligned with the and still very much aligned with the president. You can tell that it hurt her to give this testimony. So they will point to that as undermining the case. But as we said, there are lots of issues and we’ll see how this state responds to it. Mary McCord: It’s important. Listeners may still be thinking, how is that conversation an official act of the president, right? Andrew Weissmann: Oh, yeah. Mary McCord: And I think it’s important. You know, the test that the Supreme Court set forth to the extent they provided guidance and really didn’t provide a heck of a lot, isn’t if you do anything while you happen to be sitting in the Oval Office or during the four years that you are president, anything you do is official. It’s not that. And so it’s really got to be this looking, this inquiry and this is why they’re sending different things back to Judge Chutkan to evaluate from the January 6th case things that Mr. Trump did while he was president. Were those official or unofficial? So here the question isn’t, is it just official because he’s talking to his White House communications director? That’s not the answer to the question. That’s the starting point. Certainly, part of a president’s official conduct is to have a communications director for the White House. But the discussions here are purely about his reaction to a story breaking about purely personal activity while he’s president and his opinion that, hey, better that it broke now after I’m already the president than it broke before, you know, while I was a candidate, right, before the election. So I think there is certainly an argument that that discussion is purely personal. And it doesn’t matter that it happened to be that he was talking to his White House communications director. That’s at least a side of it. And this is where we’ll have to see. This is exactly why Mr. Trump’s attorneys want to brief this. I expect these will be issues that both sides are briefing and Judge Merchan will have to make a decision. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I think the other piece, which is that Cohen did this on his own, the argument’s going to be that the then president was speaking to his communications director. And even though it’s a lie, it’s a way of saying this is how he wants to spin this. This is how he wants to deal with it publicly. And this is where, again, the perniciousness of the majority opinion here is how expansively they view the official acts of a president, where they sort of go on and on about that. For instance, they say that a president can talk about sort of news of the day or things that he doesn’t have a role in that he wants to weigh in on. Mary McCord: He can use his bully pulpit. They explicitly refer to that. Andrew Weissmann: Exactly. So they have a very expansive view. And so you could imagine, let’s just take a hypothetical. Let’s assume there was a fake allegation of sexual misconduct that came up before the president was president. And the president talked to his communications director about how are we going to deal with this because it’s going to hurt me as president and I need to respond. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: And I want to deny it. And so I want to say something about it. Even though what’s coming up is personal, it’s an allegation about something I did personally before I was president, but it’s going to be relevant to the voters to know whether I did this and what happened. So I need to have conversations in my official capacity with my official communications director. So all of that I think is going to allow a Justice Alito to sort of be looking at trying to look at everything through that lens of an expansive view. I think we’ve sort of narrowed and focused everybody on this podcast to the sort of critical information and sort of what the arguments are going to be on both sides. Mary McCord: Yeah. And I think the last thought before break is just, okay, so what? So suppose Judge Merchan says, yes, that’s official acts and it shouldn’t have come in. Where does that leave us? Then the assessment is, if this was err to have this admitted into evidence, is that err harmless and therefore the conviction can stand? Or was that err material to the verdict and there needs to be a new trial? And even constitutional errors can be harmless. And in fact, courts of appeals find errors to be harmless all the time. And even constitutional errors can be harmless under a standard if they’re harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. What we’re not going to get into today is there are also various arguments here about this not only being waived, but also not being objected to during trial, which would mean an easier standard, sort of, of harmlessness. But there are also arguments on the other side of that, like, well, how did they know because they didn’t have the presidential immunity decision yet with this expansive reading of official acts, so how could they have objected? There are various arguments on both sides, which we’ll have to probably discuss after we see the briefing, I think. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: So one of the things that waiver is going to be a really big issue. And there was this very belated motion that Donald Trump made. If you remember, the trial was originally going to start in March and two weeks before the trial, Donald Trump made this belated motion where he raised a lot of these issues -- Mary McCord: He raised immunity. Andrew Weissmann: -- and he raised the immunity and sort of along the lines of sort of the Hope Hicks stuff, although not by name -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- saying, you know, conversations with White House staffers and he sort of raised this issue. And the court said -- Mary McCord: Too late. Andrew Weissmann: -- too late, and by the way, Mary, you and I have been in that situation, which is like, you know, there are deadlines -- Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: -- and sometimes there’s a little leeway. But two weeks before the trial -- Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: -- when things had been briefed months and months beforehand. And so the judge had said this was too late. And so I think there’ll be a lot of stress on whether this is waived. And that would avoid if there is a strong argument for waiver, meaning you should have raised it earlier, then that sort of avoids this contretemps of the sort of what I’ll call the expansive Justice Alito view and whether there’s a way to read it in a more narrow way. So with that, should we now turn to after the break to Judge Chutkan where it raises both the issue that we’ve been talking about whether there is official conduct that would be used, but also this whole issue of what parts of the indictment are official versus unofficial. It raises not just the things that we’ve been talking about, but sort of the core issues going back to Mary, what you talked about, about Judge Chutkan has to decide what parts of the case can even proceed because they involve unofficial conduct, or whether it’s official conduct where there’s a sufficient rebuttal of the presumption of immunity. So there’s a lot before Judge Chutkan. We’ll turn to that in a moment. Mary McCord: Sounds good. (ADVERTISEMENT) Mary McCord: All right, welcome back. So we want to spend a little bit of time talking about what Judge Chutkan is supposed to do with this mess right now. And there is some guidance that the Supreme Court gave. There is a little bit of a roadmap of at least what is in front of her and what’s not. So thing one, remember, we talked about core constitutional powers, absolutely immune. This is where the Supreme Court itself said the President’s communications with his acting Attorney General and others in the Justice Department about investigating purported election fraud are within the conclusive and preclusive executive powers to investigate and prosecute crime. So therefore, those things he has absolute immunity for. As you remember, the indictment talks about that pressure on the acting Attorney General to put out statements publicly saying we’re investigating. That’s off limits. So, too, was his threatened removal of the acting Attorney General because, as the Supreme Court held, the power to remove executive officers is a presidential power. So that’s immune. So that’s something she actually doesn’t have to have a hearing about because that is absolute immunity. Andrew Weissmann: Can I just be triggered for one moment? Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: That includes commencing investigations that are shams. Mary McCord: Yes. And that’s part of the fallout, right? That decision right there means basically a president can weaponize the Department of Justice and be immune from criminal prosecution for doing that. Andrew Weissmann: And by weaponize, it’s not, oh, you should prosecute enemies. It’s you can prosecute enemies with sham investigations. Mary McCord: Yes, that’s right. Andrew Weissmann: And that’s where the sham part is in the majority decision. They recognize the indictment here is about Jeffrey Clark proposing sham investigations. Mary McCord: Sham investigations. Andrew Weissmann: And they say that is absolutely immune. I cannot stress enough how dangerous that holding is. Mary McCord: Yes. And that’s one where, you know, the ramifications. And again, this would also apply not just to the DOJ, because if the idea is that, you know, as the president, you are the chief of the executive branch, that means you could see the same thing with directing the IRS to launch sham investigations, right? You could see directing any regulatory agency to engage in sham investigations. It all seems, based on this opinion, to be immune. Andrew Weissmann: Don’t get me started. Save it. Mary McCord: We’re going to go down Trigger Avenue. Andrew Weissmann: So anyway, I definitely digressed. Mary McCord: Yes. So that Judge Chutkan doesn’t have to assess that because they’ve made that decision with respect to that part of the indictment. So you remember the other part of the indictment talks about the pressure on Mike Pence, right? The pressure on Mike Pence, including up through the president’s comments, the former president’s comments on January 6th at the Ellipse, right? If Mike Pence has the courage to do what needs to be done, we will be okay. And that pressure was to either refuse to count the electoral ballots from the swing states at all or count the fraudulent slates of electors. And so what the court says there is that when the president and the vice president are both talking about official responsibilities with each other, that’s within the outer perimeter of official acts. The reason it’s not core constitutional is because when the vice president is acting in his role as the president of the Senate, not in his role as the vice president of the, you know, country and over the executive branch, that role as vice president of the Senate is a legislative role to open and count the electoral votes and that’s not something that is part of the president’s core constitutional powers. So they’re both doing official things. And so it’s within the outer perimeter of the official acts. So what the Supreme Court says is, therefore, it is entitled to at least presumptive immunity. So the job of Judge Chutkan on remand is to determine whether the government can make a showing that prosecution based on that pressure on Mike Pence poses no danger to the authority or functions of the executive branch after receiving briefing from the parties. So this -- Andrew Weissmann: By the way, that test that you just articulated, no danger, little esoteric note. There’s no balancing. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s just no danger. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: And people might be thinking, where does that test come from? It comes from a case involving President Nixon. Mary McCord: Absent the word no. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. And so that case involved balancing. It was involved the danger to the presidency and weighing that against the public interest. Mary McCord: The demonstrable need for evidence. Andrew Weissmann: Right. And it could come out the other way, such as in the Nixon case. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Here, they lop off -- Mary McCord: The other half of the balance. Andrew Weissmann: -- the other part, and they say not just the danger, but you have to show there’s no danger. Mary McCord: No danger. Andrew Weissmann: I mean, talk about there so clearly was a voice that wanted to say, you know what, we actually think there should just be absolute immunity. But instead, we’re going to say maybe that’s still on the table. But even if there’s just presumptive immunity, the test for overcoming that presumption, it’s a little like the Wizard of Oz saying, come back with the witch’s broomstick. Mary McCord: Yeah. Really hard to get. Andrew Weissmann: Where, you know, the idea was like, you’re never going to be able to do it. Mary McCord: But she did. Andrew Weissmann: That’s because it’s a movie. Mary McCord: It’s a movie. Okay. So then people are thinking, what about the other allegations in the indictment? So what the Supreme Court says about that is that the court will have to determine whether the acts that form the basis of the charges are official or unofficial without inquiring into the president’s motives behind those things. So for the category of communications with state officials, right, pressure on state legislators to send up different slates of electors, communications involving the fraudulent electors, the majority says this requires a fact specific assessment of the numerous alleged interactions with these various people to determine whether this is within the outer perimeter of the president’s official acts or not. The court does acknowledge that the president has no authority over what slates of electors the states will send up. That is committed by the Constitution to the states. They acknowledge that, but still, they say, yeah, presidents, though, they get to talk to state legislatures about things like election integrity and they get to talk, you know, with electors about things like that. So they’re leaving that open. Now, notably, this is another area where Justice Barrett in her partial concurrence, partial dissent says, I disagree. In my mind, that is not a hard case. The alleged participation in concocting the fraudulent elector scheme is personal and unofficial. And I would have said so, you know, as part of the majority. Again, that’s her concurrence. That does not have five votes behind it. But she at least is saying, I break from the majority, which is unwilling to answer the question here. They’re sending it back to Judge Chutkan. I would have answered the question. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So what’s so interesting here is, so again, with respect to the fake electors, it’s really 5-4, not 6-3. And she said, I would answer the question that fake electors and she says in this wonderful footnote, she says, sometimes it can be hard to separate official from unofficial. And she goes, and sometimes not. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Then she goes with respect to fake electors, not hard. He has no role. Mary McCord: Exactly. Andrew Weissmann: She says there is no argument for it. My view of this is one of the reasons that I think that you don’t have in the majority a single example of what is definitively unofficial conduct in the indictment, is if they had managed to get a fifth vote. In other words, if it wasn’t 5-4, but had been 5-4 the other way -- Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: -- where somebody joined the Barrett view with respect to, let’s say, fake electors, that would have allowed Jack Smith to slim to win. In other words -- Mary McCord: He narrowed the indictment down to just that. Andrew Weissmann: He said, okay, there are five justices who say that’s unofficial conduct, fine. Mary McCord: That’s what I’ll do. Andrew Weissmann: I’m going to just go forward on fake electors. Let’s go. Mary McCord: Yep. Andrew Weissmann: But this way, by not having that definitive ruling, it means that Judge Chutkan, let’s say she agrees with Justice Barrett that fake electors is clearly not official conduct. She rules that way. But Donald Trump gets to take it back to the Supreme Court pre-trial. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: Meaning that not only did they wait to issue this until the very last day of the term, but they basically, by not saying anything, giving an example of anything that is absolutely unofficial, they guaranteed that it would have to come back to them, meaning it would never go to trial. And by the way, you want to know why my cynical view is correct? Let me just give you one more example. One of my favorite parts of this decision is when Justice Roberts says, given the importance of this case, that’s why we expedited it. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: He says we expedited hearing this and he doesn’t address at all that they could have taken the case in December and that they could have decided the case even if they didn’t take it in December on the same sort of expedited time frame as the disqualification decision. I mean, it is such a whopper. That’s the technical legal term. Mary McCord: Yes. Andrew Weissmann: That he would say that this was expedited and it’s so hard that to me -- Mary McCord: He actually goes on and on and on about how expedited the briefing was and how little factual development and, yeah. Andrew Weissmann: Crazy. So that to me is such a great little example that tells you and illustrates for you what’s going on here, because like you can start with that and it’s a lens through which you can see the rest of the case. Mary McCord: Yeah, that’s true. Okay, last category that the Supreme Court talked about last category of charged conduct in the indictment relates to Trump’s tweets and the public address on January 6th and how that impacted the rioters and the attack on the Capitol. And there the Supreme Court says, again, we’re sending this back to Judge Chutkan to decide what’s official and unofficial, but does note the majority notes most communications are likely to fall within the outer perimeter of official acts because of the presidential power of the bully pulpit. But there may be context when the president speaks in an unofficial capacity, perhaps as a candidate or as a party leader. So that fact specific analysis is necessary. And Judge Chutkan, this is now your problem. And again, what they’re saying there, and this actually something that they kind of pulled from one of the civil cases against Mr. Trump brought by Capitol police officers and House members who were injured in some cases by the rioters. In that case, the D.C. Circuit talked about using some sort of a test to determine whether Trump’s comments were made as a candidate, which are purely personal, or as president, which could be official. So here that’s going back to Judge Chutkan to for that analysis. So she’s got a lot on her plate, but they did break things up into different categories. And now we will be seeing the setting, I think, of a briefing schedule coming up here and then hearings, some of which may involve evidence, because in some of these things, the Supreme Court said this is going to be fact specific. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah. So that raises my sort of like, it’s hard to say silver lining because it’s silver lining within this case, but they still have this horrendous Supreme Court decision out there in terms of the power of the presidency that is so untethered to how we view the role of the president in a democracy. But there is this ability for a factual hearing before the general election on the issues, Mary, that you outlined, whether it has to do with the conversations with the vice president and the rebuttal of that, or whether it’s on the other aspects of the sort of official versus unofficial components of the other aspects of the indictment. One question I have for you, Mary, is, and I’ll be interested in your view, is one of the things that the government could do because there’s so many parts of this decision that are poorly reasoned and also are sort of ambiguous, even things that we haven’t talked about yet, is the idea of going back to the Supreme Court and seek re-argument. Mary McCord: This is my theory that I floated over the weekend with you, that under Rule 44, they could ask the court to rehear the case and Jack Smith could try to make some of the points that, you know, so many commentators and legal experts and constitutional experts have been making about the scope of this ruling and how it calls into question not just criminal prosecutions but Congress’s authority to legislate in areas that are part of the president’s core executive functions, Congress’s ability to conduct oversight over things that this court would say are within the core constitutional functions of the president, because the rationale that the chief justice used was not limited to criminal prosecution. He was saying, in certain areas, the president’s functions are conclusive and preclusive, meaning precluding Congress from acting, precluding judges from examining. And so it would be a chance on the public record to really make the arguments about how expansive this is and how damaging it is and how well beyond the necessity for ruling in this case some of these comments were. And it would also, if he wanted to do it, could be a chance for Jack Smith to say, look, our position is in agreement with the dissenters. But, you know, we could live with Justice Barrett’s conclusion here. And we urge the court to, essentially, members of the court to agree with that conclusion, even if not with her entire opinion. Now, that’s kind of a wacky thing. But if you imagine what she said, as we’ve been discussing today, would allow Jack Smith to move forward. He could slim down his indictment. It would allow him to use evidence of official acts as proof of knowledge and intent and motive for unofficial acts. And it certainly is a lot better than where we’re at right now with this majority opinion. So even though the dissenters would have to give up something to join with that and someone would have to come over from the majority. And it’s hard for me to imagine who that would be, because the person I would have thought most likely is the chief justice himself. And he’s the one who wrote the opinion. So I don’t know. It’s a super, super long shot, but there is some value to my mind of actually having a filed government position on this opinion. Andrew Weissmann: Yeah, I mean, I don’t know that I would do it. I think it’s in part because I think it would lead to a continued stay of the district court case so you wouldn’t have any proceedings going forward. I think if it weren’t for that, I’m not sure I see a downside. I think there’s like, you know, maybe a 1 percent chance. But if you didn’t have that issue of whether you could have a hearing, my view would be sort of if you have a 1 percent chance, it’s better than a zero percent chance if you don’t move. Mary McCord: Yeah. Andrew Weissmann: But there is this big downside. I did want to quickly address two related questions that we have from listeners. By the way, these questions are so great. Just, you know, beforehand, we were reading a bunch of questions talking about how wonderful they are. So thank you very much to the listeners. But one was about immunity and impeachment. And it was how does this immunity decision affect the ability to impeach a president for high crimes and misdemeanors if the president is immune? Another is really similar, which is about immunity and the Mar-a-Lago case where there is this issue of crime fraud. If you remember, the Beryl Howell in D.C. had said that the government could get information from lawyers because it was part of the crime fraud exception. How does this Supreme Court decision affect that? And I think there are a lot of answers to that. But one big picture is because the Supreme Court decision was framed in terms of immunity, it wasn’t saying that the conduct is legal. Mary McCord: Right. Andrew Weissmann: It wasn’t saying that Congress didn’t have the power to criminalize things. So you can still have a high crime and misdemeanor. You can still have a crime fraud exception. This decision was about whether there would be immunity from a criminal prosecution. And obviously, an impeachment is not a criminal prosecution, nor is the court saying that this is not a crime. Mary McCord: That’s right. Andrew Weissmann: It’s just saying the president could be immune in certain circumstances. The same thing for the crime fraud exception. It still is a crime. But those are great questions. By the way, I really feel like we should be getting CLE credit for everyone who’s listening. CLE is an acronym for Continuing Legal Education, which is an obligation that lawyers have to, even after they graduate from law school, to continue learning. And they have to get a certain number of credits every year to keep yourself current on the law. So I feel like we should be doing that for this podcast, even for all of the non-lawyers out there. Mary McCord: Good idea. Yeah, good idea. Andrew Weissmann: And I think we’ve managed to stay relatively calm, which is kind of amazing given the Supreme Court decision that we’re talking about, which, you know, is in my lifetime, one of the worst decisions I can possibly think of. And I don’t want to make this political, but it does mean that it’s really important that you have a president who understands the dangers of using all of those powers in the same way that you would take the pardon power, that you need a president who isn’t going to abuse that power. Mary McCord: Yeah. And, you know, that leads to one other listener question, which is kind of like, what are things that President Biden could now be doing in light of this opinion? But I am sorry, I am never going to advocate for a president to abuse his powers because he knows he’s likely to be immune from criminal prosecution. And I understand the inclination to say, okay, maybe he should weaponize things or he should do this or that. But I mean, then we have really abandoned, you know, the rule of law, in my opinion. And unfortunately, the Supreme Court’s decision does give a lot of leeway, a huge lot of leeway to somebody who comes into that office who does not believe in rule of law, who is corrupt and who wants to break the law with impunity, as the dissenters eloquently said in this case. So on that, now we’re back to a depressing note. We should probably wrap it up before it gets any worse. Andrew Weissmann: Okay. So again, a pleasure to talk to you, Mary. There’s going to be a lot to talk about as we previewed with respect to filings that are going to be made in these various cases to see essentially how our predictions play out. Mary McCord: We’ll do this next week then. Andrew Weissmann: Thanks so much for listening. We want to continue to hear from you.
