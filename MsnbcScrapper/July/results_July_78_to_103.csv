Why Americans shouldn’t buy Trump and Vance’s free speech warrior acts,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-vance-free-speech-phonies-first-amendment-rcna163102,"Republicans, conservatives and MAGA fellow travelers love to beat their chests about their commitment to free speech. But when it comes to the current leadership of the party, it’s an absurd claim.  Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, got into the free speech act during his July 17 speech at the Republican National Convention when he accepted former President Donald Trump’s nomination to be his 2024 running mate. “Shouldn’t we be governed by a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution? That’s the Republican Party of the next four years, united in our love for this country and committed to free speech and the open exchange of ideas,” the senator intoned in Milwaukee. Those words would sound great to my civil libertarian ears if I hadn’t already heard them all before.  For all the MAGA posturing about free speech, few political figures are more hostile to free expression than Trump, who every day continues to pad his lengthy resume of trying to silence his critics. And Vance supports some disturbing carveouts to the First Amendment. To cite just a few examples of Vance’s free speech tourism: He told Tucker Carlson that the government ought to seize the assets of nonprofit groups that advocate for political initiatives he doesn’t like; he called for raising taxes to punish corporations that engage in political activities he doesn’t like; as a senator he sent a menacing letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding a federal investigation of a Washington Post writer who penned an op-ed he didn’t like; he expressed the hope that the U.S. would emulate Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s move to take government control of universities and purge them of teachers and ideas he doesn’t like. In 2021, Vance told a reporter for a Catholic magazine that he supports a ban on pornography, a proposal that’s also included in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 policy document. (Incidentally, Project 2025’s lead writer, Kevin Roberts, has a book coming out in September with a foreword written by Vance, making the Trump campaign’s feigned ignorance of Project 2025 even less plausible.) That’s about as “free speech for me, not thee” as it gets. When it comes to the GOP’s boss, Trump, free speech hypocrisy is one of the only consistent political principles he’s ever held. Just this week, he reiterated his long-held support for criminalizing flag burning. And he’s called for using the government to strip TV stations of their licenses for running content of which he disapproves; banning vaguely defined “woke ideologies” from classrooms; and has used his wealth to file an endless stream of bogus lawsuits against media outlets and journalists as a means of making their lives “miserable.” He’s also repeatedly called for lowering the bar for journalists to be sued for libel and defamation. While a president can’t do such a thing, a MAGA-dominated Supreme Court could by overturning the landmark Sullivan v. New York Times decision — something that Justice Clarence Thomas indicated he’s open to doing. Thomas called the 1964 decision and subsequent judicial affirmations of it “policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law” and having “no relation to the text, history or structure of the Constitution.” Now, to be sure, Democrats have not cloaked themselves in glory and honor when it comes to protecting Americans’ rights to free expression. Support for rigid, punitive and selectively enforced campus speech codes, poorly thought-out policy proposals to clamp down on free expression in the name of fighting disinformation and the government’s “jawboning” of private companies to intimidate them into policing certain speech … all that stuff’s really bad for freedom of speech. But it’s been a long time since Democrats writ large have made vocal and robust support for free speech a major part of their branding. It’s Republicans like Trump, Vance and allies like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who talk a big game about standing tall for free speech in the face of the tyranny of the “woke mind virus” — while also deciding that they should be the arbiters of acceptable speech, for the good of society. Don’t let them get away with calling themselves free speech warriors. They’d absolutely curb Americans’ rights if given the power. We know this because they’re saying it — right to our faces."
How Kamala Harris should pick her 2024 running mate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 27, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-pick-vice-president-rcna163892,"There’s no question the Kamala Harris campaign is off to an incredible start. She’s broken fundraising records, already earned nearly every key endorsement from Democratic leadership and launched a fantastic new ad to set the tone. Her next major task? Picking a vice presidential candidate.  There are a lot of names being thrown around as potential running mates, with pundits debating whether she should pick a midwestern governor or border state Democrat to help her campaign in key battleground states.  But beyond all of the whiteboard strategizing, Harris has to ask herself a series of questions: Who does she want to be the first in the room and the last to leave for every major political discussion of her presidency? Who does she want to call from the Oval Office when stuck with a thorny issue? And with just a few months until Election Day, who has their own following, their own ability to fundraise, and their own ability to draw crowds for events?   There is no time for on-the-job training. Whoever Harris picks has to be ready to champion the Democratic ticket from Day Ane. Remember, Donald Trump picked someone who looked great on paper. But as soon as Sen. JD Vance opened his mouth on the campaign trail, things started to go downhill. The Trump campaign has spent this entire election cycle attacking the wrong opponent. And those attacks may now backfire.  The 78-year-old Trump spent a lot of time attempting to portray the 81-year-old President Joe Biden as “too old” to be president. (The maxim, “you only have to be the second-slowest swimmer in the ocean to escape a shark attack” comes to mind.) Harris is 59, meaning the tables have quite literally turned, and all the questions about Biden’s mental acuity will be naturally redirected to Trump. The Trump campaign seems clueless as to how they should go after Harris. So far, Republicans have tried mocking her laugh and clipping her speeches out of context, a strategy which has completely boomeranged. Even Trump is aware he can’t criticize her record as a prosecutor without giving Harris the obvious rebuttal that he was recently convicted by a jury of his peers. Other Republicans have referred to Harris as a “DEI hire,” suggesting she only became the presumptive Democratic nominee because of her race and gender. This racist, sexist dog whistle is so obvious even Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized it. This woman was a prosecutor for two decades before being elected the attorney general of California. She became a United States senator in 2016, gaining notoriety for her tough questioning of judicial nominees and other witnesses in contentious congressional hearings. And for the last three and a half years, she has been vice president of the United States. Contrast that with Trump, who became president after a career spent losing money on real estate and fake firing people on TV.  The “DEI” attacks are also designed to disillusion would-be supporters. As one woman of color told The New York Times this week, “America is just not ready for a woman president — especially not a Black woman president.” But that’s the thing about firsts. They’ve never happened before. Believe me, when I joined the Obama campaign in 2007, plenty of friends and family assumed I would be off the campaign trail within months. Because — and this may sound familiar — the country wasn’t ready to elect a Black president.  In a new op-ed for the Times, Hillary Clinton — herself no stranger to firsts — laid out the challenge for Harris, writing, “While it still pains me that I couldn’t break that highest, hardest glass ceiling, I’m proud that my two presidential campaigns made it seem normal to have a woman at the top of the ticket.” She continued, “Ms. Harris will face unique additional challenges as the first Black and South Asian woman to be at the top of a major party’s ticket…That’s real, but we shouldn’t be afraid. It is a trap to believe that progress is impossible.” Hillary is right. Fear is a trap. And it’s a trap that needs to be called out. There is no time for wallowing. Because even if Mike Johnson and Republican leaders could get their caucus to stop saying the quiet parts out loud and stop taking cheap shots at Harris qualifications, right-wing media pundits aren’t going to get the memo. And neither is the guy at the top of the ticket. As one adviser to Trump told the Bulwark this week, “Trump leads this campaign. So we’re ready for him to call her a DEI hire by Biden.” Republicans are ready, and Democrats should be too. In his Oval Office address Wednesday night, Biden further discussed his vision for the remaining six months of his presidency and promised to “call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy.” While the president has yet to announce any specifics, such a plan may include an enforceable code of ethics, term limits, and perhaps even expanding the number of justices. Additionally, Biden may be considering calling for a constitutional amendment to eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other constitutional officeholders. Of course, those plans face long odds in the Republican-controlled House, and Democrats only hold a slim majority in the Senate. (Although to be clear, roughly two in three Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices.) A constitutional amendment would pose even more challenges, requiring two-thirds support in both chambers and ratification by three fourths of state legislatures.  Biden spent eight years as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and nearly a decade as ranking minority member. It’s safe to say he takes these proposed measures of Supreme Court reform seriously. Clearly, Biden does not intend to have a “lame duck” presidency. NBC News Washington correspondent Yamiche Alcindor has featured prominently in our U.S. Supreme Court this May and June. Now she turns her focus to the Harris campaign. Few journalists are as attuned to the stakes of this election as Alcindor. With her deep understanding of issues like the Supreme Court’s recent presidential immunity ruling and the broader implications of court decisions, she’s uniquely equipped to address the proposed reforms that will be central to the 2024 campaign. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz put it best this week when he posted the following in response to Donald Trump: “Say it with me… Weird.”  I had the pleasure of interviewing Walz this week, and he didn’t hold back."

White women fuel yet another fundraising surge for Harris as virtual meetups spread,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 2:45 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-women-fundraising-democrats-zoom-rcna163871,"In the days since President Joe Biden announced his plans not to seek re-election and Vice President Kamala Harris announced her campaign, a multiracial, multigenerational and gender-diverse coalition of voters have come together for virtual meetups that have fueled a fundraising boom for the Democrats. To me, it has had the feel of an Avengers-like assemblage of all the coalitions Harris will need for a chance to win in November. No, this isn’t the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is Kamala’s Democratic Universe. The fundraising hauls speak to a palpable enthusiasm surrounding the Democratic Party’s de facto presidential nominee. All of the calls have featured a variety of community organizers, celebrities and politicians mobilizing voters to cast ballots for Harris’ ticket this fall. It started Sunday, when Win With Black Women hosted a Zoom call that the group said attracted 44,000 attendees and raised more than $1.5 million. The next day, a group of Black men under a similar banner, Win With Black Men, hosted a call that an organizer said attracted nearly 54,000 attendees and raised $1.3 million. Several more virtual meetups have followed. A Latinas for Harris call on Wednesday reportedly attracted 5,000 attendees and raised $110,000. The same night, a call hosted by South Asian Women for Harris drew 10,000 attendees and raised $285,000, according to an organizer. The latest whopping fundraising haul came Thursday night during a Zoom call intended for white women who support Harris, which an organizer said drew 164,000 participants and raised $2 million. (NBC News hasn’t confirmed these fundraising numbers independently.) And the trend continues. A call was held Thursday for Black gay and queer men supporting Harris, and a similar call was organized for white men. And a national, coalition-wide Women for Harris call has been scheduled for Monday. What a difference a week makes. Democrats had been enduring a storm of defections from Biden, their presumptive presidential nominee. But with Harris, there has been energy surrounding her, interest in her and investment in her — like no other Democrat in recent memory, perhaps other than Barack Obama."

Trump, who has for months urged Israel to end the war in Gaza as quickly as possible, insisted that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel were on good terms after the two met on Friday in Palm Beach, Fla.” * The Federal Prison Oversight Act: “President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday a bill strengthening oversight of the crisis-plagued federal Bureau of Prisons after reporting by The Associated Press exposed systemic corruption, failures and abuse in the federal prison system.” * Supreme Court ethics: “Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday became the first member of the Supreme Court to call publicly for beefing up its new ethics code by adding a way to enforce it. In her first public remarks since the nation’s highest court wrapped up its term earlier this month, Kagan said she wouldn’t have signed onto the new rules if she didn’t believe they were good. But having good rules is not enough, she said.” * The demise of DeSantis’ so-called Stop WOKE Act: “A judge issued a final order Friday to overturn a Florida law pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that attempted to limit diversity and race-based discussions in private workplaces. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker previously ruled the law is unconstitutional. That decision was upheld by an appeals court in March. Walker’s latest order makes his temporary injunction permanent.” * A societal scourge: “New data on threats and harassment toward public officials in the United States show a 15 percent rise in such incidents during the first half of 2024 compared with 2023. Fully 42 percent of the reported events were death threats, according to the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which has been conducting the rolling study since January 2022. Its authors noted that racially motivated threats were reported at higher rates so far this year than those focused on gender, sexual orientation and identity.” * Kudos to The Washington Post for taking a deep dive (so to speak) into this strange story: “Over the past 10 months, former president Donald Trump has periodically unspooled a nonsensical tale involving a sinking electric boat, a potential electrocution and a ferocious shark attack.” Have a safe weekend."
"JD Vance tries, fails to clean up his ‘childless cat ladies’ mess",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 12:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-tries-fails-clean-childless-cat-ladies-mess-rcna163862,"Sen. JD Vance has been a candidate for national office for 11 days now, and during that time, Americans have learned quite a bit about the Ohio Republican. The unaccomplished senator, however, hasn’t made an especially good first impression. Many officials in his own party believe Donald Trump made the wrong choice when picking a new running mate, and Vance is the first vice presidential hopeful in the modern era to have a negative favorability rating the week after his party’s convention. But amid the avalanche of information voters have received about the 39-year-old lawmaker, three words have come to define his worldview. Three years ago, during his first campaign for elected office, the then-Senate candidate appeared on Fox News and diagnosed what he saw as a crisis plaguing the United States. The country, Vance told a national television audience, was being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It’s just a basic fact.” The future senator specifically included Vice President Kamala Harris — who has step-children, but no biological children of her own — in his societal condemnation. He’s quite the charmer. The ugliness of Vance’s rhetoric — rooted in the idea that those without biological children are somehow lesser, unreliable and undeserving of positions of leadership — has not gone unnoticed. On the contrary, it seems to have spread with extraordinary speed this week, drawing sharp rebukes from those who are generally detached from the political discourse. The GOP’s vice presidential nominee has made plenty of similar comments during his brief tenure in the political arena, but as CNN’s Andy Kaczynski noted this week, the “childless cat ladies” comment was “permeating the culture,” while simultaneously “defining Vance to a lot of people.” As part of an apparent attempt to put things right, the Ohioan sat down with SiriusXM's Megyn Kelly today and addressed the controversy, arguing: I have a hunch this won’t make matters better. For one thing, for Vance to say he has “nothing against cats” suggests he’s under the impression that the controversy is feline-related. It’s not. The underlying question is about whether he has something against women, not something against cats. For another, his 2021 comments were many things, but they weren’t “sarcastic.” On the contrary, he appears to have doubled down on the comments that sparked the controversy in the first place. Finally, if Vance has credible evidence of liberals being “anti-child,” he’s kept it well hidden. I can appreciate why the vice presidential hopeful is trying to clean up his mess, but Vance has had plenty of time to work out a defense, and if “nothing against cats” is the best he can come up with, the Republican’s problem is likely to linger for a while."
Justice Elena Kagan says what's plain to see on ethics code enforcement,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 11:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/elena-kagan-supreme-court-ethics-code-rcna163830,"Facing criticism amid last year's scandals, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct in November. From the start, one glaring problem with that code was its lack of an enforcement mechanism. Justice Elena Kagan acknowledged that shortcoming Thursday at a legal conference in California. The Barack Obama appointee noted that rules usually have enforcement mechanisms — and this one doesn’t. She said that it’s hard to figure out who should do the enforcing and how, but that there should be a mechanism. She proposed that the justices shouldn’t do it amongst themselves but that lower federal court judges would probably be the best choice. How that arrangement would work and what penalties would be available are still open questions. And Kagan is just one voice among nine justices, at least some of whom likely disagree, including, perhaps, the justices at the center of recent controversies: Republican appointees Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. But just like it’s important for President Joe Biden to press court reforms even if they won’t come soon, it’s important for Kagan to inform the public of her preference for accountability, even if her ideas don’t catch on with all the other justices. One of the reforms that Biden reportedly supports is an enforceable code — something that likely wouldn’t pass a Republican-controlled House and that the Republican-majority court might strike down as unconstitutional, anyway. The court’s composition raises a larger issue in need of reform — whether by term limits, expanding the number of justices or both — something that was also evident from Kagan’s public appearance Thursday. She highlighted the importance of respecting precedent, in the wake of yet another term in which the majority overturned a big one, this time Chevron deference. That decision led to Kagan's dissent in which she wrote that “a longstanding precedent at the crux of administrative governance thus falls victim to a bald assertion of judicial authority. The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.”  Even for something simple, like ethics rules with consequences for violating them, it’s clear that the court will cling to power as long as it can, both in its rulings and operations.

Trump wants to criminalize flag-burning. Here’s why that’s un-American.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 11:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-flag-burning-ban-palestine-protesters-rcna163736,"Images of protesters burning American flags are always divisive. But the scenes emerging from demonstrations in Washington during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress were especially so, given some protesters’ open support of Hamas. Equally predictable? The immediate calls to ban and punish flag burning that arose as criticism of the protests snowballed.  It is a question Americans continue to spar over, even though it is one the Supreme Court settled 35 years ago in Texas v. Johnson. In that case, the court affirmed that the government cannot punish offensive expression in service of protecting national symbols. Put simply, our anthem and our flag are not weighted more heavily than our rights.  But supporters of a ban got a boost from former President Donald Trump this week when, appearing on “Fox & Friends,” he advocated for congressional action and “a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American flag.” “Now, people will say, ‘Oh, it’s unconstitutional,’” the Republican presidential nominee added. “Those are stupid people that say that.”  Vice President Kamala Harris — the likely Democratic nominee — released a statement, as well. Unlike Trump, she did not call for a ban on flag burning, instead stating that the flag should “never be desecrated.” Let’s get a few things out of the way: Yes, you have the right to burn the American flag, but with some caveats.  You do not, of course, have the right to steal and vandalize a flag you do not own, and you may not be able to burn a flag in protest in any and all public spaces because of safety regulations. Police reportedly made arrests connected to protesters’ alleged theft and destruction of flags in the park outside Union Station, as well as other acts of vandalism. The conversations spurred by Trump and other advocates of a flag burning ban, however, extend far beyond criminal acts and well into purely expressive conduct. At its core, what’s at stake here is the right of people across the political spectrum to express deeply unpopular political views and be free of retaliation from the government they are criticizing.  Flag burners are rarely sympathetic free speech test cases for many Americans, but distaste for the incendiary way they express their opposition to the government should not lull us into accepting censorship rules that would be more at home in China or Russia than in a free country. Similar issues were recently raised in a court thousands of miles away that should illustrate to Americans the peril of allowing the government to erode the right to criticize or mock national symbols. In Hong Kong, the center of an ongoing crackdown on dissent, a man was found guilty last week of insulting China’s anthem after covering his ears while it played at a volleyball game.  That conviction should serve as a warning bell for Americans, not a playbook to follow.  Flag burning may be a deeply unpopular form of political expression, but it is nevertheless protected. That’s actually a sign of the wisdom of our First Amendment, not its stupidity. It suggests a confidence that critics of the U.S. and its symbols can be moved to change their minds through persuasion, a hallmark of a free and healthy society, rather than force.  Confining people to jail cells for burning the flag is far more likely to validate that they were right to oppose and mistrust the U.S. than to prove to them the sanctity of its symbols. “The way to preserve the flag’s special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters,” Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority of the Court in Texas v. Johnson. “It is to persuade them that they are wrong.”  His words are as true today as they were decades ago. Our speech rights may not be as tangible as a flag, but they are in far greater need of protection than our symbols. New flags can and will be sewn and raised, but a desecrated First Amendment would be much more difficult to repair."
"After the immunity ruling, Trump’s hush money case could come down to this",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:38 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-immunity-ruling-hush-money-case-new-york-rcna163781,"What effect does the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling have on Donald Trump’s New York criminal case? According to a new court filing from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, it has “no bearing on this prosecution.” That may turn out to be so. But let’s consider how the Roberts Court’s ruling, which came after the New York trial, could work mischief on the already secured guilty verdicts in the so-called hush money case. Recall that the high court’s Republican-appointed majority laid out a new, vague test for distinguishing between official acts that are (or can be) immune from prosecution, as opposed to unofficial acts that can be charged. That’s not the issue in this New York state case, where Trump wasn’t charged with official conduct. Rather, the issue stems from a strange part of the immunity ruling that curbs the government’s use of official-act evidence to prove guilt of private conduct. That raises the question of whether any such official evidence was improperly used to secure the Manhattan verdict — and what to do about it if so. First, what supposed official evidence from the trial are we talking about here? Prosecutors noted that Trump claimed six types: Prosecutors contend that the evidence didn’t run afoul of the immunity ruling and that “even if some of this evidence were improperly admitted, any error was harmless in light of other overwhelming evidence” of Trump’s guilt and shouldn’t lead to overturning the guilty verdict. Legal errors at criminal trials don’t automatically lead to reversal when there’s otherwise overwhelming evidence of guilt, and prosecutors say that’s the case here (while maintaining that there was no legal problem to begin with). Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyers argue that they should prevail in any harmless-error analysis but that such analysis can’t even apply here because, they say, presidential immunity errors are never harmless. In a normal case, the prosecution would be on solid footing. And it may yet prevail in defending the Trump verdict despite the immunity ruling. But we’re in a new world after that decision, one in which the Supreme Court majority’s guiding light can seemingly be boiled down to suspicion of prosecutions against former presidents — at least this former president. In their motion, which was made public Thursday, prosecutors wrote that none of the evidence that Trump objects to “said anything whatsoever about defendant’s presidential policies or political positions.” They further noted that the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, “not only allowed extensive individualized questioning during voir dire to ensure that the jurors were not politically biased, but also carefully instructed the jury not to let their personal or political opinions of defendant affect their consideration of the evidence.” That’s true. But in the immunity ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts was dismissive of the safeguards that are apparently sufficient to protect any other criminal defendant, writing that tools like evidentiary rulings and jury instructions “are unlikely to protect adequately the President’s constitutional prerogatives.” Again, perhaps the ruling has “no bearing” on this case, which has already gone to trial and wasn’t premised on Trump’s official conduct. It’s laughable to contemplate that the president’s constitutional prerogatives are at stake in the context of covering up a personal hush money scheme. But if it’s decided in retrospect that any official-type evidence improperly seeped into Trump’s trial, then prosecutors may be forced to try him all over again. Merchan is expected to rule Sept. 6 and sentence Trump on Sept. 18 if he rejects the defendant’s immunity motion. The judge already had a heavy task in weighing how to sentence the Republican presidential nominee. Now the immunity ruling has added another vague hurdle to get to that point.

What’s next for Biden? with Jamelle Bouie: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/talking-s-biden-jamelle-bouie-podcast-transcript-rcna163845,"The Democratic Party coalition is a complicated one to say the least. A growing number of Democrats have called on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election in recent weeks. Those encouraging him to step aside have cited concerns about his fitness for office and ability to win reelection. Jamelle Bouie is a New York Times opinion columnist and is a co-host of the Unclear and Present Danger podcast. He joins WITHpod to discuss the lack of mechanisms to force an incumbent president to withdraw from the race, the mostly unprecedented set of circumstances surrounding all of this, the case for and against Vice President Kamala Harris as a replacement Democratic nominee. Note that this conversation was recorded on Friday, July 12th before the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign event in Pennsylvania and before President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection. Jamelle Bouie: The thing I keep coming to is that maybe really it’s just as simple as people want someone younger on the ballot. That’s it. And if you put someone younger on the ballot, they’ll be like, I want to vote for that person because they seem younger. And if that is the situation we’re in, then like, I kind of think the case for just Biden stepping down is a pretty strong one. And to my mind, it’s easy to imagine the thing Joe Biden could say, right? Sort of like, the reason I got back into politics in a real way was just to keep Donald Trump away from power. And I did it four years. I’m not sure I can do it for another four years. I think my vice president can. Chris Hayes: Hello, and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. So, I am speaking to you on Monday, July 15th, mid-afternoon, which is one day before this episode should hit your podcast feeds. And the reason I’m starting with that time marker is because we tried to do something last week that we basically never do, which was a sort of on the news cycle WITHpod. You know, WITHpod tends to be a podcast that’s sort of a step removed from the news cycle intentionally. Obviously, I have a nightly TV show on MSNBC at 8:00 p.m., where we’re relentlessly on the news cycle, but WITHpod allows a step back and we could do topics that are esoteric or even topics that are sort of on what’s in the news, like the campaign, but with a sort of step removed to look and say the policy records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden in immigration. Anyway, long way of saying, last week, I was like, let’s just do something about this conversation happening about the Democratic Party and who its nominee should be and whether that should be Joe Biden, who, of course, won the primary going away, or he should step down and endorse Kamala Harris or someone else at an open convention. This was a conversation that had sort of enveloped and consumed the large coalition of the Democratic Party in the wake of the debate performance. And so on Friday, Jamelle Bouie, who’s one of my favorite columnists, writers, thinkers, one of the wisest people, I think, writing and thinking about politics, one of the most deeply read, got together for a conversation on that topic and more or less like, well, who should be the nominee, more about the sort of nature of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party coalition and why it was in the position it found itself in. So that was on Friday, July 12th. Of course, one day later, on Saturday, July 13th, during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, an assassin attempted to kill former President Trump about six minutes into his remarks there. The former president was, it appears, grazed by a bullet that hasn’t been hard confirmed yet, seen bleeding from his ear. Secret Service shot the shooter, the 20-year-old, and several other people were injured. One man was killed, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Compatore. There were several others who were injured. We’re hoping to get status checks on them. Obviously, a completely and utterly horrifying event sent, I think, everyone I know into a kind of spinning black circle just because it’s just about the worst thing that can happen in politics. It’s the thing that you don’t want at all. It’s a refutation of the sort of shared civic enterprise of democracy, the nonviolent resolution of social conflict through the processes we have. It’s a repudiation of that. It’s also toxic and morally repugnant and also just upsetting. So that happened on Saturday. I’m speaking to you now on Monday, July 15th, and we have two things that have happened today. J.D. Vance, a senator from Ohio who’s been senator less than two years, was just named as the vice presidential nominee on the Republican ticket by Donald Trump on the first day of the RNC. Aileen Cannon, who’s the federal judge appointed by Donald Trump in a lame duck session in 2020 while he was trying to overturn the results of the November election, she has dismissed the case against Donald Trump in her court on the secret documents case, saying that Jack Smith’s appointment does not fit with the appointments clause and he was sort of improperly appointed and therefore the case has to be dismissed. This is a totally shocking ruling, I think, largely out of completely out of line with precedent and largely lawless. But we’ll see what happens, whether it gets overturned or not. All this to say the last three days have been a wildly intense news cycle. And so I say all that because, first of all, I think the conversation Jamelle and I had is still relevant because it’s really descriptively about the nature of the Democratic Party and why it’s a complicated coalition, what it means to talk about the Democratic Party, who is the they when you say they and the Democratic Party. And also, I don’t necessarily think this conversation is completely died down. I think it’s died down considerably since Friday. But there’s new polling out today by “The New York Times” that shows Vice President Harris polling ahead of President Biden in Virginia and Pennsylvania by a few points. But there and we’ve seen polling look like that. There’s reporting today that Nancy Pelosi continues to make calls behind the scenes, trying to figure out a way to marshal enough people to try to get President Biden to announce that he’s stepping down. So all of this relevant. Obviously, I want to just acknowledge all the things that have happened since we recorded this conversation. But I do think it’s a good conversation. I learned a lot from it. And so it was really great to have an opportunity to have Jamelle Bouie on the program. (MUSIC PLAYING) Chris Hayes: Jamelle, welcome to the program. Jamelle Bouie: Thank you for having me. Chris Hayes: Okay, to start out, you had a conversation with Ezra like a week ago, but that was before the George Stephanopoulos interview and the president’s press conference, which happened last night. And I’m talking to you the day after that press conference. By the time our listeners are hearing this, the interview with the president and NBC’s Lester Holt has aired. Have the developments of the past week changed how you think about this at all? Jamelle Bouie: So, my initial thought about all of this was that I’m not sure that any of this pressure is going to make a huge difference because the decision is ultimately up to Biden. And there’s just not very many mechanisms to force an incumbent president to not run for reelection. And to the extent that that could happen, I always thought that he’d have to really kind of, you know, repeat the performance of the debate again and again and again in these various forums. And there’d also have to be definitive evidence that some other candidate would be more viable in the general election. And I guess fortunately for Joe Biden, unfortunately for those who want to remove Joe Biden, his subsequent performances have not been so bad as to, you know, push people to demand him to get off the ticket even more than they already have. And the polling has been kind of like inconclusive. Like it’s not been good for Biden, but it’s not like a slam dunk for anyone else either. So I think I still am where I’ve always been, which is that like, it’s just unclear what could happen and it’s unclear whether or not this is like dispositive for the election. Chris Hayes: Yeah. I mean, I agree with basically all that. I think the polling, as I read it, got really bad about a week out and then has sort of now plateaued a little bit again. But at a level where Joe Biden was behind, I think going into the debate, I think that his own people recognize that and part of the gamble of having this early debate in June was to kind of reset the structural forces underneath the election to get people to pay attention, to understand that Donald Trump was running again. I want to stay with something that you said that I think is a very important part of this that is both central to what’s happening and also maddening, which is what is the Democratic Party? Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And I think there is some sense, and you see this even in pretty like informed political reporters about like some they, there’s a they there. Jamelle Bouie: Right.  Chris Hayes: And at some level there is. Jamie Harrison, who I talked to last night, is the chairperson of the National Democratic Committee. But functionally, the way politics works in my lifetime is when a party holds the White House, the president is the head of the party. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: You know, it’s like that’s the way it works. And so part of the issue here is the fact that that is the reality, just as an almost institutional, organizational and political level that you have to figure out. You basically have to bootstrap some new set of processes, forms of coordination outside of the institutional nature of the party precisely because that party is kind of de facto run by the president. Jamelle Bouie: I think that’s exactly right. This is something that I have found really interesting to observe, which is, as you say, that the sense that there must be some day (ph), that there is an institutional Democratic Party that looks something like it did maybe in like 1950, right? There are the party bosses and high level, you know, strategist and maybe some elected officials who they get together and they decide what the Democratic Party does.  And if they decide the Democratic Party doesn’t want Joe Biden as a nominee, then all you have to do is pressure those people in some way. And they can tell Joe Biden to like, you know, take a hike, retire early, enjoy the rest of your life. But that’s just not how American political parties are and have not been for quite some time. And they kind of the fact of the matter is that in the modern era of American political parties, which generally refers to the party system after the McGovern Frazier reforms of 1970, 1972 -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- which basically got rid of the old conventions, got rid of kind of a lot of the backroom dealing and democratized the party system a bit more, made it more open to outside actors. But like one consequence of that, right, is that first, it’s no longer party elders or bosses or machines or anyone determining who the candidates going to be. You know, in the 1924 Democratic National Convention, it was like literal bosses from like, you know, representing various cities across the country getting together in like a convention hall and saying, you know, I can deliver these votes, you can deliver those votes. My guy, you know, does well with these. That’s how it went. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: But now, right, it’s very candidate centered. The candidate decides they’re going to run. The candidate builds up a campaign and they don’t appeal to institutional actors. I mean, they do to an extent they have to get endorsements and such, but they appeal as much to a voting public and a voting public that ultimately gives legitimacy to whoever is going to be the nominee. And that critical element of like the legitimacy obtained by winning primaries is what makes it so difficult to dislodge an incumbent president from a re-election campaign because they got the prize as it was defined, right? They had the legitimacy that no one else does. And so, as you said, in order to even begin to think of a situation in which you do get rid of an incumbent president running for re-election, you kind of have to create an entirely new structure for how parties make these sorts of decisions.   Chris Hayes: Well, certainly when you’re outside the primary system, like when you’re in the primary system, it’s like, you know, there are models there, all of which have been unsuccessful. So in 1980, Ted Kennedy challenged incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter unsuccessfully. In 1992, Pat Buchanan challenged the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, again, unsuccessfully. Scored some victories, definitely like wounded him. And in ‘68, of course, famously, LBJ was challenged and then he announced he would not run after New Hampshire. But first of all, none of those were successful. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And second of all, these were in the primary process. What you’re talking about doing now is just at an organizational, institutional level, utterly unprecedented in the modern age and hasn’t really been done in a real way since like 1924, and even that was more orderly because it wasn’t a person four months before saying, I’m not going to be the nominee. Jamelle Bouie: Right, exactly. I mean, it’s actually hard to think of a precedent. I mean, again, in the modern era, there is none. And even in the, you know, throughout the 20th century, you’d have to really go back to like the 19th century when it was a little more common, right, for incumbent presidents to be challenged for the nomination at the convention. That is a thing that used to happen. But again, the conventions, there was no presumption of like a nominee needed democratic legitimacy of any kind. It really was the party decides the people representing the party will decide if the nominee is going to be. And in our moment, you know, the convention isn’t set up to do that. The people who attend the conventions, like the delegates, they don’t represent constituencies in that way like it’s -- Chris Hayes: Right. They’re not going there with the like either institutional knowledge and practice of like, okay, I run this machine in Columbus, Ohio. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And like I’m really connected to like the Irish dock workers, you know, in the New York Harbor. That’s not what we’re dealing with when we’re talking about the delegates. I mean, the delegates are connected politicians and political entities and, you know, donors, volunteers, like they are sort of the fabric of the party, but it’s just a very different thing.   You said the party decides, which I think it’s worth laying around a little political science here. That’s the title of a fairly famous book that came out -- Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: -- after the 2008 primary by four different political scientists, which basically makes the argument that the broad contrary to the argument was, even though these reforms happened in the ‘70s to change it from this sort of party centric system to the ostensibly democratic institution of primaries, it was still the case the party retained a kind of veto and these informal mechanisms through donors and through coordination to will who the party wanted to be the nominee. And one of the things I think we’ve seen is the breakdown of that. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: I mean, 2016 is a big test of the party decides thesis for the Republicans and for the Democrats to a certain extent. I mean, you know, it is true in 2020 would look like Bernie Sanders was going to be the nominee. There was a coordinated action by high level Democrats to stop him from being the nominee.   So when you don’t have the incumbent presidency, I think, it’s a little easier to coordinate. And they definitely did coordinate in an effective way. But ultimately, they coordinate effective way. And then that vote was ratified by the voters, you know, in Super Tuesday in the states afterwards. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. Chris Hayes: Right. So first, you’re just dealing at an institutional level with like, how would this even work? The muscles aren’t there. The process is under there. But then the other sort of political science thing I keep thinking about is this idea of sort of strong polarization, weak parties as a defining attribute of our current politics. There’s a book called “The Hollow Parties” by Danny Schultzman and Sam Rosenfeld who sort of writes about this. And I remember back in 2016, I would go around when everyone was like Trump can’t win and I would be at a party or I’d be at a bar or something, people like, can Trump win? I say, yeah, of course, he can win. And what I would say to them is, if you, the person I’m talking to, were the nominee for a major party, you’d be sitting at 42, 43 percent of the vote. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chris Hayes: You like you’d have maybe not exactly a coin flip, but like you’d have a shot like no one’s winning 49 states. We don’t have the structural conditions for that. So you just take someone, anyone off the street, my interlocutor, person at a bar, you put them on the ticket. They’re hovering at 40, 41, 42. It’s going to be a battle over those last four or five points, particularly in the swing states. And you might get your clock cleaned in a narrow sense, like the 2008 election, but the polarization is so strong. So when you combine that with weak parties, I feel like we really saw that in 2016 with Trump and we’re seeing a different version. It’s not symmetrical with the Democrats right now of strong polarization, weak parties. Jamelle Bouie: Right. I mean, the Democratic Party, in this political science, it’s a weak party. And I think what we’re witnessing now is the extent to which the weakness of the institutional party, the weakness of these informal mechanisms to try to coerce an incumbent off the ballot and the extent to which the party does emanate from whoever can claim leadership at the top. In this case, it’s Biden. For the Republicans, it’s Trump, right? Kind of the other side of this, I mean, I would say very much like a similar situation is although there was a primary to try to choose a new Republican nominee. From the jump, it was clear that this wasn’t going to be particularly competitive, that by virtue of Trump refusing to let go of his claim to leadership over the Republican Party, which itself was unusual, usually a defeated incumbent president. Chris Hayes: Yeah, man. They’re like, get lost. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, that’s a get out of here. You’re done. Jimmy Carter went to go, you know -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- you know, go do his thing. George H.W. Bush went to go do his thing. It doesn’t happen. Even right like a two term president, once they’re out, they’re out. You choose a new leader. So Trump deciding not to leave to hold on to his claim to power, which is very unusual, it was path dependency from there. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: That more or less said that he was going to be the nominee, that he still was a leader of the party. And in the absence of any kind of strong institution that can, you know, push that kind of personalist figure away, you’re left with, you know, they are at the top. And likewise, Biden, he’s the president. He won that primary four years ago. And in the absence of any kind of institutional configuration that can push him aside, he is going to be the nominee unless he decides not to be. Chris Hayes: Yeah. I mean, the question is, can that choice be forced? And you are seeing like a kind of ad hoc attempt to do that, right. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: Today, you know, you’ve got George Clooney’s op ed. You’ve got Nancy Pelosi on “Morning Joe” saying very pointedly he has to decide. You have a stream of members of Congress coming out and saying they think that he should step aside. You’ve got $90 million in super PAC donations being held. I mean, all these different parts of the sort of higher echelons of the party are attempting right now to do this.   Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: There’s really a question of, you know, whether they can. I think it’s a very volatile situation. I don’t know what’s going to happen, honestly. Jamelle Bouie: No, I think it’s very hard to say. You know, it’s interesting, you know, donors, elected officials, and I think this underscores the point we’ve been making that the response, I mean, this is Biden’s response, right. That’s sort of like, well, they didn’t elect me, right? Chris Hayes: Right. Jamelle Bouie: The voters elected me. And that gets to this this reality that the currency of the realm is where is like a democratic legitimacy. And that’s why I think it’s also why, as people begin to actually think seriously about what this would look like, because one of the other parts of this is that, you know, there’s been this push to get Biden to resign. But then there’s also, I think, been a lot of like fantasizing about how you would choose new nominee. Chris Hayes: Yeah, like a parlor game. Like I’m feeling Whitmer-Shapiro. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: No, no. I’m like in Newsom, you know, whatever. It’s like, yeah. Jamelle Bouie: But the reality is that like there’s only one other person who has any legitimate claim to that kind of democratic legitimacy. Chris Hayes: Yeah.  Jamelle Bouie: And it’s Kamala Harris -- Chris Hayes: Vice President of the United States, yeah. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: Yeah. So here’s a metaphor I’ve been using and we haven’t even gotten to like whether he should or not, which I do want to sort of engage in that normative question. But I actually think some of the descriptive features are important here because the conversation is so taken up with this normative question about like what to do. But like understanding actually the dynamics of play to me are pretty interesting. And the way I’ve been describing this is people’s like and I don’t know if you’re a baseball fan, but, you know, you name your starter for the seventh game of the World Series. He pitches a good game and he’s at 120 pitches, which if you don’t pay attention, baseball is like very high, like pitchers at a certain point their arm gives out. There’s only so many pitches the body can throw because it puts an incredible strain on an arm. Jamelle Bouie: I’ve seen it “For the Love of the Game.” Chris Hayes: Yeah, great. So at 120 pitches and there’s four outs to go and he’s just loaded the bases, so it’s not looking good. And what happens in that moment in a baseball game is the manager comes and gets the starter and takes him out and replaces him with a new pitcher. Now, when that happens, the starter hates it always. In fact, you could watch videos on YouTube of them cursing out the manager into their glove or like shaking their head or be like, don’t come and get me. And they’re not doing that because they’re like pigheaded idiots necessarily. They’re doing it because the nature of the psychology that gets someone to the position in which they’re starting a World Series game seven is a psychology that says I can get the last four outs. I can do it. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: I can will myself through. That it is almost definitionally the case to have like the level of confidence and steel you have to get yourself in that position. And so every time the manager comes out in that situation, the guy on the mound is pissed. But there’s a manager to make the call. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And what is the situation here is there is no manager. So it’s like he’s on the mound. People are watching him throw these pitches and being like he is not throwing as hard as he was before. And the other aspect of this sort of extended analogy is that when the manager makes a call, sometimes a relief pitcher comes in and gives up a homer and everyone calls in the sports radio the next day and says, why’d you pull him? Which is totally possible here. Like the same sense of like an uncertain future outcome, the same sense in which when you pull the starter, you’re often pulling them for someone who is an inferior pitcher almost by definition because the starters in there because they’re the better pitcher. They’re not in the pen. Like all of those features are present here to me in this conversation, but there’s no manager to come make the call, which is why the whole thing is so angst ridden.  Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And it’s why it’s so angst ridden. It’s why the pressure from, you know, from a variety of sources, from politicians, from the media seems to be almost like repetitive at this point. Sort of like everyone’s kind of saying the same thing again and again out of, I think, a belief that if we just say it enough, we can kind of become the manager. We can become the captain here, but that’s just not -- Chris Hayes: No, he’s the manager. He has to take himself out of the game.   Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: You have to convince him to take himself out of the game. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And this is a point I made before I wrote last year, maybe when there was lots of dread over a Trump-Biden rematch. And I said, you know, listen, there are there basically structural reasons why Trump’s to be the nominee again. But there are psychological reasons why Biden’s going to run again and be the nominee. And that’s like to your point, Chris. The kind of human being who doesn’t just like become president, but devotes their entire adult life to trying to be president, it’s not the kind of person who’s going to like hang it up, like he’s not. Chris Hayes: You know what, you’re right.  You’re right. No, I mean, that’s true. So let’s talk a little bit about, I think it’s useful in this conversation to separate out two things, which is a question about who is best positioned to defeat Trump, which I think three or four months ago, I thought it was Biden. And now, I don’t necessarily think that, like particularly the binary choice of Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, which I agree with you is the most likely path forward, although, again, we’re in sort of uncertain and volatile times. So the question of who is best to make this sort of to run the homestretch of this campaign in this incredibly high stakes election. And then the substantive question of like, should this man, Joe Biden, the man that you’ve seen and the man who clearly has aged, you know, I think considerably in the last four years. Again, it’s the most stressful job in the world and he came in at 77. The job ages everyone who enters into it. We’ve all seen the pictures of Barack Obama before and after, Abraham Lincoln before and after, Bill Clinton before and after, like we know this. It’s almost a cliche. So the substantive question, independent of who’s best to take the fight to Trump and to win over persuadable voters so as to forestall a Donald Trump second term is like, should this guy be president when he’s 85? Like, should the man that you saw last night, for instance, where I thought he did fairly well, should that man have the world’s most stressful job at the age of 85? And I got to say that when I put it in those terms, like the answer is just clear as day. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Yeah. No, you’re right. Chris Hayes: And when you ask people, there was an ABC/Washington Post poll. Do you think he’s too old to serve out a second term? Eighty five percent of people say yes. And I can’t tell those people like there are things that poll where I’m like, well, the majority is just wrong. There’s all sorts of things where I disagree with the majority people’s perception of the economy I’ve been banging on about. On that question, it’s like, I can’t, no, yes, correct, like I do not think not for anything, any character flaw, not for any reason other than the demands of the job and the reality of this mortal coil, that that man should be the president when he’s 85. Jamelle Bouie: I think that’s right. Yes. So, I myself go back and forth on are there more viable people to actually win an election than Joe Biden? I go back and forth on this, but that was my takeaway from the debate, just like irrespective of sort of like electoral considerations. I don’t think I would feel comfortable with like 84-year-old Joe Biden as president of the United States when there could be crises. And the thing about the job, right, is that it fundamentally is a crisis management job. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: That’s how we typically judge presidents. We’re not really judging one former president on the basis of its ability to handle a crisis. But generally speaking, we judge presidents based on their ability to handle crises because that’s what the job is, right? In John Dickerson’s great book, “The Hardest Job in the World,” about just the presidency, he shares Dwight Eisenhower’s kind of like matrix for decision making. And basically there’s like four boxes. One is like urgent and important, like a crisis. The other is important, but not urgent. The other is not important, not urgent. The other is urgent and not important. And most of the job of being president is kind of deciding what goes in what box. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: That’s the job. And I don’t know if I think an 84-year-old, any 84-year-old, not even Joe Biden, any 84-year-old -- Chris Hayes: Correct. Yes. Yeah. I just want to interject when you said like the other guy is going to be 82 or 83 in the fourth -- Jamelle Bouie: Exactly. Exactly. Chris Hayes: And obviously I don’t think that guy should be within a thousand feet of the White House from the time he was 30 on. But also just on the question of age, it’s 100 percent as relevant with the other choice, just to be clear on this. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. Chris Hayes: Like I thought he did a catastrophic job managing a crisis in 2020. The thought of, you know, China invading Taiwan with Donald Trump sitting in the White House at age 82 is like just absolutely horrifying to me. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. I don’t think any 84-year-old would be appropriate in that kind of job, both because of the physical demands and the mental demands, but also because I do think that the job requires a certain amount of nimbleness and flexibility. And at that age, those are also qualities that are like diminishing. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: Like it’s hard to intellectually budge yourself off of an approach you’ve decided on that’s like served you well for decades when a situation might demand it. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One of the things that I’ve been so pleasantly surprised by on the first three years, particularly of Joe Biden’s administration, was his flexibility, was his supplements, was the fact that he seemed open and reacting in real time. Like, I really think he did an amazing job in many ways, particularly on domestic legislative accomplishments and domestic economic management, where I think he was able to kind of reassess his priors and he was able to like, and that was to me one of the great sort of pleasant surprises of the Biden presidency so far. But I also agree with you that that ability diminishes. The other thing I keep thinking about is that people say, well, right, but there’s a vice president for a reason if something happens, and that’s true. But there’s also a huge gray area between the president dying and the president declining.  Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And the closest we’ve come, I think, to managing that was the end of Reagan, which, again, wasn’t great. Like once you read all the accounts of it afterwards. But given how difficult this is now and how anguishing, and again, people say, well, that can happen to anyone.  You can have a stroke at 65. Totally true. But there’s an actuarial logic here that I think we’re all up against.  And the last thing I’ll say is, I think ultimately there’s a connection between the substance and the politics, which is this. If I understand why people are like, I don’t think that guy should be president at 85, then I understand why it’s a little bit of an uphill battle to win over persuadable voters -- Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- when most of them think that because you can say, well, look, you still got the coalition, all this stuff, but you’re still pushing that rock up the hill. It doesn’t mean he can’t win, but like when I go through this a million times, I just sort of keep coming back to that home base, which is like, I don’t think the objections are unreasonable. I do think they’re unreasonable in the sense that the choice is stark and obviously I would personally prefer to have Donald Trump not be president than Joe Biden at any age, basically. But you’re talking about some set of people that don’t feel that way. Otherwise, they’d be decided. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. And really, I mean, there’s some recent polling from “The Washington Post,” and it showed Biden, you know, tied with Trump, 46, 46. And then it showed Harris like 49, 47 with Trump. And the thing I keep coming to is that maybe really it’s just as simple as people want someone younger on the ballot. That’s it. And if you put someone younger on the ballot, they’ll be like, I want to vote for that person because they seem younger. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: And if that is the situation we’re in, then like, I kind of think the case for just Biden stepping down is a pretty strong one. And to my mind, you know, it’s easy to imagine the thing Joe Biden could say, right? Sort of like -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- you know, my priority, the reason I got back into politics in a real way was just to keep Donald Trump away from power. And I did it four years. I’m not sure I can do it for another four years. I think my vice president can. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: I care about American democracy so much -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- that I’m going to set aside my personal ambition. I’m going to be a Cincinnatus and move on. Chris Hayes: Yeah, which brings us to the next part of this conversation, which I think is actually an important one, which is there’s a bunch of different ways that race is shot through this whole thing on a few different levels. So one of them is Kamala Harris is a black woman. I think polling suggests that people perceive her as further to the left than she is substantively. And I think that has to do with the way that race and gender are coded. That might be a political liability in terms of winning over people who, by definition, are not particularly, you know, ideologically orthodox. Also, you know, she’s a black woman. There’s going to be racism and sexism directed at her. There already has been. So that’s part of the conversation to me and what those sort of liabilities are. And there’s always something sort of like dicey and gross about the slide between some descriptive anticipation of a penalty a candidate will play for being a black woman and then being like, oh, we shouldn’t go with the black woman, which is always like a really dangerous part of this conversation. So that’s one part of it. The other part of it, which I want to do first before we get to Kamala Harris and those dynamics, is just the dynamics of race within the Democratic coalition now. And one of the things I think that has been fairly obvious is an attempt, given the fact that James Clyburn’s endorsement in 2020 in South Carolina and Joe Biden’s convincing win in South Carolina in a primary electorate dominated by black voters, was the kind of turning point in his 2020 campaign, a sort of attempt to shore up what is the kind of base of the Democratic Party, which is black voters. And you’ve seen this in a few things they’ve done. One, the two of the interviews he gave after the debate were to black radio stations. Subsequently, it was revealed that they had sent them questions in advance, which they had selected. When that got out, both hosts were fired by their stations and also subsequently got out that they had called back to get them to edit parts out of the interview, including at one point, I think Biden saying, I have more blacks in my administration than anyone else, which is like it’s just like, well, that’s of course the way he talks.   I mean, again, it’s like if you’re a staffer for Biden and you’re cringing like I don’t know what to tell you, man, like that is that’s the way an 81-year-old white guy talks like -- Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, yeah. Chris Hayes: I too find it like not great, not at all the language I would use, but also like that kind of is what it is at this point, can’t protect him from that. But I did find something. I’m curious what you think about this, because I’m speaking about this as a white guy watching this. I actually found something kind of offensive and condescending about that whole episode of like going to black radio and then like giving them the questions and like it gave me a really bad feeling. Of all the things that have happened in the debate, that’s the thing that I’ve been most like, I don’t like that at all. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, it’s just sort of like, oh, of course you’re going to give me an easy time.  Chris Hayes: Right. Exactly. Jamelle Bouie: It’s a version of taking those people -- Chris Hayes: For granted. Jamelle Bouie: -- for granted. Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- which I kind of think is an undercurrent of like so much fizz (ph) -- Chris Hayes: Yeah, I know. Jamelle Bouie: -- across the board. Chris Hayes: Say more. Jamelle Bouie: So it’s a clear undercurrent of like the Biden team’s immediate response. I’m going to go black radio and they’ll treat us well. And it’s like that’s kind of offensive to like the professional integrity of these people, of the radio host of these stations. But also in the conversations about, oh, if you could replace Biden, who would it be?   I mean, there have been some voices were like, yeah, Harris should be considered, but there have been quite a few that sort of kind of on their face no Harris, kind of dismissing Harris, immediately jumping to, you know, can we find the blandest seeming Midwestern whites to lead the ticket and everyone else will fall in line? And it’s like, will they, though? Like -- Chris Hayes: Yeah.  Jamelle Bouie: -- you know, because again, there’s this Democratic legitimacy question, as you know, like Biden became the nominee on the support of black voters. So it really seems like you want to listen to what they think to an extent before you begin, like, you know, wish casting who you think ought to be the nominee. And just the extent to which it seems on both ends, the assumption is, well, black voters will just like fall in line. It’s not great. And it’s the kind of assumption that may play into sort of, you know, among younger black voters, it’s like it’s a real discontent with the Democratic Party -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Showing up in polling. Jamelle Bouie: Right. It’s showing up in polling. It may not necessarily translate to support for Republicans, but it will translate to like certainly less solid support for Democrats and like just voters being up for grabs in the way that they weren’t before. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And this is one of those places, again, where like it’s so hard to predict because it would be so unprecedented. Like let’s say Joe Biden were to announce and he gave a Cincinnati speech and I think he would endorse Kamala Harris, you know, but then the actual bylaws of the DNC are that they’re not really transferable delegates as far as I understand them. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And so she would have to win, win those delegates over in which maybe there’s just sort of a rush of acclimation, but maybe there’s not. Maybe other people proclaim and then you have like a genuinely open convention. And I mean, again, this is all out past the frontier of what we’ve dealt with. And in terms of what the fallout from that would be, I think also hard to predict, though your point, I think, is important one. But to me, the point you made before about democratic legitimacy is actually pretty important. Like she is the Vice President of the United States. She was chosen by the guy that won the primary the last time. She has served. She was on the ticket this time that, again, did win a primary. You can say, well, it wasn’t a real primary, which, yeah, it wasn’t, but that is the process we have, you know. I mean, like -- Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And if this were January, we’re talking about an open primary, totally different situation. Chris Hayes: Oh, totally, yeah. I mean -- Jamelle Bouie: Of course, the vice president competes with everyone else. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: But in this weird situation -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- you got to you know, it’s not so straightforward. Chris Hayes: It’s not so straightforward, yeah. And again, I’ve come to think that the best of all worlds would be him giving that speech in 2023 and saying, I’ve looked hard at this and I just don’t, you know, we don’t know what the future holds. I feel great in the job right now, but I just can’t definitively say I’m going to be able to do it for more years. And there’s an open primary. There’s a contested primary, blah, blah, blah. That didn’t happen. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: We can’t linger on that. But yes, in that circumstance, the vice president competes along with everyone else. And this is just a very different circumstance. And again, this sort of question of there is a little bit of like, you know, underpants gnome reasoning dot, dot, dot, then X happens. The other thing I will say to go back to where we started is and I did this on the show the other night where we looked at the polling average on July 9th, whatever the date was, you know, going back. And there’s never been in the time I’m covering politics professionally, a Republican leading in the polling average in July 9th, which is stark, but also, as I said in that program, like John Kerry was up and Hillary Clinton were up and like everyone remembers President Hillary Clinton and President John Kerry, right? Jamelle Bouie: Right. Exactly. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Like things do change. And last night when Biden was asked at the press conference, he basically said, look, we haven’t even started the campaign and people don’t start paying attention till after Labor Day. And I do think that that’s sort of the best answer they have. I don’t think it’s particularly satisfying about how they overcome the deficit they’re in. But all of which to say one thing I’ve learned not to do is to too radically draw a line from the present to the future. Jamelle Bouie: Yes. Chris Hayes: Because there’s been a bunch of moments from the aftermath of “Access Hollywood” to Donald Trump getting COVID when it was like Donald Trump was down by 10 points when he had COVID and the Democrats have 60 seats in the Senate. Now, he did lose that race, but the polling during that moment was not at all reflective of what happened in the end. And I think it just is also important reminder that like polling under conditions of volatility and the necessary fact that things change mean that like just because something’s happening now doesn’t mean it’s going to be the same in four months. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah, I think that’s right. So, first of all, I find this election cycle incredibly strange. And, you know, one of my big takeaways from 2016 was just to sort of like relieve myself of like any certainty about like what could possibly happen. And that lesson should be applied to any election. It’s this, it’s this one, both because of the unusual circumstance of having, you know, an incumbent and a former incumbent on the ballot together, the unusual circumstance of Trump being Trump, Biden’s age. The extent to which like the media environment is like fractured in a way that it’s like it’s hard to know what actually breaks through to ordinary people. Like one example, last year, maybe earlier this year, I know I wrote about the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. I know I did. And when I wrote about it, I was like, oh, this is this thing that probably no one’s going to pay attention to, but it’s like it’s very significant. It’s like this plan for the next Republican executive branch. Pay attention to it. And I would have never anticipated whatsoever that I could go on TikTok and flip through 20 consecutive videos -- Chris Hayes: It’s wild. Jamelle Bouie: -- of just like total normal people talking about Project 2025. And I don’t know what explains that. Is it just that it sounds sinister? Maybe. I don’t know. I don’t know what explains what’s happening there. But it’s clear that something is happening that’s significant enough that sort of the Republican presumptive nominee has to basically give a statement saying, oh, I’ve never heard about it. Chris Hayes: Which is obviously a lie, just to be clear. Jamelle Bouie: Obviously a lie. But like it’s significant. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Oh, hugely significant. Jamelle Bouie: That he feels the need to lie about it. And so that to me is just an example of how we actually do not know what is significant to ordinary people. What is going to be salient to ordinary people? How voters are going to make their decisions. And at this moment, the polling does strongly suggest that voters are saying Biden’s too old and I guess we’re going to support Trump at least in swing states. But I honestly don’t know what to make of that beyond it being a snapshot of the moment. Chris Hayes: Yeah, I agree with you. I had you on the program the other night with Dave Roberts, one of the things that’s been driving me crazy about this debate is the certainty that people seem to have in both directions. I mean, it’s all very uncertain. I mean, and again, a huge part of life in high stakes situations is making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. So you got to do the best you can. But yes, I think it’s important to just constantly be taking that humble pill about what is and isn’t going to happen and what’s going to be relevant. I agree with you on Project ‘25. I was riding my bike to work. I was pulled over at the intersection in the Lower East Side. This couple saw me. This guy kind of recognized me. He’s like, are you on YouTube? And I was like, no. He’s like, where I know you from? I’m like, I actually have a news show. He’s like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Then he goes, I haven’t checked out politics for like four or five years. What’s been going on? I was like, oh, man. Well, at this red light, I can’t. And then he said, he said that pause. I was like, well, I got to get to work. And then he goes, what’s this Project 2025 I keep hearing about? And I was like, of all the things. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. Chris Hayes: I’ve been checked out of politics for five years. I was like, oh, my God. Talk about penetration. Jamelle Bouie: Right, right. And again, that’s just sort of Biden being old, clearly is like a thing that people talk about as well. Chris Hayes: It as a thing. It is a meme, yes. Jamelle Bouie: Right. But I just can’t figure out what the significance of it all is going to be like, I just don’t know. And you’re right that like the part of high stakes politics, this is making part of our job, right --  Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- is to try to, if not provide certainty, to grapple with uncertainty and try to make some sort of analysis, offer some kind of thing that people can better help understand their world. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: So just kind of grapple with it. Nonetheless, I think the overlapping unprecedented -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- that we’re experiencing just makes that task all the more difficult. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: Yeah. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One last thing I want to talk to you about Kamala Harris we didn’t quite touch on, you know, in addition to what would be the fallout for the Democratic Coalition, were she to be somehow sidelined in succeeding Joe Biden, were he to choose to not be the nominee slash how she would fare as a political candidate. There is one thing like you’re already seeing it and I’m going to have a commentary about this tonight, linking together Kamala Harris and this utterly despicable lawsuit against Northwestern University Law School, where, you know, this sort of anti-DEI crusade, I think, has been motivated from the beginning by a desire to purge black people from institutions of elite institutions and power in American life. Quite clearly, I think.  Now, I think some people who have been along for the ride on that don’t want that. They view it as a sort of meritocratic situation. There’s interesting polling on affirmative action across racial groups. There’s even a significant number of black and brown folks who don’t like affirmative action. So I don’t want to say that all the people that have this view or have the support feel that way. But the vanguard of the right wing that is pursuing it as their project, I think it’s clear that’s what they want. Jamelle Bouie: I mean, just on that Northwestern lawsuit -- Chris Hayes: It’s so disgusting. Jamelle Bouie: -- the clear implication of that lawsuit is just that, like, there is no such thing as a qualified black person that could hold the job. Chris Hayes: Correct. Jamelle Bouie: Like, it’s a fact, though. Chris Hayes: Here are the black faculty. And by definition, because they are black, they are not qualified is essentially the argument. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: Despite the fact that these are brilliant women and faculty. Anyway, what I do think Kamala as a presidential candidate would unleash a truly despicable avalanche of ugliness, which I don’t wish on anyone. But I also do think could backfire just when we’re thinking through the political implications of what it would mean, like the sort of embedded sexism and racism in, you know, American civic culture where that’s been the case for a long time. We’ve never had a woman president. We’ve had one black president. But I also do think, like, there is a real risk for that in how ugly they will get about Kamala Harris. Jamelle Bouie: I very much agree with this. One of the most formative political science books I read when I was in college was a book called “The Race Card” by scholar Tali Mendelberg. And it’s about the 1988 election and it’s about the Willie Horton -- Chris Hayes: Yup. Jamelle Bouie: -- ad campaign. It’s about all that. And one of the observations made is that to the extent that that was neutralized among the public, it was only when it was confronted directly. It’s only when you said, this is what they’re doing. This is why they’re doing what they’re doing. And that neutralized it for a public, which once they heard that countervailing message, was like, I don’t want to be associated with that, right. This is 1988, which is much less enlightened -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- along a lot of ways than we are today. And the other thing I have in my head, and this is just sort of just like counterfactual. But the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election was like fought on this like CRT, you know, parent’s rights ground. And the current governor, then candidate Glenn Youngkin, they leaned into the CRT stuff. And I always thought it would have been interesting to see in the Democratic primary, Tara McAuliffe, the former governor, is running. And then his nearest competitor was a Petersburg, Virginia based legislator, Jennifer Carroll Foy, who is African-American. And I always thought it would have been interesting, at least to see how a black woman -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- nominee would have handled the CRT stuff, because my intuition is that it actually would have been much less effective because it would have been too explicit. Right. Chris Hayes: That’s very interesting. Jamelle Bouie: It’s maybe an easier play to run -- Chris Hayes: Against a white against a white man, yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- against a white man. And in the same way, I do wonder if, you know, as you suggested, we’ve already kind of seen it like the “New York Post” ran was a guy, you know --  Chris Hayes: Charles Gasparino. Jamelle Bouie: -- like op-ed or something. Chris Hayes: Referred to as a DEI presidential candidate. Jamelle Bouie: A DEI president. I do wonder if that would be for Republicans, whether that would be the absolutely wrong tact to take with Harris, right. That actually gives her an opportunity to directly deflect it, to make the stakes of the election even more clear, right. To sort of like pull this out in the open and it would be effective. It’s how race and racism interacts in American elections is like much more complicated -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: -- than I think people recognize. Chris Hayes: Yes. Jamelle Bouie: And there’s often a tension among the voting public between whatever latent prejudices they have and their internal conception of who they imagine themselves to be and what issues are just salient in the world. Chris Hayes: Absolutely. Yup. Jamelle Bouie: And kind of the trick of the 2016 campaign, Trump’s 2016 campaign was kind of by virtue of his own celebrity persona, he’s kind of able to negotiate all those things. Like you could plausibly say if you were like one of these Obama to Trump voters, like, oh, it’s nothing about race for me, even if it’s clear that like the explicitness of the racial message did like influence your vote. But it’s a tough line to walk. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: And it becomes all the more tougher when the candidate themselves is of like the -- Chris Hayes: Is a raving racist. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Chris Hayes: I mean, like to every last cell in his body, I mean. Jamelle Bouie: And against a non-white candidate. I mean, I honestly do keep thinking of like other races in American history. I mean, there haven’t been a ton of like black candidates running like statewide or whatever. But like you’ll see that it’s tricky to deploy that stuff directly. Chris Hayes: Yes. Great point. Jamelle Bouie: Like even one of the most infamously prejudiced political ads in like recent memory and recent history, which is the hand ad -- Chris Hayes: Hands, hands ad. Jamelle Bouie: -- from the 1990 Jesse Helms, Harvey Gantt, North Carolina Senate race. Like it’s explicit -- Chris Hayes: But it’s actually weirdly deft, which is why it’s called the hands ad -- Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. Right. Chris Hayes: -- because they never actually say it. You see one shot of the guy who got the job and not you. And all you see is his hands. And it’s clearly a black man. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Right. And that race was still very close. Chris Hayes: It was close. Jamelle Bouie: That race was still very close. Chris Hayes: Very close in again, decades ago in the South.  Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: Like, yeah, exactly. That’s a great point. And I think, again, I don’t really wish that on anyone or on the civic culture. You know, I mean, but I do think like I know who Donald Trump is. I know the people around him and like he really is. He doesn’t believe in a lot of things.  But like racism, like genuine racism and sort of racial hierarchy, not liking democracy and thinking some form of authoritarian is like better. And like Donald Trump is the best are, I think, basically the three core ideological commitments he has and are genuinely held, like genuinely held. Like none of those are an act like the fact that he likes autocrats is not some performative thing. Like he really, truly thinks democracy sucks, I think that’s a better system. And he really, truly thinks that like there’s a hierarchy of races like he does not believe in human equality. Jamelle Bouie: And yeah, if Kamala Harris were the nominee, they would just lose their minds. I mean, I think it’d be very explicit and very ugly. But like you like you suggested, Chris, at the beginning of this, I’m not sure that that would be particularly electorally successful, both in terms of how they turn off people --  Chris Hayes: Yeah. Jamelle Bouie: -- who don’t imagine themselves that way. And one last point on this, people don’t imagine themselves this way. If you’re not plugged into it, it may be hard to see. But there’s like an entire like infrastructure designed to get evangelical white people to be able to vote for Donald Trump without jeopardizing their self-conception of themselves.  Chris Hayes: Yes. Yes. Jamelle Bouie: Like it’s a whole edifice that exists. Chris Hayes: Yes. It’s enormous. I mean, we’ve done a podcast on precisely that edifice by a guy who tries to chip away at it, but it’s yes. Jamelle Bouie: And so I don’t think one should underestimate the effect that explicitness may have on how people make that kind of calculation. Chris Hayes: This is, to me, one of the most undercover voting groups in American politics is just the partisan Republican, because we cover the MAGA base, right? Like the people that go to the rallies and people who wear Trump hat. And then we cover like the never Trumpers and the people. But like a huge chunk of the coalition are just partisan Republicans who vote for him because he’s a Republican nominee and like -- Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: And there was a poll yesterday, I think about something like 35% of Trump voters want him to drop out. It’s like they’re going to vote for him. I don’t think those 35 are necessarily swing voters, but there’s just a bunch of people that are just going to vote for the Republican in the ticket and Donald Trump’s Republican, and in some ways the question of which of those are pryable or gettable, I mean, I think not a ton of them are, some of them might be. But to your point about that edifice that’s been built, you know, we’re talking about such a narrow band of voters that are going to decide this election. Jamelle Bouie: Right. Chris Hayes: That who knows? I will also note, because we’re recording this on this Friday, like by the time this is in your podcast feed, like Lord knows what’s happened. It’s like a very quick moving story. But Jamelle Bouie is, I think, one of the sort of sharpest, wisest, levelheaded, most like rigorously historically informed political thinkers and writers that we have in America today. He’s like, really, for me, just one of those people that I just, I want to know what he has to say about things, about everything. And so, Jamelle, it’s great to have you in the program. Jamelle Bouie: Thank you so much for the kind words. It’s a real pleasure to be on the show.   Chris Hayes: Once again, great thanks to Jamelle Bouie.

Discussing SCOTUS doing its worst — Strict Scrutiny Crossover: podcast and transcript,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/why-is-this-happening/discussing-scotus-worst-strict-scrutiny-crossover-podcast-transcript-rcna163828,"Another year, another pretty wild Supreme Court term. SCOTUS recently ended its term with a number of big decisions including ruling that former president Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for his “official acts” in office. And it also overturned the Chevron doctrine, reversing a 40-year-old precedent that afforded federal agencies a degree of discretion in interpreting ambiguous laws. As always, there’s a lot to unpack and we’re excited to share our third crossover episode with the hosts of the ""Strict Scrutiny"" podcast, Chris’ wife Kate Shaw, and her co-hosts Melissa Murray and Leah Litman. They join to discuss some of the most alarming actions from the super conservative majority of the Court, attacks on government agencies and more. Note: This is a rough transcript — please excuse any typos. Leah Litman: The idea that these people are so satisfied and are so convinced by what they are doing, it’s grotesque because you think about, for example, you know, the court’s inability to imagine a post-Roe versus Wade future where you have justices confidently predicting that the federal courts will be out of abortion cases once they overrule Roe, that was nuts. And similarly, when the court overrules Chevron, they’re just like, yeah, here’s some random thoughts about what the post-Chevron world will look like, but gosh knows we haven’t decided to actually hammer them out because we’ve just drank the Kool-Aid. Kate Shaw: The court has just, it seems to me, given a permission structure for Trump to do everything in his wildest imagination he might want to do but might have been somewhat constrained by the prospect of legal accountability from doing. All of that is now gone. And so it seems to me, not only a wildly wrong, but just an unfathomably dangerous decision. Melissa Murray: If you think about the whole system of constitutional design, the point of the Constitution and the separation of powers is that you don’t want any one of these branches to consolidate power in a way that allows them to dwarf any of the others. And you have this court essentially creating a king and creating within itself kind of would-be kings. Chris Hayes: Hello and welcome to “Why Is This Happening?” with me, your host, Chris Hayes. Very quick intro today because things are dire and we got to get to the point, but we are reprising what is quickly becoming an annual tradition, which is when the Supreme Court finishes doing its worst in June and this year into July, we do a term review with the hosts of by far my favorite legal podcast, really my favorite podcast with three of my favorite people, one who is particularly my favorite. The podcast is called “Strict Scrutiny.” You can find it wherever you get your podcasts. It is hosted by three women law professors, Melissa Murray, who’s at NYU, Leah Litman, who’s at Michigan, and my wife, Kate Shaw, who is at Penn. So we have just seen a crazy term. It ended with the bomb being dropped at this immunity decision, but there’s a whole bunch of other bombs they’ve planted. Then also some landmines that maybe haven’t gone off yet, but probably will in the future. And I follow this, you know, relatively closely for a civilian, pretty closely by listening to “Strict Scrutiny” and talking to Kate, but I thought this is a great opportunity. There’s so much to kind of get through. So Melissa Murray, Leah Litman, Kate Shaw, it’s great to have you on the program. Kate Shaw: It’s great to be here. Leah Litman: Thank you for having us. Melissa Murray: Always great to be back on a conjugal pod. Chris Hayes: Another conjugal pod. Yes, Melissa dubbed this a conjugal pod last time because I think marital pod is the adjective that they’ll scan more to people and sounds slightly less PG-13 than conjugal pod. Kate Shaw: Less spicy. Chris Hayes: Yeah, a little less spicy. Okay. So there’s a lot to sift through and I thought I basically, I had kind of three buckets in my mind, three categories of sort of term themes, because obviously there’s a bunch of cases, those cases go in a bunch of different directions. I thought I would start with like, it’s not the good news at all, but maybe the least bleak, which is a dynamic that was pretty interesting having to do with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. And maybe I did something on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and I got a great e-mail from someone I dearly love who’s like an incredibly with it, extremely high information news consumer who’s not a lawyer, who was like, I literally don’t understand what the Fifth Circuit is. And then I felt bad because I was like, yeah, like people literally don’t understand like how federal courts work. So I wondered if first like, Leah, maybe you can just give a like, what are circuit courts and what is the Fifth Circuit and why is it special to use a euphemism? Leah Litman: Yeah. So the Courts of Appeals are the intermediate appellate courts. And what that means is in the federal system, you start out in the federal trial courts, which are called district courts, and then the parties go up on appeal to the courts of appeal. And if they don’t prevail there, then they can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. And so the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is the court of appeals that oversees some states that include Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. And that court, why is it special? Where to begin? It is staffed with some of the most unhinged, deranged, lawless judges on the face of the earth. And these people are literally so out there, they occasionally lose the votes of both Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Chris Hayes: Just to clarify on the sort of how the federal courts work, and Kate, maybe you could just back me up here, because I do think it’s important for people to understand, you know, you go into a district court, whether it’s a criminal trial and it’s a lawsuit, and as long as you can show that you should be in there, you can get in there. And then you have an appeal by right, like you can appeal up to the next court. So those next courts, those appellate courts, they hear a ton of cases. Things go to them. And then after them, the vast majority of what they do ends there. Like only a tiny little bit gets to the Supreme Court. So most of the stuff that’s happening at the appellate, right? Is that right, Kate? Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Most appellate stuff -- Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- that’s it. That’s where you go. Kate Shaw: Everybody who loses and wants to pursue their case further in the federal system can go up to the Court of Appeals. So there’s an enormous number of cases those courts decide. And that obviously dwarfs the very small number of cases that the U.S. Supreme Court decides, which, you know, at its high watermark was a couple of hundred cases a year. In recent terms, it’s been more like 70 or 80 or even down to 60 or less a year. So that’s an infinitesimally small number of cases compared to the vast, you know, number of cases that the federal appeals courts decide. Chris Hayes: So these courts, all the circuits in the Fifth Circuit in particular, the Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, they’re hearing a lot of cases. Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: And what they’re supposed to be doing, Melissa, is they’re supposed to be applying precedent, Supreme Court precedent. Like they’re not supposed to be making up the law. I mean, no one’s supposed to be making up the law, but basically, if anyone’s going to make up the law, the Supreme Court is like, we’re going to be the ones to make up the law. And the Fifth Circuit has just kind of been doing a lot of, I think, for lack of a better word, making up a lot of law and ending up with their cases and decisions before the Supreme Court. And there were there were a bunch this term, right? Melissa Murray: Yeah, I think that’s a really good point, Chris. So the Fifth Circuit is getting a lot of cases. I will note that there are a number of cases that start out in the Fifth Circuit in Texas in particular because of the practice of judge shopping. A lot of litigants have realized that if they go to certain courts in the Fifth Circuit, like Amarillo, for example, where there’s only one judge in one courthouse, you can pretty much be assured of a conservative outcome or a conservative friendly outcome. And so they file their cases there and then those cases go on to the Fifth Circuit. And the Fifth Circuit often endorses whatever wackadoodle theory that conservatives advance in the district court and then the other litigants appeal to the Fifth Circuit. I will also note one of the dynamics of the Fifth Circuit is not simply that they’re just kind of rubber stamping crazy conservative theories. And again, to be very clear on our podcast, we refer to the Fifth Circuit as the meth lab of conservative grievance -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Melissa Murray: -- where they literally cook this stuff up. There are a number of Fifth Circuit judges who I think understand themselves to be part of this milieu that is being looked at as potential Supreme Court nominees in the future. So, for example, if Donald Trump wins in November 2024, I think it’s pretty likely that Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who are in their 70s, will step down and they will be replaced by more extreme movement conservatives. And there are a bunch of guys on the Fifth Circuit who are like, pick me, choose me, love me. And they’re basically auditioning. So one of the dynamics isn’t just that the Fifth Circuit is crazy and cooking up all of this conservative meth. They’re also auditioning. And part of the audition is being as outlandish and outrageous as possible. So it’s not only just a majority decision that’s nuts. There will also be separate concurrences that would go even further to, you know, again, garner the attention of the powers that be. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And I think that’s such an important point and partly why I wanted to start with this because in some ways, even though it’s a weird thing to say in the current context where things feel pretty dark in a lot of ways, just to remember things can get worse. Kate Shaw: It could be worse. The Supreme Court could have, yeah. Chris Hayes: It’s actually genuinely important because the only difference, and Kate, tell me if this is an overstatement, but like the only difference between the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit is personnel. Like, there’s no reason, there’s nothing binding other than who you have that you couldn’t have a Supreme Court as nutty, as proximate to the meth as the Fifth Circuit if you were to get, you know, Donald Trump, say, for an office and he got a bunch of people on the court. Kate Shaw: And you had a Republican-controlled Senate. I mean, I think that absolutely Melissa’s right that you would have two relatively quick retirements. I mean, Thomas, at least, is really enjoying this. So I don’t know that he’s going to want to go. Leah Litman: Not as much as he enjoys parking his RV and going to Walmart. He likes that. Kate Shaw: The question, though, is all of the kind of largesse you’re talking about, the RV, which is, of course, you know, heavily subsidized, as were many aspects of Thomas’ lifestyle, as we have recently come to know. But would all of that dissipate if he stepped down from the court? Leah Litman: I don’t think so, right? Kate Shaw: No. Leah Litman: Because it’s a way of locking in -- Chris Hayes: Oh, yeah. Leah Litman: -- more deregulatory corporate power in the court. And replacing Clarence Thomas with some 30-year-old person who’s just going to continue voting his same way. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kate Shaw: He’d continue to get gratuities after leaving the court. Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: Here’s a retirement gift, sir, for this year and every year after. Kate Shaw: Which one of the court’s cases this term, the Snyder case that invalidated a corruption prosecution precisely on the theory that gratuities, right, like gifts given as a thank you, as opposed to bribes given in advance, are not a violation of a really important anti-corruption statute. Chris Hayes: Yes. It’s like when you’re done with your term as mayor of Portage, Indiana, you have that little iPad, you flip it around to the contractors that you steered municipal contracts to, and then they write in the tip for that. And then they flip it back around, and that’s fine. Kate Shaw: All completely fine. Chris Hayes: Now, if up front you had been like, bro, I’ll steer some contracts to you if you give me $13,000, that’s not good. But if you give -- Melissa Murray: Well, it’s not good right now. Give me more time. Chris Hayes: Who knows? Yes, exactly. Melissa Murray: That might be fine as well. Chris Hayes: All right. Wait, but I want to talk about Snyder, but I want to steer back to Fifth Circuit because — Melissa Murray: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- so I think we’ve set up this framework that’s important just in terms of what the Fifth Circuit is, why it’s kind of at the avant-garde. It’s an avant-garde court of sort of right-wing grievance and right-wing jurisprudence. And one of the remarkable things is a lot of cases, because they were cooking up these sorts of cockamamie theories, SCOTUS took them, partly because it was like, whoa. And in a lot of places, we’re like, nah, dude, this is nuts. Sorry. Like, there’s four or five maybe times they got reversed. Kate Shaw: It’s more than that. So to take off the most important one. So you had the Mifepristone case, FDA versus Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine. The court unanimously reversed the Fifth Circuit, which had allowed this crazy, unhinged case to proceed against the FDA, arguing that some of these restrictions on Mifepristone should be reimposed and that the FDA had been wrong to loosen restrictions. They got reversed. The Fifth Circuit got reversed 8-1 in the Rahimi case, the case in which the lower court had said that someone under a domestic violence order of protection had a Second Amendment right to have a gun, regardless of a federal statute that says no, they don’t. The Fifth Circuit got reversed 7-2 in a case involving the funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Reverse 6-3 in a case involving federal agencies and officials communicating with social media companies. An then there was a malicious prosecution case and the NetChoice case involving also the First Amendment and social media and a takings case. So it’s actually a kind of shockingly long list for a term -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- in which the court decided less than 60 cases. Chris Hayes: I’m not going to ask. I mean, someone keeps the numbers like the version of, you know, the sports statisticians. Kate Shaw: It’s like a 90. It’s north of it. It’s almost a 90 percent reversal rate on the cases the court took from the Fifth this term. Chris Hayes: And to be clear, to go back to your point, Melissa, which I think is actually really interesting. I love the line in the beginning. You say it’s about the Supreme Court and the legal culture that surrounds it. And the legal culture that surrounds it what I find so fascinating is in the old legal culture, it would be shameful for those judges on the Fifth Circuit, their clerks, everyone involved to be sending these up and getting reversed, like getting reversed is kind of a badge of dishonor. You screwed up in some way. I think the sort of status of this used to be like, whoa, yikes, like I got reversed as a judge. And I wonder if you think that still holds. It is pretty remarkable. And some of the opinions were quite scathing about the Fifth Circuit in terms of the way that they do their analysis, the way that like what they’re doing. Like, it wasn’t just getting reversed. It’s like you guys are sort of out of control was the message being sent to some of the text of the opinions. Melissa Murray: No, that’s definitely true. So there were a couple of opinions where, you know, for example, the court called out Jim Ho, who is one of the worst offenders on the America’s next top appellate Judge/SCOTUS prospect market. He’s kind of doing -- Chris Hayes: Trump-appointee. Melissa Murray: -- Yes. Trump-appointee, was sworn in at the home of Harlan Crow. Super weird. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: I know. But the court publicly rebuked him in an opinion. So, you know, that’s important. It’s also important, I think, to understand that when the court tacks back from what the Fifth Circuit is doing, they get the benefit of looking moderate, even though -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- the Fifth Circuit is so extreme that when the court pulls back from that extremity, they’re still pretty much on the right. It just looks way better -- Chris Hayes: Right. Melissa Murray: -- than whatever craziness the Fifth Circuit originally offered. So, you know, in a way, the Fifth Circuit is kind of a PR arm for the court. Like, you know, they look insane so this court looks kind of normal, but it’s not normal, and it is moving to the right. It’s just the Fifth Circuit really pulls the average and mass a lot of what the court is doing in terms of ideological drift. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Let’s just talk. There are two cases that in particular I think are worth just diving into. Obviously, Kate, you just ran through them. But one of them, because they go in two different directions about this. My read on this, my little amateur reading, so you tell me if I’m wrong. I think if you look at the Mifepristone case and Rahimi, let’s start with Rahimi. And the thing I think is Rahimi, and it’s a joke that Melissa told, I think, in the live show in D.C., which has stuck with me because it’s 8-1 and Thomas writes a dissent. And Melissa’s joke was like, it was like you were showing up for the all you can eat shrimp at Red Lobster and all your all your friends are like on Ozempic. And you’re like, wait, I thought we were doing this. That Thomas basically writes this decision in Bruin, which is another gun case having to do with New York gun laws, basically being like, look, if a gun restriction isn’t there at the founding, essentially is the test, it’s no good. This case comes before the court in the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court where a domestic violence, someone with a restraining order gets a gun. He has unlawful possession of them because he has this order. It’s in violation. And the Fifth Circuit, Leah, what does the Fifth Circuit say? What do they do with this case? Leah Litman: They take it literally and they say, you asked us to find an analog for any modern-day gun restriction. And there actually isn’t an analog for laws that disarm people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. And the Fifth Circuit apply that test. And then the Supreme Court says, actually, no, that can’t be what we meant in Bruin. You know, if there’s any decision that kind of confirms that originalism is just about like what gives the Republican justices heebie-jeebies, right? It is Rahimi because the Fifth Circuit -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: -- I think, faithfully applied Rahimi. And then you have 8-1, the Supreme Court saying, actually, you misunderstood what we said. Chris Hayes: The reason that I brought Rahimi first and the reason that I invoked Melissa’s funny joke is that to me, this isn’t a case. What’s interesting about Rahimi is them taking the court literally and then the court having to be like, well, this can’t be right. I mean, literally, like the analysis that we had, like, yeah, domestic violence didn’t exist as a category at the country’s founding. So we can’t possibly be applying this test. And then all these very funny, Kate, ways, different opinions in that case of the court trying to basically run away from and a little bit gaslight their own previous, you know, jurisprudential logic to find some way to be like, yes, it is okay to take a gun away from a guy who is a menace and menacing, you know, the woman that he had child with. Kate Shaw: Yeah, I mean, all these different opinions are just like such obvious illustrations of the courts, you know, both inconsistent approach to originalism and deflection of responsibility because, right, each of these opinions says like, no, no, like it’s not our fault or the Bruin opinion’s fault that the Fifth Circuit decided to strike down — Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- this domestic violence law. It’s an unfaithful or improper interpretation or understanding of the level of generality at which a judge is supposed to conduct the inquiry about whether there is a founding era analog. But if we’re talking generally speaking about the disarmament of dangerous people. Yeah, we have laws like that. And so that supplies the requisite historical analog. So they’re both trying to reaffirm Bruin. They’re not really distancing themselves from Bruin, but they’re also redefining in a way that is fundamentally bad faith. I think it is right. The Fifth Circuit did literally apply what the court said about how to justify contemporary gun laws. And this was just an example, I think, of a spectacularly unappealing criminal defendant, right? So Rahimi was not only under domestic violence restraining order, but had discharged his weapon repeatedly at the mother of his child, went on a shooting spree where he shot at five other individuals in the course of, you know, a couple of days. Then his -- Melissa Murray: At a Whataburger. Kate Shaw: Right. There was a Whataburger involved. Then his house was searched. Melissa Murray: Do not defile the Whataburger. Kate Shaw: And the guns were found. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kate Shaw: And so I think the court, just as a PR matter, could not imagine -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- countenancing logic that let this person retain possession of their guns under the court’s cases. Chris Hayes: And the reason that I think it’s interesting to contrast that with the Mifepristone case is because in Rahimi, it seems like they’re kind of applying the conservative court’s own logic and the court’s like, wait, no. In the Mifepristone case, like the standing analysis that is cooked up at the district court for this one judge that Melissa mentioned, Matthew Kaczmarek, who’s this like movement right-wing lawyer. He’s the only judge in Amarillo. You go and file in Amarillo. You know you have him. Then it goes to Fifth Circuit where you know you’re going to get a sympathetic here. They kick it unanimously, I think, on standing, right. And I wonder maybe like, Leah, this would be real one on one for your audience, but not necessarily for mine. So like what standing is as a legal concept. And then maybe what the standing analysis of the plaintiffs were here that the court found so absurd. Leah Litman: Yeah. So standing is the rule that in order to bring a case in federal court, in order to sue, you have to show you were injured or you have some likelihood of injury in the future. And here the plaintiffs were a group of anti-abortion doctors who did not prescribe or use mifepristone. Instead, they maintained that other people’s prescription of mifepristone somehow harmed them, even though they had never been called upon to treat complications from mifepristone in part because mifepristone is so safe. The district court and the courts of appeal, you know, in order to conclude there was standing, relied on retracted scientific studies and some anonymous blog posts and concluded actually there was a sufficient risk of injury from mifepristone, right. Like it’s laughable. But I do kind of want to push back on the idea that it was just the laughability of the standing analysis that led the court to conclude we just can’t go for this because this Supreme Court has adopted some pretty laughable -- Chris Hayes: Totally. Leah Litman: -- standing analysis, like in the Student Debt Relief case. Chris Hayes: Student debt, yeah. Yup. Leah Litman: Right. And I think they specifically made moves so as to prevent having to reach the merits of this case. So, for example, they did not grant the doctors, you know, cross petition. Chris Hayes: Sorry, what’s a cross petition? Leah Litman: So the request to hear the case on behalf of the doctors because the court of appeals had ruled against the doctor’s request to revoke mifepristone entirely -- Chris Hayes: Okay. Leah Litman: -- had only granted their request to reimpose some additional regulations. But the Supreme Court also denied the request to intervene, that is to participate in the case by some states. Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: And so, therefore, the court didn’t have to confront whether those states potentially had standing. And so they put off a decision on medication abortion until after the election. Chris Hayes: Right. So you read this as they took the off ramp that was convenient so as not to come up with a really like wildly unpopular ruling in an election year. Leah Litman: Yeah, in part, right. And the laughability of the standing analysis certainly helped them. But, you know, having seen this court adopt laughable theories before -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: -- I’m just not sure that that was sufficient. Chris Hayes: I guess this gets us to an interesting question, which is we’re always in this era and we’re going to talk about the admin law cases and we’re going to talk about immunity. But we’re always in this era, I find, or I am at least, like bumping up against this question of like what the law actually is and whether the law is like a set of activities that a group of people acculturated through a set of institutions that credential themselves as making lawyers. That’s what the law is. Or if the law actually has some kind of internal logic and that certain legal arguments are so bad that they just fail on the merits. And we kind of go back and forth between these two. And I think in some ways this term is sort of testing both of those, right. So I guess my question to you is, is everything a sort of calculation of the sort of political consequences or sort of the agenda? Are there still arguments that are just so bad, Melissa, that they can’t persuade that they fail under their own weight as arguments? Or is everything essentially, from a descriptive standpoint, a kind of just a sociological question of how a group works and who you can get to do what? Melissa Murray: I mean, that’s a really good question, sort of like the legal realism behind the current court. Certainly, I think there are elements of the court, maybe even a predominant element of the court, that are motivated by outcomes, maybe ideological outcomes, if you want to put that final point on it. And I think you can definitely see that. I think they’re also very attentive to the world outside of One First Street and sort of thinking about how their decisions may play out on a broader scale in the public. I think that was certainly the case in the two abortion decisions that the court heard this year. The Mifepristone case, as you note, they never decided on the merits. They kicked it out on standing grounds. And that temporarily preserved abortion access in the United States. But of course, there are states that are already planning to file lawsuits challenging the FDA’s regulation of mifepristone. So that case will be back -- Chris Hayes: Back up, yeah. Melissa Murray: -- before the court, probably after the election. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: The EMTALA case is another great example. You know, that case was pending for five months on the court’s docket when they decided like, oh, wait a minute, maybe we shouldn’t have taken this case. That’s weird that it took five months for them to figure that out. It’s not weird if you think about them recognizing that abortion has the potential to galvanize electoral majorities and send women to the polls in massive numbers -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- in this very tightly contested election. And so, you know, that may help explain what happened in EMTALA. And it preserves abortion access in Idaho for now, although I will note there’s also a challenge involving EMTALA going on in the Fifth Circuit. And the Fifth Circuit has allowed Texas’s very draconian six-week ban to go into effect and to prohibit the provision of emergency abortions in that state. And that’s still going on because the court never decided -- Chris Hayes: Right. Melissa Murray: -- whether EMTALA conflicts with the state law. And if so, if EMTALA should preempt that state law. So that substantive question is still out there. And Texas has a lot more women of reproductive age than does Idaho. So it’s a major punt by the court - Chris Hayes: It’s a great point. Melissa Murray: -- and one with real consequences. Chris Hayes: Can I just say when you put it like that, it just seems so cynical. It seems -- Kate Shaw: Yeah. Leah Litman: Yes. Chris Hayes: Like shocking, appallingly cynical. Kate Shaw: We just recorded our term preview and we were just like, if honestly read together, it really looks like, all they have done in these two cases is decide to minimize the chances that abortion is going to be a really salient issue in the November election. And then they will do atrocious things in both of these cases when they come back, you know, a year to two years from now. I think there’s a very real chance that that’s where we are. Leah Litman: Wait, I sound super cynical. I think I probably am super cynical, but I think it’s hard not to be. Like, there are these glimmers, these moments where the court seems principled, where, you know, perhaps they do the right thing, as it were. But then there are these moments where they do the wrong thing in such a colossally wrong way that it’s hard not to think that they’re completely motivated by outcome. And I think a real difference is you have to look at how different this court has been since it became a six to three conservative supermajority. That happened in 2020 after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And in every term since they’ve had a conservative supermajority, six justices, they’ve overruled a past precedent. And it can’t be the case that every one of these earlier courts was so dumb that they didn’t get it. Like it’s because -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- this court doesn’t believe in those decisions. So you overrule Roe, you overrule the affirmative action decisions, you overrule Chevron, you overrule by implication United States versus Nixon. And through your delay, you give Donald Trump de facto immunity on the January 6th case. And you set him up with your decision to be a dictator king if he wins the presidency in November 2024. And so if it seems like they’re in the bag for Trump, they’ve made it look like that. Chris Hayes: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I want to get to you. I definitely want to talk about Trump and the immunity case. But since you mentioned Chevron, it seemed to me, aside from sort of both the Fifth Circuit getting smacked down, but also maybe looking into the ghost of Christmas future when we look at the Fifth Circuit is like seem to be one theme. The other big theme seemed to be on administrative law, which is something that we just talk about in cable news constantly. It’s a huge, sexy topic for us. It’s basically my A block every night. Kate, since you teach admin law -- Leah Litman: Checks out. Chris Hayes: -- since you teach admin law -- Melissa Murray: I want to go there. Chris Hayes: Well, I think you’ve done an amazing job about writing about this for popular audiences multiple times in “The New York Times” where you’re a contributing columnist. Maybe let’s just start with the Loper Bright case, which, as Melissa just mentioned, overruled a case called Chevron and just set up like what Chevron said, what Loper Bright says and why it’s a big deal. Kate Shaw: Sure. And you’re right. I think administrative law is not appearing on cable news in A blocks. It sounds dry and technical. And I think that people can assume that it’s sort of abstract and so are its stakes. But like we are kind of trying to communicate that it’s not abstract. The stakes are super high. People should care tremendously about these cases in this body of law. So basically, Chevron is this 40-year-old case, 1984, that just sets forth kind of distilled to its essence, a very simple rule, which is that there’s lots of laws passed by Congress and they say things that are sometimes kind of broad and general, like employees should get overtime or agencies should take steps to provide that emissions level remain as low as feasible and things like that. So like what employee means, what feasible means like those aren’t self-defining terms, but agencies that administer statutes have to spend time thinking about what the words in those statutes mean. And what Chevron says is if there’s a law passed by Congress and an agency administers that law, the agency gets to decide what the words in the law mean, if they’re ambiguous at all. And so long as the agency decision about what the words mean is reasonable, courts are supposed to defer to agencies. So that’s the basic rule. Courts defer to reasonable agency interpretations of statutes. And for 40 years, that has been the governing standard against which agencies have operated and regulated industries have operated and courts have operated. And the Supreme Court last week overruled Chevron and says agencies don’t get to be in the driver’s seat when it comes to interpreting statutes. We do. Federal courts and ultimately the Supreme Court gets to decide what statutes passed by Congress mean. And the tools that courts use to interpret statutes are not like deep expertise and understanding of the industry and the science. The tools courts use are, you know, dictionaries, Latin rules about how to interpret language, the amicus briefs filed by, you know, ideological fellow travelers and vibes. Those are the things courts use to construe statutes. And that’s what this decision says is now going to determine the meaning of every law passed by Congress. Chris Hayes: So I want to follow up on a few things. One, the practical implications of this. It’s like, okay, courts are going to decide rather than agencies, but how does that cash out, like why does it matter and why was there such interest in this as a project of both the conservative legal movement and also a bunch of very wealthy interests and corporate interests to get to this point? Kate Shaw: You know, they have just for decades been hostile to the general project of agency power. I mean, I don’t want to give too complex an answer, but I will say two things. One, really, you know, since the Reagan administration, like, you know, there have been administrative agencies and government writ-large has been in the crosshairs. And that is actually in some tension with this kind of empowerment of the president that I do want to talk about -- Chris Hayes: Yeah, I want to talk about that. Yeah. Kate Shaw: -- in a little bit. You know, there’s definite tension there. But I think basically the attack on agencies is really not about agencies, quite agencies, but the attack on agencies as independent vessels that possess expertise and decide based on, you know, rigorous reasoned based decision-making processes. So actually, I think the conservatives who have had agencies in the crosshairs for decades don’t so much want to, you know, disempower agencies writ-large. They want to bring agencies under the control of an unchecked president if they can control that president, obviously not under the control of Joe Biden, but that maybe is getting ahead. But as a general matter, I think it’s an anti-government and anti-expertise orientation that underlies this attack on the administrative state and Chevron has come to stand in for the entirety of the administrative state. And so this is an enormous symbolic victory, but it is also a huge practical victory. And agencies will get to do less because these -- Chris Hayes: They’ll get sued more, right? Kate Shaw: -- in regulatory courts. They’ll get sued more in courts. These conservative justices and many conservative lower court judges are going to read statutes -- Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- always in ways that empower the agencies as little as possible -- Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- to intervene in business, right. Like that’s the long and short of it. Chris Hayes: Okay. Right. Let me ask one and any of you can answer this? I don’t know. Just a devil’s advocate defense of Loper Bright or at least Chevron skepticism. I’ve read commentary by people that work in like civil liberties with like intelligence agencies. And basically, they’re like the people inside the intelligence agencies are menaces. They interpret statutes to maximize their power, to maximize their surveillance power, because that’s what they like. And trying to get courts to review that because of Chevron has been very difficult. Similarly, immigration lawyers I’ve seen said we can’t get our clients to get their cases heard by courts because of Chevron deference, which says whatever the whim of the administrative interpretation of this is, that’s what goes and our clients are screwed by it. And if we can get into court, that will help us. So these are just two examples where people that I think have interesting or righteous politics are more aligned with, you know, my worldview other than like, you know, the oil companies, for example, have arguments about why maybe this is good or why in their at least narrow practice in the agencies they deal with, maybe this will help. I’m just curious to hear your reactions to that. Kate Shaw: Yeah, I’m happy to say two things, but you guys should feel free to jump in as well. I mean, I think that it’s really important to make clear that no one defending Chevron is suggesting that agencies always get it right or agencies always operate in good faith or anything like that. It’s just that in a world with really two regimes on offer -- Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: -- one where agencies make these determinations and one where unelected judges make these determinations, agencies are the better option. Chris Hayes: Right. Kate Shaw: They are, you know, staffed with experts and democratically accountable to a degree that federal courts are not. Not totally. They’re not elected, but they are far more democratically accountable than our judges and agencies, if they’re overreaching as immigration agencies and intelligence agencies so frequently are do have checks that can be brought to bear upon them. You know, congressional checks, internal checks in ways that the federal courts just don’t. Chris Hayes: Interesting. Kate Shaw: So, I think those critiques have merit, but it’s a universe in which you really have two options. And I don’t see how those advocates can prefer the outcomes that their clients are likely to get in front of this Supreme Court. Chris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: One of the things that’s really striking to me, which is related to this, and Leah, I think this is something you all you guys talk about on the podcast a lot. It’s just like almost at a tonal level, the complete lack of humility that is exuded by these individuals in their opinions. Like Robert says, this really snarky line in Loper Bright, where he says like agencies don’t have the expertise interpretation. Courts do. And it’s like and everything is this kind of like smarmy condescension. Leah Litman: If you think that’s smarmy condescension, you should read a Gorsuch opinion. Chris Hayes: That’s true. Yes. My line about Gorsuch is that I went in the oral arguments, the immunity case, and I don’t listen to oral arguments very often that I had actually never heard a man make love to his own voice before I heard Neil Gorsuch. But it’s really quite a thing. Leah Litman: He cites himself. Chris Hayes: It’s really quite a thing to listen to. It’s really like just comes through the microphone. But, you know, this complete, this sort of imperiousness, the smugness, the sort of like self-satisfied. And to your point, Melissa, before about like they’re overturning all these people, but they’re just generally just like leaking out of these opinions. There is just this sense of like, you know, you ever meet someone who’s like always like I’m surrounded by idiots and it’s a gnarly personality and also not someone I ever trust. They’re like that. It’s like, well, look at these idiots over here. Look at those idiots over there. Like there’s no sense in these opinions, Leah, of like humility, circumspection. We’re carrying the part of like a long tradition and we’re fallible human beings trying to get it right. And part of what binds us is like I’m thinking of John Paul Stevens, who is very much loved those values and the way that he talked about judging, but they’re totally absent in so many of the parts of the opinions that I’ve read. Leah Litman: They’re absent, despite the fact that these justices make mistakes all the freaking time. I mean, Justice Gorsuch’s opinion -- Chris Hayes: In a space. Leah Litman: -- in another administrative law case, Ohio versus EPA, which concluded that the EPA is good neighbor rule was not adequately justified because, he, Neil Gorsuch, just wasn’t convinced by their explanations about ozone, misdescribed nitrogen oxides, the gases that cause pollution and smog as nitrous oxide, laughing gas. Chris Hayes: Wait, wait, I want to stop there. Multiple times, five times in the opinion. Leah Litman: Yeah, five times. Chris Hayes: And I just want to be clear about this. I would not get out of bed for a week if I did this. I cannot imagine showing your face. It would be like there are certain errors people make with a typo, and then there’s other errors that show they don’t understand anything. And it would be like it’s such an obvious error, but it would be like calling the Supreme Court a district court. Like if you did that, you don’t deal with the law at all. You don’t know anything. Leah Litman: Chris, Justice Sotomayor made a mistake citing like something in one of the abortion cases, like some statistic. And conservatives literally flew on her and just attacked her. If any of the female justices or any of the Democratic appointees had made the mistake that Neil Gorsuch made, they would be run off of the court, like people would be talking about how stupid they were. And instead, we’re just like there is Neil Neiling. Neil’s going to Neil. Neil’s going to mistake laughing gas for smog. And who among us hasn’t done that? They get away with a lot. Chris Hayes: The Gorsuch one, I knew I did a piece on the show, but Kavanaugh also made a mistake. Leah Litman: Well, so this was back during COVID, during one of the court’s COVID voting cases. Justice Kavanaugh made the inaccurate statement that Vermont had not changed its election practices because of COVID. And the Vermont secretary of state literally corrected him on Twitter and was like, could you please correct this in the opinion? And he did. And like those are like pointed ones, right -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- that like we can like laugh about and are very easy to describe. But the reality is the court makes all sorts of questionable moves, like in the Ohio versus EPA case where Justice Gorsuch basically misdescribed what people said during the agency process and misdescribed how the federal government had responded. And the idea that these people are so satisfied and are so convinced by what they are doing, it’s grotesque. Because you think about, for example, you know, the court’s inability to imagine a post Roe versus Wade future where you have justices confidently predicting that the federal courts will be out of abortion cases once they overrule Roe. That was nuts. And similarly, when the court overrule Chevron, they’re just like, yeah, here’s some random thoughts about what the post Chevron world will look like. But gosh knows we haven’t decided to actually hammer them out because we’ve just drank the Kool-Aid. Chris Hayes: I mean, you’ve got a situation where Alito writes in the EMTALA case, which was the emergency care as mandated by federal law in states like Idaho that have intense abortion restrictions. He dissents from them kicking it, basically punching on it to say like, yeah, we should take it and also, here’s Sam Alito. I’m like, I didn’t go to med school, I don’t know. But here’s where me and like my 25-year-old clerks who’ve like been, you know, pounding Red Bull to get this opinion out after some googling. I mean, I say this like with sort of like knowledge and love and respect. But like, again, those are the people who are doing this. And here’s what this clerk, you know, thinks about, like how much blood you can lose and it still be okay is what is the world that we’re living in. Leah Litman: Well, but it’s even worse than that, because that opinion is like I recognize that doctors, hospitals, experts and patients are telling me that abortions are required for some of these medical conditions like premature eruption of membranes. But I, Sam Alito, have concluded actually they’re not and -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: -- no evidence, right, to support that. Melissa Murray: Leah’s makes a great point about just the disdain for expertise and evidence. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: And in a way, I think this term in a lot of different ways showed the modification of the court, not just the Trump immunity cases, but in these cases involving the administrative state, just the disdain for expertise. I mean, this is a more genteel strain of Marjorie Taylor Greene refusing to call Dr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci, and saying that he has to be brought up on crimes against humanity. Like there’s a real disdain and — Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- distaste for anything that reeks of elitism when they are the most elite group of individuals in the country. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: But Justice Thomas likes regular people, Melissa. Melissa Murray: He does. He does like those Walmart parking lots. Leah Litman: And his RV. Chris Hayes: It is a quarter million-dollar RV that was basically gifted to him, which is the most amazing detail in the world. And also the documentary about how he likes regular people because he rides in an RV was also paid for by a rich guy, which is also an amazing detail. Okay, so you just mentioned, we’ve mentioned a few times, I’m talking to you the day after the court immunity decision in, I guess it’s Trump v. United States, right. And it was a 6-3 holding. Leah Litman: That’s King Trump to you, Chris. Yeah. Chris Hayes: Well, okay. So, this is something that I have more thoughts about than the other cases just because it’s more in the wheelhouse, but let me just start with one. I have a lot of thoughts. But one thought I had and I’d love for you to talk about this. Again, I’m a civilian here. I’m obviously legally adjacent. But one of the things that’s like galling is to compare what happened with the 14th Amendment cases in which it literally says in the Constitution, no one’s like debating this, that you can disqualify people from office for insurrection. It’s written right there in the 14th Amendment. And that doesn’t mean that that’s the end of the story because the courts we interpret and that’s what courts do fine. But the textual basis for it is like pretty damn clear. The court very quickly takes that case on an expedited schedule. It comes down with a, you know, split ruling, but on the holding unanimous, basically saying like, yeah, it says that, and yes, Colorado found that. But no, this doesn’t work. Then so when you compare the textual foundation to disqualification of the 14th Amendment to the textual foundation, the Constitution for absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, it just is ludicrous. It’s nowhere in the text of the Constitution. I went back and actually read Article II today to be like, what’s in here? Like what is given? And it’s like, yeah, sure. These are smart enough people that you can construct something about constitutional power and checks and balances and some analog to like immunity from civil suit, et cetera. Other forms of immunity that like officials enjoy, which it does exist and has developed in constitutional tradition and at common law, yada, yada, yada, yada. But in the end, like there’s no textual foundation. There is no textual foundation for this thing that they freaking made up yesterday at 10:30 a.m. And the way the court treated this argument with zero textual foundation to the way they treated the 14th Amendment argument with like very clear textual foundation and actual, as Ketanji Brown-Jackson, I think rightfully said, like real historical context, it’s just obviously we all know they’re not actually doing originalism. We all know that this isn’t a cover story. But man, if there was ever something for me that brought that home, it was that. Leah Litman: Yeah. I mean, if your question is why aren’t they principled in their conservatism, I could not tell you why. I think you’ve seen this in a lot of different places, like think about the Fischer case, which was the criminal law case about the January 6th rank and file — Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- defendants and whether or not that statute could be appropriately applied in the context of an insurrection on the Capitol. And this group of conservatives, all of whom are avowed textualist, meaning that they prioritize above all the plain meaning of the words in the statute, looked at the statute, which says that it is a crime to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding. What they really meant when they made the statute Congress -- Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: -- the purpose behind the statute was to prevent stuff like Enron. And, you know, that kind of context plus text analysis is usually what you hear from the Democratic appointees who are always trying to sort of think about things in a broader context. Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: And they get pilloried for it. Like that’s activism. Yet, in the context of this criminal law case, the court was all over the context, very little attention to the text. And, you know, managed to really undermine a number of cases brought against those rank-and-file defendants. Chris Hayes: This seems to me, Kate, this case yesterday, this was as bad to me as everything. Anything other than January 6th was the case — Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: -- as I read the opinion. And the only thing I compared to is Bush v. Gore in terms of like the sheer kind of power play that it is. But Bush v. Gore at least acknowledged in its own way, cynically, very famously, there’s a good for one ride only where the court, after coming up with this completely fakakta analysis of equal protection and why you have to stop the count so that George W. Bush should be president, says, now, don’t get carried away. This analysis doesn’t last after this decision. And at one level, I sort of would have been happier if they’d been like, look, we’re just trying to spring our boy here. This is not carried out afterward. Like if they had given the Bush v. Gore treatment, I think I would have felt better, you know. So, basically, how bad is it? Is it as bad as everyone’s saying? Kate Shaw: I honestly think it is worse. The more you read it, the worse it looks. So, obviously it’s a textual. As you said, Bush v. Gore at least has the equal protection clause to hang its hat on. There is nothing in the Constitution that so much as hints at the suggestion that an ex-president should be absolutely immune for anything, let alone maybe everything that’s plausibly official, which is what this opinion holds. So you have no tax to support this wild conclusion. Everything in our history points precisely in the opposite direction. Back to text, actually, not only do you have no tax, you have this very strong evidence on the other side, which is that legislators have explicit immunity granted by the Constitution. So members of Congress do get immunity. That’s what’s called the speech or debate clause. There is no analog that the president enjoys. So text, not at all on your side. History points entirely in the opposite direction. But at least in the 14th Amendment Anderson case about disqualification, you had a pragmatic argument that even though text and history actually seemed to support what Colorado had done in disqualifying Trump, there was at least a pragmatic argument that it would be too destabilizing to let individual states do what Colorado had done. So that’s what was driving the justices. Here, it seems so obvious that also every argument from pragmatism -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- and stability and democracy requires the denial of this kind of immunity. So you have that overlay, which makes this a significantly harder decision to swallow, I think, than the 14th Amendment decision. And you just have this coming at the worst possible time historically, right, where you have Trump running for election on a campaign, an avowedly anti-democratic campaign, promising to lock up his rivals. The court has just, it seems to me, given a permission structure for Trump to do everything in his wildest imagination he might want to do, but might have been somewhat constrained by the prospect of legal accountability from doing. All of that is now gone. It seems to me, not only a wildly wrong, but just an unfathomably dangerous decision. Chris Hayes: We’ll be right back after we take this quick break. (ADVERTISEMENT) Chris Hayes: There’s one part of the analysis that I find also like so offensive. Well, there’s a lot of it. But this idea of you can’t investigate motive, which I think has been a key part of the sort of Trump era. And I remember someone I once had on the show had just made this great example once. He says, look, if a new mayor comes into town and his big thing is he changes garbage collection to be on Saturdays. Like, obviously, you could do that. If he does it because he wants to chase the Jews out of the town because he knows the Orthodox won’t be able to put their garbage out and then he can ticket them, that’s obviously not okay. It’s the same action, but obviously, the motive matters tremendously. It could transform a thing from perfectly fine to not okay. And that obvious, simple analysis that we apply in the law everywhere, all the time, to come in and say, in this case, for this only this person and for this narrow class of people, which is maybe three or four living individuals at any given moment, we just completely throw that out. And anything that’s constitutionally allowable there, you can’t question motive, which is part of the Roberts opinion. Like, it’s a really insane thing to say. Leah Litman: It’s totally nuts and it both dates back to kind of one of the earlier iterations of Trump’s power grabs and unlawful activity. And then I think it’s one of the most concerning aspects of the immunity opinion. So back in the early days of the Trump administration, when he fired off the Muslim ban that sent travelers into chaos and just upended -- Chris Hayes: Yup. Leah Litman: -- a lot of things, his administration defended it on the theory that you actually couldn’t consider why Trump had enacted this. And instead, the only thing that mattered is that presidents have extensive authority, right, to decide who enters the country. And the Supreme Court didn’t exactly adopt that, basically did and said, if there’s any reasonable way of understanding this Muslim ban as not being rooted in Trump’s very apparent and egregious anti-Muslim animus, then we will understand it. Now, I don’t think there was -- Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: -- a way of understanding it, divorced from that. But that is a way of minimizing the relevance of why he enacted that. And then you get this immunity decision that says you can’t probe an official act that is why a president do something. You can’t introduce evidence about the president’s and his advisors’ deliberations about why they did something. And that is effectively eliminating the ability to prove a crime. Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: Because for all crimes, you need to prove motive, right? Chris Hayes: Yes. Leah Litman: The mens rea, why they did something? Did they do it corruptly? Did they do it to advance personal gain? Did they do it right out of vindictiveness for retribution? If you can’t prove that, you are eliminating a prosecutor’s ability to prove a crime. So even if you can introduce some evidence, you’re effectively tying their hands on proving motive. Chris Hayes: There’s a difference between I swerved my car into that person because the truck was going to get me and I swerved my car to that person because I owe him $50,000 and I wanted him dead. Leah Litman: Right. Chris Hayes: Like, that’s the most obvious thing in the universe. We all understand this, even if we’re not lawyers, like we totally get it and to remove it here. There is something, Melissa, this is a question that, well, any you can answer. I’ll go to you first, Melissa. So, I saw a lot of people making this point and people were reaching for it in different ways. People reacting very strongly, obviously, to this opinion, I think rightfully so. Just like the weirdness of the court’s conception of the executive, which is like they love the president but hate the agencies. It’s like you can order SEAL Team Six to assassinate your political rival. You can, in a very funny and darkly funny example, in a footnote from Ketanji-Brown Jackson’s dissent, poison the attorney general to replace him. But you can’t like regulate smog. And just trying to sort of think through, like how the sort of admin law and agency jurisprudence fits with their view of executive power, or maybe that’s the wrong question even asked. But I did see a lot of people yesterday trying to kind of make sense of that as a whole. Melissa Murray: No, it’s a really good question. And again, I think the inconsistency of the conservative position is worth highlighting. You know, weirdly, they are arguing that the president, as the executive, cannot, through administrative agencies, do things like regulate smog. But the president, acting through the DOJ, which is merely an appendage of his office, can fire an attorney general who’s doing something that he doesn’t want done. Chris Hayes: Right. Melissa Murray: I mean, and it’s not prosecutable. It’s completely immunized. And so, you know, it is an imperial court and I think part of the appetite for limiting agency action is also about irrigating power to the judiciary. And that’s very clear in the cases overruling Chevron. You know, in the absence of a congressional mandate to do something, it’s not the agency that gets to decide. It’s the courts. And that’s a huge grant of power to the judiciary. And so you have this imperial judiciary also enabling and facilitating an imperial presidency. Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: And if you think about the whole system of constitutional design, the point of the Constitution and the separation of powers is that you don’t want any one of these branches to consolidate power in a way that allows them to dwarf any of the others. And you have this court essentially creating a king and creating within itself kind of would-be kings. And what gets left out? Congress, ostensibly the most direct representatives of the people. Chris Hayes: Right. I mean, I saw a bunch of people make this point, which is true, is that like if you have any familiarity with the constitutional, like the convention, the debates about it, like it’s so obviously an odious view to the founders and to the constitutional tradition. Again, not telling anyone anything they haven’t heard before. Okay, so here’s where I want to kind of try to land this conversation and this is really important. And I tried to make this point on air last night amidst the pit of despair. And I’m going to make a version of it on my show tonight. But you guys are better equipped to make it. For me, it feels important to not, in advance, concede things that they are going to try to do. And what I mean by that is what I tried to say last night is if the President of the United States goes to the Department of Justice and says, I want Chris Hayes prosecuted and they open a prosecution of me, let’s hope that doesn’t happen, they’re violating core constitutional rights I have. Like I have rights under the Fifth and 14th Amendment that mean they can’t do that. And it’s and it’s not legal. And I saw a lot of people conflating. And again, I understand why they made this conflation. And I’m not trying to take away how horrible the decision is. But I do think it’s important to say that, like, it’s not like God is dead and all is permitted and because of the 6-3, you can do anything and you can order your death squads. Because to me, that feels like giving up the game ahead of time. We still have a constitutional order and that constitutional order is greater than the sum of its parts. It is embedded in a civic culture, in the constitutional decisions made by lawyers, made by the members of SEAL Team 6, who, like, honestly, I have an opinion of that I don’t think they would do that, honestly. And then weirdly, this is one of the arguments that Trump’s lawyers made before or argument. But my point is, when you look to 2020 to get back to this legal realism, the reason the coup didn’t work was that basically enough people who were lawyers and legally credentialed in some ways were like, this is nuts. I won’t do it. And I just don’t want to give up the fact that, like, that still exists and those norms should still be there. And these six people cannot tell us what the Constitution means and that we can have a king and a tyrant because we can’t. And they’re wrong and we’re right about the Constitution. And in some ways, all of us participate in the constitutional culture as much as they do. Kate? Kate Shaw: Yeah, I think that’s exactly right. And if one of the things this decision does is to kind of knock the Supreme Court off its pedestal -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Kate Shaw: -- for a lot of people as the sole and final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution, that is, I don’t want to call it a silver lining, but that at least is something to seize onto because they can err. They erred terribly in this case, but they are not the only parties who participate in the forging of constitutional meaning and I think it’s right. Executive branch lawyers, members of Congress, lower court judges, civil society, like, you know, the individual subordinates inside the bureaucracy who might be getting orders of the kind that might issue from Trump, they all have an obligation to the Constitution to not an obligation to the Supreme Court. Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: And that is a hugely important distinction -- Chris Hayes: Yes. Kate Shaw: -- to underscore. And I think it is possible to hold both of those two ideas that it is wildly dangerous for the court to have given permission to a malevolent actor to do the worst possible imaginable things. But I totally agree with the instinct that as bad as this decision is, there are ways to fight back. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And to me, it’s like it’s desperate. It’s like desperate defense of the worst outcomes. But I don’t want to go on TV and I don’t want to go on this podcast. I don’t want anywhere where anyone who’s like a lawyer, the DOD is hearing that like, well, assassination is now legal. It’s like, first of all, that’s not actually the holding of the court. Kate Shaw: Yeah. Chris Hayes: Importantly, like it isn’t. It isn’t actually the holding the court. But that aside, it’s also not lawful. It’s also not right. And it’s a violation of your oath. And I just feel like everyone needs to understand that, that the court can’t change that because a lot of people I think we’re heading towards a period where like a lot of people are really going to have to come up the way they did in those very dark weeks in 2020 and 2021, you know, in all sorts of places. And I have a lot of faith in the American people and I’ve been very inspired. Like when I watched Rusty Bowers, even people those politics I actually really don’t like. Anyway, Leah, so I’d love for you, Leah and Melissa, to sort of give your thoughts on that. Leah Litman: I mean, one, I think there’s an important historical antecedent and pedigree for the idea that people who are in the executive branch in particular and hold other offices are not bound by the Supreme Court’s worst interpretations of the Constitution and law. You know, dating back to Dred Scott, you know, when the Supreme Court declared that black people could not and would not be citizens. Abraham Lincoln famously said, like the Supreme Court can resolve the rights of the party to that case, but they can’t force me, right -- Chris Hayes: Right. Leah Litman: -- and my executive departments to refuse to treat black people as citizens. He issued passports to black people. And so there is a tradition of, I think, executive officers in particular holding true to the Constitution and their oath to uphold the Constitution even when the Supreme Court is purporting to allow them, right, to do truly morally and legally outrageous things. And second is, I think there are political and civic checks, right. So part of that should come as a response to the Supreme Court’s decision. Sure. Right. Maybe the Supreme Court says the president can’t be prosecuted for an assassination, but gosh, right, like there should not be assassinations and that idea is horrible. Right. We should reaffirm that idea. And we should also understand that this is partially what is at stake in the upcoming election, right, which is partially a referendum about do you want to elect someone as president who has basically promised to use that office to seek political retribution, exceed the bounds of the office, be a dictator? Or do you want to reaffirm the idea that maybe you want someone who believes that laws and morals should be a constraint on what officers should do? Melissa Murray: I think right now it seems really bleak because it is really bleak and, you know, I don’t want to, you know, blow sunshine toward anyone and then sort of minimize the fact that it’s really bad. I think one of the things that we can do going forward is to sort of center not just the court, but all courts and the way we think about our electoral priorities and recognize that this isn’t inevitable. It took a long time for it to get this way. Chris Hayes: Totally. Melissa Murray: It may take some time to reverse, but it’s completely possible. It’s completely probable. And, you know, I know that everyone is tired of getting told about voting, but it really is incredibly important, especially if you center the court as part of your electoral priorities. You know, Justice Thomas and Justice Alito will probably step down under a Republican president. That is what they want. And that means that this conservative supermajority will last for another generation and a half because they will surely be replaced by younger -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Melissa Murray: -- even more extreme movement conservatives. Just maintaining what we have now and not becoming more extreme is a priority. And that doesn’t feel like a huge win. It’s hard to get people excited about stasis. But honestly, until we can make some movement, that stasis is much preferable to the alternative, which is to push this extremity even further. Chris Hayes: Yeah. And two things I’d say that just to sort of close here is one is I saw people reacting angrily to, you know, in the wake of the decision being like, Democrats are going to tell us to vote again. And it’s like, look, 55,000 votes across three states go differently in 2016, and we have a 6-3 liberal court. That’s the fact. Like everything we’ve seen was the votes were not there in those three states in that election that created the conditions here. The second thing is in terms of your point, Melissa, about stasis is like no one knows what the future brings and no one knows what the actuarial role of the dice will be for anyone of any age at any time. And so we don’t know. We don’t know. All we know is who will be empowered to shape the courts. And it’s like right now, it’s like the guy that shaped the Fifth Circuit and made the 6-3 court or the other party that has shaped the three justices in the in the minority in yesterday’s decision and throughout the federal courts as well. Leah Litman: Well, can I say something about that? I mean, I do think there is a role for activism to play here, too. And yes, there is one side that has a particular vision of the courts, and they’ve prosecuted it really ably over the course of Trump’s four years in office. Biden has been perhaps less focused on the courts. I think he is at his core an institutionalist. He’s not someone for whom the reform the court, pack the court -- Chris Hayes: Yeah. Leah Litman: -- arguments has resonated really well. But I will say this. I wouldn’t have imagined that Biden would have been the guy to forgive student loans, and he did. Chris Hayes: Right. Totally. Chris Hayes: He did massive student loan relief, much of it overturned by the court. But even after that, he worked to find other solutions that offered student loan relief to a lot of people and it was incredibly successful. And that’s real money in real people’s pockets. I don’t think he would have gotten there if young people hadn’t been like, I am riding with Biden, but only if this happens. And so I think if you do care about court reform and you do think that it ought to be a priority for the Democratic Party, I think that this is the time to say so. Like, you know, my support is really conditional on you getting serious about this and doing something about it. And I do think it can be resonant because we did not start off the 2020 election with any of the candidates really talking about their plan for student loan reform and look how far we’ve come in just four years. Chris Hayes: Melissa Murray is a law professor at NYU. Leah Litman is at Michigan. Kate Shaw is at University of Pennsylvania. They co-host the fantastic, wildly popular “Strict Scrutiny” podcast, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts. It’s a really amazing way, if you’re into this stuff, to learn about the court. It’s incredibly funny and entertaining as well, and Kate, I love you. Great show, guys. Kate Shaw: Thanks, babe. Doni can decide whether to keep that. Melissa Murray: It’s a conjugal pod, people. Yeah, it is a conjugal vibe, for real. Chris Hayes: I’m just telling my wife I love her. I think that’s fine. Melissa Murray: I mean, but for me and Leah, it’s just like, sorry we’re here. Leah Litman: We’re still here, guys. Melissa Murray: Get a room. Chris Hayes: Once again, my great thanks to the glamorous ladies of “Strict Scrutiny,” including my brilliant wife. That was so fun. It’s so fun we do it. That podcast is really phenomenal. I definitely highly recommend it. I find it so useful just for my own understanding of the court, and you should check it out too. It’s available wherever you get your podcasts.

Team Trump pushes back against FBI’s Wray on assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 10:07 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-ronny-jackson-pushes-back-fbi-chris-wray-assassination-shooting-rcna163840,"FBI Director Chris Wray probably didn’t intend to spark a controversy during his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee this week, but the Trump-appointed official managed to make some unintended news anyway. The trouble began when Wray testified that there’s some uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Donald Trump’s injury from the recent assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,” the FBI director told lawmakers. That might’ve reflected Wray’s genuine beliefs at this stage in the investigation, but the comments were not well received. Congressional Republicans spent much of yesterday expressing outrage about the testimony. Last night, the former president — who’d already called for Wray’s “immediate” resignation — published a furious, 144-word condemnation of the man he chose to lead the bureau. This morning, Team Trump went a little further, issuing another written statement from Rep. Ronny Jackson, addressed to “concerned citizens of the United States.” The right-wing Texas Republican, after reminding everyone that he’s Trump’s former White House physician, wrote: Jackson went on criticize Wray, saying that Congress should “correct the record” in the wake of his sworn testimony. Referencing the recent attempt on Trump’s life, the letter added, “There is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet.” The congressman’s statement has been promoted via social media by both the former president and his campaign team. For the record, I find it very easy to believe that Trump’s ear was, in fact, hit by a bullet. What’s more, I’m not altogether sure whether it matters: A gunman tried to kill an American presidential candidate. Whether the projectile that hit the Republican was a bullet or some kind of shrapnel, his life was clearly in great danger, and the incident deserves to be carefully scrutinized with the utmost seriousness. I also think it’s fair to say Team Trump hasn’t handled questions about what happened particularly well. As we’ve discussed, for the first several days after the shooting, the former president and his political operation had surprisingly little to say about the medical care he’d received. What’s more, it wasn’t at all clear why they were being so tight-lipped about this. An Associated Press report noted last week that the public was “still in the dark over the extent of his injuries, what treatment the Republican presidential nominee received in the hospital, and whether there may be any long-term effects on his health. Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family.” Eventually, Team Trump issued a statement from Jackson — a scandal-plagued former White House physician with serious credibility problems — instead of from one of the physicians who actually treated the former president after the incident. Now, they’re promoting another statement from Jackson, as part of an apparent effort to push back against Trump's handpicked FBI director. Again, something hit Trump’s ear. Based on everything we now know, I’m very much inclined to believe that it was a bullet. But what’s baffling is why the Republican and his operation are so resistant to transparency. Jackson’s latest statement said he’s reviewed the relevant medical records from Butler Memorial Hospital. Terrific. Why not show those same records to the public and put an end to the speculation? What’s more, why not make doctors who treated Trump available to journalists, instead of relying on a controversial member of Congress? This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Why LeBron James and Coco Gauff are the perfect Team USA flag bearers,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 26, 2024, 10:03 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/lebron-james-coco-gauff-are-perfect-team-usa-flag-bearers-rcna163245,"LeBron James is about to make history yet again. The 39-year-old NBA superstar, about to compete in his fourth Olympics, will be one of two flag bearers for the U.S. Olympic team in Paris on Friday. (Coco Gauff, the 20-year-old reigning U.S. Open champion, will be the woman athlete carrying the flag.) Surprisingly, James will be the first men’s basketball player to carry the flag for the U.S. As he is arguably the greatest player to ever lace them up, he is a fitting first. “It’s an incredible honor to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together,” James said in a Team USA statement. “For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself, but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my teammates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations. Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I’m proud to be a part of this important moment.” Floating in a boat on the Seine in Paris while waving the American flag is indeed a long way from Akron, Ohio. James was voted to carry the flag by the other Olympians on Team USA. This is a vital detail, because the flag bearers are not usually the competitors with the most fame but the most game: the people whose athletic performances inspire documentarians for decades. But James, while certainly having the game, is a different kind of figure. He’s not so much an athlete as he is a brand, an institution, a corporation and a political lightning rod. It’s that last point that makes members of Team USA choosing him to represent them particularly significant. In 2012, James helped organize his then-Miami Heat team to speak out against the killing of Trayvon Martin by the self-appointed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. He has spoken out forcefully against police brutality and racism. He was perhaps the most famous voice to say “Black lives matter.” The choice of James is particularly fascinating when one considers the amount of time the GOP, Fox News and Donald Trump have spent vilifying him. In their minds, James refusing to uncritically “back the blue,” calling out anti-Black racism and defending the right of athletes to express their dissent by kneeling during the national anthem was proof that he didn’t love his country. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham infamously suggested that he “shut up and dribble.” We saw the same criticism lobbed at Colin Kaepernik, who was then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers. When he initiated the national anthem protests that inspired other athletes including James, Trump said he needed to “find another country.” James’ ventures into politics haven’t always gone smoothly. The NBA’s lucrative relationship with China is a topic James has fumbled, as his own financial entanglements have kept him from speaking out against the injustices of the Chinese government. But James has rarely, if ever, looked afraid to put himself out there. This has been in sharp contrast to the player against whom LeBron will always be measured: Michael Jordan. When Jordan was playing, he eschewed involvement in political matters. It must be mentioned that Gauff, who like James was also chosen by Team USA, has also been politically brave. She gave an extemporaneous speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in her hometown of Delray Beach, Florida, when she was just 16. And in a May interview with The Associated Press where she talked about preparing to vote for the first time, she sharply criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ leadership. She called it “a crazy time to be a Floridian, especially a Black one at that.” She said, “We aren’t happy with the current state of our government in Florida, especially everything with the books and just the way our office operates.” By selecting James and Gauff, this generation of young athletes — some of whom weren’t born when James began his illustrious career in 2003 — are rejecting the template set forth by the right wing that dissent, protest or even tolerance is inherently against the best interests of the country. Choosing James and Gauff is a rebuke to the forces of division. It’s a reclamation of the idea that marching forward is preferable to looking — and acting — backward. And it’s a rebuke of the idea that criticizing what’s happening in your country doesn’t mean you don’t love it."
Enthusiasm is Everything,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 9:47 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-podcast/how-to-win/win-2024-enthusiasm-everything-rcna163846,"In a record-breaking week, Kamala Harris has united the Democratic party behind her, with significant momentum and grassroots support.  Former Senator Claire McCaskill and former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri liken it to the energy felt in the Obama campaign, especially as online support grows organically among younger voters. They also take a beat to reflect on President Biden’s heartfelt address to the nation Wednesday night, and the legacy he leaves after decades of public service. Then, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz stops by, to chat veepstakes, explain the Democratic Convention rules, and highlight some important governors’ races to watch in November. And lastly, Claire and Jen dispel the myth of the vice president as a ‘DEI’ candidate with a reality check: JD Vance is the candidate who’s been handed everything he has.   Further reading: As promised, here is Governor Tim Walz’ winning hotdish recipe from the Minnesota Congressional Delegation’s Hotdish Off: Turkey Trot Tater Tot Hotdish. Note: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos. Jennifer Palmieri: Hello, welcome to “How to Win 2024.” It’s Thursday, July 25th. I’m Jennifer Palmieri, and I’m here with my co-pilot, Claire McCaskill. Hi, Claire. Claire McCaskill: Hey, can you hear my voice? I’m another year older. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Everyone, it was Claire’s birthday yesterday. Claire McCaskill: So old. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s very exciting. Claire McCaskill: So old. I spent the day in the swimming pool with my three-year-old delicious granddaughter. Jennifer Palmieri: Betty Ann (ph). I met her in our prep call yesterday. Claire McCaskill: Oh, Betty Ann (ph) is a deal. I asked her if she wanted to go swimming with me, and she said, well, Cece (ph), of course. Like, you know, like she was 25, you know? Jennifer Palmieri: So cute. Claire McCaskill: So -- Jennifer Palmieri: And like, here’s an important development you might not be aware of. Claire knows this, I’m missing my parents, and I made a peach pie last night. Homemade crust, by the way, I always was terrible at it. Salt, fat, acid, heat. That is the best. You’re nodding. That recipe, even somebody like me who is not good at crust, you mix a phenomenal crust. Claire McCaskill: Yes. Well, it’s the season for peaches. I thought your pie was beautiful. And in honor of you, Jen, I’m going to make a peach crumble for dinner tonight, so. Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Love it. Claire McCaskill: There we go. Jennifer Palmieri: So since we spoke on Monday, Democratic coalitions continue to unite behind Vice President Harris’ bid for the White House, making her so far the unchallenged de facto nominee. We’re about 100 days out from the election, people, and the pressure valve has been released to her immense benefit. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, it’s not official until it’s official. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: But there is so much energy. I mean, we talked about this, and it was in an environment that was difficult and painful and hard. I know I irritated a lot of loyal Democrats by how I spoke about this election in those painful weeks between the time of the debate and the time that President Biden did, in fact, pass the torch. But this enthusiasm that’s been released is so powerful and it’s so fun. And we’ll dig into the latest about that energy. And then Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is going to stop by to give us the lay of the land on a few things, excitement in the party right now, sorting out the Democratic convention rules and the most important governor’s races to watch in November. Jennifer Palmieri: And before we wrap today’s episode, a quick reality check on this DEI attack that is coming on Vice President Harris. And this is something that I’ve done a lot of research on because I’ve, you know, written a couple of books about women leaders and people are trying to help the vice president and how they respond. There are some things people should know about the most effective ways to do that, that lift up the vice president and don’t diminish her because that’s what they’re trying to do. Also, Claire has a lot to say about J.D. Vance. And if there’s a candidate who fell out of a coconut tree and had their path paid for them, it is him. But wow, let’s take in where we find ourselves on a Thursday. Claire McCaskill: Yeah, 102 days is our best friend. I love a sprint. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s so good. This is so good. Okay, so Steve Kornacki reminded us that it’s only about 65 days until voting starts in some states because a lot of states have early voting, right? So that’s going to start in September. The excitement is it’s like 2008, but somehow more powerful because it’s condensed, right. Is that how it feels? How does that feel to you? Claire McCaskill: Yeah, I agree. I think it’s a wonderful stew of relief tinged with sadness, but relief. And then there’s also, wait a minute, this is going to be so cool. This is so historic. We’re going to be able to fix what happened in 2016. And finally, we will look to the top leader in the world and it will be a woman. And how delicious is that that these guys are wanting to take us back to a time? I mean, J.D. Vance is one of these like, oh, it would be really important for men to be the sole breadwinner and women to stay home and all this stuff that is, my mother would say if she were still with us, I thought we handled that. Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: You know, I thought we took care of that. So she’s taken the center stage with a really powerful message, too. It’s not just the organic we won’t go back chant that happened. Jennifer Palmieri: But let’s pause on that for a second, because it’s really important. You know, a few days ago I got asked from people on the outside, like, what kind of signage do you think the Harris campaign should be using? And I was like, I don’t know. I think something will probably organically pop that. And sure enough, she has a message about how, you know, we’re not going back. And a crowd picked it up, started chanting it organically. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Kamala Harris: We are not going back. Not going back. Audience: We’re not going back! We are not going back! We’re not going back! (END AUDIO TAPE) Jennifer Palmieri: As happened with President Obama’s campaign with “Fired Up and Ready to Go.” Claire McCaskill: Yep. Jennifer Palmieri: Started by one old lady. Claire McCaskill: Right. Jennifer Palmieri: In South Carolina. He was having a low day and she was like, fired up, ready to go. And that’s the same kind of energy we’re hitting here. But sorry, go on. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. So I thought her pitch perfect trolling at her very first rally as a presidential candidate. Let’s listen to how on point she was. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Kamala Harris: Before I was elected United States senator, I was elected Attorney General of the state of California, and I was a courtroom prosecutor before then. And in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type. (END AUDIO TAPE) Claire McCaskill: Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And then we’ve got this other cool thing is now we have a really old man who can’t put two sentences together on the other side. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s so true. I mean, it’s so true. Not that he’s ever made sense as a presidential candidate, but there’s definitely a change where he can actually string a couple sentences together. And there is something that I want to say specifically about the condensed timeframe that, again, a little historical perspective about women leaders that might not be obvious. So as people may know, America’s never had a woman leader. One of the reasons why people think that has not happened here is because we do not have a parliamentary system. Most countries that have had female leaders, they have a parliamentary system. And that’s different because we make our candidates go through a very long, drawn out primary process. In Hillary Clinton’s case, for example, we announced in April of 2015, obviously the election was more than, you know, almost 18 months later. In a parliamentary process, a woman leader is selected to head the party by a relatively small number of folks in the party. And then they’re presented to the country as the winner. Here’s the winner of our nominating process. And then you have a relatively short sprint. In the U.K. It’s only six weeks to an election, right. And so the problem for women leaders is, you know, in like in 2020, it takes a long time for women candidates in a big field to break through. We recognize the sort of potential of a male candidate sooner. Think of Buttigieg, Beto, Bernie, Biden in 2020. Right. That was sort of the story of 2020. Six great women running. They really never broke through. Nobody won a primary. Or you win the primary, but you come at it with a ton of having survived a lot of attacks. And that makes for difficulty in the general election. That’s sort of the Clinton experience in 2016. And so this is kind of an ideal scenario for electing a woman. Kamala Harris is being presented to us, not as someone who’s gone through a battered primary, but as the winner and a lot of excitement and relief about it. And, you know, Claire, it’s funny because some of the best, we’re going to talk about the memes, and, you know, if I were in the room, how you would continue to exploit them. Some of the best memes that are helping the vice president have been pointed out to us by the RNC, right? The Republicans. And it reminds me of Trump, right. In that, you know, in 2015 and ‘16, when other Republicans or Democrats would attack something about Trump, his supporters would be like, yeah, whatever. We like that because they just really had his back and he touched something deep within them that they wanted to support. And now that’s happening with her. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. And if I were in the room, I would not overthink anything that’s going on right now because -- Jennifer Palmieri: Right. Claire McCaskill: -- I think there is a tendency of people who run campaigns. I’m not talking about you, Jen, but having been around a few that thinks that they know better than what may be going on organically. And this is an instance where the organic movement here is really paving the way for them. There’s a couple of key elements, as I want to talk to Governor Walz about freedom, the future and joy. I mean, I love it that the Republicans have made a deal about her laughing. I hope they do it all day long. I love it. I love it. And every woman in America knows that that’s stuff like that, that have been used against them unfairly. You know, we used to say husbands, hair and hemlines. Those were the three H’s that we had to deal with as women candidates. So laugh away and have joy and smile and laughter because the other side’s dark. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And the Bernie Bros are getting in the act here. Charli XCX, I think it’s a really good sign that something happened on this campaign almost immediately that I had no idea what it was. Who knew about Brat Summer? Jennifer Palmieri: Oh yeah, Brat Summer. Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And my kids told me not to even talk about it. So I’m not because they said, it’s just embarrassing for you, mother. Do not go there. So I’ll leave it to the kids. But the point is that young people have enveloped this campaign online. Women are very excited. I think voters of color have a reason to be enthusiastic now. It really is a win, win, win, win, win. Jennifer Palmieri: And the other thing that is that, you know, it’s the positive stuff on the Harris side and then J.D. Vance in particular, really turning women off with this, like talking about childless cat ladies. That pissed off Jennifer Aniston. And so she weighed in to talk about how, you know, talking about IVF and how, you know, she hoped that his daughter would never have trouble having children because, you know, it’s something that millions of families, women struggle with. And I was like, all right, Rachel has entered the chat, you all. You have pissed her off. She is now engaged. She’s not someone who really engages a lot in politics. But that’s the kind of level of enthusiasm. But if I were in the room, I would make sure that you are not just saying, okay, this is great and engaging and letting a thousand flowers bloom. But you’re engaging these people right now to be like, okay, great. We have your attention. What are you going to do? Start asking people to do things, get them bought in, get them bought in on a schedule. Like, okay , week one, we’re doing this to register voters. Here’s what you need to know about registering voters in your state. This is happening on the convention. Here’s how you can participate in the convention. I know that the convention team is figuring out ways they can expand participation virtually to make it the biggest convention ever in terms of actual participation. And then, you know, what are you asking people to do when early voting starts, right? These are early days and I’m sure there’ll be days that are really tough for the Harris campaign, this doesn’t really feel like a sugar high. This feels like momentum and deep, real engagement. But harness all of that now and, you know, make sure that those people stay with you. Claire McCaskill: And grassroots fundraising. You know, the vice president talked about this. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Kamala Harris: And we just had some breaking news. We just had the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. (END AUDIO TAPE) Claire McCaskill: It is amazing that 60 percent of the donors in the first 24 hours had never given before. And keep in mind, when we talk about online donations, we’re talking about typically the online donation average is around $27. So we’re talking about a whole lot of people. And black women have organized online. When they have 45,000 black women on a Zoom call -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- that’s really exciting. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. All of that kind of organizing happened in organically, too. It’s amazing. Claire McCaskill: And I think we need to take a moment and listen to some of President Biden’s speech last night, which it was terrific. And I know how hard it had to have been for him and his family and his staff, but he nailed it. (BEGIN AUDIO TAPE) Joe Biden: You know, in recent weeks, it’s become clear to me. I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation. (END AUDIO TAPE) Jennifer Palmieri: And what’s amazing, you know, did you see the photos afterward that they released afterwards? He got through that speech in the Oval Office surrounded by his family. I’ve seen a lot of president, you know, Oval Office addresses, but like, wow. What an incredible family moment. And also, just to pause, I’m still wrapping my head around how Biden is going to emerge in the history books as such a major political figure of the late 20th century, early part of the 21st century, elected at age 29. They called his campaign the Children’s Crusade in Delaware when he first ran for Senate because he was so young. And then, you know, goes on to become President of the United States and the oldest serving President of the United States, which means Joe Biden like eked every inch of his life out to do something important in public service. And, you know, it’s not just incredible that he was the vice president of the first black president and that he has passed the torch as president to who he hopes to be the first black woman president, but had an incredibly historic, productive presidency as well. So he’s just going to be someone who’s really appreciated and remembered. Claire McCaskill: His legacy will be legend. Jennifer Palmieri: Yes, legend. He’s such a legendary figure. Claire McCaskill: Yep. Jennifer Palmieri: People talk about LBJ and like the ability to work the Congress. And he has that plus all these other dimensions. So just really proud to be around when this all happened. Claire McCaskill: Yep. So we’re going to talk about if I were in the room in terms of the Veep stakes, because we’re going to talk about Vance in the last segment of the episode today. But I think it’s important for us to make sure people know who really is being vetted, because it’s going to happen quickly. It’s going to happen by the 7th of August, and it’s going to be one of the following names. Andy Beshear, who’s the governor of Kentucky; Roy Cooper, who is the governor of North Carolina; Mark Kelly, who’s the U.S. Senator of Arizona; the Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. And none other than Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Jennifer Palmieri: We will pause here. But speaking of Tim Walz, one of the nominees being vetted to possibly become the running mate, he is going to join us, Minnesota Governor and head of the Democratic Governors Association, Tim Walz will join us for his take on a new Democratic ticket and how the convention rules are getting worked out. Back in a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Jennifer Palmieri: Welcome back. As we mentioned, the energy in the party right now is just remarkable. The vice president’s entrance into the 2024 contest has buoyed what was a lagging, pretty sleepy campaign. And no one knows this better than Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Claire McCaskill: And we are thrilled to have him join us. Jennifer Palmieri: Yay! Claire McCaskill: The home of the hot dish. Tim Walz: The home of the hot dish. Hey, I won that contest three times. Jennifer Palmieri: What? Claire McCaskill: And by the way, you know what happened when you won that? Amy Klobuchar died a little bit inside. Jennifer Palmieri: Claire. Claire McCaskill: I mean, I’m just telling you. Tim Walz: Both of us are going to have hell to pay, Claire, because as you know, she is -- Claire McCaskill: No, I got to tell you. She is my dear buddy. But no one is more competitive -- Jennifer Palmieri: Mine too. Claire McCaskill: -- than Amy Klobuchar. Nobody in the whole world. Tim Walz: And I won it using Spam. It’s just beautiful. Claire McCaskill: Oh, I love that. Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: My family loves Spam. We do Spam grits. Tim Walz: It tells you a lot about a family. Claire McCaskill: There you go. Tim Walz: That’s all I need to know. Claire McCaskill: There you go. Jennifer Palmieri: Maybe we could link to Governor Walz hot dish recipe on the link in the show notes. Claire McCaskill: There we go. Tim Walz: I’m telling it to you (ph).  Claire McCaskill: Yes, we would love that. Tim Walz: It’s a hot dish recipe. Yup, we will. Claire McCaskill: We will do that. Tim Walz: There’s a cookbook out on congressional hot dish recipes. So you’ll be all fascinated. You know, our good friend Collin Peterson -- Claire McCaskill: By the way, just so everybody knows this. I mean, I love Governor Walz and I love my friend Amy Klobuchar and I love Minnesota. But that is just their way of saying casserole, just so you know. Hot dish is a casserole. So for those in Missouri, these are casserole recipes. All right. Tim Walz: There you go. Claire McCaskill: So Tim Walz is the Governor of Minnesota and Chair of the Democratic Governors Association and Co-chair of the Democratic National Convention Rules Committee. He has had a career that has enveloped public service from serving our country in the military to serving Minnesota students as a high school teacher and football coach. So you think he’s not ready for anything when you’ve been a high school football coach and a school teacher in high school, you are ready. So we welcome Governor Walz. Glad to have you. Tim Walz: Thank you. I also supervised the lunchroom. That’s where I gained it. Claire McCaskill: Oh my god. Tim Walz: Well, that prepared me for Congress. Claire McCaskill: I mean -- Jennifer Palmieri: I was ready to go. So, yeah. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Because everything is like high school, we say. It’s not fair to high school. We’re like, oh, everyone’s behaving like a high school, but really high school is just real life. Tim Walz: Oh, yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: We hope to evolve behind it, but beyond it, but yeah. Tim Walz: You never close a yearbook. Never. That’s me, so. Jennifer Palmieri: Oh, my goodness. Tim Walz: Good to be with you. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, thank you. Claire McCaskill: So why don’t you talk first, Governor, about how this race, how the dynamics have shifted in the presidential from your perch on the rules committee, maybe make sure our listeners understand, because we try to explain things here -- Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- that this is not a done deal, that it was perfectly wide open to anybody who wanted to try to run after President Biden released his delegates. Tim Walz: Yeah. And I’ll take it first. You’re right. The dynamics of the race and look, Jen, you and Claire both know this was a challenging week emotionally and watching President Biden, who we adore, who we all know is effective and trying to show the dignity and the respect and not closure, but a transition. And I don’t know if we could have asked for anything better. His dignity, his grace, shifting it. The energy has blown off the roof. I think the only, in my analysis is, is this is mid Obama years, if you will, in terms of energy amongst the activists. And so that was all there. And this issue about the virtual vote, look, we did this and our rules are the same as they’ve been for decades. But COVID, we voted in COVID virtually because we all learned you could do some of these things. The real rub came on this when the state of Ohio, like Republican legislators across the country, have started to mess with the voting rules. And Ohio’s law says we have got to have wet signatures signed of our nominee into the secretary of state’s office in Ohio by August 7th. Well, our convention starts August 19th. So that in itself was one. And now there are people that said, well, you know, they said they would fix it. And to those people, I would say, if you’re trusting Republicans on the voting sanctity right now, that’s a bit risky. It gets worse and that Washington State is the 20th. So the process is open. What we did yesterday, and Claire, you’ll appreciate this. I got asked months ago to be the Chair of the Rules Committee. They said, oh, it’s just honorary pro-functional. You won’t do anything. Jen Palmieri: Excuse me Governor. I hate to interrupt, but I think it would help if you explain, because I think we kind of just jumped into this and no one has any idea. You’re like chair of the rules, the DNC rules and bylaws committee. Tim Walz: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: I think, are you there because you’re chair of the DGA? Tim Walz: No. No. Jennifer Palmieri: No? Oh, no. You’re just a nice guy and someone said -- Tim Walz: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: -- can you please take this? Okay. Tim Walz: Yeah. Totally -- Jennifer Palmieri: But explain what they get assigned to do -- Tim Walz: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: -- because I think it’s not a body we’re familiar with. Tim Walz: Well, it’s a good point. Yeah. And the chair of the DGA, this is really important. We have 23 Democratic governors. When you have a Democratic governor, you have reproductive access. When you have a Democratic governor, you have free school meals. When you have a Democratic governor, you’re dealing with climate change. My job is to be the chair of that, to elect Democratic governors in the 11 races this year, including Missouri. With Crystal and Mike, we got great candidates and we got Ashcroft down there that I want Claire to spend some dirt with me on this one, but that’s my job. Totally separate from that, the party apparatus has a convention coming up and somebody has to run the rules. Like, how are we going to vote? When are we going to vote? What do these things look like? And these are experts. These are people that love this stuff, but they need to have a chair. So Bishop Daughtry, who’s an expert at this, is a co-chair. Claire McCaskill: Leah Daughtry, yeah. Tim Walz: Yeah. She’s fabulous. Everybody loves her. But they asked me because it’s like an honorary thing coming from, you know, the White House. Well, little did I know now this thing became central because look, Claire’s right. Look, I didn’t know how this worked. And digging into this, there was a lot of misinformation that you’re not allowing people to vote on the floor. It’s the foundational thing that we do. Everybody who wants to get in should get in. And it felt like the system was closed. Now, what’s rich about this is Republicans talking about disenfranchising voters, you know, with pictures of January 6th behind them or whatever. It’s not that. And so, Claire, here’s how this works. What we finished yesterday was opening this week will be the process. We have 4,699 delegates. You got to get the majority of those to get the nomination. These are pledged delegates who were for Joe Biden who are now open to go to whoever they want. If you can go get 300 delegates before, I believe, the 30th, you’re able to bring that to the floor and you’ll get a vote if you can get that. So it is open. It’s the same way it would be done in person, but it must be done before August 7th to ensure ballot access, certainly in Ohio. And then it falls in quick succession, August 20th, Washington State, 22nd, California, 23rd, Virginia. So that’s what it was. It’s an open process. Anybody can get in. We’re going to vote virtually. And then we’re going to go to Chicago and do something that I think people worried about. We are going to celebrate and bring energy that blows the roof off things to celebrate Joe Biden, but to shift the torch to our nominee and presumptive nominee at this point in time is Kamala Harris. Jennifer Palmieri: If somebody wants to run, they need to get 300 delegates. Tim Walz: Correct. Jennifer Palmieri: By the way, delegates, to remind people. The delegates were selected by you. Tim Walz: Correct. Jennifer Palmieri: Because if you vote in the Democratic primary, well, I vote in the state of Maryland. You vote for Joe Biden. You’re really voting for an actual person delegate -- Tim Walz: Correct. Jennifer Palmieri: -- like actual delegate who will represent you in Chicago. And so if you wanted to run, you need to get 300 of those delegates who were elected by Democrats. Again, I’m just like building up the legitimacy of this process. Tim Walz: You’re doing great. Jennifer Palmieri: It’s almost like I did communications for a living. And then if you get 300 of these delegates to sign a nomination form -- Tim Walz: Yes. Jennifer Palmieri: -- your name can be placed in nomination and you can compete for the Democratic nomination. Tim Walz: That’s right. Jennifer Palmieri: No one has done that to date. And the vice president has secured enough delegates are pledged to her now that we know she can be elected as the nominee on the first ballot that will happen virtually sometime between August 1st and 7th. You haven’t resolved what date yet, right? Tim Walz: That’s right. It’ll be open during that time, finished by the 7th. You should be a teacher. And also Claire would appreciate this. Superdelegates can’t vote on the first vote. So none of the 700 superdelegates will have a say. So it’s pledged into that. I think the unity that came behind this, but it is open, there is the opportunity, but I agree. I don’t think anyone will. And I think the good news is, is because we have a candidate that was there on the ticket with Joe Biden that is a known quantity that people are excited about and then we can get to Chicago and do the rest of the work. Claire McCaskill: I will just tell you as an aside, I know your pain about the Rules Committee. I remember after the election in 2008, I got a call, I think it was from Plouffe, somebody and said, Claire, we want you to serve in an honorary capacity on this committee for the DNC. And I said, oh, sure. And then a month later I got the call. Now here’s your job. We want to change the first primary away from Iowa. Tim Walz: No way. Claire McCaskill: And I’m like, oh, gee, thanks. Tim Walz: All my neighbors in Iowa still wanted to know who that was. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: Well, I’m going to go ahead and pass along your name, Claire. Claire McCaskill: I was the sucker. Okay. So we got to get this done. Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: You know, you were obviously being vetted for vice president, which is a tremendous honor in and of itself and we want to congratulate you on that honor because that is Joe Biden would say, is a BFD. So we don’t want to force you to talk about this, but we certainly want to give you the opportunity to address it if you would like. Tim Walz: Thank you. And I’m not going to share the internal or the personal things conversation, but I will say this. Just even being mentioned in that is the most surreal thing in the world. And I remind people, you know, less than 20 years ago, I truly am supervising that public school classroom with no intention to run. But I think now, and I’m saying this, I’m biased. I’m biased towards democratic governors. That’s why that list is full of most incredible people. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: And I will go back to it again. She cannot go wrong where she picks. And I say that because these are states that across the country that have protected reproductive freedoms, that have come up with real solutions on climate change, that are focusing on labor unions and middle class. It’s certainly, as I said, personally, it’s an honor, but it’s reassuring to me that Vice President Harris and the party, if you will, is seeing this ability to be able to compete across the board. And I think, again, the states and the people being mentioned make sense because we need to win them. But I just be candid with you. I think this map expanded. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: And I look at it as the 11 races we have as for governors, we’re going to win North Carolina. We have incredible Attorney General down there, Josh Stein. But their candidate is full blown beyond anything I can imagine. He makes Donald Trump look somewhat sane, and that gets really weird. But there are states like Missouri, there are states like Indiana, there are states like Montana. So what I would say about it is, is I think they’re focused on the right things. I think they’re focused on winning. That’s my concern. They make sure that when they get through this process, whoever that is, needs to be there to make sure that we win in November. Claire McCaskill: Where’s your best chances for pickups in terms of Democratic governors? I don’t want you to diminish any of the states, but why don’t you lift up for our listeners? Because we want everybody to help. I mean, governors are really important. I know. I ran for governor and then I ran for Senate two years later. Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And it’s a different exercise in terms of how there’s a national base for when you run for senator, not so much when you run for governor. Tim Walz: That’s right. Claire McCaskill: And people across the country need to realize they need to help out these Democratic governors races. Where would you highlight for our listeners to maybe send 10 or 20 bucks if they felt like it? Tim Walz: My heart is melting for Claire. I need to take you on the road for this because that assessment is exactly right. People who don’t know, say it’s a statewide race or whatever, it’s very different. Governors races are very localized and they don’t gain that. It’s very hard to gain resources. That’s why the DGA is so important. We are a key player in this. This is like the DSCC or the DCCC, but we do it for governors. Look, we have no incumbents. This organization has won 27 out of 28 of the last races, but we’re going to win in North Carolina, hold that seat that Roy Cooper’s in. We’re going to win and beat Kelly Ayotte, a former colleague of yours, Claire, up in New Hampshire. We’re going to, of course, hold Delaware. I believe we can play in much broader places. We have incredible candidates. Like I said, we’ve got Indiana, we’ve got Missouri. And I will just mention this in Montana that people need to -- Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah, I know that guy well. Yeah. Tim Walz: Sixteen out of the last 19 years, it’s been a Democratic governor. Jennifer Palmieri: I know. Tim Walz: Democrats give up so easy. Oh, Montana’s stalled to red. John Tester is going to win, Claire. Don’t bet against that guy. He is going to win. And I think our governor candidate. So we’ve got some safe seats. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Ryan Bussey is the governor candidate there, he’s good. Yeah. Montana, it’s still a purple state. People don’t believe that it is. Tim Walz: It is. And they care about public lands. Claire McCaskill: They really do. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. It’s a big deal. We’re going to take a quick break, but stick with us because I think that Governor Walz has one of the best critiques I have heard yet of why the Trump advance ticket is not right for America. So stick around. We will be back in just a moment. (ADVERTISEMENT) Claire McCaskill: Governor, we’ve talked about your role as chairman of the Rules Committee for the DNC, and we’ll look forward to seeing you in Chicago. And we’ve talked about your role as Chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and those important races. Let’s turn now to the mess that is known as the Republican ticket for president. That is Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Why don’t you give us your take on the strength or weakness of that particular ticket? Tim Walz: Oh, wow. The thing is, is that I come at this, I keep saying this, Claire, and you get it from Missouri. And, Jen, I grew up in a small town of 400 people. I said I had 24 kids in my class, 12 were cousins graduating. That’s small town America. And I said the thing that most irritates me and it baffles me and I think we can take this message back is a failed real estate guy from New York City that knows nothing about small towns and a guy who wrote a book that denigrates my neighbors and tells them that this is some type of cultural thing. I think the real message here is, is the reason that rural America is struggling more, and we’ve seen it whether it’s outsourcing of jobs, is because of Republican policies and people like Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist who cares nothing about those institutions there. If you’re in a town of 400, there are two institutions that are the most important to your town. That is the public school and a hospital or a clinic, if you have it. Both of those things are being gutted by the Republicans. They’ve been telling us for six and a half years they have a plan on healthcare, and that means taking away Medicare and Medicaid and reducing the ACA access. And they talk about privatizing public schools. And I think the simplest thing on this is, where do you think you’re gonna find a public school in a town of 400? Where do you think that’s gonna work? The great genius of this country was everybody gets an opportunity. Every community thrives. I had the best government teacher in a guy named Ed Pebble in a town of 400 with a small class, and now I’m the Governor of Minnesota. That’s the American story. Oh, we’re gonna privatize this and take the money out of our public schools. Let me be very clear. When you talk about private education, that means you gut the public schools, you send it to people already sending their kids to those schools, and you got it. So I think the condemnation of these people are they don’t know middle America. They don’t know who we are. Their policies do nothing to help them, and yet we know? You know, Claire, I represented a district that Trump won by 18 points, but that got tougher and tougher. You and I both saw this, that there was a transition in real time in front of us. I think we need to take this populist message, the economy, the freedoms. These guys aren’t for freedoms. Their idea of freedom is to be in your exam room, your bedroom. You know, banning books, we’re banning hunger. These are democratic policies. And I think the people in Missouri, I would argue, the people in Montana, doing those types of things make a big difference. What is Donald Trump offering? You go to these rallies, he’s talking about Hannibal Lecter. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: He’s trying to think up names. It’s stunning to me. At some point in time, I am convinced of this. At some point in time, this crumbles like the house of cards it is because there is no plan. There is no policy. And now they’re flirting with, you know, totalitarianism, Orban down in Mar-a-Lago, you know, no problem with Putin, none whatsoever. Those are the types of things that I think are all coming to a head. So look, this is a bad ticket on the other side. It is anti-union. It is anti-public school. It has no solutions on healthcare or climate change. And these are things that are in everybody’s life every day. So I’m very hopeful that the Harris ticket will bring that message. Claire McCaskill: You know, I think the freedom message, Jen and I have talked about this before, you know, we do a segment on this podcast often about if we were in the room, what we would be talking to campaigns about in terms of their ability to win in November. And I think the freedom message is so important. Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, that’s where people like J.D. Vance are so hypocritical. If you look at some of the votes he’s taken recently -- Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: -- and this is not some interview he did, you know, when he was in college. These are votes as a U.S. senator where he was one of only 28 senators to vote against a bill that would have restricted law enforcement from getting women’s medical records -- Tim Walz: Yes. Claire McCaskill: -- which is just bonkers in terms of being anti-freedom. Big government is watching you. Big government is tracking you. I mean, in my state, they actually caught a person in the Republican administration trying to track women’s periods. Tim Walz: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: I mean, it is really, really scary shit. Tim Walz: It’s terrifying. Well, you’re in the right spot, Claire. I saw the new ad just this morning that came out from the vice president, and it’s freedom, freedom. And you’re exactly right. Claire McCaskill: Yeah. Tim Walz: And I think their idea of freedom is very, very different. Very different. Claire McCaskill: Very, very, very different. Jen, what else do we need to cover with the governor about this race? Jennifer Palmieri: So, Minnesota, you know, prior to the sort of last round of polling, it was sort of reported that I guess that one of the reasons why President Biden in the end did decide to not run is that he saw polling from the campaign that showed even states like Minnesota, you know, people say, Minnesota is no blue state. I know. I know it is not easy to win in Minnesota. I know it’s not easy for Democrats to win there. It’s a very diverse state. Tim Walz: That’s right. Jennifer Palmieri: A lot of rural areas as well. You know, there’s big cities, but a lot of rural areas, the Iron Range, the whole thing. Tim Walz: Yeah. Jennifer Palmieri: Like, I know it’s tough. But what were you seeing in Minnesota prior to the president dropping out and how do you think that this Harris nomination sort of upends the Trump and Vance playbook? Tim Walz: Yeah. Well, it was real. It is close. We don’t take anything for granted. I will, though, tout our record. We have the longest streak of voting for Democrats going back to ‘72. Jennifer Palmieri: Wow. I didn’t realize that. Tim Walz: Oh, yes. And every other state got it wrong in ‘84, except us with Walter Mondale, as you well know. But look, it was going to be close. It was there. But here’s the thing. Minnesotans vote in highest numbers, or either one or two. So, the universe is pretty predictable. Donald Trump’s floor and ceiling is the exact same thing. He’s going nowhere. He’s got his folks that they’re there. The issue we had was enthusiasm around the Democratic base. That is now gone. And so Donald Trump, you know, said he won in 2020. He lied. He said he was going to win in 16. ‘He didn’t. And so in hockey parlance, he’s going for the hat trick of getting his butt handed to him again this year. We will win. And I think the thing to keep important is all the money Donald Trump raises goes to Donald Trump. All that money goes to his funds, whatever he does. They do not have the infrastructure. They talk about it. Now, he’s coming out here. I tweaked him online, and apparently he was watching Fox News. So he’s now scheduled a rally out here. Here’s my thing. Come spend your money in Minnesota. Come pay your damn bill, though, if you’re going to hold a rally. That’s what I would say. Pay your bills, but spend your money here, because while you’re spending your money here, we’re building up in North Carolina. We’re building up in Wisconsin. We’re building up in Pennsylvania. So we’re going to win this thing. It’ll be close. We’ll take it to them, though. Jennifer Palmieri: Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, thank you so much. It’s delightful to meet you. You’re as fun as everyone promised. Yeah, we really appreciate your time. Claire McCaskill: And, you know, let me just say about Tim Walz. I don’t know who’s going to be selected as vice president, but, you know, give me a plain talking former public school teacher any day of the week from the heart of this country. It is not flyover country. It is the beating heart of America. So go, Tim. Tim Walz: Thanks, Claire. Thanks, Jen. Claire McCaskill: All right. Tim Walz: Good to talk to you. Jennifer Palmieri: Thank you. Claire McCaskill: See you in Chicago. Tim Walz: Yep. See you. Claire McCaskill: Okay. So we are now going to talk about the real DEI candidate in this race, who is J.D. Vance. You know that DEI is used by Republicans as shorthand. Well, it really means he’s not a white guy. DEI to them means anybody other than a white male, which is so bad. It undermines Harris to do this, and it tries to diminish her amazing qualifications. And the resume she has built through her effort, through hard work. I mean, you don’t win Democratic primaries in California without being tough as nails. And she has won a number of them against the odds, not only for D.A. of San Francisco, but Attorney General of California and United States senator. I mean, that was a really tough primary for her. Jennifer Palmieri: Yeah. Claire McCaskill: And she prevailed because she’s really good at public service. So let’s talk about how J.D. Vance. Jennifer Palmieri: Claire is going to tee off on J.D. Vance, which is excellent. But I’ll just add in here because, you know, again, like worked with a lot of people who’ve done research and polling and focus groups about the, you know, what’s really going on here and the best way to handle if you’re trying to be helpful. So, as Claire laid out, what’s really happening here is that Vice President Harris is far more accomplished, qualified and prepared to be president of the United States than either Donald Trump or J.D. Vance, okay. And also she’s electric on the trail and they are trying to do whatever they can to undermine that. And they know that in people’s minds, even though it’s 2024, we still have a lot of questions about women. People have different questions about female candidates and they do male candidates. And we have to be constantly reminded of women’s qualifications. So, you know, it may be true, but not necessarily helpful to be like this. These attacks on the vice president are racist and they’re sexist. It’s kind of diminishing of her. It’s kind of what they hope we do. It triggers all sorts of things in our brains. What is helpful to say is, you know what? The vice president is one of the most qualified and prepared people to ever seek the office. She was a prosecutor. She was attorney general, the largest state of the nation. She was elected senator of the largest state of the nation. She was elected vice president. And she’s been doing this job. She’s prepared to take it on. These attacks are not going to stop her. She’s been hearing this kind of thing her whole life. But you know what? Our daughters do hear it. Our nieces hear it. Young women hear it. And it’s harmful for them. And so that’s what I’m concerned about here. People don’t need to worry about Kamala Harris. She is going to be fine. But this may turn off black voters. This may turn off women. And by the way, it’s really destructive for these guys to be sending that kind of messages to our daughters. That is a great way for people to respond if you want to push back on this and do it in a way that, you know, frankly, inflicts as much damage as possible for the jackasses that are saying it. All right, Claire, go on J.D. Claire McCaskill: All right. So here’s the deal with J.D. The reason Republicans complain about DEI is they claim that that gives people positions that they did not earn, that they did not get on merit, that they got by a certain classification, either gender or ethnicity. That’s exactly what he did. And he admitted it in his book. And I’m quoting him, “The financial aid package Yale offered exceeded my wildest dreams. In my first year, it was nearly a full ride. And it wasn’t because of anything I’d done or earned. It was because I was one of the poorest kids in school.” So he got special treatment because of a status, not because he earned it. That’s how he got what he got. Okay, then fast forward. He gets out of Yale, writes a book that was notable, and I will give him that. But he’d written a book. And what does Peter Thiel do, this billionaire tech guy? He starts getting him hired in financial firms when he has no experience whatsoever doing anything in the financial sector. And they even admitted these financial firms said, I hired him because Peter Thiel told me to. Once again, he didn’t earn it. Peter Thiel gave it to him. And then fast forward to his Senate campaign. He wasn’t raising any money. And what did Peter Thiel do? Gave him $10 million so that he could win the primary for U.S. Senate in Ohio. Not only did he have 10 million, he then gave another 5 million. I mean, I ran for the U.S. Senate. I can’t imagine what it would be like to get a $15 million contribution. You know how hard you have to work to raise that money if you’re used to doing things on merit? This guy, Peter Thiel, has been carrying him piggyback style from the moment they had a bromance back when Peter Thiel attended a speech he gave. And it has been all Peter Thiel since then, not merit. So he is the DEI candidate. He is a guy who is where he is not based on what he’s earned. He’s been a U.S. senator for 10 minutes. He has no experience in doing this. He doesn’t know government. He wants to take away your freedoms. And he is a really bad dude. And he’s way out there. He’s way out there extreme. So here you go. Jennifer Palmieri: And like, also just to remind people of Trump’s lack of, I mean, Trump has served in one government position. He has won one campaign and he got impeached twice in the four years he had that because he was doing a bad job, okay. And J.D. Vance has won one race. He served as senator for 10 minutes, you know, versus Harris, who had almost 14 years as prosecutor and attorney general and then elected to the United States Senate and then four years as vice president. Claire McCaskill: She’s ready. Jennifer Palmieri: We don’t know her nominee is, her running mate is, but we know enough of the choices like that person is also going to be infinitely more qualified and prepared for this job than either J.D. or Donald Trump. Claire McCaskill: And by the way, the Republicans are now worried about J.D. Vance. Okay. Jennifer Palmieri: Okay. Claire McCaskill: This was a delight, right? Jennifer Palmieri: All right.

A second Trump term would actively make climate change worse,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 9:09 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-climate-change-project-2025-proposals-rcna163426,"The videos first started appearing a dozen years ago. Pickup truck drivers, mostly young men, would modify their diesel engines and then record themselves deliberately spreading air pollution. It was called ""rolling coal,"" and the idea was to spew dark clouds of exhaust at bicyclists, Prius and Tesla drivers and other cars as a protest of environmentalism. The trend appears to have peaked in 2014, thanks to new state laws and crackdowns on people selling vehicle modification kits and, presumably, finding better things to do with their time. But the impulse behind it lives on, even as the risks of climate change become ever more serious. The most recent example? Project 2025, a set of conservative proposals from the Heritage Foundation that outlines step-by-step plans to remake the federal government in a second Donald Trump administration, including dismantling nearly everything the federal government is doing to fight climate change, making it dramatically harder to conduct basic scientific research on it and actively promoting more oil and gas use. Trump has tried to distance himself from the proposals, despite the fact that some of his top former advisers spearheaded it. But it's in line with his thinking. As The Washington Post reported, he told a gathering of top oil executives this year that he would reverse dozens of environmental regulations and stop new ones if they raised $1 billion to help him return to the White House. His campaign, meantime, targeted environmental regulations such as electric vehicle mandates in its Agenda 47, a scattershot series of videos outlining its plans for a second term. And at rallies, Trump frequently criticizes electric cars, claiming in one bizarre aside that buying one made his friend gain weight because he would eat at restaurants while it charged. Trump has also gone off on weird tangents about the risks of electric batteries on boats. In his first ""rolling coal"" term, Trump rolled back or loosened nearly 100 rules and regulations on pollution, many of which set the U.S. further behind in the effort to stop the worst effects of climate change, according to a tally by The New York Times. But that record would be dwarfed by the damage that the Project 2025 proposals could do if he followed through on them, even as Monday was the hottest day ever measured by humans, according to a European Union science agency. The 922-page document drips with disdain for what it calls ""climate alarmism"" that it argues is being used as propaganda for ""ineffective, liberty-crushing regulations."" But its most damaging proposal looks like it would launch what amounts to a propaganda effort against climate science. The first step is something called Schedule F, which would reclassify thousands of government workers, making it easier for the president to hire and fire them. Even if Trump were to fire only some of those workers, the shift toward politicization of lower-level government jobs would mean an exodus of experienced scientists. Those who remained might become more cautious about their research decisions to avoid trouble. The second step is to create a job that appears to basically be an anti-climate change czar. Project 2025 proposes creating a position of ""science adviser"" and six senior political appointees who would be charged with ""overseeing and reforming"" research at the Environmental Protection Agency, emphasizing that these political overseers should be hired for their ""management, oversight and execution skills,"" rather than scientific expertise. Imagine something like the final scene of an episode of ""The Apprentice,"" only with Trump hauling climate scientists into the boardroom to dramatically fire them. That may be exciting for the oil and gas industry and some of Trump's supporters but not for the two-thirds of Americans in a recent Pew Research Center survey who said they support the country's taking steps to become carbon neutral by 2050. (If you want to understand the depth of disdain here, the section on the EPA was written by Mandy Gunasekara. The Drilled newsletter points out she's in the famous 2015 photo of her then-boss, the late Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., holding up a snowball in the Senate as an attempt to disprove climate change.) The report goes further, proposing dramatically downsizing the National Weather Service and leaving weather forecasting to private companies. That could hamper its ability to issue public warnings about floods, hurricanes and other dangers, just as we are seeing more intense and frequent extreme-weather events due to the human-caused increase in greenhouse gases. That's not all. Other sections of Project 2025 propose ending subsidies for wind and solar power; cutting research into wind, solar and battery technology needed to help transition away from fossil fuels; ending federal mandates and subsidies for electric vehicles; and expanding drilling for oil and natural gas on federal lands. As Trump said in his convention speech, ""we will drill, baby, drill."" The efforts would not be limited to the U.S., either. A section on foreign aid proposes rolling back efforts to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuels, arguing that they are ""unachievable."" But then it goes further, arguing that the U.S. should spend taxpayer dollars persuading these countries to burn more oil and gas. The U.S. Agency for International Development, the proposal says, ""should cease its war on fossil fuels in the developing world and support the responsible management of oil and gas reserves as the quickest way to end wrenching poverty."" Taken together, these proposals would not just make it harder to fight climate change but actively make it worse. A second Trump administration would be rolling coal on the entire planet."

"Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris, throwing 'full support' behind her",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 8:44 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/barack-michelle-obama-endorse-kamala-harris-rcna163817,"Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 race on Friday. The announcement was posted to the Obamas' social media accounts, accompanied by a video of Harris — the current vice president and de facto Democratic presidential nominee — receiving a call from the Obamas offering their endorsement.  “Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend @KamalaHarris,"" Obama said in his post. ""We told her we think she’ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support. At this critical moment for our country, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you’ll join us.” In the video, Michelle Obama can be heard saying, “I can’t have this call without telling my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic.”  In response, Harris thanked them for their friendship over the years. “And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she said in the video. You may have detected a bit of consternation online from people who wondered why this endorsement didn’t come sooner — perhaps, along with the wave of Democratic endorsements that immediately followed President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race. Barack Obama had released a statement soon after Biden announced his intention to drop out that didn’t make any endorsement. Its reference to Obama's ""extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges"" may have suggested to some that he hoped for a brokered convention scenario.  But a source familiar with discussions between Obama and Harris told NBC News that Obama didn't want to overshadow Biden's moment by issuing his endorsement before the president addressed the nation on Wednesday. Whatever the reason for the delay, the Obamas have offered their full-throated support of Harris now. In fact, aides to Obama and Harris have already discussed potential plans for the former president to join the likely nominee on the campaign trail, NBC News reported on Friday, citing three people familiar with the matter."
"U.S. politics are catching Olympic fever, but it's not all fun and games",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 8:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/us-politics-play-olympic-games-rcna163794,"With the 2024 Olympics officially kicking off Friday, politicos from Washington, D.C., and campaigners from around the country are starting to look for ways to stretch their own political muscles.

The first lady’s delegation includes: The second gentleman’s delegation to the closing ceremony includes Campbell Bauer; Sen. Laphonza Butler and Rep. Robert Garcia, both of California; four-time track Olympian Chaunte Lowe; and two-time gold medal soccer player Briana Scurry. The first lady touched down Thursday in Paris where she delivered a speech and met with U.S. athletes and their families (you can watch her speech here, and you can check out some of her interactions with Olympic athletes themselves here, including a little relay practice with women from the U.S. track team).  U.S. political campaigns are also riffing on Olympic themes in a slate of new ads. The Senate Majority PAC, an organization vying to help Democrats keep their Senate majority, uses various events to poke fun at Republican Senate candidates and highlight what a group spokesperson Hannah Menchoff characterized as ""out of touch"" and ""extremist"" policies. In an ad against Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, for example, announcers characterize Lake as a gymnast who's vaulted to the political fringe while taking dangerous positions. And the group's ad against Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde depicts him as a champion beach volleyball player who practices at his mansion in Laguna Beach — a reference to Hovde’s recent residency in California, which has become a campaign issue.  And Ohio Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes debuted an Olympics-themed ad of her own Friday that features Sykes, a former state champion gymnast who participated in the Junior Olympics, flipping off of a balance beam.  The massive platform that is the Olympics and the attention that it generates are already providing a rich opportunity for political power players to promote causes and people they support.

As NBC News reported, House Republican leaders canceled next week’s session “and sent lawmakers home for a six-week summer recess with little to brag about to constituents and voters heading into the final months before the election.” As recently as last fall, Johnson’s position was that House members shouldn’t leave town until the chamber had completed its work on all 12 of the federal appropriations bills. That was certainly a nice idea in theory. But in practice, the House’s Republican majority had passed only five funding bills — none of which can pass the Democratic-led Senate — and plans to take up four more this week fell apart. As Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida told NBC News, in reference to GOP leaders: “They can’t pass their own bills.” Looking ahead to the near future, a Roll Call report added, “The outlook is similarly grim come September, the focus will shift to passing a stopgap funding measure to avoid a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.” Ordinarily, ahead of Congress’ summer break, House leaders try to rack up at least some wins so that their members have something to boast about in their local districts. That’s clearly not the case in 2024. “Extreme MAGA Republicans have been in the majority for over 18 months,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement Thursday. “Can anyone name a single thing extreme MAGA Republicans in the House have done in order to make life better for the American people? A single thing that they have done? You can’t. ... You can’t name one single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans have done on their own to make life better for the American people. “They are incapable of governing.” The New York Democrat’s rhetoric comes roughly eight months after Republican Rep. Chip Roy delivered impassioned remarks on the House floor about his party’s legislative efforts. “One thing. I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing — one! — that I can go campaign on and say we did,” the Texan said. “Anybody sitting in the complex, if you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me, one meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done.” No one rushed to respond to Roy’s — or Jeffries’ — challenge. The point is not to point and laugh at congressional foibles. The point, rather, is to question what in the world House Republicans intend to say as they hope to maintain their majority in the chamber. A recent Punchbowl News report noted that they’re “struggling to figure out what — if anything — to tout this November.” When Punchbowl News asked “roughly two dozen House GOP lawmakers about how they plan to convince voters to let them hold on to the majority,” they had strikingly little to say. In fairness, Republicans could plausibly argue that with a Democratic-led Senate and a Democratic White House, the prospect for legislative breakthroughs were severely limited. That’s true. But it’s also true that GOP House members could’ve engaged in good-faith negotiations, embraced legislative compromises, and scored some meaningful victories they could take to voters in the fall. They didn’t want to. The result is a wasted governing opportunity and a blank slate where a record is supposed to be. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
I've helped secure 5 Olympic Games. Here's what's worrisome about Paris.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 26, 2024, 8:15 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/olympics-paris-2024-security-threats-rcna163437,"UPDATE (JULY 26, 2024, 11:15 a.m. ET): French officials say a “massive attack” on part of France’s high-speed rail network disrupted service for hundreds of thousands of passengers Friday morning but that the attack has had no direct impact on the Olympic Games themselves other than inconveniencing rail passengers. As America continues to process the shocking act of political violence that was the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there’s another pressing security concern 4,000 miles away. The 2024 Summer Olympics begin in Paris on Friday and run through Aug. 11. Securing a Trump rally on a field in Butler, Pennsylvania, for a couple of hours proved to be a fatal failure, and the challenge of the Olympic Games makes Butler pale in comparison. The threat in Paris has already manifested in the form of arrests and disruptions, and the Games haven’t even started. During my FBI career and subsequent corporate security stint, I led or supported security plans for five Olympics. The Games play out on a global stage. An expected 15 million visitors are expected in France’s capital, including 2 million from outside the country. More than 10,000 competitors from 206 countries, including almost 600 U.S. athletes, will be there, and there will be billions of viewers watching on television and streaming platforms. The Olympics are supposed to transcend politics and bring the world together through peaceful competition, if only for a couple of weeks. But that large a bull’s-eye, with so much of the world paying attention, makes for an almost irresistible target for those whose causes are antithetical to peace. On July 17, French anti-terror police arrested a suspected neo-Nazi who allegedly planned to attack the Olympic torch relay. Prosecutors said the suspect runs a group called “French Aryan division” on the Telegram social media platform and was being questioned over death threats, hate speech and other postings. In May, French authorities disrupted a reportedly “Islamist-inspired” plot to attack Olympic soccer matches at the Paris Games. Police arrested an 18-year-old ethnic Chechen when they discovered the man exchanged encrypted messages with “known Islamists” and found photos and videos of the soccer stadium on his phone and computer. Prosecutors said the suspect intended to target spectators and police at Paris’ primary stadium. Paris is now on lockdown. Terrorism of all shades will be the primary security threat to the Games. The threat poses such a concern that the number of planned spectators allowed to watch the Olympic torch relay along the Seine during the opening ceremony was reduced in half, from 600,000 to 300,000. French authorities have already banned 4,000 people from even getting near the Olympic sites based on the potential threats they pose. The global threat level is already quite high in part because of the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Paris Games will only serve to heighten the threat level. Specific delegations to Paris will pose a greater security challenge in addition to the overall security plan. For example, the International Olympic Committee has banned Russia from being represented at these Games, but that doesn’t mean Russian athletes won’t participate. Only 15 Russian participants will be permitted and they’ll be identified as Individual Neutral Athletes. Russia is not happy with this decision and has been trying to keep people from attending the Games by stoking fears of a terror attack. There’s talk of a Russian cyberattack in Paris. The presence of 140 Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics further heightens the tensions and the threat picture in terms of Russia. Some of Russia’s athletes attending the Games are accused of violating the rules precluding them from supporting their nation’s war against Ukraine. Israeli athletes in Paris may make a particularly troubling target for terrorists, and will be protected by their own nation’s security agency, Shin Bet, even as they mix with and potentially compete against Palestinian athletes. As we cheer for our U.S. athletes over the course of the Games, let’s also root for a peaceful and safe Olympics. Regardless of which country wins the most events, I’m hoping that the French security services earn a gold medal, and that any would-be terrorists go home feeling defeated and disappointed."
"Why in the world does Trump keep saying, ‘We don’t need the votes’?",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 7:39 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/donald-trump-keep-saying-dont-need-votes-election-2024-rcna163808,"You don’t need to be an expert in electoral politics to understand Rule One of any campaign: Candidates should pursue as many votes as possible. In a democracy, it’s common sense: The more votes a campaign has, the greater the chance of success. With this in mind, Donald Trump appears to have a counterintuitive rhetorical habit. The New Republic noted: As a clip from the show makes clear, the former president didn’t appear to be kidding. If the phrasing sounded at all familiar, it’s not your imagination. The day after last month’s presidential debate, for example, Trump held a rally in Virginia and told attendees, “We don’t need votes.” A week earlier, the Republican spoke at a far-right conference and said roughly the same thing. “I tell my people, I don’t need any votes,” said Trump, who added: “We don’t need the votes.” That came on heels of the GOP candidate pushing the same line during an appearance in Detroit. “Listen, we don’t need votes,” Trump said. He added: “We don’t need votes. We have to stop — focus, don’t worry about votes.” In fact, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the former president has been pushing this line since last fall, during his party’s primary process. “You don’t have to vote,” Trump told a New Hampshire audience in October. “Don’t worry about voting. The voting — we got plenty of votes.” At face value, all of this probably seems bizarre. In fact, I’ve never heard a candidate for elected office — in any race, in either party, in any cycle — literally tell the public, “Don’t worry about voting.” But making matters worse is the message behind the message. Despite the odd phrasing, Trump isn’t literally telling Americans not to cast ballots, he’s instead arguing that he’s so wildly popular, receiving support from voters will be effortless as Election Day nears. The real challenge, the former president invariably adds, is dealing with cheating and electoral fraud that definitely exist in his weird imagination, despite Trump’s inability to substantiate his conspiracy theories with evidence. In other words, every time the Republican downplays the need for votes, he’s necessarily emphasizing the need for unnecessary voter intimidation tactics."
Growing number of Republicans see JD Vance as the wrong VP pick,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 6:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-see-jd-vance-wrong-vp-pick-donald-trump-election-2024-rcna163788,"By all appearances, Democrats seem quite pleased with Donald Trump’s latest choice for running mate. In fact, Democratic officials and their allies have spent the last week effectively treating Sen. JD Vance like a pinata, eagerly reminding the public about the Ohio Republican’s weird far-right views. The question, however, is whether Republicans are equally satisfied. Donald Trump appeared on Fox News around this time yesterday, and co-host Steve Doocy asked the former president, “I’m sure you’ve seen there have been a couple of stories out saying they wonder whether or not you feel you made the right pick. ... You’re still 100% behind JD Vance, right?” The Republican nominee, not surprisingly, reiterated his support for his newest running mate, but the fact that a Fox host even felt the need to ask the question — a week after the party’s national convention — was itself extraordinary. It was emblematic of a conversation in GOP circles that the party didn't expect to have. The day after President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid, The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta wrote via social media, “[The] most striking thing I heard from Trump allies yesterday was the second-guessing of JD Vance — a selection, they acknowledged, that was borne of cockiness, meant to run up margins with the base in a blowout.” This was not the only such report. Axios reported yesterday that some Republicans are “second-guessing the former president’s selection,” with one House GOP member explaining that Vance “was the only pick that wasn’t the safe pick. And I think everyone has now realized that.” The same report quoted another House Republican saying the feeling withing the conference is that Vance “doesn’t add much” to the party’s ticket. The Hill, meanwhile, published a related report of its own overnight. The article quoted one GOP lawmaker who called the Ohioan “the worst choice of all the options.” Another told The Hill, “I think if you were to ask many people around this building, nine out of 10 on our side would say he’s the wrong pick. [Vance is] the only person who can do serious damage.” The latest polling suggests the senator’s intraparty critics have a point. As the young, far-right senator makes the transition to being a national candidate, Vance begins his effort with a negative favorability rating — a rarity for any modern running mate. Circling back to our recent coverage, the case for the Ohio senator has long been difficult. The 39-year-old Republican — the least experienced major-party running mate in nearly nine decades — has no accomplishments to speak of. He has a record of extremism on key issues. He comes from a state the GOP ticket is almost certain to win anyway. He actually hated Trump in the recent past. In his first-and-only campaign, Vance prevailed, but he also “underperformed every other statewide Republican on the ballot by a large margin.” And as the public was reminded at Vance’s first solo rally since joining Trump’s team, the guy doesn’t exactly radiate charm and charisma, either. But Trump picked him anyway at least in part because Trump assumed he was poised to win anyway. As the former president saw it, with an inevitable 2024 victory in hand, there was no harm in running up the ideological score, satisfying the MAGA base, and establishing greater control over the Republican Party’s vision for the foreseeable future. That, of course, was when the GOP nominee thought a relatively easy victory over Biden was at hand. As of five days ago, things are suddenly ... different. All of this obviously matters in an electoral context, but the developments also say a great deal about Trump’s judgment, and none of it’s good. CORRECTION (July 26, 2024, 2:57 p.m. ET): This post originally misspelled Steve Doocy's name. The above text has been corrected. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Harris mocks Trump after he hedges (again) on presidential debate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 5:45 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-mocks-donald-trump-election-presidential-debate-2024-rcna163777,"The first sign of trouble came on Sunday. Just a few hours after President Joe Biden announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term, Donald Trump quickly turned his attention to one thing: an upcoming presidential debate, which he suddenly seemed reluctant to attend. The Republican published an item to his social media platform, noting that the next debate is currently scheduled to air on ABC in early September, and though Trump and his campaign operation had already agreed to participate in the event, the former president declared on Sunday that he instead wanted a debate on Fox News, instead of a network he described as “fake.” The second sign of trouble came two days later, when the GOP nominee doubled down on his original message, adding that he believes ABC “is not worthy of holding a Debate.” Later Tuesday, Trump told reporters he was “absolutely” prepared to debate the likely Democratic nominee, though he quickly added, “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden.” The latest sign of trouble came last night. The New York Times reported: The written statement from Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign’s communications director, was weird, even by 2024 standards. It said there’s “chaos” in Democratic politics (there’s not). It said Biden is corrupt (he isn’t). It suggested Barack Obama opposes Harris (he doesn’t). It suggested it was necessary to use Obama’s middle name (it’s not). It said the opposing party is called the ""Democrat Party"" (it's not). It also said “many” Democrats want to nominate someone other than Harris (they don’t). But after combing through the nonsense, the bottom line was simple: Team Trump concluded that it would be “inappropriate” to “finalize” the existing debate schedule until after the Democratic National Convention. It led the Democratic vice president to respond with a simple and derisive message via social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” It came hours after Harris told reporters that she was prepared to stick to the agreed upon debate schedule, despite the fact that she’s only been a candidate for less than a week, and she didn't know why her rival was ""back-pedaling."" Harris’ mockery was rooted in fact. Trump spent the better part of a year begging for debates against Biden, and expressed total indifference to the details. The former president summarized his position in three words: “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” When Biden proposed a pre-convention debate, Trump was only too pleased to agree. The Republican’s position is obviously vastly different now. When we last kicked this around, it seemed as if there were a couple of possible explanations for the antics. One was that Trump was engaged in a mind-numbing “work the refs” exercise, whining incessantly about ABC, in part in the hopes that the network will tilt the debate in his favor and in part to preemptively have an excuse in case Harris fares well in an upcoming standoff. The other possibility is that Trump and his team are simply afraid of how he’d perform against the incumbent vice president. All things considered, the latter explanation appears to be the accurate one. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Sonya Massey’s killing highlights the stakes of the 2024 election,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/sonya-massey-police-accountability-trump-harris-rcna163741,"As calls for police accountability mount over the killing of Sonya Massey, the Black woman who was shot by a sheriff’s deputy in her Illinois home, I’ve thought about the stubbornness of police violence — how this issue can seem intractable and insurmountable, given how frequently incidents like this seem to occur. And as presidential election talk rages on, I think it’s natural for people to feel a bit helpless. To believe presidential elections don’t have much of an effect on policing at the local level. Certainly, not as much as races at the local and state levels. And but not for Donald Trump’s remarks about police, I’d largely agree with them. This election is unique in that he is vowing to use presidential power to influence local police departments — and in ways that could make it far more difficult to achieve justice for victims of police violence in the future. “We’re going to give our police their power back,” Trump recently vowed at a Wisconsin rally, “and we’re going to give them immunity from prosecution.” One could argue that Trump wouldn’t have any federal authority to do such a thing as president. But after the Supreme Court’s Trump-friendly immunity ruling, few things seem out of bounds, legally speaking. Trump has also vowed to indemnify police officers “against any and all liability,” seemingly meaning that police who mete out violence on the job — even deadly violence — would be even more shielded from lawsuits than they already are. And there’s a clear contrast here. Under the Biden-Harris administration, the Justice Department has taken the opposite approach when it comes to police. The DOJ has issued scathing reports on civil rights abuses committed by various police departments, like in Louisville, Kentucky, where officials are currently negotiating a consent decree with the federal government, and in Phoenix. It stands to reason that, as president, Kamala Harris would want a Justice Department similarly committed to police accountability. After all, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee has been outspoken about the Trump administration’s opposition to such accountability. And that’s a notable contrast as we consider cases like Sonya Massey’s."
Kamala Harris has 100 days to make history. Here’s why I think she can do it.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 26, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-100-day-campaign-history-rcna163541,"In a little over 100 days, Vice President Kamala Harris needs to put together a campaign staff, develop her platform, decide on her strategy, approve advertising and prepare for a possible debate, among other things. It's a daunting set of tasks even when a nominee has months of preparation. But as her former senior adviser and chief spokesperson, I believe she is well-prepared to pull it off. It will not be easy, but it is doable. Look at what she's done so far. In the days since President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed her, the nonpartisan website Vote.org saw 35,000 people register to vote, 83% of them ages 18 to 34. The Harris campaign says it raised an earth-shattering $126 million in three days. The campaign also enlisted thousands of new volunteers, including in crucial swing states such as Nevada, Michigan and Georgia. On Wednesday night, the president appeared on national television behind the Resolute Desk to elaborate on his decision to leave the race and reiterated his support for his governing partner of nearly four years, saying she “is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.” The torch was passed, and now it is up to Harris to take it from here. The first hurdle to clear is reintroducing herself to the American people. Who is she and what does she believe? The campaign has responded so far by reaching back to her start in politics as a prosecutor who took on criminals and rapists, drawing a contrast with Republican nominee Donald Trump. She'll also most likely lean on her experience as vice president. From Day One of the transition, even before we got to the White House, Biden set the tone that his vice president would be in every meeting and she would get all the same materials he received. His directive was there would not be any “silos."" If for some reason we did not have something, all we had to do was ask. Just as President Barack Obama did with him, as their schedules allowed, they would have a private lunch weekly. Every day they were both at the White House, they would receive the Presidential Daily Briefing together. Biden set that tone and, in doing so, laid the groundwork for the surge of possibility and enthusiasm Democrats are experiencing.  Once in office, she was sometimes out of the spotlight, due to the nature of the vice presidency. Frankly, it’s a job few people pay attention to and that the mainstream media apparatus has not covered extensively. So people may be unfamiliar with Harris’ work as the chair of the president’s labor council or her work with the Small Business Administration to increase access to capital for small businesses, especially ones owned by people of color. They may not know her extensive foreign policy engagements with the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine or Central America.  More of them may have heard about her political work. It was the vice president’s emphasis on keeping the government from interfering with women’s bodily autonomy that helped lay the groundwork for the Democratic Party’s success in the 2022 midterms. Her laser focus on the root causes of migration — rather than focusing only on border enforcement, as Republicans tend to do — has helped envision a way to curb the crisis without obscuring the humanity of people braving untold peril in search of a better life. Even from the White House she’s set a record in Congress. As a result of the closely divided Senate, Harris has cast more tiebreaking votes than any of her predecessors. These votes were vital in getting some of the White House’s defining legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, over the finish line. It is a matter of historical fact that she has been one of the most consequential vice presidents the nation has ever seen. The second hurdle for her campaign is slightly more daunting. In order to win, Harris will have to claw back crucial base voters whom past Democratic nominees have been shedding in small but consequential numbers. Black women have been an indispensable voting bloc for the Democratic Party. While the vast majority still vote blue in every presidential election, their numbers have steadily waned since 2012. That year, Black women voted 96% for Obama, followed by 94% for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 90% for Biden in 2020, according to NBC News exit polls. We have seen similar drops among other key voting blocs. On paper, the percentage differences may seem small, but this is going to be a close race. Minor differences in these groups could make a difference in what will be a consequential election. The Harris campaign should treat base voters as persuadable. It is not a foregone conclusion that the diverse coalition of the Democratic Party will turn out simply because the candidate at the top of the ticket has been swapped out. When I worked for the vice president, she often stressed the importance of being straightforward and taking out the fluff. For example, instead of talking in general about the investments in small businesses, she would ask for specific numbers about how many small businesses in a particular state were affected and who they were. She was intentional about making sure people knew when they heard from her that she saw them and that the work spoke directly to them. That is one of Harris’ superpowers.  Beginning a successful presidential campaign roughly 100 days from the election is unheard of in modern American politics, but make no mistake, a lot of history can happen and a lot of odds can be beaten in that time. Allied troops in World War I began an offensive that would result in the end of the Great War 95 days later. In his first 100 days in office, Franklin D. Roosevelt laid the groundwork that would lift America out of the Great Depression. And if Democrats mobilize and America’s electorate turns out, the end of this 100 days could see history made with the first Black woman and woman of South Asian descent elected to the presidency and our democracy preserved once again.
