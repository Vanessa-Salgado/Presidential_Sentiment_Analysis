Trump lost his immunity battle — but won the war,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 7:35 AM PDT / Updated July 1, 2024, 10:08 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-immunity-ruling-alito-thomas-rcna158005,"After the Supreme Court rejected the full sweep of Donald Trump’s presidential immunity argument on Monday, we can say the former president lost the battle — but won the war. Conservative justices like Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas may not have let Trump off the hook by proclaiming him immune to all prosecution. But they tossed out portions of Jack Smith’s indictment and delayed the case as much as they could in the hope that Trump can avoid more guilty verdicts, get elected and carry out the un-American, authoritarian agenda they share, which includes packing the courts with even more MAGA judges.  That’s why Trump hailed the opinion as a “big win.” Fortunately there are steps that the lower courts and the American people can take to respond. To start, let’s look at how we got here. All six Republican-appointed justices reached the court with the backing of groups like the billionaire-funded Federalist Society. Trump’s three nominees for the court came from a list written by Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo. The conservative legal movement’s aim is no secret: to take us back to the America of the 1920s. They want to return to a country when the excesses of unregulated capitalism went unrestrained (before plunging the nation into the Great Depression), and systemic sexism and racism went uncontested. This plan has been in place for many years. Recently, however, the justices, foremost among them Alito and Thomas, have stopped trying at all to hide their participation. Witness, for example, Alito and Thomas’ refusal to recuse themselves from this case, even though the actions of both justices’ spouses clearly created an appearance of partiality. With this in mind, we need to divorce ourselves from the idea that the Supreme Court majority was undertaking a legitimate, nuanced internal legal argument over presidential immunity. They were not. Had that been the case, they would have decided this case in a timely fashion that would have allowed a trial in 2024. But their approach to this case was always about delay, delay, delay. It certainly wasn’t about the law. If the justices had genuine concerns about the nuances of presidential immunity, they had a chance to take the issue up in a timely manner in December, when special counsel Jack Smith presented them with the option. Taking up the issue then would have allowed the Supreme Court to make a decision in plenty of time for Trump’s Jan. 6 trial to start, and conclude, before this year’s presidential election. They refused. Only after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled against Trump’s claims of immunity in February did the Supreme Court decide to revisit the issue. They set the oral argument for April 25, making their intent even more obvious with a hearing at the very last sitting in the court’s term. And rather than issue a decision with all due speed, as has happened in other momentous cases like Bush v. Gore, not to mention the alacrity with which they rejected the challenge to Trump appearing on the Colorado ballot just a few months ago, they delayed a decision until the last possible day this term. That is no accident. It is a deliberate attempt by the MAGA justices to slow down the process and shield Trump from the repercussions of the criminal conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 election. Contrast the court’s timeline with what happened when Trump faced a jury of everyday Americans. In a trial that took less than two months, Trump faced 34 charges in a court of law and was convicted by a jury on every single one of them. When Americans are presented with evidence of Trump’s crimes, they are not fooled by his lies — they choose to hold him accountable. The MAGA justices have done everything in their power to prevent Trump from receiving another fair trial before the election, because the thing most capable of stopping Trump’s agenda has been the commitment of the American people to holding the former president accountable for his actions. Too many commentators on this case have been thinking about a battle while the Supreme Court has been focusing on the wider war. Presidential immunity isn’t the objective. Even the most pro-MAGA justices know that unlimited presidential immunity sets a terrible precedent. That is clear from the test they have promulgated, limiting such immunity — while making the completion of a 2024 trial an impossibility. Those justices are intent not on completely absolving Trump through an official ruling, but on creating the circumstances that will allow Trump to win the presidential election and make the whole Jan. 6 case against Trump moot. If they are successful, the nightmarish results that would follow were on stark display in the first presidential debate, such as Trump’s threat to weaponize the Justice Department against his political rivals. But there is still a path to stopping the pro-Trump agenda on the court now, before the former president and his allies can get their hooks into the White House for the second time. The Court has given Judge Chutkan the ability to hold an evidentiary hearing to apply its test.  That will allow her to rebut the presumption that Trump’s pressure campaign against Pence is entitled to immunity and also to decide whether Trump’s interactions with parties outside of the executive branch fall within the outer perimeter of official duties. She should do so expeditiously, demonstrating that his conduct was not shielded by the Constitution.  While that is no substitute for a full trial, it is better than nothing and will at least call attention to Trump’s propensity for breaking the law — a companion piece to the Manhattan conviction.  The ultimate recourse is now at the ballot box. As in 2018, 2020 and 2022, the antidote to the MAGA agenda is an American public that is animated by a need to preserve our laws, justice and values. We recognize that the stakes — and the risk — are even higher after the presidential debate, but also that ample time remains to make the case to the American people that accountability is up to them. If Trump loses, there is no obstacle to his being tried in this and the other remaining criminal cases. Justice is now ultimately in the hands of the voters."
"With immunity ruling, Supreme Court raises the stakes in 2024 race",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/immunity-ruling-supreme-court-raises-stakes-2024-race-rcna159781,"On May 19, 1977, millions of Americans tuned in to watch an installment of David Frost’s multipart interview with former President Richard Nixon. This was nearly three years after the Republican was forced to resign in disgrace, and public interest in Nixon and the Watergate scandal remained high. Viewers to the third part of the Frost/Nixon Q&A saw the former president deliver one of the most memorable political claims of the generation: “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” For nearly a half-century, Nixon’s claim has stood as a classic example of political and legal radicalism. In the United States, no one is above the law, and the idea that a president’s official actions, by definition, are legal — even when they’re not — represented obvious madness. Indeed, it’s not as if there was a spirited public conversation in 1977 about whether or not Nixon was correct. He plainly was not. The former president’s assertion, nearly five decades later, still seems shocking, dangerous, and in a rather literal sense, un-American. Alas, Republican Supreme Court justices have come to the conclusion that Nixon was onto to something. In a 6-3 ruling in Trump v. U.S. — an oddly fitting case name, given the circumstances — the high court’s dominant far-right majority concluded that some of Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat are immune from criminal prosecution. As my MSNBC colleague Jordan Rubin explained: It’s notable that the court’s GOP-appointed members chose to issue the decision the same week as the Fourth of July holiday — an occasion in which Americans have traditionally celebrated the time when we forcefully rejected the idea that we would be ruled by an unaccountable king. In terms of the practical implications, special counsel Jack Smith’s election-related case now returns to the district court, which as Rubin’s report explained, will begin trying to determine whether Trump’s alleged misconduct included official or unofficial acts, “which will likely add further delay to the case, making it even more unlikely to go to trial before the November election.” To put it mildly, few saw this coming. In fact, it was widely assumed that Trump would lose the case, but the defeat would be inconsequential because the Supreme Court ran out the clock, ensuring that the presumptive GOP nominee’s case wouldn’t go to trial before Election Day 2024. This, many observers assumed, was the real scandal. As regular readers might recall, it was easy to argue that the litigation was hardly a real case to begin with. Trump’s lawyers, desperate to delay the legal proceedings, appeared to concoct a bizarre legal claim as a transparent stalling tactic. To the extent that this ever was a legitimate question, it was answered emphatically by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued a unanimous ruling in February. “It would be a striking paradox if the president, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity,” the judges concluded, adding, “We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.” The D.C. Circuit went on to describe Trump’s position as “irrational,” adding that under the Republican’s preferred approach, presidents would be “free to commit all manner of crimes with impunity.” As hard as it is to believe, six sitting justices disagreed. “Today’s decision to grant former Presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the Presidency,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. “It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law. Relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about the need for ‘bold and unhesitating action’ by the President ... the Court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.” The progressive jurist added, “The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune. “Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority’s message today.” Sotomayor concluded, “Never in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law. Moving forward, however, all former Presidents will be cloaked in such immunity. If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop. With fear for our democracy, I dissent.” The stakes were already high in the 2024 presidential race. The Supreme Court just upped the ante: Donald Trump — a man who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions — learned today that he enjoys at least some immunity from prosecution, no matter how obvious his alleged crimes might be. What a terrifying day this is."

The hope, obviously, is to use West’s candidacy to help divide GOP opponents and swing the state back to Trump. * Last week, a barbershop in Atlanta hosted a roundtable discussion for the Trump campaign. Now, the owner of that shop is saying he feels “betrayed” by the Republicans who organized it, insisting that he didn’t realize it’d be a campaign event. * On a related note, Trump sparked a controversy on Thursday night with a reference to immigrants taking “Black jobs.” The former president doubled-down on the rhetoric soon after, despite the fact that no one seems to know what a “Black job” is."
Justices Sotomayor and Jackson fear for democracy in their dissents,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 8:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-immunity-dissents-sotomayor-jackson-rcna159771,"Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson raised serious questions about the future of democracy in their dissents to the high court's ruling on Donald Trump's immunity claims.

Writing for all three Democratic appointees, Sotomayor found fault with the majority's ruling that Trump is entitled to at least presumptive immunity for all ""official acts,"" including talking with the Justice Department or Vice President Mike Pence about his schemes: Later in the decision, Sotomayor outlined her view that the case essentially gave presidents immunity for all kinds of misconduct:Sotomayor ended her dissent by noting her ""fear"" for the future of democracy under this ruling: Supreme Court justices have previously drawn attention for dropping the word ""respectfully"" from ""I respectfully dissent"" as a closing statement, so the final sentence is particularly notable. In a separate dissent, Jackson added a few words of her own about the decision's ""paradigm shift"" for the powers of the presidency: She added that the decision means the Supreme Court will now be the final arbiter of whether a president has overstepped the bounds.

Why I joined other former military leaders in rejecting Trump’s immunity claim,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"April 25, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 1, 2024, 8:17 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-military-national-security-rcna147049,"UPDATE (July 1, 2024, 11:15 a.m. ET): On Monday morning, the Supreme Court ruled that on Trump’s presidential immunity claim, finding some of the former president’s alleged efforts to overturn the election are immune from criminal prosecution, and likely delayed a trial date in the federal election interference case. Imagine a large group of activists assembled outside the White House, peacefully protesting a recent decision by the president. They are waving signs denouncing the new policy, holding banners demanding change and chanting slogans about that president. As their numbers begin to swell, as their voices grow louder, the president issues an order to military commanders: Take them out. Our military leadership would then be faced with an impossible choice. They’d either have to follow the clearly unlawful order of their commander in chief, and commit crimes for which they could be prosecuted, or openly defy that order. This is not a far removed hypothetical, but a very real choice service members could face if the president of the United States is immune from criminal prosecution. It could become the reality for our men and women in uniform if the commander in chief is found not to be restrained by the law. These are the incredibly big, country-defining — possibly democracy-ending — stakes before the Supreme Court this week as it considers former President Donald Trump’s argument that he is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for any ""official acts."" The two bedrocks of the United States military are the principle of civilian control and the rule of law. Civilian control is enshrined in our Constitution and has guided us through centuries of conflict. The military does not operate outside our democratic system, but instead answers to our elected representatives and appointed civilian leaders. At the same time, the military and the civilians who control it have a duty to operate within the rule of law. These two principles function together because of trust. The military trusts that the orders they receive are lawful, and the president and the American people trust that the military will follow and obey the chain of command. Coupled with this is the military’s affirmative duty to disobey unlawful orders. If the president is above the law and can issue illegal orders at will and without accountability, then members of our military can be thrust into a nightmare scenario where they’re forced to choose between obeying an unlawful order or following their duty to disobey. Taking this one step further, how do service members throughout the chain of command respond if there is an order coming from the commander in chief demanding that they do something illegal and another coming from the top of the military leadership telling them to disobey? There would be chaos as each unit commander and each individual service member decided which to follow. This would inevitably destroy the United States military as a fighting force and as a defender of democracy. This threat to our military and national security is why I joined the amicus brief in Trump v. United States with 18 former service secretaries and retired four-star admirals and generals. I have served my country both in uniform and as a civilian leader, and I believe in the critical role the military plays in upholding our democracy. We cannot stay silent about the risks to our nation and our national security if the president is placed above the law. Such is a belief held by dictators, not democratically elected representatives. Notably, no other president or former president in our history has argued, as Trump has, that he must break the law to be effective. The signers of this amicus brief served in every presidential administration from President John F. Kennedy to Trump. All those in uniform served for decades and attained four stars, the highest military rank. Among them are former chiefs of staff for the Army and Air Force and a former commandant of the Marines, a combatant commander, fleet commanders, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, and myriad other posts at the very top of our military. Signers include former service secretaries from all the branches — Navy, Army and Air Force. Every signer has devoted much of their life to serving and defending our country and understands the profound risk to our military if a president is not held to the rule of law. One of the great strengths of our military, and one of the reasons it is held in such high esteem by Americans, is that it is not political. Our military and civilian leaders take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and not to any person, regardless of the office that person holds. Having a military loyal to a person or party is the antithesis of a democracy and the definition of a dictatorship.  The questions in this case are monumental yet clear: Will we continue to hold to the belief that no person is above the law? Will we continue to have the greatest military force of all time dedicated to preserving the very idea of this country as first laid out by the founders? Will we continue to be a beacon of democracy and hope for the world? Will we preserve the nearly 2 1/2-century-old democracy that was bought and defended by blood, brought through fiery trials and bequeathed to us? As President Abraham Lincoln articulated in his second inaugural address, “fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray” that all the answers are yes."
"Why Dems, for now, are keeping their powder dry on Biden’s future",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 7:55 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/dems-now-are-keeping-powder-dry-bidens-future-rcna159745,"If it were up to many of the nation’s leading political pundits, President Joe Biden would be spending the day working on the details of his retirement plan. I started putting together a list over the weekend of the prominent media voices calling on the incumbent Democrat to pass the torch, but I eventually gave up — because it was difficult to keep up with the deluge. The editorial board of The New York Times was arguably the most prominent voice to urge Biden to stand down, and the editorial board of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution soon followed with a front-page argument of its own. The Atlantic published a half-dozen pieces in the aftermath of last week’s debate calling on Biden to end his candidacy. They were joined by Thomas Friedman, Paul Krugman, Maureen Dowd, David Remnick, David Ignatius, and many, many others. Complicating matters, anxiety among many leading Democratic donors has reached the point at which some aren’t just looking for alternatives to the incumbent, some are also looking for refunds. There’s no reason to assume that this chatter will end anytime soon. Indeed, once this conversation starts, it’s hard to make it stop. It’s reminiscent of the point in presidential primaries when candidates start facing questions — at every appearance and in every interview — about what it’d take for them to exit the race. The lines of inquiry themselves signal to voters that these candidates have bleak futures. Every hour that Team Biden spends trying to reassure party officials, insiders, donors, voters, and pundits that his re-election plans remain on track is another hour in which it’s not making a case against Trump, drawing attention to the incumbent Democrat’s accomplishments, and presenting a vision for the future. And yet, the grand total of Democratic officials — in the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and gubernatorial offices nationwide — who’ve publicly called on Biden to step aside is zero. The Washington Post reported that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries “has told his worried members to hold their fire for a few days to see how things shake out,” and to date, they have. This is no small detail: The more Biden can keep leading Democratic officials on his side, the more he can focus on the general election. If those officials turned on him, the political challenge would go from bad to worse. So, perhaps the president can breathe a little easier, satisfied that officials from his own party haven’t called for him to step aside? It’s not quite that simple. NBC News reported on an important interview: “We’re having a serious conversation about what to do,” the Maryland Democrat told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi. Raskin, an influential voice in Democratic politics, added, “One thing I can tell you is that regardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified. ... Whether he’s the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention. He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward and beat the forces of authoritarianism and reaction in the country.” These were not the words of a congressman who believes the underlying question has been resolved. So what should the public expect from this serious intra-party conversation? As unsatisfying as this seems, polling will likely have an enormous impact. If, for example, surveys in the coming days show a relatively unchanged race, Biden and his political operation will find it far easier to address Democratic anxieties. If, on the other hand, polls from the near future show Trump’s advantage reaching new heights, that will lead to a qualitatively different Democratic discussion. Remember, for Democrats, there is nothing but affection for Biden. Those who want to see him replaced on the ticket don’t do so because they dislike or disapprove of him; they’re motivated solely by electoral considerations. If the president isn’t going to win in November, the argument goes, then he’ll need to step aside. The Democratic conversation will almost certainly be data-driven, and to the frustration of the impatient, that data is not yet available."
Why Biden and Trump are facing asymmetric post-debate pressures,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 6:21 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/biden-trump-are-facing-asymmetric-post-debate-pressures-rcna159730,"It would be an overstatement to argue that no prominent voices have urged Donald Trump to end his 2024 campaign. The editorial board of The Philadelphia Inquirer, for example, made a compelling case over the weekend that the former president should drop out of the race. After the Republican’s criminal conviction in May, The Washington Monthly published a similarly persuasive piece. But by any fair measure, those are the exceptions that prove the rule. In the wake of last week’s debate, incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden has faced, and continues to face, intense pressure to end his candidacy and pass the torch. His GOP rival is confronting nothing comparable. It’s worth asking why. In fact, attorney Luppe Luppen (known online as “southpaw”) summarized the dynamic this way the morning after the debate: I think there’s real merit to the observation, though the explanation for the asymmetry isn’t immediately obvious. Part of this is likely the result of pragmatism: Those hoping to persuade Biden to forgo his re-election bid appear to believe, sincerely, that he might listen to their arguments. Love him or hate him, the Democratic incumbent is a reasonable, patriotic leader, open to hearing people out. Those making the case that the president should stand down are working from the assumption that their pleas might very well have a meaningful impact. Few bother to make a comparable case to Trump, regardless of merit, because they know full well that he’d never listen to their arguments. Love him or hate him, the presumptive Republican nominee is neither a reasonable nor patriotic leader, and when confronted by those who tell him what he doesn’t want to hear, he makes up conversations in his imagination to soothe his fragile ego. Those who might be inclined to argue that Trump should stand down tend not to bother — because they know their arguments wouldn’t have any kind of impact whatsoever. But there’s another dimension to this. By and large, Biden’s admirers aren’t urging him to step aside because they’ve turned on him; they’re pressing him because they assume others will turn on him, making it more likely that Trump will prevail and put the future of the American experiment in severe jeopardy. It’s not about animus; it’s about an electoral calculation. If the Democratic incumbent is likely to lose public support, the argument goes, then he has a responsibility — to his country, to the world, to the future — to stand down in the hopes of keeping a dangerous, felonious, and undemocratic madman from reentering the White House. Trump’s admirers, meanwhile, see no need to urge him to step aside because they assume his crimes and many scandals will prove inconsequential: Some voters won’t know the truth about the presumptive GOP nominee; others won’t care; and others still will be conned into believing a counternarrative about everything being “rigged.” There was no palpable panic in Republican circles — even after he was convicted of 34 felonies, even after a jury held him liable for sexual assault, even after his business was found guilty of fraud, even after he was indicted for trying to overturn an election defeat without cause, even after he participated in a debate and was caught lying repeatedly about matters large and small — because they’ve long assumed, and continue to assume, that the facts are irrelevant. Much of the public — which is to say, enough of the public — can be convinced to believe what the party tells them to believe. Biden’s backers fear voters will turn on him; Trump’s backers are confident they won’t."
"Eyeing the 2024 ticket, Burgum joins the GOP’s race to the bottom",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/eyeing-2024-ticket-burgum-joins-gops-race-bottom-rcna159720,"Partway through his latest “Meet the Press” appearance, Gov. Doug Burgum tried to impress one viewer in particular with a bizarre claim. “Donald Trump, at the end of his term on January 20th, left the White House,” the North Dakota Republican claimed. “We had a smooth transition.” We did not have a smooth transition. Soon after, in the same interview, NBC News’ Kristen Welker noted that the former president spent much of last week’s debate brazenly lying. “As someone who is on Donald Trump’s short list to be his vice presidential nominee, do you think he should stop saying things that are not true?” the host asked. “[E]verything that he said on Thursday night, he’s been saying before,” the governor replied. “So this is not news.” It’s a defense rooted in the idea that deliberately deceiving the public is acceptable, just so long as the politician peddling the lies repeats the same false claims more than once. But perhaps most importantly, Welker asked Burgum whether he’ll accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. The guest said he would — just so long as Burgum considers the race to be “free and fair.” As regular readers know, those eager to become Trump’s running mate have come to an unfortunate conclusion: They almost certainly won’t make the Republican ticket if they say categorically that they’ll accept the 2024 election results. After all, the former president is refusing to commit to honoring the results — the same posture he adopted four years ago — so the GOP’s prospective vice presidents are sticking to the same script. Months ago, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik helped get the ball rolling, refusing to say whether she’d vote to certify the results of the 2024 election. More recently, Sen. Tim Scott appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where host Kristen Welker repeatedly pressed the South Carolinian to simply say, “yes or no,” whether he was prepared to accept the results of the upcoming presidential election. Scott refused. In May, Sen. J.D. Vance told CNN that he “plans“ to accept the election results, but only if they meet the Ohio Republican’s undefined standards, and soon after, Sen. Marco Rubio dodged the question entirely. Burgum appears to have joined an unfortunate club, no doubt aware of the fact that his national ambitions would come to an immediate halt if he failed to toe the line. As we’ve discussed, in the not-too-distant past, prominent American politicians were not asked whether they were prepared to accept their own country’s election results. The line of inquiry seemed wholly unnecessary: Our political system was stable and healthy enough to make the answer to such a question obvious. But as the radicalization of Republican politics intensifies, leading officials from the party aren’t just confronting the question, they’re also struggling to answer it. Indeed, at least so far, among the top contenders for the GOP’s 2024 ticket, none has simply replied, “Yes, win or lose, I’ll accept the results.” As for the “free and fair” phrasing, this continues to look like a rather clumsy shell game. Burgum likely knows all of this. He stuck to the partisan script anyway. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"‘Team of Felons’: Out of options, Steve Bannon reports to prison",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-felons-options-steve-bannon-reports-prison-rcna159718,"UPDATE (July 1, 2024, 1:01 p.m. ET): Shortly after this post was published, Steve Bannon did, in fact, report to prison. Two years ago this month, a jury in the nation’s capital found Steve Bannon guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress. In the 24 months that followed, the right-wing operative/podcaster explored every possible legal avenue in the hopes of avoiding incarceration. But when the Supreme Court rejected his last-minute bid late last week, Bannon ran out of options. The Associated Press reported overnight: It was way back in September 2021 when the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack first sent Bannon a subpoena. Even at the time, the seriousness was obvious: The podcaster was told that this was a legal summons — not a suggestion — and that failure to comply opened the door to meaningful legal consequences. Bannon nevertheless refused to cooperate. The House then approved a resolution finding the GOP operative in contempt of Congress and referred the matter to the Justice Department, which indicted the former White House strategist. A jury later convicted Bannon — his lawyers struggled to present much of a defense — ultimately leading to his prison sentence, which was imposed by a Trump-appointed judge. Congressional Republicans launched an 11th-hour bid to rescue him from legal accountability, but it proved inconsequential. It’s against this backdrop that a recent memorable quote comes to mind. “With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told USA Today in May. “With Trump, you have a team of felons.” In fact, now seems like a good time to update the big list. And did I mention that former president’s business was itself found guilty of tax fraud? Because it was. This does not include the fact that a jury held Trump liable for sexual abuse in a civil case. It also doesn’t include the fake electors who’ve been charged in jurisdictions across the country, or the Republican National Committee’s “election integrity” lawyer, who was recently indicted on election-related crimes. To be sure, some of the aforementioned men were ultimately pardoned by Trump, who doled out pardons as if they were party favors before exiting the Oval Office, but this doesn’t change the scope of the broader picture. The number of people in the Republican’s orbit who’ve been convicted of crimes in recent years is so great, The Washington Post once described it as the “remarkable universe of criminality” surrounding the former president. That was five years ago. It’s even more remarkable now. This post updates our related earlier coverage."

Biden couldn’t fight history at the first debate,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 1, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-debate-trump-obama-clinton-rcna159511,"There’s one word that best describes Democrats’ reaction to President Joe Biden’s performance in Thursday’s debate: panic. His faltering appearance alongside former President Donald Trump has been enough to prompt calls for his swift exit from the race in favor of another candidate. It wasn’t ideal, to put it mildly — but looking back at recent history, Biden’s poor showing was hardly unprecedented. As the incumbent, the one who’s fighting to keep the job, most sitting presidents are inherently on the defensive. It’s their records over the last four years that are in the spotlight, and they are the ones making pitches to have another chance to maintain the status quo. Challengers, on the other hand, get to go on the offensive from the jump, putting their opponents on the back foot. Biden had hoped to break that trend, as NBC News reported before the debate — which clearly didn’t go according to plan. Meanwhile, it feels absurd to consider Trump as the change candidate in this race, given that the candidates’ roles were reversed just four years ago, with him in office and Biden the one offering a return to normalcy. But Trump has benefited from the strange form of public amnesia that the intervening period has engendered, as the immediacy of Biden’s administration is foremost in voters’ minds over the chaos of his. This may be part of the reason Biden’s attempts to call out his predecessor’s record fell flat Thursday, though his scattershot delivery certainly didn’t help. Biden and his aides can take cold comfort in the fact that his former boss, President Barack Obama, didn’t fare much better during his first debate outing as an incumbent. Obama tanked hard during his first debate against GOP nominee Mitt Romney, coming across as hyper-aloof and professorial, more focused on wonking out over his record than on contrasting himself with the challenger. Romney, on the other hand, had toned down his “severe conservative” persona from the primaries and came across as more affable compared to the stern and lecturing Obama. The last two Republican incumbents faced their own difficulties when they took the debate stage. As I noted last week, Trump was a hot mess during his September 2020 showdown with Biden, seeming to spend as much time fighting with the moderator as actually engaging with the former vice president. Former President George W. Bush didn’t flame out spectacularly in 2004 against Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. But Kerry was said to have won the debate by a 2-to-1 ratio among viewers, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Biden’s camp could also look to President Ronald Reagan’s trainwreck debate in 1984. Reagan, then the oldest sitting president in history, had been faring much better in the polls than his rival, Democrat Walter Mondale, throughout the campaign. But when the two of them faced off in their first debate, Reagan was woefully unprepared and rambling and occasionally appeared confused onstage. The performance set off a flurry of questions about whether he was too old to hold the presidency and triggered a 7-point drop in the polls. It was deeply ironic, considering how severely Reagan had trounced Democratic President Jimmy Carter four years earlier. Carter had refused to take part in the earlier of the two planned debates, as it would have included Rep. John Anderson, R-Ill., who was running as an independent. The decision left Carter only one chance to defend himself and his administration with only a week before Election Day. The chance evaporated when Reagan delivered his now-iconic closing statement, asking Americans to consider “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Reagan’s successor, President George H.W. Bush, didn’t fare much better than Carter, despite having more bites at the apple. He shared the stage in October 1992 with Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton and eccentric billionaire Ross Perot, whose third-party candidacy was pulling a rare amount of attention and support. And while Bush had no major flubs, a CNN/USA Today poll conducted over the next few days found that only 16% of respondents thought the incumbent was the winner. (Notably, it was in the second debate, the first to use the now-familiar town hall format, where Clinton really shone — and Bush famously was caught on camera checking his watch). Clinton was the rare exception to this trend in the first 1996 debate against former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. The incumbent easily handled his challenger, offering up a defense of his record while still managing to land attacks of his own against the former Senate GOP leader. It definitely helped that Dole refused to focus on the “character issues” that the president would spend the next several years combatting. Even that performance from Clinton “was not his finest moment by any stretch of the imagination,” Alan Schroeder, a presidential debate historian, told NBC News. It still left Clinton in a good position to offer advice to the shaken Obama camp after the train wreck against Romney in 2012. “No one’s ever won the second debate by winning the first,” Clinton said at a fundraiser between the two debates, former aide Jon Favreau later recounted. It was clear that his team listened, delivering a pair of follow-up performances that helped enable Obama’s landslide electoral victory in November. It’s worth remembering that Reagan, Bush and even Trump also managed to make adjustments and hold their own much better in subsequent debates. Unlike his predecessors, Biden has a lot longer to recover from the missteps of last week. The next debate between the two candidates is months away instead of the usual weeks (or even days), which one imagines would be plenty of time to course-correct if it's a matter of preparedness at issue. It’s going to be up to his team this summer to draw what lessons it can from history in hopes of tacking more toward Reagan, who managed to turn his age from a point of weakness into an all-timer laugh line, and away from Carter when Biden and Trump meet again this September."
