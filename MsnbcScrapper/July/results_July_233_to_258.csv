Speaker Mike Johnson has an unfortunate fondness for ‘intuition’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 10:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/speaker-mike-johnson-unfortunate-fondness-intuition-rcna162752,"As part of Fox Business’ coverage of the Republican National Convention, Maria Bartiromo sat down with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who claimed that officials believe there are now “terrorist cells set up around the country.” Not surprisingly, the host asked how many. “I don’t know,” the Louisiana Republican replied. “It’d be conjecture on my part, but intuitively we know that this is a serious problem.” This made far less sense than Congress’ top Republican official seemed to realize. First, he doesn’t need to speculate: As the House speaker, Johnson receives briefings on sensitive, highly classified security information. If he’s learned about “terrorist cells set up around the country,” he could speak to the problem with authority. Instead, the GOP leader decided it’d be responsible simply to speculate on national television about a terrorist threat based on what people “intuitively” know. Second, information about terrorist cells is not something that people can “intuitively” know. It simply falls outside of what “intuition” means: No one has instincts about the existence of terrorists forming groups and/or networks on domestic soil. People in positions of power either have seen evidence or they haven’t. It's not the sort of thing someone can know by way of a gut feeling. But as relevant as these details are, there’s a larger problem: Johnson's reference to what is “intuitively” known is part of an unfortunate pattern. After Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat, for example, Johnson insisted that “a lot of us know intuitively” that there were problems with the process. After the Senate rejected the House’s impeachment effort against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Johnson said “know already intuitively” that Mayorkas “had a fantastical breach of duty.” When the House speaker unveiled legislation to ban non-citizens from voting — which is already illegal, and which effectively never happens — Johnson declared at a press conference, “We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections.” What we’re dealing with is a Republican leader who appears to rely on “intuition” a bit too much. Time and again, Johnson lacks the evidence to support his beliefs, so he references “intuition” as if it were a legitimate substitute for knowledge. It’s not."
"Barron Trump, initially expected at the RNC, was nowhere to be seen",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 10:41 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/barron-trump-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162711,"The Trump family, dressed in red, white and blue, showed up in force on the last night of the Republican National Convention on Thursday. But as Donald Trump delivered what would be the longest-ever convention acceptance speech, one person conspicuously missing at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee was his youngest son, Barron Trump. ""We love our Barron,"" Trump said in his speech. But the 18-year-old did not join his father and siblings as they walked onto the convention floor during the event, nor was he seen with his mother, Melania Trump, who entered the VIP box by herself to applause. He was also absent when the family took the stage after the speech. The youngest Trump son attended the RNC in 2016 and 2020. NBC News reported in May that he had been included as an at-large delegate by the Florida Republican Party, but two days later, he declined the role through his mother's office. “While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines due to prior commitments,” Melania Trump said in the statement. Barron Trump, who graduated from high school this year, did recently feature at one of his dad's campaign events. At a rally in Florida earlier this month, Trump introduced his youngest son to supporters. ""You're pretty popular,"" Trump told him as the crowd cheered. With Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump looking on, he added: ""He might be more popular than Don and Eric."""
How Clarence Thomas and Aileen Cannon may help Hunter Biden,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 10:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/hunter-biden-aileen-cannon-clarence-thomas-rcna162689,"U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon broke new ground this week when she dismissed Donald Trump’s classified documents case on the rationale that special counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed. Now, Hunter Biden wants the same treatment for his criminal cases brought by another special counsel, David Weiss. Biden’s success is far from guaranteed, partly because Trump’s ultimate success isn’t guaranteed. Cannon’s trial-level ruling only applies to Trump’s case, and if she’s reversed on appeal then it won’t even affect Trump’s case. Smith is challenging Cannon’s ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and whichever side loses in the appeals court is likely to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case. A Supreme Court ruling could set a nationwide standard applying to both defendants. At least one justice, Clarence Thomas, is poised to agree with Cannon if the Supreme Court rules on the issue. In the Trump immunity case earlier this month, Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion that questioned the lawfulness of Smith’s appointment. Cannon cited Thomas’ concurrence to support her dismissal of the classified documents case on Monday. No other justice joined Thomas’ concurrence, but Smith’s appointment wasn’t at issue in the immunity case, so we don’t know what a majority of the court would do if the appointment issue were squarely presented. That is, just because Thomas was the only one to raise it in the immunity case doesn’t mean that the Supreme Court would therefore side with Smith 8-1 on the appointment issue. Like Cannon’s trial-level ruling, Thomas’ solo concurrence isn’t binding. But as a Supreme Court justice, his view will ultimately be more important than Cannon’s for the legality of special counsels generally. There are also distinctions between Smith and Weiss that could lead to different outcomes for Trump and Biden. One of the defense criticisms of Smith is that he wasn’t appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Weiss was. That distinction doesn’t necessarily end the analysis, however, because the issue that Cannon and Thomas raised goes to the heart of Attorney General Merrick Garland’s statutory authority (or lack thereof) to appoint special counsels. That could doom Weiss as well as Smith if a Supreme Court majority heeds Cannon’s and Thomas’ view.   Biden’s lawyers make that point in their motion to dismiss on Thursday, writing that Garland “relied upon the exact same authority to appoint the Special Counsel in both the Trump and Biden matters, and both appointments are invalid for the same reason.” He was found guilty of gun-related charges last month in Delaware and hasn’t been sentenced yet. He also faces separate tax charges brought by Weiss in California and his lawyers have raised the appointment issue there in an effort to get those charges dismissed, too. It may take a while before the final impact, if any, of Cannon’s and Thomas’ opinions are fully realized in the Trump and Biden cases. Weiss will respond before trial judges rule in Delaware and California. Both of those federal trial courts fall under different federal circuits from one another and from the 11th Circuit, which covers Florida and will review Cannon’s ruling. Whatever happens in the lower courts, the Supreme Court may have the last word — and while we don’t know what that last word would be, a Trump win wouldn’t necessarily be a win for the president’s son.

The Republican National Convention offered Russia a lot to like,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 9:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-national-convention-offered-russia-lot-rcna162728,"Shortly before last month’s presidential debate, NBC News reported on a network of pro-Kremlin social media accounts that were “attempting to spread false narratives” to help Donald Trump. The Wall Street Journal added soon after that Vladimir Putin’s government has launched a “whole of government” effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and return the Republican to power. As recently as last weekend, as my MSNBC colleague Ja’han Jones noted, the Kremlin rushed to echo far-right talking points in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt, suggesting that Democrats bore responsibility for the gunman. And then the Republican National Convention got underway, at which point the public was reminded why Russia is so eager to help the party win. On the opening night of the convention, for example, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene delivered remarks condemning Democrats for a bipartisan bill intended to “secure Ukraine’s borders.” Also on Monday night, tech investor David Sacks delivered remarks and insisted that Biden “provoked — yes, provoked — the Russians to invade Ukraine with talk of NATO expansion.” Trump then tapped Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — one of Congress’ fiercest opponents of U.S. security aid to Ukraine — for the party’s ticket, which was a move that drew praise from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. As the convention neared its end, attendees heard from far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, who also took the opportunity to push a message that was likely well received in Moscow. As NBC News reported: “We know where the drugs are coming from. We know the supply routes,” Carlson declared from the stage. “You don’t see our commander in chief suggesting that we use our military to protect our country or the lives of its citizens? No, that’s for Ukraine. And it’s too much. Actually, it’s too insulting. It’s too insulting. It’s a middle finger in the face of every American. It’s a very clear statement which is unmistakable, and that is ‘we don’t care about you.’” Soon after, Trump, a benefactor of Russia’s earlier electoral assistance, accepted his party’s presidential nomination. It stands to reason that Putin was pleased with how things went in Milwaukee this week."

Jared Huffman, Marc Veasey, Chuy Garcia and Mark Pocan — joined the list of members calling on President Joe Biden to leave the race, writing that he should “pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.” Veasey is of particular interest because he’s the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to ask the incumbent to forgo his re-election plans. * Soon after, Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico became the third sitting Democratic senator to publicly call on Biden to suspend his campaign. * That said, the news for Biden isn’t all bad: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ political action committee has officially endorsed his candidacy. * The latest national CBS News/YouGov poll, conducted after Saturday’s assassination attempt on Donald Trump, found the former president leading Biden by 5 points among likely voters.

'Twisters' doesn't mention climate change. That's just the first problem.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 8:48 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/twisters-review-climate-change-missing-storm-sequel-rcna162322,"The new movie ""Twisters"" finally provides an answer to the age-old joke about how everyone talks about the weather but nobody ever does anything about it. While the storm chasers of the 1996 original drove after tornadoes in order to study them, the reboot ups the stakes: stronger storms — including one filled with columns of fire — and heroes who have a so-crazy-it-just-might-work plan to stop them. It makes for a fun two hours, but it leaves us a little worse off when we leave the theater. The first problem starts with those stronger storms, which one character laments are ""getting worse every year"" and an actual Oklahoma TV meteorologist describes in a cameo as a ""once-in-a-generation tornado outbreak."" That's a phrase that may already need to be retired, as we have seen ""once-in-a-generation"" winter storms, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts and windstorms in recent years amid signs that these won't be one-off events. The most likely cause is two words you won't hear in the movie: climate change. Now, to be clear, scientists remain uncertain of the links between climate change and tornadoes. As climate scientists Hope Jahren and Kerry Emanuel explained to me, we know that large outbreaks of tornadoes and off-season tornadoes are increasing but not why, and there is much less certainty than there is with the links between climate change and hurricanes, for example. That's how science works. But in the real world, one of these characters might, you know, mention it as a possibility? Especially when the mother of one of the heroes says storms and floods are becoming more common and wheat and seed are getting more expensive. Not to be a backseat screenwriter here, but maybe two characters could argue about it briefly? And then kiss? I dunno. This summer movie stuff doesn't seem that hard. In case you think I'm imagining things, director Lee Isaac Chung has made it clear that it was a deliberate choice not to mention climate change. “I wanted to make sure that we are never creating a feeling that we’re preaching a message, because that’s certainly not what I think cinema should be about,” he told CNN. “I think it should be a reflection of the world.” Look, if I'd just been handed $200 million to make a summer movie, I'd be pretty cautious about not offending anyone, too, and no one likes a preachy blockbuster, especially on a subject that so many politicians insist isn't a real problem. We're not expecting Hollywood to make a fictionalized version of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" here. Tornadoes bad; pickup trucks good. We get it. But a moment of introspection wouldn't kill the movie, either. Even if viewers make the connection themselves, the movie fails in a second and more crucial way. (Spoiler ahead, but I promise it's not about any part of the movie you'll care about.) The film's heroine, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, is a scientist who has developed a Mark Rober-like machine that can shrink tornadoes by filling them with tiny balls of superabsorbent polymer. Her plan fails, and she retreats to the relative safety of New York City until she gets a second chance with a tornado-chasing social media influencer, played by Glen Powell, and uses rockets filled with silver iodide to precipitate the moisture first and save the day. You've seen this plot point before: Check the alluvial dampers! Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow! Cross the proton streams! Scan the quantum fissure using a subspace differential pulse! Again, I get it. You've written the heroes of your $200 million summer blockbuster into a corner, and you need some kind of deus ex machina to save the day. They can't just drive their pickup next to a supercell tornado and post YouTube videos about it while innocent Oklahomans die all around them. The problem is that this kind of magical thinking has infected how we approach climate change in the real world, too. Sure, we could reduce greenhouse gases by building more solar and wind power, subsidizing electric cars and e-bikes, improving mass transit, stopping deforestation and planting more trees, improving agricultural techniques or adding a price to carbon and letting the market sort it out. But what if, instead, some people suggest, we put a giant solar shade in outer space? Or dump tons of iron dust into the ocean? Or build a machine that vacuums carbon out of the atmosphere? Or paint all the rooftops white? Or even an entire mountain? Or spray sulfur dioxide particles into the stratosphere? Or throw a bunch of tiny glass beads on the ice caps? Or just build machines to create more ice? I'm not saying these ideas wouldn't work or that we shouldn't study them. But too often they seem to be proposed as a shortcut to doing the hard work to slow climate change, an Ozempic for the Earth. And that's ultimately the problem with ""Twisters,"" a movie that says tornadoes are getting worse without ever naming a possible cause and presents as its only solution a bunch of technobabble. Maybe we were better off when all the movie characters did was talk about the weather."
"After shooting, Team Trump keeps medical care info under wraps",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 8:23 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/shooting-team-trump-keeps-medical-care-info-wraps-rcna162705,"When the White House announced on Wednesday that President Joe Biden had tested positive for Covid, his team issued a written statement noting his symptoms and self-isolation plans. It was accompanied by a message from the Democrat’s physician describing Biden’s condition in more detail, including information about the president’s respiratory rate, temperature and pulse oximetry. A day later, the White House issued another letter from Biden’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, with updated information about the president’s symptoms, condition and treatment plan, as well as assurances about additional updates. This is, of course, precisely what one would expect from an operation that believes transparency, especially about health matters, is important. It also stands in contrast to Biden’s Republican rival. The Associated Press reported: The AP’s report quoted Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at The George Washington University, saying, “It’s an understatement to say that it’s bizarre that a presidential candidate has sustained an injury from an attempted assassination and no medical report is issued to describe his evaluation and the extent of his injury.” I’m mindful of the fact that there are plenty of conspiracy theories surrounding Saturday’s shooting, none of which have been substantiated with any credible evidence. One need not take those theories seriously, however, to wonder why Team Trump has been reluctant to share basic medical information about such a serious matter. Recent history doesn’t help matters. The Republican, for example, has long adopted a rather untraditional approach to sharing information about his medical exams. Indeed, it started before he took office. As regular readers may recall, in late 2015, during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Team Trump released an unintentionally hilarious, four-paragraph letter from the late Dr. Harold Bornstein, asserting that Trump’s “physical strength and stamina are extraordinary” and his lab tests results were “astonishingly excellent.” The doctor added at the time, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” We learned several months later that Bornstein wrote the letter in five minutes while a limo, dispatched by Trump, waited for the document. In the years that followed, disclosures did not improve. Last fall, Trump released the first updated report on his health in more than three years, but it came by way of a statement issued by one of his golf club customers, and it omitted basic details such as his blood pressure and medications. It’s against this backdrop that Team Trump also hasn’t provided the public with information about the Republican nominee’s medical care in the wake of Saturday’s shooting. There might be a benign explanation for this lack of transparency, but for now, I have no idea what it is."
Democratic effort to nudge Biden off ticket appears to gain momentum,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 7:43 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democratic-effort-nudge-biden-ticket-appears-gain-momentum-rcna162699,"A couple of days ago, the public saw multiple reports about Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — Congress’ top two Democrats — having taken steps to encourage President Joe Biden to forgo his re-election plans. There was related reporting that House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi has also privately told Biden “that she and other Democratic lawmakers worry that he’s dragging down the party.” A day later, however, the reports were considerably worse for the incumbent president. The Washington Post, for example, reported that Barack Obama has “told allies in recent days that President Biden’s path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy.” The public also learned about a letter Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin sent to the president, suggesting he step aside. The Post also reported that Pelosi has told some House Democrats she believes Biden “can be persuaded fairly soon to exit the presidential race amid serious doubts he can win in November,” which dovetailed with a New York Times report that said several people close to the president said that they believe “he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race.” Unfortunately for the incumbent, there’s more. Bloomberg News reported that some members of Biden’s White House Cabinet have also had “private discussions among themselves” about whether to “reckon with him” about his electoral future. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the number of Democratic members calling on the president to pass the torch keeps growing — in both chambers — and even the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been unyielding in its support for Biden, acknowledged that “things are fluid.” In case this weren’t quite enough, The Wall Street Journal highlighted a polling report from Blue Rose Research, a Democratic firm, which found Biden losing every battleground state, and struggling in New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia, Maine, and even New Jersey — states he won with ease four years ago. And yet, despite all of this, as the day came to an end, the Biden campaign sent out talking points that read in part, “The president is his party’s nominee. ... He’s running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.” Technically, that wasn’t true — the party’s nominee will be chosen at the convention, which is still weeks away — but the statement nevertheless indicated Team Biden isn’t prepared to look for an offramp, at least not yet. It was against this backdrop that NBC News reported that Biden “feels personally hurt and betrayed by the way so many Democrats, including some of the party’s top leaders, have left him hung out to dry.” The same report quoted a source close to the president who appeared eager to lash out at Democratic leaders. As much as I can appreciate Team Biden's frustrations, as a rule, when campaigns are behind, and the team reaches an everyone-is-wrong-except-us stage, that’s not great. Complicating matters, when a Democratic incumbent’s political operation is lashing out at Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer — blaming them for Trump — that’s not great, either. And finally, when Biden demands to see polling evidence that he’s losing, only to have his team say that “polls are BS” when the data says he's losing, that’s also not great."
"At Republican convention, Tucker Carlson completes transformation",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 6:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republican-convention-tucker-carlson-completes-transformation-rcna162691,"We don’t need to wonder what Tucker Carlson genuinely believed about Donald Trump after the Republican’s 2020 defeat because we already know. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem noted last year, the since-settled Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News produced a treasure trove of communications from the network’s hosts, including candid messages from Carlson that his viewers weren’t aware of in real time. In early January 2021, for example, Carlson texted, “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait.” He added soon after, “I hate him passionately,” and he confessed that he “can’t handle much more of this.” This came on the heels of Carlson telling a colleague, in reference to Trump, “What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that.” The former Fox host went on to say that he found it “disgusting” how many Americans believe Trump’s rhetoric. Reflecting on Trump’s failed term, Carlson also wrote, “We’re all pretending we’ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it’s been is too tough to digest. ... But come on. There isn’t really an upside to Trump.” That was three and a half years ago. A lot has changed since. In fact, Carlson has not only taken his shtick online, he’s also managed to position himself as an influential ally to the Republican he hated “passionately.” It was Carlson who helped Trump choose his running mate. It was Carlson who seemed to be having a grand time at the Republican convention. And as a New York Times report noted, it was Carlson who made a return to prime time with remarks at the Republican National Convention. To be sure, more than a few prominent Republican voices have made the transition from Trump critic to Trump sycophant. In fact, I’m aware of only one current member of the U.S. Senate who has characterized Trump as “America’s Hitler,” and the former president just tapped him as his running mate. Has Carlson experienced a genuine change of heart, or is he opportunistically sailing on the prevailing winds in Republican Party politics? Only the right-wing host knows for sure, though his 2021 messages seem to offer a hint. Either way, however, a HuffPost report raised a point that stood out for me. We don’t know who the president will be next year, but if it’s Trump, it’s safe to say Carlson will have walk-in privileges in the Oval Office, his 2021 assessments notwithstanding."
Trump's speech veered from somber to maudlin to unhinged,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 6:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-rnc-acceptance-speech-tone-rcna162414,"On Thursday night, my party bent the knee and enthusiastically nominated a man convicted of numerous felonies for president of the United States. In a Milwaukee convention hall full of activists and party loyalists whom I have known for years, there were also election deniers, organizers of the fake electors scheme and active participants in the insurrection against our nation on Jan. 6. Then, in that most poignant of moments when a political party says “here is the best among us that we have to offer for service to our nation,” Donald J. Trump accepted his third Republican presidential nomination. From the opening of his acceptance speech, Trump appeared to be deliberately somber, not leaning into the fiery affect that he so often uses at his rallies. This version of Trump was just weird. He still can’t read a teleprompter properly, even as he launched into an account of the attempt on his life last weekend.  Now, I’m not going to begrudge a man from sharing his thoughts about a brush with death, and certainly many in the audience appeared visibly moved by it. But by the time he decided to kiss the helmet of former volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore, the whole scene was just a little too maudlin and unserious. It was also a weird bit of stagecraft considering that Trump took three days to call Comperatore’s widow. Once we were past the emotional part of the program, it did not take long for Trump to return to form, offering his usual diatribe of lies and exaggerations about cities flooded with crime and inflation spiraling out of control. But of all the untrue things he said, perhaps the biggest was when he claimed “this movement has never been about me.” It’s only ever been about him, and he has spoon-fed Republicans so much of himself that it’s now all they want, no matter how incoherent or offensive it may be. On Thursday night, the Party of Lincoln finally solidified itself as the Party of Trump. And it wasn’t even his speech that did it. It happened the moment he accepted the nomination.

Meet the new Donald Trump; he’s the same as the old Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 6:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/meet-new-donald-trump-convention-speech-2024-election-rcna162677,"It might seem like six months ago, but it was just six days ago when a gunman in Pennsylvania nearly killed Donald Trump. In some political circles, people assumed that the outrageous assassination attempt wouldn't just change the 2024 election cycle, it was also change the candidate who was targeted. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United,” the former president wrote on his social media platform the morning after the attempt on his life. Hours later, the Republican was even more succinct, adding, “UNITE AMERICA!” As the week got underway, Axios reported that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Trump going forward. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added, “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America.” During the Republican nominee’s convention address, some observers would be forgiven for thinking the assurances were true — at least initially. In the first part of his remarks, Trump spoke in a somber tone while describing the awful events of Saturday and at least paid lip service to the “unity” theme he’d promoted days earlier. “Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” the former president said. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.” And then Trump ripped off the mask, abandoned the pretense and reverted to form. As a Washington Post analysis summarized: I’ve seen a great many convention speeches from presidential nominees, and I think it’s fair to say Trump’s was the worst. At times, it seemed as if he were trying to make himself even less popular with an American electorate that already holds him in low regard, reminding voters of all the things they don't like about him. The speech was breathtakingly dishonest. It was painfully long — to the point that even some of his loyalists left the convention floor before it was over. It rewrote recent history. It made fools of those who genuinely believed his “unity” rhetoric and took seriously the idea that Saturday’s shooting had changed him. But most of all, it was familiar. CNN’s Daniel Dale noted overnight that fact-checking the former president’s convention speech was surprisingly easy “because he’s told almost all of those lies before.” He added, “Trump is hardest to fact check because of the extreme volume of false claims but easiest to fact check because he does the same false claims dozens of times over years.” This was partly a convention speech and partly a greatest hits package, filled with petty lies, conspiracy theories, cheap shots, juvenile taunts (""Crazy Nancy""? Seriously?), borderline incoherent asides about Trump’s overwhelming sense of grievance, praise for the authoritarian leaders he admires, and the latest in a series of weird references to “the late, great Hannibal Lecter.” Meet the new Trump; he’s the same as the old Trump. By some measures, this was the best news Democrats have received in weeks. If the former president had demonstrated real leadership on the Republicans’ convention stage, his opponents would have new reason to worry. Instead, in a rather literal sense, Trump simply couldn’t help himself."
The case against Biden's candidacy remains as strong as ever,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 19, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-drop-out-schiff-pelosi-trump-shooting-rcna162384,"In the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there was a pause in the Democratic campaign to pressure President Joe Biden to drop his White House re-election bid. That moment of quiet was appropriate, as the nation took a brief break from politics as usual to take in what had just happened and sought calm to ensure the shooting did not spark further chaos. But that slowdown has come to an end. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff of California called on Biden to “pass the torch” in one of the most high-profile objections to Biden’s candidacy to date. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not deny an ABC report claiming that in a meeting he had with Biden he pressed the president to step down. And CNN, citing four sources briefed on the phone conversation, reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told Biden he cannot win the race and that his candidacy could ruin his party’s chances of winning the House.  The renewed pressure campaign on Biden is welcome news. The case against Biden’s candidacy did not grow any weaker in light of an assassination attempt against Trump. All the reasons Biden is ill-suited to be a candidate — and ill-suited to be president for four additional years — remain intact. In fact, the case is stronger than ever.  The polls present an unceasing torrent of terrible news for the president. Trump continues to best Biden in the polls despite his felony convictions and authoritarian rhetoric. According to New York Times and Siena College polling records, Trump holds his largest lead over a Democrat since his 2016 White House bid. A poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a remarkable 65% of Democrats want Biden to drop out of the race and allow his party to select a different candidate. Biden is still getting clobbered by Trump in polls of swing states and lagging far behind his Democratic colleagues in those states, indicating that he is a distinctly weak candidate within the party. Data for Progress’ latest survey finds that swing voters consider Biden’s age to be a much larger concern than Trump’s criminal charges. (The same survey conducted before the debate had found the reverse to be true — swing voters were more concerned about Trump’s charges.) There are concrete signs of how frustration over Biden’s candidacy is already demoralizing the party. NBC News reports that major donations have “fallen off a cliff” and that grassroots fundraising is falling short of campaign needs. In a worst-case scenario, this downturn is a preview of how disenchantment over Biden’s age could dampen his appeal not only to independents and swing voters, but also to ordinary Democratic voters. This is why top Democrats are warning that they fear a full-on wipeout of Democrats in government. Biden’s debate performance has generated a strange and shortsighted media game. Every one of the president’s media appearances these days is scrutinized to determine whether he presents any better than he did during his mumbling and at-times incoherent debate performance. Journalists and Democrats assess the timbre and smoothness of every word he utters and then grade the performance afterward typically on the spectrum of somewhere from “bearable” to “alarming.” The problem is that these performances are measured against the unacceptably low standard of Biden’s debate performance, and that Biden is ultimately not defined by his unremarkable moments, but his most troubling ones. It is naive to think Biden can fix this. Widespread concerns about his age predate the debate, and for good reason: For years — and especially during the past year — Biden has displayed a striking decline in his capacity to communicate clearly and display the level of energy appropriate for the most powerful political office in the world. The perception of him as too old is thoroughly entrenched, and challenging Trump to a golf showdown is not going to remedy that. Trying to game out how strong Biden is relative to other potential Democratic candidates is the wrong way to think about this issue. Every potential candidate possesses pros and cons, and electability is mostly poor-quality guesswork. The way to think about this issue is to acknowledge that Biden cannot do his job. These days Biden cannot explain his policy accomplishments. He cannot respond with confidence to politically sensitive questions from reporters that he needs firm responses to. He cannot speak sentences that are consistently intelligible or audible. He cannot paint a vivid and attractive picture of what America should look like in the future. In other words, he cannot make the case for his own candidacy. If he cannot do these things, then he cannot fulfill one of the most basic requirements of any politician: to communicate ideas and persuade people to join them in an endeavor to make them a reality. Such a task will always be required of a politician, whether in private meetings with power brokers or at public rallies ahead of elections. It requires willful denialism — of the polls, of common sense — to suggest that Biden's communicative problems do not help explain why he is trailing in the polls against one of the weakest presidential candidates in modern political history, and why it's hard for him to close the gap. The leaders of any responsible party would attempt to intervene and find someone who can do the job, and it is refreshing to see reports that, for all their flaws, Democratic leaders are doing just that. If the campaign to persuade Biden to step aside fails and he remains the Democratic nominee, the choice between him and Trump will be a no-brainer for the majority of Democratic voters. Biden’s values and judgment — even if executed poorly — are far better alternatives to Trump’s ethno-nationalist authoritarian fantasy. But most voters are not partisan Democrats. And less-engaged Democrats, independents, true swing voters, disenchanted Republicans and potential third-party voters are all persuadable demographics who will play a critical role in who wins the election. The Democrats need someone capable of persuasion — not just through rhetorical competence but also a meaningful and ambitious policy vision. First they must persuade Biden that, as much as he may wish that he could, he is no longer capable of doing what waging a presidential campaign and leading the country demand."
The return of Melania Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 12:03 PM PDT / Updated July 18, 2024, 10:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/melania-trump-rnc-will-not-speak-rcna161908,"A year ago this spring, when the 2024 presidential campaign was just kicking off, it seemed evident that Melania Trump, wife of former President Donald Trump, had decided to give it a miss. Little has changed since then. Her continued detachment from campaign events and rallies, her absence in all the primaries save Florida’s (where she voted), her skipping her husband’s lengthy hush money trial and his June 28 debate against President Joe Biden come alongside the strong speculation that she won’t live full-time in the White House again should Trump be re-elected. All of it taken together seems only to confirm that her distance from Trump’s political life will continue no matter what happens Nov. 5. Melania Trump has, it is true, held two campaign fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans at her homes; but by contrast, first lady Jill Biden has held frequent fundraising tours with multiple destinations. Jill Biden, described as “defender-in-chief” of her husband’s campaign by the Economist, and described by The New York Times as “comforter-in-chief” to some jittery Democrats, has visited red states and blue ones, often alone, and been an actively political surrogate for her husband. Melania Trump’s limited appearances could not be in starker contrast. Though she has been harder to find, Melania Trump did attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. However, unlike she did in 2016 and 2020, this time she did not speak. Her silence ends an unbroken tradition that goes back to Barbara Bush in 1992 of first ladies and candidates’ spouses giving significant addresses at conventions. As long as she is visible at the convention, even if she’s silent, Melania Trump will win plaudits from Trump fans, many of whom only want more of her. Still, her silence and her rare appearances are further evidence, as Katie Rogers noted recently, that Melania Trump has significantly reshaped the role of first lady: “She broke open the role and actually showed us [that] you don’t have to do anything with it if you don’t want to.” For more than a century, whether they desired it or not, first ladies have been highly visible campaigners. As many American women got to vote for the first time in 1920, for example, Florence Harding eagerly stood on her front porch, in what was called the Front Porch Campaign, hosting tens of thousands of visitors alongside her husband, President Warren G. Harding. Similarly, Eleanor Roosevelt called for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented third term during her “no ordinary time” speech at the Democratic convention in 1940, a step that, as First Ladies Association for Research and Education President Nancy Kegan Smith notes, “was credited with helping FDR to unify the convention.” Two decades later, Lady Bird Johnson was the first to take to the hustings on her own, with the whistle-stop tour in 1964 — a bold venture into a hostile South that helped bring about LBJ’s victory. Pat Nixon was the next to appear at a convention, in 1972, thrilled to offer remarks about her husband, Richard Nixon, following an eight-minute standing ovation. Then in 1992, Barbara Bush, already known for a significant speech at Wellesley College, had the opportunity to speak “about the centrality of family … in a model of conciliatory rhetoric,” as scholar Myra Gutin explains. Since then, first ladies’ speeches at conventions have often focused on family matters; Hillary Clinton spoke of children and family in 1996, as did Michelle Obama in 2008: “I come here as a wife; I come here as a mom.” In 2012, Michelle Obama further highlighted hers and President Barack Obama’s humble family histories. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Jill Biden offered a speech “as a mother and a grandmother” from a classroom at a high school where she once taught. Both Melania Trump’s speeches in 2016 and 2020 were similarly focused on family, addressing mothers like herself — and women as a whole.        This theme of family was also echoed by Melania Trump this past weekend in the wake of the assassination attempt on her husband. In an effort to reach across the aisle, she pointed out that “every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.”  Her statement was heartfelt and empathic, calling for Americans to see each other as “human beings.” Considering her absence during so much of the campaign so far, her outspokenness at this moment was notable — and will likely carry significant political weight. Her comments, of course, stand in stark contrast to the way her husband told supporters to ""fight like hell"" right before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Melania Trump’s words were important in humanizing her husband, and they suggest that GOP strategist Alex Conant is overlooking something significant when he claims that “people vote for the presidential candidate, not their spouse or their vice president.” This is because for more than a century now, whether they are particularly interested in politicking or not, first ladies have served their spouses’ campaigns immeasurably, by humanizing and broadening their appeal. With her statement, Melania Trump did just that after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. And Jill Biden’s call to her in the wake of the attack underlined the sisterhood of first ladies, all of whom know that what happened Saturday is what each of them dreads the most."
"Trump gives RNC speech, recounts assassination attempt: Highlights",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:53 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-speech-rnc-republican-convention-live-updates-rcna160910,"Chris Hayes speaking on MSNBC moments ago: First part of the speech, I was struck by the fact that this was a 78-year-old man who had just gone through a profoundly traumatic experience and was forced to reckon with his own mortality and how scary this was for him. The time comes for all of us, and that part of it was a part of Trump you don’t see because I don’t think he likes thinking about it at all. I also felt like the biggest takeaway after what has been three of the most painful weeks I have ever seen in Democratic politics: this is not a Colossus. This is not the Big Bad Wolf. This is not a vigorous and incredibly deft political communicator. This is an old man in decline who’s been doing the shame schtick for a very good long time and it’s really wearing pretty thin. And he is a beatable candidate. And Democrats have been feeling a lot of pain and fear and anxiety and understandably so but I don’t think anyone watched that speech and thought, ""Wow that’s going to be hard to top, that’s going to be hard to beat, how are we going to message against this guy."" And that is what he does at every rally. That was just a Trump rally with some speech woven through. I just think you got to look at that and think it’s really important if you’re on the pro-democracy side of this country to stop him from getting back into office but that should be a doable thing. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Jen Psaki speaking on MSNBC moments ago: From being a part of many convention speeches in the past, I think we can all agree this was not a traditional one. The first 35 to 40 minutes were about himself, about Donald Trump. He only stuck to the teleprompter for a page and a half or so. Also, for a man who is not a person of faith, but has struck a chord with the faith community in our country. There was one line that stuck out to me: “I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God … Many people say it was a providential moment.” He was surrounded by photos of his own bloody face that were projected in the arena. Obviously, that was a very traumatic moment for him and for the country, but he also spoke about this as if it was sort of a calling from God. We'll see how he speaks about this moving forward. But I also think if you’re tuning in and not really paying attention, or you’re undecided, you may see his speech and think maybe I'll go with the other guy. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: To paraphrase Erik Killmonger: “MAGA, is this your king?” If Joe Biden had given a rambling, shambling, all-over-the-place speech like that, elected Democrats would be demanding that the 25th Amendment be invoked immediately. They would scramble even worse than they are now to jettison him as the candidate for president. We would be questioning his mental acuity. That speech was proof that there’s not just one old man in the race. Donald Trump is an old man clearly in decline and we must start talking about him the same way that we are questioning Joe Biden, because Donald Trump cannot stay on message for even five to 10 minutes — even when telling a story about the most traumatic moments of his life. Donald Trump is not a candidate that Democrats should be terrified of. Their terror is embarrassing tonight. Again I have to ask: MAGA, is this your king? These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Four years ago, Trump’s acceptance speech ran 75 minutes and landed with a thud. This year, he spoke for nearly an hour and a half, went on a dozen or more tangents, and, after recounting the assassination attempt on him early in the address, made no effort to tamp down the usual rhetoric. Trump declared that Democrats “used Covid to cheat” in the 2020 election. He lied about crime rates, his inflation plan and his tax plan. He didn’t even bother mentioning abortion, because even he knows no one would believe anything he says about it. His only good fortune was that a good portion of the country likely went to bed before he finished. In short, this was among the worst — if not the worst — acceptance speeches any presidential nominee has given. And as more members of Biden’s party ask him to step aside, Democrats on all sides of that issue should ask themselves some hard questions, given that this is the candidate they are losing to in many polls. Nicolle Wallace speaking on MSNBC moments ago: I think if you’re wondering what impact Donald Trump's speech has on the viewing audience, you have to wonder how much of the viewing audience stayed through. It was longer than modern baseball games with a new pitching clock — I don’t even know that all baseball games last that long. It was very lengthy, very meandering. I hope that the bigger message anyone in the pro-democracy side got tonight is that the pro-democracy candidate, the Democrat, can beat him — by a lot and decisively. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Despite being billed by Republicans as a convention focused on national unity, I think it wrapped up true to the form of the Republican Party. Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, Dana White, Hulk Hogan and Trump — five men who've made headlines for bigoted comments — closed it all out. Pretty telling that the RNC felt the people best suited to drive home their purported message of multiracial unity and political harmony were these guys. Trump had said he rewrote his speech to focus on calling for unity after his assassination attempt, but his remarks tonight were classic Trump. The speech was more than 90 minutes long, and he went off script again and again, greatly exaggerating or lying about his administration’s accomplishments in his first term. Trump made brief, sweeping attempts to appeal to a diverse group of voters, but his overall talking points on immigration, foreign policy, the economy and violent crime remained as grim as ever. The dissonance between his call for the country to heal from “discord and division” while having played a major part in sowing such conflict — including criticizing Biden, Democrats and “crazy Nancy Pelosi” tonight — was unmissable. The lack of any abortion talk in Trump’s speech is notable, and it mirrors the other convention speakers’ deafening silence on the issue this week. Abortion rights is a losing issue for Republicans at the ballot box and one that the party remains divided on. The GOP platform this year — parts of which The New York Times reported Trump had dictated personally — had no mention of a national abortion ban for the first time in 40 years. Trump touted his endorsement from Hungary’s authoritarian Viktor Orbán, whose illiberal behavior Trump and fellow Republicans have praised repeatedly.  Orbán, Trump claims, thinks Russia and China fear the former president. That certainly contradicts Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, who said world leaders viewed Trump as a “fool.”  This whole aside felt like a truly self-aggrandizing diatribe, though I’m not sure many folks outside the MAGA bubble lionize Orbán enough to care what he thinks.  Trump took a veiled shot at Biden’s “cancer moonshot” in a part of the speech that was not in the prepared remarks. In the middle of boasting about how American technology will “soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and many other diseases,"" Trump took a swipe at his opponent. “You remember this gentleman that I don’t want to mention other than one time I had to,” he said, referring to Biden. “This man said, we’re going to find the cure to cancer. Nothing happened.” In 2016, then-Vice President Biden launched a project often called the “cancer moonshot” after losing his son Beau to brain cancer, and he relaunched in 2022 after he was elected president. Trump has gone way off script, making this a very rambling speech that feels relatively low energy for a politician known for riling up his crowds. His remarks were supposed to be just over an hour but we're nearing the 90-minute mark at this point. HuffPost's Igor Bobic reported that ""lots of delegates [are] on their phones"" at this point of the speech. In the middle of a diatribe about how much North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un likes him, Trump mocked people who asked how he could possibly get along with someone like Kim. “It’s nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons,” Trump deadpanned to the audience. He may have said it like a joke, but it speaks to why rogue countries like North Korea sought out nuclear weapons in the first place. It undermines the entire concept of nuclear nonproliferation, showcasing how even the mighty United States will be forced to listen if you only get a few nukes to guard your back. Trump has railed against a “woke military” before, but tonight he distinguished between service members and the “fools” in higher positions in the military. He made a brief mention of it, saying: “We have a great military. Our military is not woke, it’s just some of the fools on top that are woke.” Trump has said something to this effect before. Last month, asked by Fox & Friends Weekend if he would fire “the woke generals on top,” Trump said, “I would fire them. You can’t have woke military.” Read more from my colleague Steve Benen on Trump’s vow to remove military leaders who don’t align with his ideology. “Our crime rate is going up,” claims Donald Trump, “while crime statistics all over the world are going down.” But it’s not true. As NBC News reported last month, “the rate of violent and property crimes dropped precipitously in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, according to quarterly statistics released Monday by the FBI.” Overall, violent crime was down 15.2%, with murders down more than 26%. That’s on top of a significant decline in 2023 as well according to the same FBI data. Trump's ""no tax on tips"" proposal has become a catchy rallying cry on the campaign trail lately, and not surprisingly also got a reference during his RNC speech. But experts do not agree that this plan is the best way to substantially help all — or even many — tipped workers in America. As Sharon Block, a professor of practice at Harvard Law School and the executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy wrote for MSNBC back in June: ""The first element of a pro-tipped worker agenda would be to end the tipped minimum wage... The next element of a pro-tipped-worker agenda would be to raise the minimum wage."" Read more below: Trump promised he’d lower taxes and get rid of inflation, but the math says otherwise. A report from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, for example, found that his 10% tariff on all imports — and 60% on imports from China — would impose a $2,500 tax on the average American household. And the tariffs would also increase inflation by as much as 2.5%. Last month, 16 Nobel laureates penned a letter warning that Trump’s economic program would “reignite” the inflation that plagued millions in recent years. Trump just bragged about dramatically slashing the length of the Republican Party’s platform. “This week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for America’s renewal,” he said before veering off his prepared script. “You saw that agenda, and it’s very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past, including the Democrats.” “They write these things that are hundreds of pages long, and they never read them after they’re done,” he added. “In their case, fortunately they don’t read them, because they’re pretty bad.” The Trump team dramatically cut the party’s platform by nearly three-fourths, while they pushed delegates to pass it quickly and without any leaks. Still, the platform was more of an effort than 2020, when the party skipped writing a platform entirely due to the truncated convention. Despite the generally optimistic tone, Trump’s speech still had a few moments where partisan rhetoric slipped through. For example, he referred to the “Democrat Party,” an old pejorative that dates back to the 1940s and was revived in the modern era by former Speaker Newt Gingrich, since “Democratic” sounds too much like “democratic,” which has positive connotations. He then referred to the classified documents case, recently thrown out by Judge Aileen Cannon, as “the fake documents case,” the “meaningless Green New Scam” (a reference to the proposed Green New Deal), “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” “Deface the Nation” (a dig at the CBS News show “Face the Nation”) and Democrats “cheating on elections.” These smaller moments — only some of which were in the prepared text of his remarks— were revealing because they tend to grate on the very undecided voters that Trump claimed to be reaching out. Trump, repeating dubious claims he and his supporters have made in the past, argued tonight that “our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III” — and only his isolationist approach to foreign policy can avoid it. Such baseless claims have been undercut, however, by foreign policy experts like Fiona Hill, who served in Trump’s administration. Hill, a key witness who testified against Trump in his first impeachment trial, explained to Politico last year that abandoning the United States’ NATO allies or reneging on our promises of support could drive nations to increase their nuclear arsenal, girding themselves for conflict.  In other words, one could argue Trump’s policy proposals may end up accelerating a global conflict — not avoiding it. Trump claimed that if returned to the White House, he’ll “bring down prices, and bring them down fast” after years of runaway inflation. The plan he pitched is the same plan Republicans have been pitching for years: more drilling for oil and natural gas. The argument goes that by increasing the supply of petrofuels, the costs for everything else will go down. The problem with that is twofold: First, the U.S. is already producing “more crude oil than any country ever,” according to the International Energy Agency, outpacing both Russia and Saudi Arabia this year. Second, and more problematic, oil prices are set internationally and even that glut of American oil isn’t enough to get OPEC to reduce their own profits. Doubling down on petrofuels instead of renewable resources is a move with diminishing returns, especially given the worsening effects of climate change that continued oil production — and Trump’s pledge to back off electric car production — will exacerbate. Trump is increasingly veering off script as he goes on tonight, adding whole sections riffing on the words he’s reading off of the teleprompter. It’s transforming what was already set to be a lengthy address into a much longer speech and adding in non sequiturs like Democrats “used Covid to cheat” in 2020 when talking about his policy toward Iran. He also name-dropped Biden and Nancy Pelosi, despite neither being in the prepared text. It’s hard to tell where we’re going to wind up by the time we get to this end of this speech, compared with his promise of “unity.” Trump just praised Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who just dismissed his classified documents case in Florida. Trump nominated Cannon to the bench during his lame duck period after losing the 2020 election. After the classified documents case was dismissed earlier this week (a ruling special counsel Jack Smith is appealing), Trump used his speech to praise her as a “highly respected federal judge in Florida,” offering rare praise for the widely criticized judge. It’s yet another reminder that Trump seems to believe the legal system should serve his personal interests. “We will make Wisconsin great again,” Trump proclaimed. But he’s made that promise before. In 2017, the Trump White House touted a $10 billion factory from Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn that would create 13,000 jobs. Trump held a gold-painted shovel and boasted the manufacturing campus would be a crown jewel for his “America First” agenda.  By 2021, the investment was scaled back more than 90%, and Foxconn largely abandoned the project. This gap between Trump’s rhetoric and reality can be found across the state, with more counties having lower unemployment under Biden than under Trump. And earlier this year, Biden announced a $3.3 billion data center from Microsoft — on that same property Foxconn and Trump had once promised to make “great” again. In the middle of recounting Saturday’s shooting, Trump told the crowd that “I am not supposed to be here tonight.” In response the audience began to chant “Yes you are! Yes you are!” Trump took in the adulation before responding: “No, I’m not” and continuing with his prepared remarks. The crowd also took up the cue to begin chanting “Fight! Fight!” as Trump reached that point in his recollection, echoing the cry at the rally when the Secret Service led him off stage. And after a moment of silence for firefighter Corey Comperatore, there was a round of “We love Trump” from the assembled masses. Trump went into detail about last weekend’s assassination attempt, saying he realized immediately that he had been struck by a bullet in the ear and ducked, and that the audience “did not move an inch” as the gunshots rang out because they thought he had died and didn’t want to leave him. Videos show some audience members crouching down and moving during the shooting, but the crowd did largely remain in place. Trump also honored Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the shooting, and David Dutch and James Copenhaver, who were upgraded to stable condition after being critically injured. After recounting the attempt against his life, Trump eulogized Corey Comperatore, the man killed during the rally shooting last weekend. Comperatore, 50, died trying to protect his family, officials said. He was a former fire chief for Pennsylvania's Buffalo Township and a father of two. At one point, Trump walked over to a stand that was holding up Comperatore's fire helmet and jacket. Though Comperatore's name is misspelled on the jacket, it was of his part of his official uniform. Trump then called for a moment of silence for Comperatore. Trump’s speech included this confounding bit of verbal judo. “We must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement,” he said. “In that spirit, the Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy, especially since that is not true, in fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country.” Two things: First, it’s honestly bizarre that Trump is criticizing criminalizing dissent when his 2016 campaign’s unofficial slogan was “lock her up.” He also threatened to deploy the military against unarmed protestors in 2020. But more importantly, this MAGA mumbo jumbo proves polls that suggest there is bipartisan concern among Americans for the future of democracy need to be taken with a grain of salt. In the worldview that Trump is promoting, his attempts to overturn the 2020 election were about him protecting democracy — from Democrats’ voter fraud. It follows, then, that his supporters would think Biden and Democrats are the actual threat, no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary. As Trump recounted the attempt on his life on Saturday, he praised the “very brave Secret Service agents” who were “putting themselves in peril.” Not all of his supporters feel similarly. “At least three female agents were among those protecting Trump in the moments after the shooting,” reports NBC News, “and in the days since, their actions have become popular targets of criticism and jokes among conservatives, with several posts on X receiving more than 10 million views.” Republican Reps. Tim Burchett and Marjorie Taylor Greene have also denounced Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle as a “DEI hire” and a “DEI initiative person” respectively. Trump, the 45th president, just formally accepted his party's presidential nomination in the hopes of becoming the 47th president next year. Following his prepared remarks, he went to to describe the assassination attempt against him on Saturday. On retelling his experience, he said: ""You'll never hear it from me a second time because it's actually too painful to tell."" UFC president Dana White, a longtime Trump supporter who faced condemnation last year for slapping his wife on camera, just wrapped up his hypermasculine speech portraying Trump as a strong man Americans want and need in charge. As I’ve written on the ReidOut Blog, White and fighters in the UFC have repeatedly used the company as a platform to promote Trump and play up his purported toughness. I’m not sure that speech or White’s appearance will do much to win over many women voters. But Trump’s campaign seems more focused on appealing to misogynistic men more than anyone else. A number of speakers tonight have said that God saved Trump from being assassinated. Leading the convention in prayer, the Rev. Franklin Graham directly credited God.  “Our heavenly Father, we come before you this evening with grateful hearts,” the noted evangelist leader began. “Thank you for saving the life of President Donald J. Trump. In his own words, it was you and you alone who saved him.” Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said it was “divine intervention.” Speaking directly to his father from the stage, Trump’s son Eric credited “the grace of God, divine intervention and your guardian angels above.” But it was the Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, the pastor of a Black church in Detroit that Trump visited last month, who went the furthest, arguing at the climax of his speech that God saved Trump for the country’s future.  “You can’t deny the power of God on this man’s life. You can’t deny that God protected him,” he said. “You cannot deny that it was a millimeter miracle that was able to save this man’s life. Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for such a time as this?” Sewell added: “Could it be that the king of glory, the lord God strong and mighty, the God who is mighty in battle, protected Donald Trump because he wants to use him for such a time as this?” In his acceptance speech, Trump also said that God protected him last weekend. Recounting the shooting in Pennsylvania, he said: “There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way, I felt very safe, because I had God on my side.” He later added: “I’ll tell you, I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. In watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was.” Lawrence O'Donnell speaking on MSNBC moments ago: When I was working in the Senate in the 1990s, what you saw was the abortion issue doing was exactly what each party needed it to do. You couldn’t imagine the Republican Party without it. There was just no way they could come close to winning a national election without it. They needed that piece in their coalition. But you also knew that they never ever wanted it to go away. I didn’t believe George W. Bush wanted it to go away, because then what do you do? How do you how do you campaign on the issue? I never dreamed Ronald Reagan wanted it to go away, or George H.W. Bush. And the Democrats were very good at using it against them. Both sides were using the issue for enormous fundraising. It just seemed like a status quo that served both parties. What the Democratic Party was saying was preserve Roe v. Wade, and the Republican Party was saying get rid of it. But then they got rid of it and now, the guy who got rid of it is afraid of talking about it. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Don Jr. has long been heralded as the heir apparent for the Trump family. After all, he is the eldest son and the one with the deepest ties to the alt-right movement that helped fuel his father’s initial presidential run. But in this new era, it’s Eric whose wife is running the RNC, Eric who got the better RNC speaking slot, addressing the convention ahead of his dad. It’s also worth noting that while the New York civil fraud case is being appealed, the Trump family's main business is politics. Either way, Eric is clearly a workhorse when it comes to his dad’s interests, even if his older brother is the one who has historically garnered the most attention. Following the theme of Trump amnesia, Eric mentions how cheap gas was when his dad was president. Eric seems to have forgotten about the once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that caused gas to be so cheap. Eric complains about how mean everyone is to his dad. Lots of good conservative grievances from Eric. Eric tells everyone how his dad is going to fix everyone’s problems but it feels like he’s forgotten that his dad was president for four years. Despite how weirdly angry and long his speech was, Eric always just makes me sad. The former first lady has finally arrived on the convention floor in the final hours of the RNC. Her entrance followed Eric Trump's speech. Just one speech remains ahead of Trump's — UFC President Dana White — and a couple of musical performances — one from Kid Rock and one from Lee Greenwood. It looks like most of Trump’s immediate family members are here tonight. Before Hulk Hogan took the stage, Trump walked out onto the convention floor and into the VIP booth with his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle; his older daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner; the former president's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, and her husband Michael Boulos; and others. Trump's second-oldest son, Eric Trump, is set to speak later tonight. His wife, Lara Trump, was also seen in the VIP box. There’s been a lot of commentary over the past several days about the confidence among Republicans in Milwaukee. Nowhere is that confidence more obvious than among Trump’s campaign, and his selection of JD Vance as his running mate is being interpreted as a sign of confidence in the polls. (Never mind that Mike Pence was hardly a choice designed to woo swing voters either.) And yet Thursday has capped off the convention of a campaign that, if it is as much in the lead as it claims, has done so in spite of itself. The speakers’ list has been almost entirely employees on Trump’s payroll or rich celebrities. Tucker Carlson, Dana White, Alina Habba: These are not names who will win over the sliver of persuadable Americans. And the night’s proceedings have been marked by the house band filling time, again and again. There haven’t been any attempts to shore up Trump’s weaknesses or cement his strengths. Trump may be ahead right now, but four months is a long time in politics, especially in 2024. Nothing about this week suggests that Trump’s staff is ready to save him if and when things go sideways. Alex Wagner speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We should note that the Republican National Convention is unified around Donald Trump’s candidacy. But when it comes to literally anything of substance, even within the convention hall itself, different camps have differing opinions. JD Vance got up there last night and said the Republican Party isn’t the party of Wall Street anymore, they’re the party of the working class. He did that the same day there was reporting that Trump was interested in tapping Jamie Dimon to be the head of the head of the Treasury Department. Those two statements are at odds with one another.  On mass deportations — there are people holding up mass deportations signs but then we have reports that Hispanic men, in particular, don’t think Trump’s going to follow through on that policy. The Republican Party largely hasn't been held to account by its voters on any of the policies that Trump seeks to enact, or any of the plans he says he has for a second term. Donald Trump and JD Vance are telling voters: full lockdown, don’t ask us any questions, get in line and pull the lever. This is what you got. That’s unity. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Ahead of wrestler Hulk Hogan’s speech tonight, social media users are raising awareness about racist comments he made in the past. From Tucker Carlson to Trump, this convention has welcomed plenty of people who’ve been derided for their racist rhetoric — Hogan included. In 2015, he apologized after a recording surfaced of him saying he is “a racist to a point” and repeatedly using the N-word while decrying his daughter dating a Black man. Not the gifted orator I remember, but he did seem very enthusiastic. Hogan mentioned “real Americans” — am curious what that means. Also, he did in fact rip his shirt off, which the crowd loved and honestly could be the high point of this whole convention. It’s worth remembering that Peter Thiel funded Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker. Very interesting to hear Hogan talk about how he has known Trump for over 30 years and why he thinks he will stand up for everyday Americans.  In the lead-up to his speech, allies of the Biden campaign shared video of Hogan mocking Trump — including Trump’s hair — and claiming the former president turns his back on everybody that’s close to him and everybody who has done business with him. Trump was expected to speak around 10 p.m. but there are still several speakers to get to and the house band has been playing for over 20 minutes since the last speech. It's unclear what's causing the delay. Meanwhile, Melania Trump has reportedly arrived to the convention, according to a photo snapped by The New York Times. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson repeated an old story about protesters coming to his house in his speech tonight. The incident happened in 2018, as about 20 protesters with the anti-fascist group Smash Racism D.C. showed up at his house, chanting “Tucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!” One woman could be overheard in a video posted online saying she wanted to bring a pipe bomb to his house. The protest was widely condemned and Facebook and Twitter removed the group’s videos of it from the internet. In his RNC speech, Carlson said that “antifa came to my house,” defining the group inaccurately as “the Democratic Party’s militia.” He also said that the protesters “tried to come in through the front door,” a claim that he made at the time which was not backed up by police reports or evidence. Tucker Carlson, whose main platform is social media after Fox News fired him last year, still has huge sway over the Republican Party. He took the stage to one of the biggest applauses so far tonight, and he reportedly played a major role in pushing Trump to pick JD Vance as his running mate: The New York Times reported that when Trump was wavering on Vance as his VP pick, Carlson called up the former president and warned him that if he didn't go with Vance and instead chose a ""neocon,"" U.S. intelligence agencies would be incentivized to assassinate him. In a statement to the Daily Montanan, Tester said, “While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.” Tester becomes the second sitting senator after Vermont’s Peter Welch to suggest Biden step aside. Earlier this week, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for California's Senate seat, also asked Biden to step aside. Tester, who is in a tight race with businessman Tim Sheehy, also told the Daily Montanan that he supports an open nominating process, rather than designating Vice President Kamala Harris as the new nominee. Days after waxing nostalgic about an era when American men felt empowered to “punch out” school employees, and warning about the spiritual battle being waged with “anti-human” liberals, Tucker Carlson finally got his chance to gush over Trump on the official RNC stage.  But just like fellow speakers Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis before him, Carlson hasn’t always had such nice things to say about the former president.  Last year, Carlson tried to walk back anti-Trump texts that were unearthed during the Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit. In those texts, Carlson said he hated Trump “passionately” and called Trump’s presidency a “disaster,” noting “there isn’t really an upside to Trump.” “The only crime [former] President Trump has committed is loving America,” said Trump lawyer Alina Habba onstage just now. In fact, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide an affair ahead of the 2016 election. Two other criminal cases against him are ongoing, and while a third was recently dismissed, special counsel Jack Smith has appealed that dismissal. And Trump has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in multiple civil suits involving fraud, defamation and sexual abuse. Alina Habba, an attorney who represented Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation trials, lauded Trump’s character in a dramatic speech. “Tonight, I want to take you behind the law and behind the headlines, and share with you a side of President Trump that reveals his character, his kindness and his commitment to saving this great country,” said Habba, whose client was ultimately found liable of sexual abuse against Carroll. At one point, Habba seemed to tear up as she recounted when a bystander in Manhattan shouted his support for Trump while Habba was on the phone with the former president, and Trump asked to speak to the man. Several other prominent women in Trump’s orbit have also gone to lengths to talk up Trump’s “softer” side in an attempt to humanize him at the RNC. A short video shown between speakers featured Trump in full election denial mode. Clearly filmed before last weekend’s shooting, the video shows Trump saying that if he’s re-elected he will move to eliminate all early voting and electronic voting machines and require voter ID across the country. “We’re going to do it properly,” he said. “We’re going to have good, secure, beautiful elections. We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.” The video is part of a broader effort to persuade voters to “use every appropriate tool available” to vote, including voting early and by mail. Trump’s repeated attacks on voting by mail during the 2020 election put the GOP at a strategic disadvantage as the party has to rely more on Election Day turnout. In the video, Trump also encouraged voters to look for election fraud, which is vanishingly rare despite Trump’s baseless claims. “Keep your eyes open because these people want to cheat, and they do cheat, and frankly it’s the only thing they do well,” he said. Thursday’s speaker schedule has plenty of Trump employees and has-been celebrities. What it won’t have is any former Republican presidents, vice presidents or nominees for either office. ""At this year’s RNC, it’s as if there was no Republican Party before Trump came along,"" Michael A. Cohen wrote earlier this week. ""And, in a sense, that’s true. The current incarnation of the GOP bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan or the Bush family. The only real blast from the past is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich."" Read more below: New York real estate executive Steve Witkoff is the latest in a string of people who apparently were given speaking slots to talk about what a nice guy Trump is in his private life. Witkoff is a longtime friend of Trump’s who was brought in as the first expert witness for the defense in the New York civil fraud trial against Trump and his business last year. The polite applause Witkoff got from the audience tonight shows his speech did more to boost Trump than his courtroom appearance, which didn’t help prevent a $355 million fine against the Trump Organization. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: These ideas being pushed at the RNC, that immigrants are taking your jobs, that we have an immigration problem, this notion that immigrants are stealing American jobs is simply not true. Now, if you’re worried about the economy, Donald Trump’s plan of mass deportation is only going to hurt our economy. If you take all of these people out of the country, they’re no longer going to be contributing spending here and that’s going to shrink our economy. We’re going to be further short on labor. We know that under the Biden administration, $2 trillion in infrastructure spending is happening. We need a labor force. For me, the takeaway that I’m scratching my head on, there are all sorts of policies that JD Vance and Donald Trump represent, like extending the corporate tax cut. JD Vance is anti-supporting Ukraine, obviously overturning Roe v. Wade was their crowning achievement, but they’re not talking about any of those things. JD Vance last night and Donald Trump tonight are pushing this pro-worker populist message. It’s amazing because in the state of Ohio there is a senator who has had a populist message who’s worked for the working man and woman for years, and it’s Sherrod Brown. If you’re talking about unions, you’ve got the head of the Teamsters here the other night, which was amazing that Trump is potentially getting their vote, but you didn’t see a lot of these people in the crowd cheering them on because the Republican platform is not pro-union. For me, my big takeaway is just this giant disconnect. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump entered the convention hall to a raucous reception tonight and sat next to country singer Jason Aldean.  Aldean, whose single “Try That in a Small Town” was accused of endorsing lynching, is closing out the four-day convention on Thursday night with a performance. At a concert this week, he dedicated the song to Trump after the attempt on the former president’s life. Pompeo’s speech tonight, besides repeating falsehoods about Chinese spy balloons and foreign policy, also clashed with Trump’s actual record on veterans and the military.  “I’m disgusted by the Biden administration’s incompetent pullout from [Afghanistan],” Pompeo claimed. But a report from the National Security Council determined Trump’s haphazard announcement that the U.S. would be pulling out of Afghanistan was largely to blame for the chaos that followed once Biden took over. Pompeo also portrayed the MAGA movement as friendlier to veterans than the Biden-Harris admin — a strange claim considering Trump’s disparaging comments about veterans like the late John McCain, and the fact that Trump’s RNC is currently suing Michigan over directives state officials say would make it easier for veterans to register to vote. John Nieporte, the head pro at Trump’s golf club, was a truly baffling speaker. He made me wonder what are we even doing here? I don’t know. Trump’s golf pro said, “Donald Trump, 21 club championships; Joe Biden, zero.”  Is Joe Biden a member of Trump’s golf club? He is not. That golf portion marked one of the most sycophantic parts of this convention. Nieporte praised Trump’s golf game and gushed over his purported athletic prowess. With that in mind, I advise you to read this interview with sports writer Rick Reilly on Trump’s alleged tendency to cheat in golf and how it seems to explain some of his political tendencies Trump, still wearing a bandage over his right ear, joined the RNC moments ago, walking into booming applause and cheers. He shook hands with several attendees on the way to his seat, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has endorsed Trump once again despite all the nasty things the former president has said about him and his wife. There is nothing as bipartisan as a good attack line, as Mike Pompeo just proved again. In a speech harshly criticizing Biden’s foreign policy, Trump’s onetime secretary of state recycled a line from his predecessor, Hillary Clinton. “The entire administration has failed to tell us the truth, the truth that we all know and is so dangerous to our nation, the truth that Joe Biden can’t handle that 3 a.m. phone call,” he said. “Indeed he won’t take a phone call after about 4 p.m.” The “3 a.m. phone call” originated back in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, when a Clinton ad used it to try to raise doubts about Barack Obama’s lack of foreign policy experience. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rewrote a lot of Trump’s foreign policy in his speech, but one of the biggest lies was about Biden’s supposed weakness in the face of China. “Not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States — four years,” he said. “If I was the secretary of state and a Chinese spy balloon flew across the country, I’d have been the former secretary of state — and rightfully so.” Except that didn’t happen only because Trump’s administration didn’t notice when it happened. Pompeo was one of several Trump administration officials given classified briefings last year because “incidents that occurred during Trump’s presidency weren’t discovered until after Biden took office.” That’s a bit less of an applause line, though, so I guess Pompeo’s strategic amnesia makes sense here. It was interesting to watch a newly svelte Mike Pompeo try to engage the crowd. Spoiler: He failed. Instead we got a lot of the usual lies about Trump’s foreign policy, but just a little bit more boring. GOP convention attendees clearly feel like nothing can stop Trump from retaking the presidency. It’s a sense of inevitability that not only says Trump will win, but that he can’t lose. As I explained yesterday, that narrative is a red flag when you consider how much can change between now and November — and how unlikely Republicans are going to be to accept any result other than a total victory for Trump. You can read more below: “For Twitter to deserve public trust,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk once wrote, “it must be politically neutral.” That pretense of neutrality, on life support ever since Musk purchased the site now known as X, is not just dead but now 6 feet underground. Visitors to X tonight will find that the #MAGA and #Trump2024 hashtags now have custom emojis and icons on the site. To top it all off, those who click on #Trump2024 are greeted with raining American flags. A representative for X told tech news website Mashable that this is a paid promotion for Trump’s campaign. Twitter and X have long provided custom emojis for advertising campaigns, nonpartisan events such as NFL games and bipartisan events like Election Day. But never before has a presidential campaign been allowed to purchase such promotion. While unprecedented, though, this development is hardly unexpected when Musk’s pledge to donate $45 million a month to Trump for the rest of the campaign. It’s another reminder, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem wrote, of “how acutely vulnerable our civil society is to being hijacked by billionaires who want to reshape the world to their liking.” Businesswoman Diane Hendricks, who just spoke, is one of the RNC’s so-called “everyday Americans” who have been featured throughout the convention this week. But the idea that Hendricks would be able to sympathize with the average voter is somewhat laughable. As Rolling Stone reported, Hendricks is the co-founder of a massive roofing wholesale business and a billionaire Trump donor who benefited greatly from his rich-friendly tax cuts during his first term. She was, according to Forbes, the 92nd-richest person in the world in 2024. “Everyday” she is not. Joy Reid speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Let’s talk about some of the hottest fashion trends at this convention, like the cowboy hats the Texas delegation brings every year. This year, we’re seeing some Republican delegates give another stylistic show of support for their presidential nominee Donald Trump: white bandages on their right ear, just like the one Trump is wearing to cover the wound he received Saturday. This is not the first time that delegates at a Republican convention have used a bandage to send a message. But it’s quite different from the one we saw 20 years ago that managed to take away 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry’s advantage over incumbent president George W. Bush at the height of the Iraq War. Then-Senator Kerry had served in combat in Vietnam as a Swift boat captain, while Bush, whose father was a U.S. congressman, wound up serving stateside in the Texas Air National Guard.  During the 2004 campaign, a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, bankrolled by a Republican megadonor, emerged to smear Kerry’s service record and the injuries that earned him one of three Purple Hearts. At the 2004 Republican convention, some delegates were Band-Aids with Purple Hearts on their faces to mock what they called a self-inflicted scratch Kerry had sustained. It didn’t matter it sold a lie about combat veteran Kerry, amplifying a baseless charge that he was somehow dishonorable. While George W. Bush sold himself as a wartime president, albeit one who conveniently avoided combat in the war that defined his generation. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump’s claim that he wanted to stress “unity” at the Republican convention after the attempt on his life seemed to fall by the wayside when it got underway. But looked at another way, Trump is getting unity; it’s just among Republicans only. The convention has shown the party coming together in support of the nominee, with Trump’s former rivals speaking on his behalf and an overall jubilant mood in the room.  And that may have been what Trump meant all along. Consider that as president, he had a habit of bragging about his poll rating among Republicans and with Republican pollsters. Once he memorably claimed that 52% of women supported him in the 2016 election, which as fact-checkers noted was actually the numbers he got among white women. So Trump may be getting the unity he meant after all. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., has the job of trying to keep control of the House in Republicans' hands. During his speech, he told RNC attendees that “to save America we need to grow our majority.” It’s a tacit admission that there’s no way for the GOP to govern with the size of its very slim majority. What he had the tact not to say though is that it’s thanks to the chaos caucus members who list themselves as Trump’s biggest supporters that Republicans have spent the last two years swinging from internal crisis to crisis. Diane Evans, labeled as one of the “everyday Americans” speaking tonight, just made a dig at Biden: “I’ve never spoken at a convention before; I’ve never used a teleprompter before. But I figure if Joe Biden can, I can manage all right.” Evans, it’s also worth noting, is on the executive committee for the Palm Beach GOP — and indicated that she got involved in politics because of Trump’s 2020 lies. She told the crowd that they should ”tell 20 people to tell 20 people to vote — and they can’t cheat or rig their way out of a landslide.” It’s one of the first direct references to Trump’s claim that he can only lose if Democrats cheat, but likely won’t be the last. Anyone under the belief this convention is truly about “unity” could take one look at the Arizona delegation of Republicans in attendance to be proven otherwise.  I wrote earlier this week about Shelby Busch, the election-denying Arizona delegate selected to announce her state party’s support for Trump at this year’s convention. Busch was in the news recently after video surfaced of her saying she'd like to ""lynch"" Republican Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richer, who’s been targeted with baseless election conspiracy theories.  Senate candidate Kari Lake of Arizona used her RNC speech to attack the press and push false claims about immigrants voting in federal elections. Her icy relationship with the press was further exposed in viral footage of her withering during an interview in which she was asked about her election conspiracism.  And Arizona state Rep. Alexander Kolodin, a fellow election-denier, was captured on camera telling Democracy Now host Amy Goodman that Goodman and Democrats tried to “assassinate” Trump, peddling a far-right conspiracy theory that claims liberals are responsible for the recent shooting at a Trump rally.  So much for “unity.” Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was the first major speaker tonight and made the case for an “America First majority” in the Senate. The speech was what’s become standard boilerplate for the GOP at this point, calling out liberal Democrats who “speak like moderates but vote with Joe Biden” for opposing the Keystone Pipeline and “taking away your Second Amendment rights.” But he got the biggest response when attacking trans kids, trotting out the tired line that Democrats “can’t even define what a woman is.” But “back in Montana, we know the difference between a cow and a bull,” Daines said. A reminder, though: Anti-trans rhetoric failed to win over voters during the 2022 midterms, and it’s unlikely that it will this time around either. Fmr. Gov. John Kasich speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Will we see a different Donald Trump tonight? He’s been talking about love and compassion but a lot of people are skeptical about it. If he is going to talk about love and unity, and all that other stuff, we’ve got to see if that’s for real. Words are one thing and actions are another. Republicans think they’ve got an excellent chance of winning this but I do think they are very unsettled by the prospect of President Joe Biden not being the candidate. Republicans have had a good convention — any way you want to look at it. Now, the question is, what kind of a convention are the Democrats going to have? When you look at what’s happened, by and large for the Republicans, it’s been pretty good. They seem to be together and have largely controlled some of the rhetoric — we’ve not seen Jan. 6 people parading around. What’s going to be interesting is what kind of a convention the Democrats will have. If Democrats go into a convention that is sort of, but maybe not totally, wide open, it will be exciting and different. That would be something much different than what you’re seeing with the Republicans right now.  These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. At a sound check at the convention this afternoon, musician Kid Rock changed the lyrics to his 2000 song “American Bad Ass” to reference the recent assassination attempt on Trump. Rock’s original lyrics: “They call me cowboy, I’m the singer in black / Throw a finger in the air, let me see where you’re at / And say (hey, hey).” As sung during a sound-check earlier this afternoon: “They call me cowboy, I’m the singer in black / Throw a fist in the air, let me see where you’re at / And say (fight, fight).” The new lyrics reference Trump raising his fist after the failed assassination in Butler, Penn., and chanted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” to the audience.  Attendees at the convention have adopted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” as their own chant at several points, and a Trump-owned sneaker company is also selling shoes with the slogan and an image of Trump’s bloodied face. Stephanie Ruhle speaking on MSNBC moments ago: RNC attendees are not talking about cutting taxes for the rich or extending the corporate tax cut. They are not talking about the crowning achievement, which is overturning Roe v. Wade. We are not hearing about ending support for Ukraine, and the question is why. And the answer is, those policies — the actual policies that Donald Trump stands for — are not popular with the majority of American people. Obviously, the people in this arena are going to vote for Trump — win, lose or draw. But there are not enough people here to win the next presidential election. Trump knows this. JD Vance knows this. So the challenge is for Democrats: are you going to educate the American people, and independent and swing voters, to say their populist message, their blue-collar worker message, isn’t reflective of what their policies are going to be? Two nights ago, the head of the Teamsters was here. News flash: The Republican Party does not support unions. So my question is going to be, is there ever going to be a connection between the message Donald Trump has and this audience realizing that his policies don’t reflect it? These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump’s speech tonight will be a crowning moment for a politician who has defied massive odds to solidify his control over the GOP. The former president left the White House in 2021 having lost the election and incited a failed insurrection at the Capitol, with many prominent Republicans disavowing him. In the years that followed, he was relegated to the political sidelines as criminal investigations into his conduct after the 2020 election slowly progressed. He was indicted in four separate cases last year, and two months ago, one of those cases resulted in a conviction on 34 felony counts. He had initially been scheduled to be sentenced just four days before the start of the convention. Yet the past few weeks have seen a stunning turn of his fortunes. Biden’s disastrous debate performance has overshadowed Trump’s incessant lying, and the public narrative has shifted from Trump’s alleged criminal behavior to Biden’s age. Then the Supreme Court ruled in one of those criminal cases that, as president, Trump enjoys some immunity from prosecution, a decision that jeopardizes the other indictments against him and has delayed his sentencing in his hush money conviction. On Monday, the first day of the convention, the Florida classified documents case against him was dismissed by a judge. Trump, having narrowly survived an assassination attempt on Saturday, has also elevated his already-exalted stature within the party.  His moniker, “Teflon Don,” is perhaps more apt now than ever. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley just officially opened tonight's session. Several more presentations will take place before the speakers take the stage, including the invocation, the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of the National Anthem. Political conventions can make or break a career. But one of the breakout stars of the Republican National Convention this year appears to be the house band, which has ranked among the top searches on Google about the RNC over the last four days. The band, Sixwire, can be heard playing what could be described as “dad rock” during breaks and in between speeches, covering hit songs like “Don’t Stop Believin’” and “Life is a Highway.”  The Nashville-based band, which released one album back in 2002, has experience as a house band on reality TV shows such as “Nashville Star” and “Next Great American Band” and at various professional sports gigs. The investigation into the Trump assassination attempt continued this week as the RNC unfolded in Milwaukee. And while many details about the attack have come into focus, one key detail remains unknown: the shooter's motive. Federal investigators have been unable so far to determine the underlying ideology of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who fired at Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. As NBC News reported today: ""Investigators looked into his internet history and found that Crooks made searches this month specific to Trump, a rally, and the [Democratic National Convention], according to a senior U.S. law enforcement official."" Crooks was a registered Republican but also made a $15 donation to a progressive cause in 2021, according to NBC News. Despite the lack of evidence about a potential motive, some top Republicans immediately blamed Biden, Democrats and ""the media"" in the wake of the shooting. Let's see if Trump and his allies stick to the ""unity"" message they promised to deliver tonight. Ari Melber speaking on MSNBC moments ago: Trump's address tonight is significant and historic: a former president who was extremely close to an assassin’s bullet and death returning here to address his party and also the nation. And that is true regardless of one’s view of Trump, his policies or his politics. It’s true even for critics who note that he has not always extended sympathy or proper gravity after political violence targeting others. And that kind of debate is about whether other people uphold the civic and peaceful traditions and whether we do that regardless of what others do, what they do. The test for America right now ultimately is about us. For anyone who fails to consistently reject violence — well, that would be on them. For those who want to continue to uphold our civic values and peace and justice, it’s a different path. That’s the serious context for tonight’s address in a nation that has lived through so many attempted and completed assassinations. These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. The Trump campaign has leaned heavily on celebrity endorsements this go-round. Many of the people with government experience and relevant knowledge from his first presidency — including Trump’s own vice president, of course — have refused to back him, with many painting the former president as a threat to democracy. In lieu of that support, the Trump campaign has tried to highlight its support from celebrities and influencers instead. The RNC has underscored this, relying on model Amber Rose to tell voters that the MAGA movement is welcoming to all people — a message undercut by the adherents’ widespread opposition to diversity measures and immigrants — and reality show participant Savannah Chrisley to push Trumpian falsehoods about politicized prosecutions. Tonight will be more of the same, as WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan, UFC president Dana White and country music singer Lee Greenwood are scheduled to speak. But this strategy seems to have limitations. A USA Today/Suffolk poll released in May showed that celebrity endorsements — with the exception of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama — have little to no impact on the overwhelming majority of voters’ decisions. Trump claimed in a pair of interviews last week that the acceptance speech he’d been ready to give tonight was tossed out. “I had all prepared an extremely tough speech, really good, all about the corrupt, horrible administration,” the former president told the New York Post. “But I threw it away.” Trump told the Washington Examiner: “The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger. Had this not happened, this would’ve been one of the most incredible speeches.” He added: “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now.” It’s unclear exactly who the actual author of the speech is, given that Trump is not known for drafting his own lengthy remarks and used ghostwriters for all of his books. Longtime aide Stephen Miller was the wordsmith behind his 2016 acceptance speech and most of Trump’s other major addresses in office. Quick update: The Washington Post actually reported earlier that the speech was originally drafted “by aides including campaign policy adviser Vince Haley and former White House adviser Stephen Miller,” before Trump “decided to overhaul much of the draft after Saturday’s assassination attempt.” If that’s the case, I can’t imagine that the newer draft didn’t get a polish from Miller and Haley, but I can believe that he gave a sense of what he wanted to say instead. Charlie Sykes speaking on MSNBC moments ago: We need to talk about how united this Republican Party is and how committed they are to this agenda. I think we need to take it seriously. Trump 2.0 will be much more serious, much more extreme than Trump 1.0. And we need to be very, very clear-eyed about what it would mean to have Donald Trump in the White House and 53 or 54 Republican senators. Anyone who thinks that they are not serious about this is naive. What right now are the guardrails? What are the limits? The Supreme Court has told Donald Trump that in effect, he is above the law. The law will not deter him. If he gets in, he doesn’t have to worry about impeachment. He won’t have to worry about Republicans pushing back against him. So as Democrats decide what they’re going to do, I think they really need to step back and go, ""You know, if we really do think that this is an existential crisis, maybe we should behave like it."" These comments have been slightly edited for length and clarity. Trump is pretty freewheeling at his rallies, news conferences and TV interviews, but his two previous convention speeches (in 2016 and 2020) were among the few times he stuck to the script. But that script is still classic Trump, even if the rhetoric is more high-flown than usual. His 2016 convention speech stands out for its darkness. Nicknamed the “Midnight in America” speech by Time magazine, it described an America besieged by violent criminals, flooded with immigrants in the country illegally, humiliated abroad, and impoverished by bad policy choices. After the assassination attempt over the weekend, Trump said he was rewriting his speech to focus on unity and less on tearing down Biden’s record. We’ll see how much he follows through on that. But even if he aims for a more optimistic tone, the dark moments will still be there.  His 2020 convention speech is a good example of how this could play out. As the incumbent, he couldn’t repeat his previous approach and he began by talking about how he was “brimming with confidence” about the nation’s future. But that tone soon faded as he began contrasting the choice between re-electing him or voting for a “socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny” and “give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.” “In this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,” he said. We’ll see tonight which direction Trump goes with this speech, whether it’s more like his 2016 speech, his 2020 speech or a new thing entirely. As Republicans prepare to fete Trump tonight, Democrats appear to be edging closer to the tipping point for Biden to withdraw as major figures in the party reportedly have spoken with the president and his allies about his chances in November and as big donations slow down dramatically, according to NBC News. Some of Biden’s fiercest backers are privately conceding that the end of his candidacy seems inevitable now, NBC News reported, with one person close to the president saying: “We’re close to the end.” Sen. Chuck Schumer had a “blunt” discussion with Biden about the race. Rep. Nancy Pelosi reportedly told Biden that he cannot win and that he could jeopardize Democrats’ hold on the House. And even former President Barack Obama has told allies that Biden should “seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,” according to The Washington Post. None of these top Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside, but this reporting only adds to the pressure on the president. The New York Times reports that Biden himself may be resigned to dropping out. ""Several people close to President Biden,"" reports the Times, ""said on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race, bowing to the growing demands of many anxious members of his party."" The Times also reports that Biden is getting particularly strong pushback from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""In a recent call, when Mr. Biden insisted he had polls showing he could win, Ms. Pelosi said 'put [Biden senior adviser Mike] Donilon on the phone,' so she could cite her own polls showing the opposite — a direct challenge to the president and an implication that he was not being fully informed."" Last weekend’s shooting apparently is on Trump’s mind as he prepares to give his speech tonight. A source told NBC News that the former president looked around while being shown the stage where he’d be speaking and commented that it’s a lot safer inside. It will be interesting to see when Trump resumes outdoor rallies and whether his demeanor will be different in comparison with indoor events. A senior Trump adviser said Thursday that Project 2025 is a “pain in the ass” for the campaign. Trump has sought, unsuccessfully, to distance himself from the 920-page plans for a second term put together by the far-right Heritage Foundation think tank led by several of his former staffers. That’s largely because the proposal includes a lot of unpopular ideas, such as dismantling the Department of Education and withdrawing Food and Drug Administration approval of abortion pills. In a Politico-sponsored event at the Republican convention, senior Trump adviser Chris LaCivita said that the think tank’s proposals aren’t helping. “The issues that are going to win us this campaign are not the issues that they want to talk about,” he said, blaming the media for talking about them as well. “And you guys know it which is the reason why you write about it.” He also mocked the authors as nobodies, even though they include Trump’s own former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, his former acting Defense secretary, his former Housing and Urban Development secretary, his former deputy chief of staff, and his former Justice Department senior counsel. “Let’s go find another guy who worked, you know, cleaning up the West Wing or some back office who’s going to write a policy statement and you guys are going to write a story about it,” LaCivita said, sarcastically. Vought, it should be noted, is not only one of the key authors of Project 2025 but also the Republican National Committee’s platform policy director. Though it was reported last week that Melania Trump would attend the RNC, marking a rare public appearance by the elusive former first lady, she has been noticeably absent from the event so far. She is expected to show up for her husband's speech, and though she addressed the 2016 and 2020 conventions, she isn't scheduled to speak tonight. It's unclear why she has decided not to attend much of the RNC this year. Some people close to Melania Trump reportedly say she's shaken by the assassination attempt against her husband. But, as NBC News reported, she's largely avoided public events since before the shooting and has only joined a handful of events on the campaign trail. Read more below: While Nikki Haley espouses or accommodates many MAGA values, she still waged war against Trump during the primaries by attacking his character and calling him unfit for office. She described him as “totally unhinged” and pushed back against his thirst for “revenge.” She warned that he is “declining” cognitively and called him a “toxic” agent of “chaos” who lacks “moral clarity.” And she diverged from a key pillar of the MAGA worldview by stating that America doesn’t “rig elections” and acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.  Nonetheless, Haley offered Trump an endorsement that was not only full-throated, but even helped revise his record and boosted him in an area where she has had sharp policy differences from him in the past: foreign policy. As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, Haley diverged from Trump by staking out more hawkish positions on Russia than he did, including by making clear her belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. During the primaries, Haley denounced Trump for encouraging Russia to attack NATO allies. But in her RNC speech, Haley praised Trump as a guarantor of a “strong America” and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden — you know, the guy who is a NATO traditionalist and helped organize an unprecedented sanctions regime against Putin. Read more below: Trump's and Biden’s running mates may not have agreed to terms for a debate yet, but Vice President Kamala Harris is already gearing up. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Thursday, Harris said that Vance told a “compelling story” about his life at the convention but argued that “it was not the full story.” She went on to talk about Project 2025, saying it’s “extreme” and “divisive."" She argued that the Trump-Vance campaign has not lived up to its promise of unity. “If you claim to stand for unity, you need to do more than just use the word,” she said. “You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity and dignity.” She went on to criticize the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and proposals to cut access to abortion and cut taxes for the wealthy. Today's session features the theme ""Make America Great Again"" — what else? — and is scheduled to begin at 6:45 p.m. ET and end around 10:30 p.m. ET. More than a dozen Trump allies will address the convention tonight before the nominee takes the stage as the final speaker. Kid Rock is slated to perform right before Trump speaks. Here are the speakers, in order of expected appearance: It’s noteworthy how much this week has been designed to play up Trump’s purported toughness. Because Trump has modeled himself after dictators and authoritarians around the globe, this was likely on the campaign’s vision board even before last weekend’s shooting at a Trump rally. But in the wake of that attack, it was all but guaranteed that Republicans would want to portray Trump like a war hero. (Some supporters at the RNC have donned an ersatz ear bandage in a nod to Trump's injured ear.) Trump’s surrogates have gone to great lengths over the last few days to portray him as the candidate of choice for macho guys. For example, check out some of these clips of UFC President Dana White, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and far-right activist Charlie Kirk gushing over Trump, trying to convince men that the former president is the strong man they’ve always wanted to see in charge.  For more on this PR campaign, check out my previous blogs here, here and here. Tonight’s speakers include former WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan, who has connections to Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Hogan helped bankrupt Gawker Media after winning a lawsuit over the publishing of a sex tape. It was later revealed that Thiel had financed the lawsuit. Thiel was a big backer of Trump in 2016 and even had a prime speaking spot at that year’s RNC, but later broke with him. Another big tie to Thiel: Trump’s running mate. Thiel hired Vance at his venture capital firm and later spent $15 million to help elect him to the Senate. Looming over the RNC is the unsettled question of who the Trump-Vance ticket will run against in November. Whether Biden ends up as the Democratic nominee is still up in the air, and that uncertainty has been reflected at the convention in how often the speakers have attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, who seems among the most likely options to replace Biden at the top of the ticket should he withdraw. It’s also plausible that Trump will seek to contrast the disarray among Democrats with Republicans’ show of unity under his leadership this week. The official RNC calendar this week features several showings of ""Reagan,"" an upcoming biopic about Ronald Reagan. The movie, which has been under development for 14 years, is set to be released in August, but it will probably never have a better audience than this week. (Watch a trailer for it here.) It’s clearly a movie aimed mainly at conservatives; it's based on a book by an author whose other works include “The Devil and Karl Marx” and another about American progressives called “Dupes.” Dennis Quaid stars as Reagan in a bit of stunt casting that is less about looking like Reagan and more about hitting a similar level of Hollywood stardom (although he nails the voice.) The movie also features arch-conservative actors Jon Voight and Kevin Sorbo and in another bit of stunt casting, the lead singer of Creed as Frank Sinatra.  Anticipation for Trump’s speech tonight is higher than ever after Saturday’s shocking turn of events. After quite literally dodging a bullet to survive an assassination attempt, the GOP nominee has claimed to want to unite the country. He told the New York Post that he ditched a previous convention speech that he said was “all about the corrupt, horrible administration” and was rewriting a new one focused on unity. On the campaign trail, Trump has frequently hit the same notes in his speeches, using similar terms to criticize Biden and Democrats, vowing to punish his political enemies and lamenting what he characterizes as the country’s downward trajectory. As he receives a hero’s welcome from his party tonight, his ability to stick to this ostensible new message of unity — after years and years of railing against his perceived foes — is likely to be sorely tested."
Trump’s RNC speech proved again there’s never a ‘New Trump’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-rnc-acceptance-speech-rcna162654,"For a minute there, former President Donald Trump sounded different on Thursday night. “Whether you’ve supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American Dream,” Trump told a sea of conservative believers at the Republican National Convention. “With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country.” The acceptance speech he delivered lacked the soaring phrasing of Ronald Reagan telling the RNC crowd in 1980 that “the time is now, my fellow Americans, to recapture our destiny, to take it into our own hands.” The overall tone of the prepared text distributed ahead of his speech was a far cry from his first acceptance speech eight years ago, let alone his inauguration address, later dubbed the “American Carnage” speech. It was a shift in line with the reported “new softness” he’d displayed since last week’s assassination attempt. As with most things Trump, though, any shift away from his usual bombast was surface level — at best. The facade of a new Trump evaporated quickly, just like the last several times we were promised a new Trump. Even when he has managed to momentarily project a calmer persona, a state that lasted only minutes into an address that broke records as the longest acceptance speech ever, Trump remains substantively the same: impulsive, xenophobic and more than happy to go on the attack in exchange for the applause of a crowd. In his remarks, Trump initially portrayed himself as a happy warrior, one fighting for all Americans, in sharp contrast to his usual polemics against Democrats. “Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” he intoned toward the beginning of his speech. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.” If you’d handed me that quote before Thursday night, I would have sooner guessed it came from President Joe Biden or almost any other political figure before I ever landed on Trump. In promising to be the “president for ALL of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,” Trump played against type in a way that I hadn’t expected even having read the reporting that he’d torn up his original speech in the aftermath of the shooting. But despite promising unity, his speech only grew Trumpier as it continued, as he leaned into his worst instincts, riffing to the crowd’s delight as he threw it red meat. Even in the prepared text, though, he was still disparaging of LGBTQ Americans when declaring “we will not have men playing in women’s sports.” It was still filled with lies about a supposed surge in crime fueled by migrants sneaking across the border. It still framed the criminal cases against him as partisan witch hunts from Democrats, rather than the results of his own actions. It was still packed with pie crust promises, easily made and easily broken, that “incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never before.” It is hard to find the unity in promising to “launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country,” darkly warning that “bad things are going to happen” otherwise. He miraculously managed to (mostly) avoid directly attacking Biden, using his name directly only once, saying the “damage he’s done to the country is unthinkable.” But I’m pressed to find anything meant to win over skeptical Republicans who couldn’t bring themselves to vote for him in the primary campaign, let alone disenchanted Democrats and independents. Even if he did rewrite the speech he was prepared to give as he claimed, Trump couldn’t help but go off script and attack “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” drawing boos from the crowd, and accusing Democrats of “destroying our country” and “cheating at elections.” There was nothing he said that contradicted the conservative agenda laid out in Project 2025, even as he urged listeners to “rise above past differences and disagreements and go forward united, as one people and one nation.” In the end, Trump may have offered to “a hand of loyalty and friendship” to “every citizen, whether you are young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic,” but he did little to disguise the racism and fearmongering at the heart of his campaign. The Trump we saw on display Thursday night wasn’t the chastened, humbled man some predicted might be on display. It was exactly the Trump we’ve come to know over the last nine years. The bottom line is this: Donald Trump still wants the same things for this country that he did before Saturday’s attempt on his life and is still willing to do it in the least unifying way possible."

Jamie Raskin urged President Joe Biden to reconsider his re-election bid, joining dozens of other prominent Democrats who have publicly called for their presumptive nominee to step aside. In his four-page letter, first reported by The New York Times and later obtained by NBC News, Raskin doesn't explicitly call for Biden to drop out. Rather, he warns that the country is ""under siege every day by the autocrats and monarchists, from Moscow to Mar-A-Lago"" and that the stakes of the November election are high. ""I am not writing to presume to tell you what to do, Mr. President, because that is up to you and Jill and your family entirely,"" Rasking wrote, adding: ""No one envies the choice you must make now, Mr. President, but remember this as the great politician you are and have always been."" ""The hard questions that have been raised about your mental and physical stamina ... are not just medical and scientific questions now,"" he added. ""They are also political questions because both political leaders and tens of millions of voting citizens have formed judgments based on the events of the last few weeks.""

Joe Biden has big plans — and terrible timing,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 2:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-campaign-second-term-agenda-rcna162330,"Timing has not been President Joe Biden’s strong suit lately. Hours after he declared in an interview released Wednesday that he would consider ending his campaign if doctors told him he had “some medical issue,” the White House announced he had tested positive for Covid. The only reason his exit is even being discussed is his performance in the first debate with former President Donald Trump. It was his team’s decision to hold the abnormally early faceoff before the Democratic National Convention, leaving enough time for second thoughts about his candidacy to percolate. Among the fears his performance sparked is whether, as my colleague Zeeshan Aleem argued, his campaign has been too focused being anti-Trump rather than presenting a second-term policy agenda. With that in mind, it makes sense that Biden finally has begun to roll out his plans for what he’ll do if he wins. You’d be forgiven if you missed the announcement for his plan for the first 100 days of his second term. It came during a Friday night event in Detroit — the day before the failed assassination attempt on Trump. Such has been the case for Biden the last several weeks, as forces outside his direct control have overshadowed his attempts to steady his wavering campaign. Biden’s pitch for his second term included some familiar agenda items, unfinished business from when the Democrats held both houses of Congress in his first two years. He pledged that the first bill he sends Congress will be to “restore Roe v. Wade to make it the law of the land.” Biden also said that he’d sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, both of which ran into a Republican filibuster when last presented to the Senate in 2022. Other portions of his proposed plans would expand or codify actions his administration has already taken. Last month, Vice President Kamala Harris and Lena Khan, head of the Federal Trade Commission, announced a new rule that would ban medical debt from being included in credit reports. Biden said on Friday that he would go after medical debt writ large if he returned to the White House, drawing applause from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Likewise, he vowed to cap insulin costs at $35 per month for all Americans with diabetes, the same way the the Inflation Reduction Act did for Medicare enrollees. But there were some new announcements in his speech that will hopefully get more attention over the coming months. One was a pledge to finally tackle the cost of housing, a crisis that affects Americans across the country. Biden told the crowd that he’d advocate a plan to “build 2 million housing units and cap rent increases at 5% a year so corporate landlords can no longer gouge everyone like they’re doing.” Since then, his administration has already rolled out details on his new housing plan in hopes of getting traction on the issue ahead of November. And while it wasn’t mentioned in his Friday address, we’ve also learned that that he’s developing a proposal to reform the Supreme Court, a major shift for him to address Democrats’ angst over the deeply conservative court and the ethics scandals circling several of the justices. On the one hand, this is exactly what Zeeshan was calling for in his piece, offering up a substantive, positive agenda to counter Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next GOP president’s agenda. It also reportedly comes after progressives like Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., threw Biden a political lifeline following the initial calls for him to step aside. Looking down ballot, announcing these policies now also gives Democrats running for Congress items to sell to their voters, as many of them would require retaking the House and retaining the Senate. The immediate question, though, isn’t whether these are good policies — which they are, offering up a clear difference for Americans about what a Democratic president will do compared to Trump. For that matter, it’s not even about whether it will move the needle for undecided voters ahead of this fall. That’s a question that’s more up in the air, as a Gallup poll from last month showed that more independents surveyed said that Biden is too liberal than thought Trump is too conservative. Instead, the question has become whether Biden would necessarily be the one to implement those policies next year. While the intense scrutiny he’s faced since the debate has been a bit much at times, it was still eyebrow raising when he mangled his housing policy when speaking at the NAACP earlier this week. And after a brief respite in the aftermath of this weekend’s shooting, the tide against him remaining in the race has continued to pummel him. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., became the most prominent Democrat to publicly call for Biden to drop out in favor of another candidate. Hours later, the White House announced that he has Covid, taking him off the campaign trail. Curiously, Biden’s inability to sell these second-term policies on the stump for the next few days highlights how few of them are uniquely associated with Biden. Much of what’s been announced could easily be the position of any Democrat running for president in 2024. Without a competitive primary season to distinguish between the alternative candidates whose names have been floated, the debate has been over who voters will believe is best equipped to win against Trump. Maybe that wouldn’t have been the case if Biden had started making his case earlier — but, again, timing is everything here."

In addition to Trump and Biden, the shooter had photos of Attorney General Merrick Garland and a member of the British royal family saved on his phone, two people familiar with the probe said.” * This White House sure is serious about student loan debt relief: “The Biden administration announced Thursday it will cancel $1.2 billion in student debt for 35,000 workers, as a result of its recent fixes to a popular debt relief program for public service workers.” * On the other hand: “A federal appeals court blocked the implementation of the Biden administration’s student debt relief plan, which would have lowered monthly payments for millions of borrowers.

Patrick Orlando allegedly lied in public filings when he said his company, Digital World Acquisition Corp., had not contacted any possible merger targets and had no specific merger plans, the commission said in the lawsuit filed Wednesday night in Washington, D.C., federal court.” * Onto the 11th Circuit: “Special counsel Jack Smith formally filed notice on Wednesday that he will appeal a Florida judge’s decision to dismiss Donald Trump’s 40-count indictment for allegedly mishandling classified documents and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.” * A familiar face in Nevada politics: “Michele Fiore, a Nevada politician known for her fiery brand of conservatism, was indicted on fraud charges on Tuesday for what prosecutors said was a scheme to spend charitable donations on personal expenses.” See you tomorrow."
"With Roe gone, abortion foes tee up another precedent for the Supreme Court to overturn",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 1:55 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-abortion-clinic-hill-v-colorado-rcna162543,"When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority complained that prior abortion rulings had “distorted First Amendment doctrines.” The case the court cited for that proposition was Hill v. Colorado, a 2000 decision that upheld a law that barred approaching people without consent outside of a health care facility for the purpose of leafletting, displaying signs, protesting, educating or counseling.  A new petition to the justices this week asks the court to overrule Hill — and there’s reason to think the court will do it. Hill was decided 6-3 in 2000, when the court’s composition was much different than it is today (as one may have guessed from the Dobbs majority’s disapproving citation). Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented in Hill, is the only justice from that original ruling who is still on the court. The new petition comes from the anti-abortion group Coalition Life. It challenges a Carbondale, Illinois, ordinance that it says is virtually identical to the one that the court upheld in Hill, which set the zone within 100 feet outside a facility and within 8 feet of a person. “The lower courts had no choice but to uphold that carbon-copy measure,” the group said in the petition filed by the group's legal representatives, the Thomas More Society and Paul Clement, a top conservative Supreme Court lawyer. “This Court has a better option,” it said: overrule Hill.  The city has an opportunity to respond before the court considers whether to grant review, which takes four justices. Based on the majority’s negative reference to Hill in the Dobbs decision — on top of the court’s First Amendment rulings since Hill — it appears there are at least that many justices who would consider overturning Hill. And Coalition Life's is not the only petition seeking to ditch the 2000 precedent. There's another one pending before the justices, filed by the American Center for Law and Justice, whose chief counsel is Trump impeachment lawyer Jay Sekulow, who argued Hill for the challengers. Whether in these pending appeals or any another, the issue is one to watch as the court fills out its docket for the next term, which starts in October."
Why JD Vance’s record on abortion rights matters in 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 11:32 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-record-abortion-rights-trump-2024-race-rcna162554,"NBC News published an interesting report in March on Donald Trump’s search for a new running mate and the importance the former president had placed on abortion rights. The Republican, the report noted, was “laser-focused on the abortion issue, especially when it comes to his vice presidential pick,” mindful of the Democratic advantage on the issue. NBC News quoted a source close to Trump saying, “He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position.” To be sure, “too staunch” is a matter of perspective, but if the presumptive GOP nominee tapped Sen. JD Vance for the ticket assuming that his views on reproductive rights would seem mainstream, Trump made a poor choice. Take this Washington Post report, for example. Unfortunately for the Republican ticket, this is just one of many relevant data points. While Trump has avoided endorsing a national abortion ban, for example, CNN reported that Vance, during his Senate candidacy, said, “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.” Vance, the year before reaching Capitol Hill, said at the time, “I’m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here’s a situation — let’s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let’s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately Black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity — uh, that’s kind of creepy.” “And, and it’s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?” Vance said, “I’m pretty sympathetic to that actually. So, you know, how hopefully we get to a point where Ohio bans abortion in California and the Soroses of the world respect it.” The comments are hardly ancient history: The Republican said this just two years ago. What’s more, Vance’s campaign website described him as “100 percent pro-life” — under a headline that read, “END ABORTION” — though the text was quietly removed after Trump chose him for the GOP ticket. In case that weren’t quite enough, Talking Points Memo ran a related report this week, noting that the Biden administration finalized new regulations under HIPAA that limited law enforcement access to medical records tied to reproductive health. Eight Republican senators pushed back against the administration’s efforts — and Vance was one of the eight. And did I mention that Vance publicly endorsed his home state’s six-week abortion ban, which does not include exceptions for rape or incest? Because he did that, too. All of which brings us back to the concerns Trump reportedly expressed in the spring. “He’s concerned it will have a drag on the ticket if they’re seen as holding too staunch a position”? By any fair measure, Vance is one of the Senate’s most far-right Republicans when it comes to reproductive rights, with a series of beliefs that most Americans would see as extreme."
Why haven’t Senate Republicans called on Bob Menendez to resign?,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 10:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/havent-senate-republicans-called-bob-menendez-resign-rcna162379,"Sen. Bob Menendez was already facing a bleak political and legal future, but things went from bad to worse for the New Jersey Democrat after a jury found him guilty on 16 federal corruption counts. Ahead of the verdict, most of his colleagues in the Senate Democratic conference had called for Menendez’s resignation, and after the verdict, the number grew — quickly. Indeed, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wasted no time in calling for Menendez to step down. Others, including Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, raised the prospect of expelling their criminal colleague if he failed to resign. But it was a point from another member of the Senate Democratic leadership that stood out for me. NBC News reported: “I strongly reiterate my call for him to step down,” Murray said in a written statement. “No one is above the law — it’s pretty straightforward. Now if only my Republican colleagues would apply the same standards to the convicted felon who is running for President of the United States as their nominee.” In fact, while the list of Senate Democrats calling on Menendez to resign grew — and continues to grow — there was no comparable push among Senate Republicans. GOP senators learned that one of their colleagues had just been convicted on corruption charges, but they made no real effort to show him the door. Circling back to our earlier coverage, there might very well be an ideological dimension to this: When it comes to foreign policy, Menendez is to the right of most of his Democratic colleagues. Senate Republicans could be content to have him stick around because, on matters related to international affairs, they agree with him quite a bit — and no matter which Democrat replaced him, the GOP would almost certainly disagree with him or her more. But Murray’s point is ultimately the more persuasive one: If Republicans were to agree that Menendez’s crimes leave him unfit for office, it would almost certainly mean that Donald Trump is equally unsuitable for positions of public trust. For most Democrats, there’s no inconsistency to reconcile: They’re comfortable saying Trump has disqualified himself and showing Menendez the door. But for the GOP, it’s apparently easier to stay silent on Menendez than to try to explain why the senator should resign but the Republican Party’s felonious presumptive nominee should return to the White House. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Voters’ incredulity gives Trump an important edge in 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/voters-incredulity-gives-trump-important-edge-2024-race-rcna162534,"Before Donald Trump took over Republican politics, most of the party exercised some caution while targeting immigrants. The political calculus was simple: GOP officials and candidates didn’t want to risk a voter backlash, especially in Latino communities. Trump, however, felt comfortable testing those assumptions. He used racist rhetoric toward immigrants in 2016, for example, but nevertheless fared better among Latino voters than Mitt Romney did four years earlier. He implemented ugly anti-immigrant policies while in office — even separating Latino children from their families and locking them in cages — and his share of the Latino vote went up, not down. As part of the former president’s comeback bid, the Republican has targeted migrants with dehumanizing rhetoric that echoes Hitler, all while promising to create militarized mass deportations and detention camps if voters reward him with a second term. He’s even talked about putting migrants into a ring to fight for Americans’ entertainment. It’s against this backdrop that Republican National Convention attendees waved professionally made “MASS DEPORTATIONS NOW!” signs, while chanting “Send them back” on the convention floor. And Trump nevertheless expects to fare even better among Latino voters in 2024, and recent polling suggests none of his recent antics have hurt him with Latino voters at all. There are a variety of possible explanations for this, but a New York Times report published this week raised an important point about public perception: In other words, these Latino voters are well aware of the fact that Trump says he wants militarized mass deportations and detention camps, but they don’t believe he’ll actually follow through on such a policy. It’s a position that effectively says, “I’ll vote for the guy because I assume he’s lying.” If you spend enough time online you’ll probably see references to the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party. This summary is as good as any: “Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party refers to a parody of regretful voters who vote for cruel and unjust policies (and politicians) and are then surprised when their own lives become worse as a result.” It appears to have started in 2015 with someone who wrote, “‘I never thought leopards would eat MY face,’ sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party.” It came to mind reading about voters who oppose mass deportations but who nevertheless plan to vote for the candidate running on a platform of mass deportations. Stepping back, there’s a larger phenomenon to keep in mind. For many years, focus group participants have expressed great skepticism when confronted with accurate information about Republican policies. Provided with the truth, many voters found it impossible to believe that GOP proposals were real because the measures simply sounded too radical. As New York magazine’s Jon Chait summarized several years ago, focus group participants have received facts about Republican plans, but the truth “struck those voters as so cartoonishly evil that they found the charge implausible.” If the Times’ report is accurate, many Latino voters are responding to Trump’s deportation plans the same way. “It’s all just campaign talk,” they apparently assume. “It won’t be that bad.” For all the talk about Americans being cynical, sometimes they’re not quite cynical enough.

A reminder of why former Trump adviser Peter Navarro actually went to prison,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 9:34 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/peter-navarro-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna162498,"Fresh out of prison, Peter Navarro told the crowd at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that “if they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful: They will come for you.” Putting aside the fact that the Supreme Court’s recent immunity ruling broadly insulated Trump from criminal liability, Navarro is correct — to the extent that anyone who fails to comply with a congressional subpoena does risk prosecution. But Navarro's remarks to the party don’t signal a full appreciation for why he was incarcerated. The former Trump White House adviser cast his prosecution for contempt of Congress and his imprisonment as part of an unjust Democratic plot against him and the Constitution. The truth is simpler: Navarro was convicted after he failed to comply with a subpoena from the House Jan. 6 select committee. He told the crowd in Milwaukee that the committee demanded he violate executive privilege and betray Trump, but that he refused. Yet, a court found that Trump didn’t assert or authorize Navarro to assert privilege in the first place. Navarro’s narrative of Democratic “lawfare” by all three branches of government is further complicated by the fact that, in the end, it was the same Roberts Court that bestowed broad immunity on the president that also declined to keep Navarro out of prison while he appeals his conviction. To be sure, Navarro’s underlying appeal is still pending, and the court could still take up the issue someday, whether in his or in Steve Bannon’s appeal, which is also pending. (Bannon is currently locked up after the court similarly declined to keep him free while he appeals his contempt of Congress conviction.) But contrary to Navarro’s RNC claim that he “went to prison so you won’t have to” — whatever that even means — he went to prison because he failed to comply with a subpoena, was convicted at trial, and even the GOP-supermajority Supreme Court didn’t see fit to keep him free during his appeal."

JD Vance, the Trump campaign responded that it won’t agree to until after the Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled to begin on Aug. 19. * North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican Party’s right-wing gubernatorial nominee, apparently removed references to abortion from his campaign website. * USA Today reported that George Conway, a prominent anti-Trump Republican, has launched a new political action committee “called the Anti-Psychopath PAC on Thursday to portray Donald Trump as a danger to democracy and mentally unfit for a second term.” * Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to support Biden’s re-election, but in a newly published interview with The New Yorker magazine, the Vermont independent said, “You’re right — sometimes he doesn’t put three sentences together. It is true.” * And Melania Trump has kept an extremely low profile of late, including being absent from the first three nights of the Republican National Convention. The former first lady is expected to attend the final night of the party gathering in Milwaukee."
Trump-owned company sells shoes with image from assassination attempt,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 18, 2024, 8:26 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-owned-company-sells-shoes-image-assassination-attempt-rcna162513,"As difficult as this might be to believe, the Associated Press reported that people can now purchase $299 sneakers featuring an image of Donald Trump with his fist in the air after Saturday’s assassination attempt. As part of the pitch — which I am not making up — prospective buyers have been told, “These limited edition high-tops, featuring Trump’s iconic image with his fist raised, honor his unwavering determination and bravery. With only 5,000 pairs available, each one is a true collector’s item. Show your support and patriotic pride with these exclusive sneakers, capturing a defining moment in history.” These are not to be confused with the $399 Trump-related gold high-tops, which are also sold by the same Trump-owned company, which the Republican candidate’s campaign officials have promoted online. In fact, for consumers with a special fondness for the former president, there’s a seemingly endless stream of other products to choose from. Remember “the only Bible endorsed“ by Trump? And the “official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection”? All of which comes on the heels of the steaks and the board game? How about Trump selling off pieces of the suit he wore while taking his mug shot after one of his criminal indictments? On a related note, after the Republican was arraigned in Atlanta, his political operation started selling mug shot-related campaign swag — including, but not limited to, mugs, sweatshirts and beverage coolers. One could presumably wear the mug shot sweatshirt while also wearing “Victory 47” cologne and perfume — available for just $99. I’m reminded of a recent Washington Post analysis with a great headline: “Trump used to sell the perception of opulence. Now he just sells Trump.” That was true when the piece was published in February. As the shoes featuring an image related to his assassination attempt help prove, the situation appears vastly worse now."
