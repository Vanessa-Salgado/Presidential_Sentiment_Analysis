"Team Trump wanted Biden to stay in the race. Then in an instant, everything changed.",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 1:20 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrats-harris-biden-ticket-trump-rcna163078,"This is an adapted excerpt from a July 21 special episode of “The Rachel Maddow Show.”  Three and a half years into his presidency, Joe Biden made American history with an act of profound political and personal sacrifice: stepping down from his re-election bid in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris. In the instant Biden announced that news, at 1:46 p.m. on a Sunday, everything changed. The Democratic Party instantly ended its internal war — an emotional, intense, harrowing fight that has torn the party apart for the past three and a half weeks. That is over. The expectation among Democrats, an expectation voiced more and more openly in recent days, was that the party was in for a historic wipeout in November — with not just the White House in danger, but the House and the Senate in danger as well. That expectation has also evaporated in an instant.  Shortly after issuing his statement, Biden voiced his strong and unequivocal endorsement of Harris. Harris confirmed immediately that she would indeed run and pledged to fight — to win.  When it came to commenting on the very difficult knockdown, drag-out fight within the Democratic Party, Republicans and Donald Trump had been uncharacteristically disciplined. They were being very reticent and very disciplined about not talking about the concerns over Biden showing his age.  That’s because they were crossing their fingers and hoping Biden would stay in the race, expecting he would stay in. They were looking at the polls and bragging about their surely, absolutely guaranteed victory. Last week, Trump’s pollster said there were between 20 and 25 different paths to victory in the electoral map. Biden, perhaps cannily, waited until the supremely self-confident Republican side locked in their ticket. He waited to announce his plans until Trump picked a running mate whom most Americans do not know, and who — they are discovering — is deeply committed to a nationwide ban on abortion. Trump’s remarkable recent run of political good luck has finally come to an end. He is now the old man in the presidential race. A 78-year-old who is only occasionally coherent, with a record as president that is viewed by historians as the worst in the history of the country and a tenure that ended in violence. A man who refuses to promise there won’t be more violence from his supporters in the future.  Trump drags along with him not just the legacy of what happened the last time he was in office, but also the threat of a national abortion ban and a possible prison sentence — that all heads with him to the polls. We now know Trump’s opponent will not be a man older than him. His opponent will likely be a 59-year-old former prosecutor, attorney general, U.S. senator, and vice president to Joe Biden — who cemented his legacy with a decision that will go down in history as one of the most selfless patriotic sacrifices of any sitting president ever.  At 1:46 p.m. on a Sunday, Biden changed everything about this race. In an instant, the old era is over and the new era is here. It’s go time.

Biden will be a one-term president. That's not necessarily a bad thing.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 1:17 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-joins-one-term-presidents-club-legacy-historical-comparison-rcna162973,"America tends to pity the one-term president. Whether denied a second term by the voters or by fate, the commanders in chief who served only a single stint in office have a certain pathos about them. Consider just some recent one-termers. Gerald Ford? Accidental president remembered for falling down the steps of Air Force One. Jimmy Carter? Used as an epithet for a failed presidency by Republicans for decades. George H.W. Bush? Outshone by his own son’s two terms. It is this sad fate that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden sought to avoid as they ran for a second term this November. But now that Biden has dropped out, he has definitively joined the club. Before he ran in 2020, Biden reportedly considered pledging to serve only a single term before deciding instead on a strategy of ""quietly indicating"" that he wouldn't run again. (He chose a funny way of going about that.) Republican nominee John McCain also mulled a similar move in 2008. Both dropped the idea in the end because they feared it would reduce their power in the White House, but maybe also because the lure of joining the pantheon of two-term presidents is too strong. The two-termers, after all, get the glory. Mount Rushmore? Two-termers. Coins and paper bills? Two-termers. Prestige Hollywood biopics? Two-termers. One-term presidents are not remembered as fondly. When the American Political Science Association released its regular survey ranking the presidents earlier this year, the top 10 had only a single one-termer in it (JFK, who continues to be remembered more for his potential than his achievements); the bottom 10 were all one-termers (including Trump, for now). Looking at the bottom of the list starts to feel like the old ""Simpsons"" bit where the kids dress up as the ""adequate, forgettable, occasionally regrettable caretaker presidents,"" singing: One-termers, all of them. Some of that is raw skill. After all, as Trump reminded us in 2016, anyone can win a presidential race once if they get lucky. But winning twice shows that it wasn't a fluke. A second term is also a good proxy for whether you lived up to your promises since voters have a chance to weigh in on how you did with your first four years on the job. But if becoming a certified member of the One-Term Presidents club is a sad moment for Biden, there is still hope for him. Some one-termers have been rehabilitated by history, especially when they have shown skill in international diplomacy, racked up legislative achievements in a short time or done what was right for the country on a major issue. The exemplar here is James K. Polk, who, admittedly, is not well known today. But as fans of the band They Might Be Giants know, he fulfilled every one of his campaign goals in just four years, including a pledge to only serve one term. Another model is the elder Bush, whose judicious handling of the end of the Cold War and decision to end the first Gulf War without invading Iraq lost him political points at the time but came to look better in retrospect. The truth is that it's still too early to tell, as historians will largely judge Biden based on what happens next. He may be remembered for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, massive spending to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and fight climate change, and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Or his presidency may be seen as a brief interregnum between Trump's two terms. Whatever happens, Biden's decision to voluntarily step down and not seek the nomination that was within his grasp will loom large in the analysis. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins the nomination and goes on to win the general election, Biden may be seen as a statesman who understood the stakes and let go of power for the good of the country, a marked contrast with Trump, who still can't admit he lost in 2020. He will have passed the test of doing the right thing on a big issue. But if she falters and either loses the nomination or the general election, Biden will be remembered more for having held on as long as he did, fatally damaging his party's chances. Biden's legacy, then, may come down not to what he did on the job but how and when he decided to quit. He may forever be a one-term president, but, unlike most of the others, it will have been his choice, and he can take some solace in that."
Harris praises Biden's 'deep love' of country in first remarks since he endorsed her,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/vp-harris-first-remarks-short-rcna163081,     
A potential Trump v. Harris race puts two competing ideas of Christianity on display,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 10:54 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-christian-faith-religious-freedom-rcna163011,"Following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will no longer seek re-election in November, the 2024 presidential race juxtaposes two very different versions of Christianity: Donald Trump brandishes a performative rendition of the Christian faith as a political prop to advance authoritarian theocracy, while Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to take his place as the Democratic nominee, practices the Christian faith she was raised in, while embracing her interfaith family.  In doing so, Harris embodies our nation’s founding ideal of religious freedom and models a Christian commitment to religious pluralism.  Although he has reportedly mocked his conservative Christian leaders behind their backs, was not active in church before running for president and says he’s never asked God for forgiveness, Trump has manufactured mass far-right devotion among his base through moves like overturning Roe v. Wade. Surviving an assassination attempt will only heighten MAGA zealotry, as we saw with the surge of Christian nationalist narrative claiming Trump survived only by the will of God.  Harris grew up attending 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland. “I was raised to live my faith,” she said at the National Baptist Convention, USA, Annual Meeting in 2022. “Marching for civil rights, my parents pushed me in a stroller. That was faith in action.” I’ve witnessed her put her faith in action on the national stage. Four days after Biden picked her to be his running mate in 2020, I was invited by the Biden-Harris campaign to attend a meeting between her and national faith leaders. We heard directly from the Rev. Dr. Amos Brown, her pastor at Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. It was clear from the very beginning of her national political career that she would not shy away from talking about her Baptist convictions. Harris once served as Rev. Brown’s campaign manager when he ran for re-election to the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. “She is an encourager; she encourages all people regardless of their social station in life,” Rev. Brown shared with Baptist news outlet Word&Way. “She is a role model for womanhood, and just human decency and dignity at its best.”  Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church. “Just think, after slavery was outlawed in our country, the founders of this very convention came together to protect the freedom of worship,” she said at the National Baptist Convention. “As Black people in our nation battled racist laws and ideologies, men and women of the cloth were the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in America. And they, then, following the teachings of Christ, built coalitions of people of all faiths and races and walks of life, because they understood and knew the importance of the collective.” “I can trace my belief in the importance of public service back to learning the parable of the good Samaritan and other biblical teachings about looking out for our neighbors,” she said in a Religion News Service interview in 2020.  “Ever since I was a girl, church has not only been a place where I draw strength, it’s been a place for reflection, a place to study the teachings of the Lord and to feel grounded in a complex world,” she told RNS. “Church still plays that role for me. And I also draw something else from it as well: a sense of community and belonging where we can build lasting relationships and be there for one another in times of need.” Harris grew up in an interfaith family and chose to form an interfaith family as an adult. Her mother, an immigrant from India, took her to visit Hindu temples growing up. Harris has said this teaches her “to see that all faiths teach us to pursue justice.” If elected, Harris’ husband Douglas Emhoff wouldn’t just be the first person to hold the title of first gentleman. He’d also the first Jewish spouse of a president.  “From all of these traditions and teachings, I’ve learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,” Harris said about the Hindu and Jewish influences in her life.  Emhoff has also been a leader in the Biden-Harris administration at fostering interfaith dialogue and collaboration. I heard him speak at an interfaith iftar at the U.S. Institute of Peace in 2022 during Ramadan. Harris and Emhoff hosted an Eid al-Adha celebration in 2023, the first Eid celebration at the vice president’s residence.  One of the most exciting aspects of Harris’ potential candidacy is that she doesn’t shy away from making the religious case for abortion rights, meeting head on Trump’s alliance of Christian nationalist groups pushing to outlaw abortion on so-called religious claims.  Harris spoke on this matter at the National Baptist Convention: “As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And she will choose, in consultation with her pastor or her priest, or a doctor and her loved ones. But the government should not be making that decision.” Harris’ boldness is representative, as most Christians in the United States support abortion rights.  In 2021, Rev. Lauren Jones Mayfield was invited to the White House to participate in a roundtable discussion on reproductive health care with Harris. “Harris honored my religious voice as I intended for her to hear it, a deep valuing of American religious liberty and reproductive freedoms,” Jones Mayfield told me. “The vice president made clear her own support for reproductive health for all Americans alongside her ongoing commitments to religious liberty. For those of us who engage in reproductive rights activism of our faith, not in spite of it, Harris honored our collective, clerical voice that celebrates the American right for a patient to choose their best course of medical treatment with their doctor, family and faith leader if it’s so desired.” Rooted in the Black Church tradition, deeply informed and inspired by her interfaith family, and a trailblazer for reproductive freedom, Kamala Harris’ Christian faith is the antithesis of Donald Trump’s Christian nationalism, in which the Christian faith is wielded as a tool to oppress, exclude and limit basic rights of people who believe or pray differently.  If elected president, she would make history on multiple fronts: the first female president, the second Black president, and the first president of South Asian descent. She’ll also be a role model for confidently living out your faith in public while respecting others’ religious values."
Of course Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 10:35 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-kamala-harris-beat-trump-democrats-rcna162955,"By the end of last week, Joe Biden’s departure from the 2024 presidential campaign seemed a question of when, not if. But when the president finally announced his exit on Sunday afternoon, the preceding sense of inevitability didn’t lessen the shock of a political leader putting party and country above his own ambitions. In an era of intense political cynicism, Biden’s withdrawal is an extraordinarily selfless act. As Barack Obama wrote in a tribute to the man he selected as his running mate in 2008, ""we’ve also been reminded — again — that he's a patriot of the highest order.” Biden’s second announcement on Sunday, less than a half hour after the first, was equally momentous. By endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him as president, Biden has unified Democrats and put the party on solid footing to hold the White House in November. A Biden endorsement of his vice president always seemed like a foregone conclusion, but by putting his full political weight behind Harris, Biden ensured that no Democrat would seriously challenge her bid for the party’s nomination.  Not surprisingly, by Sunday evening, the wind at Harris’ back had reached hurricane strength. All the Democratic officials whose names have been bandied around as potential challengers to Harris — including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newson and Josh Shapiro — endorsed her bid for president. So, too, have former President Bill Clinton and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. As of Monday morning 178 members of the House and Senate Democratic caucuses had jumped on the Harris bandwagon. Key unions, abortion rights organizations and other outside groups quickly threw their support behind Harris. And Democrats appear poised to have one of the single best fundraising days in American history — raising $60 million in less than 24 hours At this point, Harris is likely to win the party’s nomination in Chicago by acclamation. But here’s the question that most concerns Democrats — can she beat Donald Trump? Critics will point out that Harris’s 2020 bid for the White House was a disaster — and they’re right. Her campaign was not just poorly managed, but it was difficult to discern a basic rationale for her candidacy. She came across as overly cautious, lacking a core set of beliefs. She struggled with staffing issues — a problem that persisted into her early days as vice president. That Harris is a polished and effective campaigner has never been in doubt. But it’s her management skills that have long been in question. But other presidents, including Biden himself, have succeeded after earlier failed campaigns. And the past three weeks have arguably lessened the concerns about Harris. Since Biden’s disastrous debate performance, pretty much every Democrat on the planet expressed either a public or private opinion about who should lead the party against Trump in November — with one notable exception, Kamala Harris. There have been zero leaks from Harris’ team or her political allies. She allowed no political daylight between her and Biden as she criss-crossed the country on behalf of the presidential ticket. And when the president dropped out, the vice president and her whip operation sprung into action, quickly lining up endorsements and support. In a matter of hours, Harris and Democrats had completely flipped the script on the 2024 campaign. Of course, the strategic problems that torpedoed Harris’ campaign four years ago could return between now and November. But one advantage for Harris is that the campaign’s trajectory and messaging have long been established. The Biden campaign sought to make 2024 a referendum on Trump. The Harris campaign will do the same. Her most important responsibility will be to make the case why another Trump term in office will be a disaster for America — and the best option for voters is to stay the course with Democrats. That she can do, and likely more effectively than the man she is replacing.  At the end of one of the most extraordinary 24-hour periods in American political history, it’s amazing what a difference one day can make. On Sunday morning, Democrats were in disarray, hopelessly divided and convinced that the 2024 election was already a lost cause. A day later, they are united and seemingly more determined than ever to end Trumpism once and for all. If they are successful, Joe Biden’s legacy will be set — as the man who stepped up to eject Donald Trump from the White House, and four years later as the man who stepped down to ensure Trump remained out of office.

Kamala Harris’ ‘top cop’ background complicates matters for GOP,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 9:57 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/kamala-harris-top-cop-2024-election-republicans-democrats-rcna163062,"Most American presidents were lawyers before seeking elected office, but the number of presidents with prosecutorial experience is vastly smaller. Vice President Kamala Harris would join this tiny club. The New York Times reported on the Democratic candidate’s professional background: A Time magazine report added that Harris, who campaigned in the Golden State as California’s “top cop,” also “developed a tough-on-crime reputation as district attorney.” This wasn’t a principal part of Harris’ pitch during her 2020 campaign, but that’s apparently about to change. In fact, it was just a couple of hours ago when the vice president’s political operation issued a press statement with a headline that read in part, “Donald Trump Won’t Be the First Felon Kamala Harris Holds Accountable.” For Republicans, this creates a challenge. At last week’s Republican National Convention, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird boasted about her party’s approach to law enforcement: “We put criminals where they belong: in jail.” Montana Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy added, “Cops are good, criminals are bad.” My personal favorite was a speech from House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who said with a straight face, “Donald Trump stands with the people and the police — our men and women in blue — not with the criminals and rioters.” It was around this time when convention attendees waved pre-printed “Back the Blue” signs. As we discussed soon after, there was a glaring problem with the rhetoric: A jury recently found Trump guilty of 34 felonies — which came on the heels of a different jury holding Trump liable for sexual assault — and the Republican happens to be running on a platform rooted in his support for rioters. But after President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race, the dynamic took on a greater significance. This isn’t just a situation in which Republicans have nominated a criminal for the nation’s highest office, it’s also a situation in which the GOP candidate will likely face someone with a record of putting criminals behind bars. The New York Times reported a few months ago on the “complicated relationship” between Trump and law enforcement, which touched on an underappreciated story. Emmer’s rhetoric about the former president “standing with the police” notwithstanding, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at those he’s described as “dirty cops,” as part of a larger offensive against law enforcement. He’s also condemned law enforcement officials as “fascists” and expressed support for prosecuting members of the Capitol police. Just as notably, Trump has promised pardons for insurrectionists, many of whom violently clashed with police officers. And that was before he prepared to take on a former prosecutor. Complicating matters, some of the top contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination — Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — are also former prosecutors, raising the prospect of two former prosecutors taking on the first presidential candidate in American history to be convicted of a crime. The Republican’s crimes and condemnations of law enforcement haven’t stopped multiple police unions from endorsing his 2024 candidacy — the first time in modern American history in which police unions have backed a criminal for national elected office — though it’s an open question as to whether they might reconsider. As for Trump, the former president said at a rally on Saturday: “You’re not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal.” Don’t be surprised if Team Harris puts that quote to use in the coming weeks and months."

A Texas Tribune report noted, “The possibility and timing of a special election to fill Jackson Lee’s seat for the remainder of the current term, which concludes in January, remain uncertain.” * Although there was some reporting over the weekend about Sen. Joe Manchin possibly rejoining the Democratic Party and running for president, the independent West Virginian told CBS News that he would not be a candidate. * For reasons that I do not understand, Donald Trump continued to rail against Biden Sunday night and Monday morning, including fresh allegations from the former president that the Democrat “never had Covid.” (If you’re confused about why the Republican keeps pushing this, you’re not alone.) * In a bit of a surprise, businessman Sandy Pensler ended his Republican U.S. Senate campaign in Michigan and agreed to back his primary rival, former Rep. Mike Rogers. * The Associated Press reported over the weekend, “An initiative to ask voters if they want to protect the right to a pre-viability abortion in Montana’s constitution has enough signatures to appear on the November ballot, supporters said Friday.” * Earlier this year, then-Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley declared, “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.” The on-camera quote has suddenly taken on greater meaning. * And if you’re wondering about Vice President Kamala Harris and the coconut tree meme, NPR apparently has you covered."
Flashback to 2018: Harris says she is keenly aware of what a barrier-breaking campaign would entail,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 8:58 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/flashback-2018-harris-says-keenly-aware-barrier-breaking-campaign-enta-rcna163048,"All eyes are on Vice President Kamala Harris following Joe Biden’s decision over the weekend to withdraw his candidacy for the U.S. presidency and to endorse her instead. If Harris, 59, become the Democratic nominee and defeats Republican candidate Donald Trump in November, she would be the first woman to serve as U.S. president. Harris previously served as the first woman and first Black attorney general and U.S. senator in California’s history. In December 2018, then-senator Harris headlined a Know Your Value event in San Francisco as she was considering making a bid for the presidency in 2020. Harris said she was keenly aware of the challenges a barrier-breaking campaign would entail. “Let’s be honest. It’s going to be ugly,” Harris told Know Your Value founder and “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski on stage in front of hundreds of women. “When you break things, it is painful. And you get cut. And you bleed.” Harris did end up making a bid for the nation’s top position, but withdrew her bid in December 2019, citing a lack of funding. In 2021, the vice president was honored on Forbes and Know Your Value’s inaugural “50 Over 50” list . During an interview with Brzezinski about the honor, Harris encouraged women not to view their age as a limitation and to follow their passions at every phase of their lives. “There is so much that we still need to do to encourage girls and women of every age to know and internalize their capacity, and to internalize their strength and their gift, whatever that may be—and to not be burdened by other peoples’ limited views of their capacity based on who has historically done what,” she said. Harris, then 56, added she has never used her age as a guide for her life plans— not even when others told her “no.” “I’ve never been one to do a five-year plan. Never. I’ve never evaluated myself based on my age,” Harris told Brzezinski. “...I’ve been told many times during my career, things from, ‘oh, you’re too young, ‘It’s not your turn,’ ‘They’re not ready for you.’ But I didn’t listen.” The vice president added: “I eat ‘no’ for breakfast.” And just last month, Brzezinski sat down with Harris to mark the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling striking down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which guaranteed the right to abortion in the United States. Accompanying Harris was Hadley Duvall, a young woman from Kentucky who  survived her stepfather’s sexual abuse as a child. Duvall teamed up with Harris to sound the alarm on what a second Trump presidency would mean for women in America. Harris declared that freedom is at stake in this year’s election. “Every person of whatever gender should understand that if such a fundamental freedom, such as the right to make decisions about your own body can be taken. Be aware of what other freedoms may be at stake,” said Harris. Brzezinski asked Harris why the presidential race is so close, to which Harris responded: “These races are always close …At the end of the day, we’re going to win ..Just look at what happened in the midterms, for example…Many talked about the red wave. I would call it a red drip. You look at where the American people were in so called red states, and so called blue states, every time this issue of abortion was on the ballot, the people voted for freedom …We have our differences, but the American people believe in the integrity of our country and our values, which include that we protect and fight for individual freedoms and liberties. And so I do believe that the contrast is clear. And in November, it will be stark.”  "
"Election denier Mike Johnson claims legal concern for Biden voters, democracy",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 8:52 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/mike-johnson-biden-harris-trump-rcna163013,"When you hear “Mike Johnson” in the same breath as “invalidating votes,” you might think of his role supporting unsuccessful efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential victory. But on Sunday, the Republican House speaker voiced purported concern about invalidating the votes of millions of Democratic primary voters, raising the specter of unspecified legal challenges to Democrats putting forward a different nominee than Biden against Donald Trump in November. For starters, there doesn’t appear to be any legal impediment to nominating someone besides Biden (seemingly Vice President Kamala Harris, at this point). Though Biden was the presumptive nominee after winning all but one Democratic contest earlier this year, he hadn’t officially been nominated. That process was expected to take place next month. And despite what some Republicans have claimed, the relevant state ballot deadlines for appearing on the ballot haven’t passed. And in this historic moment, it’s worth recalling Johnson’s support for invalidating votes in the 2020 election. When he became speaker last year, The New York Times called him “a silent but pivotal partner” in the failed effort, citing, among other things, that he “collected signatures for a legal brief in support of a Texas lawsuit, rooted in baseless claims of widespread election irregularities, that tried to throw out the results in four battleground states won by” Biden. Johnson is a lawyer, by the way.  Relatedly, there’s Johnson’s support for his party’s nominee, who is under criminal indictment for allegedly subverting the 2020 election. Trump’s federal election interference indictment, for example, alleges that, “on the pretext of baseless fraud claims, the Defendant pushed officials in certain states to ignore the popular vote; disenfranchise millions of voters; dismiss legitimate electors; and ultimately, cause the ascertainment of and voting by illegitimate electors in favor of the Defendant.” (Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases and was found guilty in the New York case, the only one to have gone to trial.) So while we should expect Johnson to continue supporting baseless legal claims to aid Republicans, right now it’s hard to see any merit to such claims. And even if legitimate issues arise, it will always be difficult to take Johnson seriously as a caretaker for democracy and the rule of law.

Team Trump (sort of) provides new info on post-shooting medical care,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 8:31 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/team-trump-sort-provides-new-info-post-shooting-medical-care-rcna163038,"For the first several days after a gunman attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, the former president and his political operation had surprisingly little to say about the medical care he’d received. What’s more, it wasn’t at all clear why they’d be tight-lipped about this. An Associated Press report noted last week that the public was “still in the dark over the extent of his injuries, what treatment the Republican presidential nominee received in the hospital, and whether there may be any long-term effects on his health. Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family.” CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta also had a good piece along these lines last week, noting that a full public assessment of Trump’s injuries “is necessary,” adding: “The concern is that gunshot blasts near the head can cause injuries that aren’t immediately noticeable, such as bleeding in or on the brain, damage to the inner ear or even psychological trauma. As a trauma neurosurgeon, I have seen how a thorough evaluation after any kind of gunshot wound can provide a complete picture and lead to a speedier recovery.” Since I wrote about this a few days ago, it seemed only fair to note that Team Trump did, in fact, eventually provide some additional information — at least, sort of. The Washington Post reported: To be sure, some transparency is better than no transparency, and it’s good to know that the former president is recovering well in the wake of the shooting nine days ago. But this doesn’t put the matter entirely to rest. Under normal circumstances, we’d expect to receive information from the physicians who actually treated Trump after the incident. There might even be a news conference or two. Instead, Team Trump waited a week before issuing a letter from a member of Congress — issued on Jackson’s congressional letterhead — who acknowledged two years ago that he had allowed his medical license in Florida to expire. (Jackson’s medical license remains in “military active” status until early next year.) This is the same Jackson who was slammed by the Pentagon’s inspector general’s office, which concluded in 2021 that Jackson engaged in “inappropriate conduct” while serving as Trump’s White House doctor, adding that the congressman “drank alcohol, made sexual comments to subordinates, and took the sedative Ambien while working as White House physician.” The watchdog also found that Jackson mistreated subordinates and “disparaged, belittled, bullied and humiliated them.” In 2022, the Navy demoted Jackson from admiral to captain as a consequence of his misconduct. The Washington Post’s report added: “Jackson worked in the White House medical unit under three presidents but drew scrutiny in a Pentagon inspector general’s report, which states that he provided prescription drugs without proper paperwork — a habit that allegedly earned him the nickname ‘Candyman.‘ Jackson has denied the report’s claims, describing them as politically motivated.” He was nevertheless elected to Congress, where Jackson ran into ethics troubles. Between Jackson’s record and Trump’s long-standing record of problematic medical disclosures, Saturday’s statement didn’t exactly resolve the larger concern.

Democrats celebrate President Biden’s ‘selfless and patriotic act’,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 7:46 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/democrats-celebrate-president-bidens-selfless-patriotic-act-rcna163029,"After President Joe Biden announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term, the Democratic incumbent wasted little time in endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris. The Californian, not surprisingly, issued a statement of her own that touted, among other things, Biden’s “remarkable legacy of accomplishment,” his leadership, his “honesty and integrity,” and his “big heart.” But there was one sentence in Harris’ statement that stood out for me: To acknowledge the obvious, Biden faced an incredibly difficult decision. The Delaware Democrat scored an impressive victory four years ago — by most measures, the best performance for a challenger since FDR — and took office facing daunting challenges, here and abroad. In the months and years that followed, Biden’s steady hand helped guide the nation through dangerous waters, putting his skills and experience to use. The result is a stronger and safer nation, well positioned for the future. In theory, his re-election should’ve been a foregone conclusion. In practice, it wasn’t nearly that simple, and his odds of electoral success were poor, despite his accomplishments. It must’ve been tempting for the president, confronting unwelcome evidence and pressure, to put his desire to serve above other considerations, but when push came to shove, Americans were reminded of who Joe Biden is. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni had a good column on “the bigness of what Biden just did.” It’s no secret that Biden has long dreamed of the presidency, first seeking the office 36 years ago. Having finally attained the office, and delivering on his promises, it’s not surprising that he was slow to listen to those who urged him to acknowledge unpleasant electoral realities. But in the American tradition, leaders became heroes, not just through the leadership, but also by choosing to voluntarily relinquish power for the benefit of the nation. Biden didn't just do the right thing with his decision to pass the torch, he did the patriotic thing — making a historic sacrifice for the good of the country — creating a case study for future generations to follow. Take a bow, Mr. President. You’ve earned it."
"Trump raises stakes in 2024 race, praises ‘iron fist’ leaders",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 6:42 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-raises-stakes-2024-race-praises-iron-fist-leaders-rcna163009,"In his bizarre speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Donald Trump strayed from his prepared text to share some thoughts about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. “Hungary, strong country,” the Republican said. “Run by a very powerful, tough leader. He’s a tough guy. The press doesn’t like him because he’s tough.” In reality, of course, it’s not just “the press” who has concerns with Orbán — and “tough” seemed like a ridiculous adjective given the circumstances. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem has explained, the Hungarian strongman has taken a series of steps in recent years to undermine democratic institutions, “through measures like consolidation of hundreds of media outlets under the control of political allies, gaming elections and using emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic to dramatically expand executive power.” Vox published a related report in 2018 on “how democracy died in Hungary.” It noted a vote from the European Parliament, which labelled Orbán’s government a “systemic threat to the rule of law.” Closer to home, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said just a couple of weeks ago that Orbán is also “completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians.” And yet, Trump can’t seem to shake his affection for the Hungarian leader, which leads to a related question: Does the former president admire Orbán despite the apparent fact that he’s “completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians” or because of it? The question returned to the fore over the weekend, when Trump spoke in Michigan and reiterated his praise for foreign autocrats. As a Newsweek report noted: Trump clearly wasn’t kidding. “Orbán was right,” Trump continued. “We have to have somebody that can protect us.” When the political world looks at the Republican as a candidate who’s hostile toward democracy, part of the focus is on his failed White House term, when he was routinely indifferent to legal limits and constitutional boundaries, culminating in an effort to claim illegitimate power after an election defeat. There’s a related focus, of course, on his 2024 platform: Trump, a candidate who’s talked about “terminating” parts of the U.S. Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions, has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship.” He’s also vowing to reject election results he doesn’t like, created militarized camps, issue pardons for politically aligned criminals, and fire federal officials who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. But just as important is Trump looking to authoritarians as models worthy of emulation. Ahead of the 2016 elections, the then-GOP candidate was on record praising Saddam Hussein, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and even China’s handling of the Tiananmen Square massacre. (Seeing images of brave Chinese democrats standing in defiance in front of tanks, Trump sided who deployed the tanks.) Ahead of the 2024 elections, he’s doing it again. Trump offers gushing admiration for Beijing’s “ruthless” control over China’s population. He struggles to contain how impressed he is with his benefactor in Moscow. He celebrates Orbán “because he says, ‘This is the way it’s going to be,’ and that’s the end of it. ... He’s the boss.” He heralds Kim Jong Un as an “absolute leader.” He asks his followers to believe, “It’s nice to have a strongman running the country.” This keeps happening for a reason: Trump expresses public admiration for dictators, not despite their authoritarian control, but because of it. In the process, the former president keeps raising the stakes in the 2024 race. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
"In the new 2024 race, Trump hedges on debating Kamala Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 5:40 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-2024-race-trump-hedges-debating-kamala-harris-rcna163003,"It’s difficult to overstate just how eager Donald Trump was to debate President Joe Biden. Last summer, for example, the Republican said the debates “definitely” have to happen. Soon after, the former president suggested he’d like to see 10 debates, rather than the usual three. As regular readers might recall, Trump used his social media platform in the spring to declare that he was prepared to debate the Democratic incumbent “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE,” regardless of who organizes the events. A month later, the former president headlined a rally in Wisconsin and appeared alongside an empty podium on the stage. “This is for Joe Biden,” Trump said. “I am trying to get him to debate.” It was not subtle. The GOP nominee worked from the assumption that a one-on-one debate against the incumbent would go his way, and as it turns out, it did. But now that Biden has decided to forgo his re-election plans, is the former president equally eager to share a stage with Vice President Kamala Harris? Here was the message Trump published to his social media platform a few hours after Biden’s announcement: At this point, we could note that there’s literally zero evidence of Biden being corrupt; presidential scholars consider Trump the worst president in American history; ABC News is neither “fake” nor “very biased; and Trump’s deliberate misspelling of George Stephanopoulos’ name makes the Republican look like an ill-tempered tween.But as relevant as those details are, let’s not miss the forest for the trees: When it came to a possible debate against Biden, Trump said, “ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE.” When it comes to a possible debate against Harris, Trump’s message is ... noticeably different. What’s more, Politico reported overnight, “One GOP source tells me he doubts Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris — he’ll likely call her an illegitimate candidate.” In fairness, it’s worth emphasizing that Jason Miller, a senior member of the former president’s campaign team, told NBC News that there will “definitely” be another debate. Whether his boss ends up agreeing remains to be seen."
Why Republicans have reason to worry about the 2024 race shake-up,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 5:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/republicans-reason-worry-2024-race-shake-rcna162998,"As the Republican National Convention wrapped up four days ago, party officials could hardly believe their good fortune. Republican expectations had reached extraordinary heights, which was understandable under the circumstances: The party was united; their candidate was leading; their opponents were splintered; and the Democratic incumbent appeared on track to lose. For his part, Donald Trump wasn’t just telling people privately he’d win, he’d also started talking about the post-election transition period, as if his 2024 victory were a given. Everything was on track — until the race changed. The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta had a good report on this overnight, noting that Republicans, with striking speed, went from “cocky ... to fearful,” in large part because they assumed President Joe Biden would never abandon his re-election candidacy. A Politico headline said the Republican Party was “pretty pissed” by the Democratic incumbent’s surprise announcement, adding, “It’s striking how much GOP anger there is over today’s news. Donald Trump’s campaign is built to beat Joe Biden.” Democrats, meanwhile, have made a similar transition — from despair about a looming defeat to cautious hopes about a race reborn. To be sure, there’s still some uncertainty about the process and the relevant details, and it’d be an overstatement to start describing Vice President Kamala Harris as the presumptive nominee. But let’s not play games. Delegates are on board with Harris. So are Democratic governors and members of Congress. And the Clintons. And Cabinet members. And labor unions. And donors — both large and small. Perhaps most importantly, a Harris-vs-Trump contest offers contrasts that Democrats like. At this time 24 hours ago, the presidential race was a contest between two old and unpopular men. Now, barring any surprises, the contest is dramatically different. In a year in which focus group members say they’re looking for a younger candidate, Republicans are running the oldest presidential nominee in American history against a likely Democratic candidate who’s nearly two decades younger. In a year in which many voters are concerned about crime, Republicans are running a man who’s committed dozens of felonies against a former prosecutor who’s brought criminals to justice. In a year in which some voters might care about experience, Republicans are running the least experienced presidential ticket in generations against a Democrat who’s spent the last 20 years serving the public well. I spoke to someone overnight who works in Democratic politics who said a Harris-Trump contest would be “the future vs the past.” No wonder Republicans are feeling anxious."
Kamala Harris is the right choice to continue Joe Biden’s legacy,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 22, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-next-president-joe-biden-legacy-rcna162596,"The seesaw battle for the soul of the Democratic Party is finally over. A long three weeks after Joe Biden’s debate debacle against Donald Trump, with scores of party leaders and big-time donors expressing zero confidence in his physical ability to endure the rigors of the campaign trail, our 46th president has called it quits.   It wasn’t easy for Biden to reach this decision. By nature, he is a relentless crusader on behalf of America’s working class. His Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the among the most historic pieces of legislation since Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society victories in the 1960s. But at 81 years old, Biden — who refused to take a cognitive test — has reached the end of the line. The Democratic Party’s burden of derailing Trump’s backward-looking isolationism, nativism and racial divisiveness takes a Democratic nominee with the stamina to deliver five energetic speeches a day. This rule does not apply to Trump: He is a MAGA cult leader with his own Truth Social network at his disposal in a nanosecond. It couldn’t have been easy for Biden to reach this decision, because, as he’s said many times, he really has proven how to get “Big Deal” beneficial things done for America’s middle class. But now, after much hand-wringing and fretting over abysmal approval ratings, Biden has returned to his previous 2020 political position. “Look,” he said then, “I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else. There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.” That future is now. But Biden himself prepared us for this moment four years ago, when he selected Kamala Harris as his running mate. As Trump and his campaign deployed racist dog whistles, Biden chose a brilliant 59-year-old California woman with a Jamaican-born economics professor for a father and an India-born research scientist for a mother. Countering Trump’s innate sexism and lawlessness, Biden recognized and valued the incisive intelligence Harris had honed as a courtroom prosecutor, district attorney, attorney general and senator. Now Vice President Harris must use those skills to send Trumpism writ large into history’s dustbin. Everyone who truly knows Harris, not the media, knows she is brilliant and an empathetic voice for social justice. The vice president’s family — as recounted in her excellent memoir, “The Truths We Hold” — is part of the great American immigrant success story. When Trump said at a 2023 New Hampshire rally that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” Harris’ response came swift and hard. “It is language meant to divide us,” she said later the same day, likening Trump’s vitriol to “the language of Hitler.”  Born in Oakland, California, in 1964, Harris was raised in college towns in the Midwest before graduating from high school in Quebec. She then returned to America and attended Washington, D.C.’s prestigious Howard University before she resettled in her birth state for law school. After graduation, Harris became a prosecutor and was eventually elected San Francisco’s district attorney in 2003. Over the next dozen years, she worked her way up to elected posts as the state’s attorney general and then its junior senator. Columnist Joe Mathews put his own spin on it: “Is there any better preparation for running a country … than a political career in a state as crazy as California?”   Harris arrived on the national scene in tumultuous political times, entering the Senate just as Donald Trump entered the White House. As Trump’s presidency opened floodgates of right-wing activism across the land, she earned a reputation as one of the Senate’s most forceful interrogators, skewering the likes of Attorney General William Barr and Supreme Court nominee (now Justice) Brett Kavanaugh. When Joe Biden selected her as his running mate four years ago, he was already thinking about the next chapter of her history, and of America’s. Donald Trump and the Electoral College had denied America its first female president in 2016. But Biden’s endorsement of Harris once again opens the White House door to finally have America’s first female president. The passing of the Democratic Party leadership to Harris has come earlier than our 46th president had hoped. But Biden — the inveterate institutionalist, strategist and political fighter — had set up his heir apparent in advance: Kamala Harris.  Extending his presidential legacy was the motivation for Andrew Jackson in the early 1830s. On track for easy re-election, Jackson proposed that after he won he would immediately resign, leaving the top job to his vice presidential running mate, the personable Martin Van Buren. Devoid of any imperial attitude toward the presidency, Jackson considered it as just another job, in which withdrawal or resignation due to changing circumstances could and should be commonplace. Only when Martin Van Buren balked on minor grounds did Jackson abandon his plan.      By the time President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose a new running mate in 1944, he’d been in office 12 years. As with Biden, his focus was innately on the future, and self-awareness of his own ill health must certainly have had him thinking of a potential successor. His ultimate choice, Sen. Harry S. Truman of Missouri, may have been fairly obscure, but no one knew better than Roosevelt what the job of the presidency required. And when Truman ascended to the office upon Roosevelt’s death in 1945, his instinct was borne out. Today, Truman is regarded as one of the very best presidents in U.S. history. Another member of that august group, President Dwight Eisenhower, was keenly aware that a president’s job included setting up a strong bench of future leaders. Though popular with his party and the electorate during his first term, the 66-year-old Eisenhower wasn’t convinced that he remained the man for the job. In a letter to his personal physician, he used a football analogy to explain why: A good quarterback, he wrote, “may have all of the wisdom to be derived from years of experience in the game. But when the need arises, he has to throw himself unreservedly into the play. … If we merely needed a brain on the field, a quarterback could play if he had to be in a wheelchair; but that isn’t true in his case, nor is it in the presidency.” Ike elaborated on this theme in his diary, noting that there is a “greater likelihood that a man of 70 will break down under a load than a man of 50” and that to win, his party needed top-tier candidates “in positions of the highest responsibility so as to symbolize … youth, vigor.” A decade later, facing the prospect of a re-election campaign in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson worried not so much about his age as about his own unpopularity’s dragging his party to defeat. Announcing his decision not to seek a second term, he framed the campaign horse race as a distraction from the real work of governing. “With America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day,” he said, “I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes, or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office.” For four years now, Vice President Harris has been in the trenches fighting against right-wing populist forces challenging America’s future here at home and abroad. During her term, Harris has traveled extensively, visiting 21 countries on missions ranging from humanitarian to military. She was a point person for the administration on immigration, on climate and on women’s right to health care and reproductive freedom. Sometimes studious, sometimes vivacious, she has emerged as the very antithesis of Trump. Harris and Trump now offer voters the starkest political contrast in U.S. campaign history since 1860.  Where Harris is rational, Trump is bombastic. By virtue of Harris’ legal training, she instinctively deals in facts. Former President Trump is a showman extraordinaire who doesn’t let truth get in the way of scoring a shazam moment. Where she’s compassionate, he is often the bully of the bully pulpit.  Make no mistake, though, Harris can be the toughest presence in any room. But being combative in one-on-one political showdowns — like she was with Kavanaugh and Barr — isn’t her default modus operandi. In an old-fashioned but multicultural 21st century way, Harris is an avatar of Duty, Honor and Country. A vote for Kamala Harris this November, in essence, is a vote for the legacy of Joe Biden."

Joseph McCarthy’s activities -- and his troubling connections to those on the ultra right -- are exposed in the press, Democratic Sen. Lester Hunt launches a final effort to take McCarthy on and rein in his abuses. In response, McCarthy and his allies launch a coordinated blackmail campaign against Hunt, using his own family, that will ultimately end in tragedy Announcer: This episode contains descriptions that reference self-harm. If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or chat live at 988lifeline.org. (NBC NEWS RADIO CHIMES) Rick Ewig: This is an interview with Mr. Lester C. Hunt, Jr. Mr. Hunt is a historian teaching in a Chicago-area college. This interview is being conducted on December 29, 1979, in Mr. Hunt’s home on Cornell Avenue in Chicago. Rachel Maddow: That is the voice of a grad student at the University of Wyoming. His name is Rick Ewig. It’s 1979, and Mr. Ewig is doing this interview for a research paper. The paper is about a U.S. senator from Wyoming, Lester Hunt. He’s in Chicago to interview the son of the senator. Ewig: His father was a United States senator from the state of Wyoming who served in the Senate from 1949 to 1954. Maddow: It was 25 years since Lester Hunt had served in the Senate; 25 years since he died. But this grad student managed to track down the senator’s son and namesake, Lester Hunt, Jr., who had always been known by the name Buddy. Radio Anchor: Taking seats right next to Mrs. Hunt, Buddy Hunt, son of His Excellency Governor Lester C. Hunt of Wyoming.  Maddow: Buddy Hunt had been a young man when his father died. He’d been 26 years old. Ewig: Okay, what I’d like to start out with first is, like, a general background on your father, since I really don’t know much about him. Lester C. “Buddy” Hunt, Jr.: Well, let me see. What do you want from me? Like, you know, beginning to end sort of thing? Ewig: Okay, well, for my own benefit that I would -- I would like to have is a physical description of him. Was he your size or? Buddy Hunt: How interesting. He’s taller than I am, had light brown hair, as you probably know, and white later. He was corpulent. And often as fat as I am, although not always. And round-chested, you know, heavy built. Women thought he was very charming. He had a good smile and a sort of pleasant face. His sort of face did not put people off. Maddow: There was a lot that Buddy remembered about his dad. How he never touched a drop of alcohol in his life. How good a baseball player he was. How he had decided to become a dentist, not exactly for the love of medicine, but just as a way to build a bigger, fuller life for himself and his family. He remembered that the career his dad built after being a dentist, that one was the real passion for him.  Buddy Hunt: He would often talk about how he enjoyed his dental practice and this and that, but it was clear, I think, from our point of view, that what he liked was politics and dentistry was a way to make a living. Anyhow, that’s the way we saw it, and that’s sort of the way my mother and sister and I sort of talk about it, at least. And he loved politics. He just loved it. Maddow: He loved politics. One of the things that stuck out the most for Buddy about his dad, even all those years later, was how hard he had worked at that job that he really loved. Buddy Hunt: He worked a lot of nights, a lot of weekends. But, on the whole, he didn’t bring his work home. So that at home, we didn’t -- we talked about personal things, you know, family things and so forth. And he didn’t talk much politics at home. He was glad to get it off his mind when he came home.  Maddow: “He was glad to get it off his mind when he came home.” And maybe it was for that reason, Senator Hunt not bringing his work home, that there was quite a lot that the senator’s own family didn’t know about him in terms of what he was contending with at work day to day. That was certainly true when it came to the darkest chapter of his time in politics, his time in Washington. And that was the reason this grad student was interviewing Buddy Hunt in the first place. During the interview in Chicago, he pulled out some old newspaper articles for Buddy to take a look at. They were from right after his dad died. Articles written by Washington journalists Drew Pearson and Marquis Childs. They had to do with the specific circumstances surrounding the death of Senator Lester Hunt.  Ewig: Have you read the things that were written by Drew Pearson or Marquis Childs?  Buddy Hunt: No. No. Ewig: You haven’t read any of that?  Buddy Hunt: No, I haven’t. Ewig: Oh. Because they say basically that -- you know, that your father was being blackmailed.  Buddy Hunt: Oh, they did?  Maddow: Blackmailed. It was maybe not the sort of question Buddy Hunt expected to get from this grad student who was just there interviewing him for a research paper. Ewig: They say basically that -- you know, that your father was being blackmailed.  Buddy Hunt: Oh, they did?  Ewig: Yeah.  Buddy Hunt: By whom? I don’t -- Ewig: It was by Senators Welker and Bridges at the time. Maddow: It was by Senators Welker and Bridges, two Republican U.S. senators.  Ewig: You know, I have the things here if you’d like to look at them.  Buddy Hunt: Yeah, I might. I don’t -- I don’t think I’ve seen them. I might have seen those and, you know, ignored them because I -- Ewig: Yeah, well, this here, this one is by Drew Pearson, that one came out shortly after your father died, like a few days. Buddy Hunt: Uh huh. Interesting. I didn’t see this. Maddow: Buddy Hunt here is reading these newspaper articles detailing a blackmail campaign by these other senators against his father.  Ewig: And Marquis Childs says basically the same thing as -- Buddy Hunt: Uh huh, uh huh. No, I didn’t see that. It may be that nobody told me this, in order not to tell me this, you know, and then — Ewig: Yeah. Maddow: You can hear it in Buddy’s voice. He’s almost speechless. But it’s there in black and white in front of him. It’s detailed reporting.  Buddy Hunt: I don’t know anything about that. But maybe I -- maybe I wasn’t supposed to. Maybe that was the whole issue.  Ewig: That could be.  Maddow: Because buried in these old newspaper articles Buddy Hunt had never seen before was not just the reporting that Buddy’s dad had been blackmailed. It was also the reporting that the blackmail had to do with Buddy.  Buddy Hunt: The only blackmail thing I see here is in regard to me. Am I missing something?  Ewig: No, that’s basically it. Buddy Hunt: No. Yeah, yeah. Maddow: “The only blackmail thing I see here is in regard to me.” That’s what Buddy Hunt says there. And he is right about that. The blackmail that preceded his father’s death was in regard to Buddy. What it was really about, though, was the fact that his father, Democratic Senator Lester Hunt, had made a very powerful, very dangerous enemy in Washington, a man with almost superhuman talent for dominating every news cycle. A man with a chain of serious ethics problems, personal problems, corruption scandals. A man who had been caught in innumerable lies, flagrant lies, on issues big and small, trivial and serious. All of which seemed to only increase his followers’ belief that he was the only one they could trust, the only politician they truly believed in. He had been aligning himself with some of the most dangerous forces in the country, who saw in him not just someone they agreed with, but someone whose approach to power might succeed in what they wanted. It might succeed in taking the country apart. His critics described him as a would-be American dictator, and warned that his power might be growing even beyond his own party’s ability to stop him. That he might make it to the apex of American power, to the White House, no matter what any entity in politics might do to try to stop him. His political opponents had sought to have him censured, impeached, expelled from the Senate. Not only had he survived all of it, but each successive failed confrontation appeared to make him stronger, his base of support all the more energized. And those battles had been costly. His opponents would not only find themselves unsuccessful in their efforts to stop him, they would then find themselves targeted in response with every kind of attack, breaking every kind of rule. Rules of the Senate. Rules of decency. In Washington, Lester Hunt had made the kind of enemy who wouldn’t even think twice about trying to destroy an opponent by attacking a man’s family, by using his own son against him.  Ewig: This is a tough question to ask.  Buddy Hunt: Ask anything you want.  Ewig: Why do you think that your father did kill himself?  Maddow: This is “Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra.” Roger McDaniel: He had seen McCarthy ruin people’s lives, in some cases drive people to suicide.  Reporter: Former senator found shot to death in his Washington home today.  McDaniel: Hunt was one of the very few politicians at the time who challenged McCarthy. Senator Lester C. Hunt: It’s being used as a special privilege for a few, very few, irresponsible members of Congress.  McDaniel: This opportunity presents itself for him to take revenge on Lester Hunt.  ******************************** Maddow: Episode 6: Under Pressure. Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr.: I have introduced an amendment to the Constitution of the United States -- Maddow: As political nicknames go, it wasn’t the strongest. But it fit, and so everybody used it. Everybody called him Young Bob. La Follette: -- which would give the people the right to vote on the question of peace or war.  Maddow: Young Bob La Follette. The “Young” was to distinguish him from his dad, who was also named Bob. The older Bob, Robert La Follette, was political royalty in Wisconsin. District attorney, congressman, governor, U.S. senator. He’d even made a run for president as the candidate for the Progressive Party.  It was one of the most successful third-party presidential runs ever. He was a household name. And then so was his son, Young Bob, who succeeded him in the U.S. Senate. When Young Bob was elected to that Senate seat, he was only 30 years old, one of the youngest senators in U.S. history.  La Follette: I believe that it presents a great opportunity for service to your state and to the nation. Maddow: Young Bob La Follette was a Republican. Like his father, he was also progressive. He was pro-labor, a critic of big business, a champion of civil liberties. He was pro-FDR’s New Deal. And although he had been an isolationist ahead of World War II -- he’d even been involved with the America First Committee -- nevertheless, FDR liked him back. Roosevelt, in fact, liked Young Bob so much that he considered naming him Secretary of State or to the Supreme Court, or even tapping him as a potential vice presidential running mate, even though they were from different parties. Young Bob was also loudly and firmly anti-communist. An issue which was much more important to him than it was at the time to an unknown political upstart who challenged him for his Wisconsin Senate seat in 1946.  Reporter: Today’s guest, Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Maddow: When Joseph McCarthy primaried Young Bob La Follette in 1946, Young Bob wasn’t all that young anymore. He had been in the Senate for a couple of decades. And McCarthy blasted him as a creature of Washington who had lost touch with what was going on back home in Wisconsin. McCarthy told voters that Young Bob actually lived in Virginia, even though he had never lived there.  McCarthy said La Follette was corrupt, that he was using his influence in the Senate to enrich himself. That wasn’t true either. But McCarthy campaigned with incredible energy, and in a low-turnout August primary election, he won that big upset. Before McCarthy had come along, that U.S. Senate seat had been in the hands of someone named Bob La Follette for more than 40 years. But that is how McCarthy got his seat in the Senate, by cutting off a legendary political dynasty.  McCarthy biographer Larry Tye says Joe McCarthy called that race against Young Bob the sweetest political triumph of his entire life. Soon after he lost that race and left the Senate, Young Bob wrote an article for Collier’s magazine on a topic that was still an animating concern for him. He wrote, “I know from firsthand experience that communist sympathizers have infiltrated into committee staffs on Capitol Hill in Washington. A few years ago when I was chairman of the Senate Civil Liberties Committee, I was forced to take measures in an effort to stamp out influence within my own committee staff.” It was 1947 when Young Bob wrote that. He wrote it years before Joe McCarthy ever picked up anti-communism as his signature issue. But once McCarthy did latch on to that issue and rode it to the heights of political power -- Reporter: You believe as of the moment there are Communists in the State Department?  Senator Joseph R. McCarthy: Communists or worse.  Maddow: Young Bob developed a strong suspicion that McCarthy was going to come back for him. That McCarthy would haul him before his committee in Congress, berate him live on television about these communists that Young Bob had admitted to knowing about on his Senate committee staff. He’d admitted to it in that magazine article. Well, why hadn’t he sounded an alarm about it at the time? Why hadn’t he called the FBI? Why was he so soft on this issue? In the end, McCarthy never got his chance to ask. Reporter: Headlines, Washington. Former Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr. of Wisconsin was found shot to death in his Washington home today. Apparently he died by his own hand. He was 58.  Maddow: Robert La Follette, Jr. drove home from work, closed himself in the bathroom, and shot himself with a pistol his father had given him when he was a kid. Young Bob was known to have had a long history with depression. He also reportedly harbored deep regret about losing the U.S. Senate seat once held by his dad.  But according to his own son, it was the threat of being dragged in front of Congress by Joe McCarthy that most directly contributed to him taking his own life. La Follette told multiple people in the days before he died that he thought McCarthy had him in his sights. La Follette’s son told McCarthy biographer Larry Tye that he was fairly sure that McCarthy himself had actually called up Young Bob and personally made the threat that he was going to investigate him. His son said, quote, “My dad committed suicide instead of being called before McCarthy’s committee. No question at all.” McCarthy: I don’t much give a tinker’s damn what anyone says about the methods. I don’t much care about the advice to stop. This job must continue, my good friends. It will continue as far as I am concerned, as long as I am in the United States Senate, regardless of whether we hurt Democrats or Republicans or anyone else.  Maddow: During his time in the Senate, Joe McCarthy racked up a long list of people he hurt. Principled members of both parties who couldn’t stomach what McCarthy was doing and who tried to stop him. There was Senator Raymond Baldwin.  Steven Remy: Raymond Baldwin was a moderate Republican senator. He was fair-minded and he was conscientious.  Maddow: Baldwin chaired the Malmedy investigation in Congress, the committee McCarthy hijacked and turned into a forum to spread false anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda. Baldwin was so exhausted by McCarthy’s behavior, so repulsed by dealing with him, that he up and quit the Senate altogether once the Malmedy investigation was done. The Malmedy report came out in October. Raymond Baldwin resigned his seat and left the Senate by December. Senator Raymond E. Baldwin: It has been indeed a rare privilege and opportunity to serve this grand little state of Connecticut.  Maddow: Next was Maryland Senator Millard Tydings. Tydings was the conservative Democratic senator who had investigated and disproven McCarthy’s claims about supposed communists running rampant in the U.S. State Department.  Senator Millard E. Tydings: Have you in your possession any memorandum, any affidavit, any paper?  Maddow: McCarthy took revenge on Tydings by fabricating that fake photo of the senator posed next to a famous communist. Thanks to that dirty trick and to a blizzard of anti-Tydings attacks in the pro-McCarthy conservative press, Millard Tydings lost his seat in the Senate. McCarthy gloated about it, deriding him as Little Millard. McCarthy: Little Millard is with us no longer.  Maddow: Next would be Senator William Benton.  Announcer: Our distinguished guest for this evening is the Honorable William F. Benton, United States senator from Connecticut. Maddow: William Benton introduced an expulsion resolution against McCarthy to kick him out of the Senate altogether. In an hours-long exposition, which was more like an indictment, Benton laid out McCarthy’s record in detail on the Senate floor. Everything from his lies on behalf of the Nazis in the Malmedy investigation to his personal financial corruption to that fake photo dirty trick he used against Senator Tydings. Benton called McCarthy “an amoral man of corruptibility, mendacity, and gross irresponsibility who had followed a pattern of distortion and deceit.” In response, McCarthy declared war. He hired a lawyer, believe it or not, yet another lawyer who defended Nazis at the Nuremberg trials. And with the assistance of that counsel, he filed a multimillion-dollar libel suit against Senator Benton. He baselessly accused him of having distributed lewd material during his time at the U.S. State Department. He called him the hero of every communist, and he taunted him as Little Willie Benton, Connecticut’s mental midget. Radio Host: So if you are a member of the Senate next year -- Senator William B. Benton: You mean when I’m a member of the Senate next year. Host: Yes, when you’re a member of the Senate next year.  Maddow: After the onslaught from McCarthy, William Benton did lose his seat. He was voted out. Joe McCarthy just plowed down any opponent who stood up against him. And even though he went after Republicans as well as Democrats, members of his own Republican Party mostly just stood by and watched it happen. In awe of his power, how nothing seemed to take him down, how every confrontation, every scandal just seemed to increase his standing with his supporters. McDaniel: When they didn’t stand up to him, it only got worse. It only emboldened him. And the number of lives that he ruined continued to mount up. Maddow: That’s Wyoming author Roger McDaniel. By the time Joe McCarthy had taken down Senator Baldwin and Senator Tydings and Senator Benton, there was almost no one left in the Senate who was brave enough to stand up to McCarthy. Almost no one. Senator Monrad C. Wallgren: It gives me pleasure to introduce to you at this time the Honorable Lester Hunt.  Maddow: Lester Hunt, senator from Wyoming. Like Raymond Baldwin and Millard Tydings and William Benton, Lester Hunt was disgusted by the way Joe McCarthy conducted himself in politics. Not only what he was doing to his political enemies, but what McCarthy’s type of politics was doing to the country. Unlike his colleagues, though, Lester Hunt had a unique vantage point to it all. Literally. McDaniel: Buddy Hunt told me that their home overlooked Joe McCarthy’s apartment.  Maddow: Lester Hunt and Joe McCarthy were not just fellow senators. They were neighbors in Washington. They shared a property line, which gave Lester Hunt literally clear sight lines into not just how Senator McCarthy behaved in the halls of the Senate when the lights and the cameras were on him, but how he behaved in private, too.  McDaniel: From their backyard, they could look across the way and see the apartment where McCarthy had a patio and they would watch him womanizing and drinking. It was just disgusting to this, well, this man of Lester Hunt’s integrity. Maddow: Lester Hunt had learned from the senators who came before him that publicly calling out McCarthy’s bad behavior came with real risk.  McDaniel: By now, he had seen McCarthy ruin people’s lives, cost them their jobs, their livelihoods, in some cases, drive people to suicide.  Maddow: But Lester Hunt was undaunted and he found a way to fight back. For years, going all the way back to the Malmedy investigation and to McCarthy’s false attacks on Anna Rosenberg, back before Joe McCarthy was famous, Lester Hunt had watched McCarthy at work. He had watched him traffic in disinformation and defamation and just lies, lies that McCarthy told with impunity and also with immunity. McDaniel: He came to understand that McCarthy was protected from any liability for slander or libel by the Constitution.  Maddow: McCarthy was shielded by the U.S. Constitution, by the Speech and Debate Clause, which protects members of Congress from being sued for anything they say in Congress, even if it’s slander or defamation. It’s a constitutional protection for the freedom and independence of the legislative branch of government. It makes sense, but it is also open to abuse, abuse that Senator Joseph McCarthy made into an art form.  And so, problem solver Lester Hunt proposed a reform, one that was designed to hit Senator Joe McCarthy right between the eyes.  Theodore Granik: Senator Lester C. Hunt of Wyoming has introduced a resolution making members of Congress legally responsible and legally liable for their words and actions. Senator Hunt, is our congressional immunity being used today for the purposes originally intended by our founding fathers?  Lester Hunt: It is not. I would say we’re using it today for an entirely different purpose. Maddow: Lester Hunt introduced legislation. He wrote newspaper op-eds. He did interviews. He went on the radio speaking as a senator. He said it was time to stop, to legally stop, senators from making false allegations and lying about people to hurt them. Lester Hunt’s proposal was to limit congressional immunity, basically to allow regular citizens to sue senators for slander. Lester Hunt: Are you contending that as a United States senator, you have the right on the floor of the Senate to call somebody a communist? Not with the true knowledge or facts that he is a communist. He may be an enemy of yours. You may have some ulterior motives. That man is smeared, then, throughout the United States for the rest of his life. Now, do you mean to say that there should be no means whereby that man can get redress for that injury that has been done to him?  McDaniel: That was a direct attack on McCarthy. Lester Hunt was motivated by what he had seen. Lester Hunt: I say it’s being used as a special privilege for a few, very few, irresponsible members of Congress who say things in their remarks and get them printed in the record that never should have been in there.  Maddow: When Lester Hunt made this proposal, when he argued for it in public, he started getting piles of mail from all over the country, people thanking him for what he was doing. One man wrote to him, “It is certainly about time that irresponsible members like Senator McCarthy be prevented from defaming average citizens.” One woman from New York wrote to him, “Millions of decent real Americans read with great pleasure your denunciation of certain senators, and we know whom you have in mind.” McDaniel: He thought that somebody had to make a drastic proposal, and so he chose to do that. There was no mistake who it was aimed at, and McCarthy knew that, but so did everybody else.  Maddow: One of the people Lester Hunt reached out to at the time he was pushing this proposal was the journalist Drew Pearson. Drew Pearson: This is Drew Pearson. I’ll be back in a minute with an exclusive story -- Maddow: Drew Pearson had his own history with McCarthy, and he was about to break some news about exactly what kind of lies McCarthy had told back when Hunt and McCarthy first met during the Malmedy investigation. McCarthy’s actions during that investigation, his promotion of disproven Nazi propaganda, it had remained a bit of a mystery. Why had this American senator acted as a mouthpiece for the Nazis? How had he ever gotten hooked up with that barrage of false information that was coming out of Germany?  Pearson: McCarthy abused American army officers because they convicted the Nazis who shot American soldiers in cold blood at Malmedy.  Maddow: Drew Pearson now reported that during the Malmedy investigation, Joe McCarthy had been receiving packages in brown manila envelopes in the Senate. McCarthy had in fact left behind one of those big brown envelopes in one of the Malmedy hearing rooms. Inside the envelope was the information he had been citing at the hearings and in his speeches and press releases about Malmedy.  This was the inflammatory disinformation about the supposed torture of the innocent Nazis by Jews in the U.S. Army. Where had he gotten that information? Well, funny story. Drew Pearson reported that on the envelope McCarthy left behind in the hearing room, there was a return address listed in the upper left-hand corner. It said, quote, “Rudolf Aschenauer, Munich, Germany.”  Remy: He’s a cagey character and he’s deeply embedded in the quasi-underground post-war German far-right. Maddow: U.S. Army counterintelligence in Germany had told the Senate investigators that the false attacks on the Malmedy prosecution were coming from unrepentant Nazis in Germany who were trying to get back into power. In their report, the senators had described Nazi defense lawyer Rudolf Aschenauer as the key man in that effort.  Remy: Rudolf Aschenauer was a German lawyer and a former Nazi who had not really renounced his allegiance to national socialism. Maddow: What Drew Pearson was now reporting was that McCarthy’s disinformation on Malmedy, what he was pushing to the American public, the so-called evidence that he said demanded an investigation into the Malmedy trial, it was coming to him from the source.  Remy: The evidence indicates that Rudolf Aschenauer was indirectly an important source of the torture stories for Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Maddow: Through a pro-German advocacy group, Rudolf Aschenauer, the Nazi mastermind of the Malmedy torture hoax, the leader in Nazi groups trying to return to power in Germany, he personally was stovepiping totally false, anti-American, anti-Semitic propaganda to an American senator. That senator ripped open the envelopes in which he received this stuff, and then he fed it as propaganda right to the American public.  Reporter: The senators are probing reports that the Germans were beaten and starved to get confessions from them.  Maddow: Drew Pearson now reported that the evidence of what McCarthy had done, his involvement with that Nazi lawyer, had been, quote, “locked in the secret files of the Senate Armed Services Committee, known only to the committee members themselves.” Committee members like Lester Hunt.  Lester Hunt: You will agree with me that certain derogatory, certain slanderous, certain libel, certain smearing statements are made in the halls of Congress. Not often, but they are made. Senator John C. Stennis: Unfortunately, yes. Maddow: And then Drew Pearson had more. He would soon report that that Nazi lawyer, Aschenauer, had been running a number of agents inside the United States, pro-Nazi operators who were working to advance the Nazi cause in post-war Germany and around the world and here in the U.S. One of those agents was a senior figure in the National Renaissance Party, the uniformed street-fighting Nazi militia headquartered in Yorkville, New York, where McCarthy had accepted an invitation to speak at a rally chaired by one of the group’s members.  He only backed out after reporters described the list of Holocaust deniers and fascists with whom he was set to be sharing the bill. The second operator Aschenauer was running in the United States was registered as the official agent for the Socialist Reich Party, the successor to the Nazi party that had been banned by law from competing in Germany’s elections.  The third agent being run by Aschenauer, Pearson reported, was Francis Yockey, whom Joe McCarthy had recently brought in to write a speech for him to deliver at that rally in Yorkville. Pearson reported that the FBI was, quote, “most interested in Yockey. “ Anthony Mostrom: Drew Pearson named Yockey. He named some of Yockey’s other associates.  Maddow: This guy, whom McCarthy was being the mouthpiece for in the U.S. Senate, he was the lawyer who Yockey had been secretly helping at the Nazi war crimes trials. He was a leader of the post-war successor to the Nazi party in Germany. He was running pro-Nazi agents in the United States, including in a uniformed neo-Nazi militia in New York. Drew Pearson had figured it all out. Journalists like Drew Pearson were doing their best to inform the public about what McCarthy had been up to, about who he was involved with. Pearson: What he doesn’t like from his fellow senators now, is anyone who opposes him or exposes him.  Maddow: Among McCarthy’s fellow senators, Raymond Baldwin, Millard Tydings, William Benton, they had all confronted him, and they’d all been run out of the Senate by McCarthy one way or the other. Senator Robert La Follette Jr., Young Bob, had killed himself rather than face what he thought it would mean to become McCarthy’s next target. Practical, problem-solving, devoted dad Lester Hunt was intent not just on confronting McCarthy the way his colleagues had, but on stopping McCarthy’s ability to operate the way he did.  Lester Hunt: Outstanding men in the country today do not care to come into the government and subject themselves constantly to the smearing and remarks, slanderous remarks -- Maddow: Lester Hunt knew what he was up against. And he also knew how McCarthy was likely to respond.  McDaniel: This opportunity presents itself for him to take revenge on Lester Hunt.  Maddow: That’s next. ******************************** Maddow: It’s a summer night in 1953. Buddy Hunt is 25 years old. He’s walking through Lafayette Park right by the White House. And he makes eye contact with another man who’s passing by. Buddy would later say that the man looked like he was trying to catch Buddy’s attention. The two men held each other’s gaze. They started to talk. A proposition was made. But nothing physical happened between them. The man took out a police badge, and he put Buddy Hunt under arrest.  McDaniel: It was an undercover officer that he had made eye contact with that night in Lafayette Park. And there was some discussion about having a homosexual relationship and Buddy gets arrested.  Maddow: The man Buddy had met that night in the park was part of something called the Morals Division of the D.C. Police. Morals Division officers would go out in D.C. at night. Lafayette Park was a frequent target. And they would try to induce gay men to proposition them, to solicit them for sex. And then they’d arrest them. Buddy Hunt says that he wasn’t gay. He wasn’t sure what he was. This was more of an experiment than anything. But he was taken to the police station. Mugshot. Fingerprints. He was too embarrassed to call his parents, too embarrassed to call his father, the senator. So he spent the night in jail. But the charges against Buddy were pretty quickly dismissed. McDaniel: He was not a federal government employee. He was a young man in the seminary. There was no reason to believe that he would offend again. And so it would have been the normal course of events that the charges would have been dismissed.  Maddow: This is where that whole ordeal probably should have ended. This is where it would have ended had word of Buddy Hunt’s arrest not gotten to Joe McCarthy and to two of McCarthy’s closest allies in the U.S. Senate. McDaniel: Senator Styles Bridges, who was a powerful Republican senator from New Hampshire, and a senator from Idaho named Herman Welker, they get pretty excited about the idea that this might be an opportunity to force Lester Hunt out of the Senate.  Maddow: These Republican U.S. senators, they’re both on the committee that oversees Washington, D.C., and they use that political power to interfere with this as a law enforcement issue. After the charges had already been dropped, they called the head of the Morals Squad up to Capitol Hill and they told him to file new charges. They threatened his job if he didn’t. And it worked. Charges were refiled against Buddy. In the process, they accused Lester Hunt, Buddy’s father, the senator, of having paid a bribe to get the charges dropped in the first place.  McDaniel: Senator Welker and Senator Bridges claimed that someone had told them that the detective in charge of the case had taken a bribe from Hunt to drop the charges.  Maddow: There is zero evidence that this was true. The detective himself told them it wasn’t true. But McCarthy and his allies, they smelled blood.  McDaniel: You have this opportunity that presents itself for him to take revenge on Lester Hunt. Maddow: Lester Hunt had publicly called Joe McCarthy a drunk and a liar. And on those two points, he knew of what he spoke. Hunt called out Joe McCarthy’s lies on the Malmedy investigation. Hunt had defended Anna Rosenberg after McCarthy had come for her, also with lies. Hunt was now waging a public crusade to roll back the senatorial immunity that was part of what allowed McCarthy to build all of his political crusades on abject lies.  Lester Hunt: What is the advantage to a member of Congress when he uses such tactics? He gains notoriety, and primarily that’s what he’s looking for, publicity. Maddow: Well, now, Senator Joe McCarthy could make Lester Hunt pay for all of that, because he could use Hunt’s own son against him. Go for the son. Hit the father in the heart. Before Buddy’s trial date, McCarthy and his allies got a message to Senator Hunt that this could all be over, this could all be taken care of. The charges against Buddy could be dropped again if Lester Hunt would just leave the Senate. If he would not seek re-election. Senator Hunt refused to do it. And so, Buddy went to trial.  McDaniel: Buddy is tried in October. There’s a week-long trial. The Hunts don’t dodge it. They set through the trial. Some of his friends said you could watch him visibly age during that week as he watches his son on trial for what then was this really egregious charge. And Buddy is convicted.  Maddow: After he was convicted, Buddy Hunt chooses not to appeal. He’s given the choice between jail time or a fine. He chooses the fine. He does get expelled from seminary school. But the whole ordeal, mercifully, is over. At least that’s what they thought. Buddy had been arrested in June. His trial and conviction had been in October. But then in December, Senator Hunt’s home in Washington, D.C. was broken into.  McDaniel: While he and his wife are back in Wyoming for Christmas, somebody breaks into their apartment in Washington and ransacks it. Nothing of significance is stolen. It’s clear they’re looking for something. And that was incredibly unnerving. Maddow: It’s not a normal burglary. The house is ransacked. Every drawer turned out. But almost nothing is taken. Buddy remembers his father and his mother being profoundly rattled by this.  McDaniel: And then the pressure is really put on.  Maddow: Then the pressure is really put on. McCarthy and his allies try a new approach. Buddy Hunt’s arrest and conviction for soliciting gay sex. How’s that going to play back home in Wyoming? At this point, Buddy Hunt’s arrest and his trial, his conviction, it has made the press a bit, but not a lot. Only in a conservative Washington paper that was part of the Chicago Tribune family. And there was a small AP story, a wire service story. But it didn’t get much pickup. McCarthy and his allies, Senator Styles Bridges and Senator Herman Welker, they threaten to change that.  McDaniel: The threat is that if he stays in the race, Bridges and Welker will print off 25,000, they look like wanted posters, with Buddy’s picture on it and information about the charges and distribute those to every mailbox in Wyoming. It was truly a significant way to try to blackmail Senator Hunt into leaving the Senate. Maddow: Lester Hunt’s son, Buddy, is not only going to be used as a weapon against his father, he’s going to have his life ruined. His face, this incident in his private life, plastered all across the state, delivered to the mailboxes of 25,000 Wyoming homes. For Lester Hunt, that was enough. It was finally enough.  McDaniel: Almost a year to the day from Buddy’s arrest, Senator Hunt announces that he’s decided not to run for re-election and he says it’s because of health problems. That was clearly not the reason, but that’s the reason he gave publicly.  Maddow: After a year of torment, despite having previously announced that he would seek re-election, Senator Lester Hunt changes his mind. He gives in to the threats and the blackmail and the attacks on his son. McDaniel: I think he did agonize over the decision. The polls showed that he would win, but I think he came to realize that winning would have been ugly. It would have dragged his son through this all over again in a very public way. And so I think he was looking at all of that and thought, this will all end if I don’t run for re-election. But he was wrong about that.  Maddow: It still wouldn’t be the end. Sure, getting Lester Hunt to withdraw from running for re-election, that was what they wanted. But then McCarthy decided he wanted more. If they could get Hunt out now, immediately, if they could get him to quit before his term was even up, then they could flip control of the U.S. Senate, which Democrats held by only one vote.  If Hunt would resign and leave, Wyoming’s Republican governor would then get to appoint a Republican to fill his seat. That would give Republicans Senate control. It would give McCarthy even more power than he already had.  McDaniel: For them, it was not enough for him to simply not run for re-election. He had to leave the Senate. And so they weren’t done yet with their threats.  Maddow: The finale of this blackmail campaign, the endgame, it wasn’t carried out by Senators Welker or Bridges, but by Joe McCarthy himself, through an ominous statement to the press.  McDaniel: Joe McCarthy announces that he intends to open hearings to investigate a Democratic member of the Senate. Maddow: “A Democratic member of the Senate,” McCarthy said, who was linked to, quote, “very serious charges,” charges he personally had been checking into and would soon reveal.  McDaniel: If you’re Lester Hunt, you know who they’re talking about.  Maddow: Joe McCarthy made this threat. He announced it to the press on a Friday. The Friday before Father’s Day, 1954. The next day, that Saturday, Lester Hunt woke up early. He drove to the Senate, and he took his own life.  McDaniel: I suspect that that night, Friday night into Saturday, was spent thinking about what it meant to be the target of one of Joe McCarthy’s hearings. Everybody had seen what happens. How ugly they were, how the truth was twisted, how reputations were ruined, lives destroyed. He knew that even though he wasn’t running for re-election now, they intended to put him through this through a different means. And that was a public hearing headed by McCarthy. And so the next morning, he took his life.  Maddow: Lester Hunt, 61 years old, 22 years of service to his state and to the country, gone. Senator Hunt left a handful of notes behind before he fired his gun. He laid them on the desk in his office. There was a note for his wife. Another was written to his son, Buddy.  Ewig: After his death, I’ve seen different reports that he left some letters.  Buddy Hunt: Yes, he did leave some. He left one to my mother, one to me. But the one to me was “this has nothing to do with you” sort of thing. You know? Yeah, “You mustn’t think it does” and you know, so on and so forth.  Maddow: This has nothing to do with you. And that is what Buddy Hunt believed about his father’s suicide, up until the day 25 years later when that young grad student, Rick Ewig, walked into his living room in Chicago with the evidence of how Senator Lester Hunt’s love and care for his son had been turned into a weapon against him.  Buddy Hunt: The only blackmail thing I see here is in regard to me. Am I missing something?  Ewig: No, that’s basically it.  Buddy Hunt: I don’t know anything about that. But maybe I wasn’t supposed to. Maybe that was the whole issue.  Ewig: That could be.  Maddow: After the grad student began to lay out the evidence in front of him, the reporting from Drew Pearson and Marquis Childs and others, the links to McCarthy and his allies, Buddy does start to see it. Ewig: I have one thing in here I thought you might be interested in. This was found in Senator Bridges’ files. A little note on your arrest. Looking at that, perhaps he did use that against your father.  Buddy Hunt: Well, he might have.  Ewig: Yeah, well, it all seems to point to that way. Buddy Hunt: Yeah, maybe so. Bridges had that in his files, huh?  Ewig: Yeah, that was in his files, that’s where I got that. Buddy Hunt: Interesting. I’m learning more from you than you’re learning from me, Richard. Maddow: Buddy Hunt died just a few years ago, in 2020. Years before he passed, Wyoming author Roger McDaniel spent time with him. Roger had found records confirming that Senator Hunt had told at least two friends before he died about the blackmail plot, about what McCarthy and his Republican allies in the Senate were threatening him with, and how desperate he felt about it. It was Buddy himself who suggested that Roger McDaniel should write a book about his dad, about what was done to him.  McDaniel: In the end, Buddy called me after he read the manuscript and he said, thank you, this clears up a lot for me and I’m thankful that you wrote the book so that people understand what really happened. Maddow: Before he died, Senator Lester Hunt had been asked about the widespread expectation that Senator Joe McCarthy would make a run for the White House. Hunt responded that McCarthy didn’t really need to. He said, “As a senator, he’s now acting Secretary of State, acting president, and the chief high executioner of department heads. In the White House, he would merely be a president.” The list of political lives, in some cases the actual lives, that ended because of Joe McCarthy’s reign in U.S. politics was growing. Young Bob La Follette, Raymond Baldwin, Millard Tydings, William Benton, Lester Hunt. For some in the Senate, losing Lester Hunt specifically, his suicide, was the last straw. They knew they had to do something to try to push back.  Lawyer: Senator McCarthy will vigorously defend himself against these three charges. Maddow: But how do you push back? What do you do when every attempt to constrain or confront a figure like that just makes his supporters more devoted to him, some of whom would soon turn up to the U.S. Capitol, intent on stopping the proceedings there against him. To do that, they didn’t have to bring along men with drawn weapons, but they did.  David Austin Walsh: An armored car pulls up to the Capitol building.

Many, many other members of Congress don’t need this immunity or this privilege. You don’t need it. There are a few who do need it, and to my way of thinking, those few shouldn’t have it.  Stennis: Now you say that I do not need it, and I’m flattered by your compliment. I can certainly say, knowing you as I do, that I don’t think you’ll ever need it, as the law is now. But if you repeal that privilege, you will wish you had it. You’ll find the reason there.  Lester Hunt: I hope the time will never come when I need and hope I had that privilege. Stennis: Take that privilege away, and you will need it as certainly as my father did. Lester Hunt: May I make one more point, please, before you take questions?  Granik: All right, I want to give him a little privilege.  Stennis: You’ve served the people long and well, and you’ve been subjected to slander and libel yourself, and you love your country more, though, than you did despise the abuse that you had to take. That’s why you’re here."

How Democrats and Republicans are reacting to Biden dropping out of the 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:45 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 5:39 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-drops-out-reaction-democrats-election-2024-rcna162753,"After weeks of public and private hand-wringing among Democrats, President Joe Biden has announced that he will end his re-election bid and withdraw from the race. On Sunday afternoon, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the top of the ticket. Biden’s announcement was met with a rash of statements from Democrats praising his leadership. It also set off a palpable wave of relief among many in the party, including those who feared that his staying on the ticket could jeopardize the party’s chances in down-ballot races. “Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he’s a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., posted to X. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Biden “a patriotic American who has always put our country first.” “His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” she said in a statement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the president “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.” Former President Barack Obama issued a statement acknowledging the difficulty of the decision that Biden faced. “For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,” Obama wrote. “But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country —  and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.” Democratic governors also lauded Biden. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called him “a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom thanked Biden, calling him an “extraordinary, history-making president.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Biden’s decision “is in the best interest of our country, and our party.” Several Democrats who had publicly called on Biden to step aside also issued statements praising the president’s decision. “Joe’s announcement today reflects what we’ve known all along: he is an American patriot who is willing to put America’s interests over his own,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, thanked Biden for his “years of committed service.” Even progressives, who had stood by the president in the wake of the debate, expressed gratitude. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., thanked Biden, saying, ""This was the president’s decision to make"" and endorsed Harris. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, expressed much the same sentiments. Later Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pledged her ""full support"" to Harris and called on the country to ""swiftly unite"" to defeat Trump in November. Ocasio-Cortez was one of several progressive lawmakers to adamantly stand by Biden as pressure for him to drop out increased among Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez has warned of chaos within the party should he withdraw from the race In a joint statement, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton celebrated Biden’s accomplishments, “with his North Star always being what’s best for the country.” They also endorsed Harris and said they “will do everything we can to support her.” Former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, continued to criticize Biden on a phone call with NBC News, saying, “He should never have been there in the first place. He should have stayed in his basement.” Trump — who had claimed he wanted to unite the country after his assassination attempt — also slammed Biden on Truth Social, writing in a post that he “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., struck a conspiratorial tone, writing in a post on X that the “deep state” and the “elites in power” had started a “coup” against Biden that led to him stepping down from the Democratic ticket. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., took a similar tack, claiming without evidence that the Democratic Party had “forced” Biden off the ballot, adding that Biden should resign from office “immediately.” Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, also a Republican, accused Democrats of “rigging their own elections.” Biden, whose political career has been marked by his ability to defy the odds, had pushed back hard against the calls for him to step aside after his June 27 debate with Trump. At times, he reportedly even lashed out at fellow Democrats. Those calls quieted down briefly after last Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, but soon afterward they picked back up with greater urgency. Although Biden and his aides worked hard to quash concerns about his age and mental fitness, the pressure on him to resign — or the political calculus for his party — ultimately overcame his insistence. First lady Jill Biden responded to Biden’s announcement on X with a hearts emoji. Hunter Biden issued a statement lauding his father as a selfless leader, writing: “He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years.” He added: “I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same.” This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
The Democrats' discord is a sign of a healthy party,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 20, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 5:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/rnc-trump-biden-drop-out-dnc-rcna161585,"UPDATE (July 21, 2024 8:20 p.m. E.T.): President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election from the 2024 presidential race. Republicans’ spirits are high after the party’s national convention. The GOP is fervently unified behind former President Donald Trump as its presidential nominee. Trump is leading President Joe Biden in most national and battleground polls. Despite being convicted of 34 felony counts, Trump’s base remains loyal as ever. And an adoring crowd seemed to hang on his every word during his acceptance speech Thursday night, as Trump used his survival of an assassination attempt to frame his nomination as ordained by God. That picture of harmony is likely the envy of many Democrats as they prepare for their own convention in August. As Trump is feted, Biden is struggling to keep his candidacy afloat. The president faces a tremendous pressure campaign from his own party to drop his White House bid. Poll after poll spells potential disaster for him and his party. Fundraising totals have plunged since last month’s presidential debate. Should Biden depart the race, Democrats would almost immediately have to decide between anointing Vice President Kamala Harris and a divisive open convention. At the same time, dozens of pro-Palestinian groups are planning to demonstrate against Biden’s Israel policy around the convention, hoping to echo the protests on college campuses that captured headlines earlier this year. In short, the contrast between the two parties in both unity and confidence at this moment could not be clearer. But in the longer view, the Democratic chaos is a sign of the party’s health, while the GOP’s unity is a symptom of its sickness as a political entity.   Political parties win and govern effectively by producing candidates who can secure as big of a majority as possible among their constituencies. Yet entering the summer, both parties had opted for candidates who were, by any typical standard, remarkably weak. Trump currently may be ahead in most polls, but he remains a uniquely unpopular presidential candidate, plagued by low favorability ratings. He has never won the popular vote. He was the first and only president to never breach over 50% in approval ratings. Independents remain wary of his criminal convictions and his personal character. And during his leadership of the GOP, the party has performed poorly in midterm elections.  So while the polls indicate that Trump has a very serious chance of winning in November, his vulnerabilities ensure that he does not have a decisive lead. That the GOP is turning over and over again to such a divisive, risky candidate is a sign of party dysfunction. There are multiple sources of that dysfunction: conservative media, which thrives on deception and discord; the party’s diehard base, which buys every conspiracy theory thrown its way and worships Trump as a savior; and GOP lawmakers, almost all of whom tremble with fear at the mere thought of criticizing Trump. But the upshot is that the Republicans have lost most if not all of their identity beyond Trump and his lackeys. Beyond him, they are lost, and with him they’re not much better off. The intra-party debate over Biden reflects a party with a sharply different, healthier goal. The intense debate over Biden’s candidacy reflects the beliefs of many Democratic voters, lawmakers, party leaders, donors, and commentators that, despite Biden’s many accomplishments, he’s no longer in a position to campaign effectively. This conclusion was reached based on a fact-based appraisal of his sustained difficulty at carrying out a politician’s most important job: communicating clearly with the public. And it was made all the more urgent because evidence indicates that this problem is key to explaining his trailing in the polls to an exceptionally weak candidate. For the purposes of the party’s long-term effectiveness as an institution, the party’s splits over Biden reflect a healthy distance from him — a view of the president not as the party itself or an infallible hero, but rather a vessel for its values, policies and ideas. And while the timing of this internal division is far from ideal, it also reflects a nimbleness and sensitivity to the electorate that seems inconceivable in the sclerotic GOP. Right now the Democratic Party is riven by division — some of it rather rancorous, much of it long overdue — but that division will be ephemeral. The scramble is to figure out who the best candidate can be ahead of the party’s convention. After the convention, in all likelihood the overwhelming majority of Democrats will fall in line behind whoever the candidate is and lock arms against Trump and the Republicans. It is possible that this extended period of intra-party division could hurt the Democrats ahead of Election Day. If Biden stays in, maybe he’ll be irreversibly hurt by weeks of infighting and demoralization. If Biden is replaced, it’s possible the new candidate will also be weak against Trump. But it’s also possible that this period of intra-party strife produces the impetus for the party to reset and achieve its goals in a manner it otherwise couldn’t have. What's clear is the party is responding earnestly to the giant electoral warning signs it sees — the kinds of signs that Republicans have socialized themselves to ignore. In the long term, any healthy movement or party must ultimately always balance commitments to unity with introspection and honest reckonings over whether it’s uniting behind the right things. That’s what the Democrats are doing, and it’ll serve them well for the future. "
Joe Biden’s incredibly selfless career has led to this historic moment,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 3:57 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-biden-endorse-kamala-harris-selfless-service-rcna162747,"On Sunday, President Joe Biden made the historic decision to step aside and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place in November. Yet more proof that Aaron Sorkin himself would not have been able to script Biden’s career.   Just weeks before he was set to be sworn in as the youngest member elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden's wife and 1-year-old daughter were killed in a car accident while shopping for a Christmas tree.  The grieving and suddenly single dad of two boys, Biden was encouraged by his new Senate colleagues to stay in Congress, and for years he traveled back and forth on the Amtrak train to make sure he was there for his sons as much as possible. It’s a story packed with enough tragedy and fortitude to last a lifetime. But that is far from the full story of Joe Biden.   He survived a brain aneurysm, an embarrassing exit from his 1988 run for the presidency, the loss of his son Beau and the conviction of his other son, Hunter.   And yet, despite it all, Biden has always chosen to reject bitterness. He refused to give in to his pain and spiral into self-pity or lash outward with hatred. He never went into hiding. He has instead channeled his loss and personal tragedy into a lifetime of public service and an incredibly deep well of empathy for others. Over and over and over again.  It’s easy to say that your job is not your life. But it really isn’t for this president. Biden picks up the phone every time his granddaughters call. He talks about his wife (Dr. Jill Biden) the way a much younger guy might talk about a girl he has a huge crush on. And his love for his son Hunter and concern for Hunter's mental well-being have resulted in decisions that sometimes made no political sense.  At the same time, Biden’s belief that through politics you can make a real difference has been the driving force of his adult life. His career was never about becoming rich (he was one of the least wealthy members of the Senate), nor was it about fame or clout (I don’t think he would know how to tweet if his life depended on it). Obviously, you don’t run for office — and certainly not the presidency — without a healthy sense of self. And Biden has that. I remember sitting with him in the Oval Office early in the first few weeks of his presidency and asking how he was dealing with the weight of the office. He told me he’d been in this office before and knew exactly what he needed to do. But, he added, he was having trouble finding his socks.  It was a funny moment. And a very revealing one. Because Biden did know that office. He’s been visiting it for decades, as he negotiated legislation as a senator and later navigated his responsibilities as vice president — both at home and around the world. No one came into that job with more experience. And perhaps no one in modern history felt more out of place among the ornate trappings of the White House residence than the son of a used-car salesman from Scranton.   Biden doesn’t care about celebrities or fancy events. He would probably eat spaghetti and meatballs and chocolate chip ice cream every day if given the choice. He cares about workers being paid fair wages, about everyone getting a shot at a better education or training. About protecting the fundamentals of our institutions and the people who serve in them.   He also has a chip on his shoulder — and as a result, a particular soft spot for every American who has ever felt underestimated and left behind. His career has been defined by stubbornness and tragedy and by proving many, many doubters wrong. He pledged to get a bipartisan infrastructure deal and did, with the help of 19 Republican senators. He finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary in 2020 and went on to win not only the nomination, but also the presidency. And all of that is why his decision to step back from the Democratic nomination right now is so powerful. Public service has been his life for over 50 years. He doesn’t know anything different.  There is no other campaign.   The next few months will be his last in public office.   Make no mistake: Biden isn’t doing this because he doesn’t think he can do the job. He’s stepping down because he has been convinced that he is not the right person to defeat Donald Trump. Time and time again, Joe Biden proved his incredible strength by getting back up after being knocked down. This time, he shows it by stepping aside."
Trump responds to Biden announcement in a decidedly Trumpian way,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 2:19 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-responds-biden-2024-election-announcement-decidedly-trumpian-way-rcna162959,"After President Joe Biden announced his decision not to seek a second term, Donald Trump responded with uncharacteristic class, thanking the Democratic incumbent for his decades of service to the United States and the American people. No, I’m just kidding. The Republican actually responded to Biden’s news with an ugly missive published by way of his social media platform, which read in part: Nearly an hour later, the former president followed up with a similar online message, which read in part: The Republican then concluded in a third online item, “Crooked Joe just got knocked out, so now I’ll have to do it a FOURTH TIME!!!” I’m not altogether sure what that meant, unless Trump was making a rare reference to his ill-fated consideration of the Reform Party’s presidential nomination in 2000. For good measure, the former president went on to suggest, for reasons unknown, that Biden's recent Covid infection was an elaborate ruse for reasons that only make sense to Trump. Regardless, the Republican nominee doesn’t actually gain anything from such viciousness. Biden is exiting the stage anyway. Trump likely would’ve benefited far more from a gracious statement than a spiteful one. But we’re left with the same lesson we saw in his Republican National Convention speech: Trump, in a rather literal sense, simply can’t help himself. Taking the high road after Biden’s announcement would’ve helped his campaign, but the former president is who he appears to be. His instinct is to be needlessly malicious at all times, and he appears incapable of anything else. As last week got underway, Axios reported that Americans should expect to see a different kind of Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt. “Almost dying rocks perspectives — and people,” the report read. Axios added, “Yes, Trump has shown little appetite for changing his ways, tone and words. But his advisers tell us Trump plans to seize his moment by toning down his Trumpiness, and dialing up efforts to unite a tinder-box America.” Four days later, Politico published a related report, noting that in the aftermath of the shooting in Pennsylvania, “Republicans who have observed and spoken with former President Donald Trump say they have detected a new softness to the man whose brand has been anything but.” The article added, “GOP allies, in roughly a dozen interviews, used words like ‘emotional’ and ‘serene’ — even ‘spiritual’ — to describe Trump in the days since the attempt on his life.” To the extent that such descriptions ever had merit, that time has clearly come and gone. This post was updated to reflect Trump's weird Covid-related claims."
Kamala Harris says she intends to ‘win this nomination’ after Biden drops out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:14 PM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:55 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-reaction-biden-dropping-out-rcna162942,"Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that she intends to “earn and win” the Democratic presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced he’s dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsing her in his place. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,” she said. “His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office.  The statement continued:  Harris concluded by noting there are 107 days until Election Day. “Together, we will fight,” she said. “And together, we will win.” Harris, a former California senator, received an outpouring of support from many top Democrats on Sunday. Before serving in the Senate from 2017 to 2021, Harris was California’s attorney general for six years. She sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out before the primary elections. Harris’ vice presidency is historic in several ways: She is the first woman to hold the role, as well as the first Black person and Indian American to do so. This is a developing story.

"Why President Joe Biden is retiring, but not resigning",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 1:50 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/president-joe-biden-retiring-not-resigning-2024-election-rcna162953,"When President Joe Biden announced that he was ending his re-election bid, he specifically referenced his eagerness to do the job he was elected to do for the next six months. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” the Democratic incumbent said in a written statement. The news, of course, has touched off a multifaceted process, but it will also generate a related question from his Republican critics: “Shouldn’t Biden step down now, rather than January?” Sen. JD Vance, his party’s vice presidential nominee, made this pitch via social media just yesterday, ahead of Biden’s announcement: This coincided with an Axios report, which added that Republicans are “laying the groundwork to pressure him to resign from office.” I don’t doubt that voters will hear this argument quite a bit in the very near future, and it might even have some superficial appeal to casual observers. If Biden isn’t up to seeking the presidency, is it unreasonable to think he isn’t up to doing the job in the coming months? The closer one looks, however, the more problematic this argument becomes. First, few seriously believe that the president is incapable of performing his duties between now and January. Second, the “if you can’t run, you can’t serve” argument is plainly wrong. Indeed, as Vance probably knows, plenty of members of Congress, including several of his Senate colleagues from both parties, have announced that they’re stepping down at the end of their current term. This is routine, and it doesn’t mean they have to resign from Capitol Hill. Third, it stands to reason that Biden will explain in the coming days that his decision is about the future, not the present: It’s one thing to say that the Democratic incumbent is up to the job in 2024; it’s something else to say that he’ll still be equally fit in 2028. If I were helping Biden write a speech on this, I’d probably encourage him to say something like, “Lately, I’ve had two jobs: running the executive branch and running for a second term. Going forward, I’ve decided to focus all of my energies on the job Americans hired me to do, and leave the second job to others.” Finally, it’s probably worth questioning the motivations of Republicans who seem a little too eager to show Biden the door. Not only does the party seem to like the idea of running against an incumbent, let’s not forget that under the 25th Amendment, if the president were to step down before his term ends, Harris would assume the office and have an opportunity to select a new vice president — who in turn would have to be confirmed by the House and Senate. The confirmation process in the Democratic-led Senate probably wouldn’t be too difficult, but would the House’s far-right Republican majority handle such a task responsibly? Maybe Republicans will push for Biden to resign the presidency because they genuinely believe he can't fulfil his duties, or perhaps the party is looking for an ugly election-season spectacle."
Trump issues first statement after Biden says he's dropping out,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:59 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:43 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-reaction-biden-dropping-out-rcna162925,"Donald Trump on Sunday fired off a snide reaction to President Joe Biden’s historic decision to withdraw from the 2024 race, calling Biden the “worst president” in United States history. Trump had called for national unity in the wake of an assassination attempt against him last weekend. But he quickly ditched that message by the time he accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention. His acceptance speech, which ran more than 90 minutes, was filled with insults and vitriol. His Truth Social post about Biden’s withdrawal was no different. “Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” Trump wrote on his social media platform, adding: “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump told NBC News in a brief phone interview on Sunday that if he’s elected in November, he will “fix what he [Biden] has done.” “Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of the United States by far,” the former president told NBC News. “He should never have been there in the first place,” Trump continued, “He should have stayed in his basement.”"
"Biden drops out of 2024 race after weeks of pressure, endorses Harris",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 21, 2024, 11:00 AM PDT / Updated July 21, 2024, 1:41 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-drops-out-2024-election-rcna162537,"President Joe Biden on Sunday announced that he is withdrawing his bid for re-election after weeks of pressure from top Democrats to drop out of the race amid concerns over his cognitive state and his ability to beat Donald Trump in November. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter to Americans. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” Biden said he would address the country “later this week in more detail.” In a subsequent tweet, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. In a statement Sunday, Harris thanked Biden and said she intends to “earn and win” the nomination. Calls for Biden to step aside followed his June 27 debate with Trump, in which the 81-year-old president at times seemed confused, tired and unable to articulate his thoughts. Though there had been some reporting in the weeks leading up to the debate that Biden's mental acuity was slipping, the prime-time debate, watched by more than 50 million people, brought the issue center stage. Biden's performance ignited concerns among Democrats and prompted some prominent party members to urge him to drop out. For weeks, the president refused to exit the race and attempted to control the damage through high-stakes interviews, a news conference at the NATO summit and meetings with governors and congressional lawmakers. But his efforts to reassure voters did little to stem concern at the highest levels of the party. More than two dozen top Democrats — many of them members of the House — publicly called on Biden to withdraw. Others reportedly expressed concern privately about polling that suggested Trump’s support over Biden was growing. “I have great respect for President Biden,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post earlier this month. “He saved our country from a tyrant. He is a man of uncommon decency. He cares deeply about our democracy. He has been one of the best presidents of our time.” “But I, like folks across the country, am worried about November’s election,” he continued. “The stakes could not be higher. We cannot unsee President Biden’s disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night. ... For the good of the country, I’m calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.” By mid-July, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had privately warned Biden that he was unlikely to beat Trump in November, according to multiple reports. As Steve Benen noted Sunday, Harris’ nomination isn’t locked in, despite significant support among congressional lawmakers. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
