The Secret Service failed Saturday. America deserves to know why.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 15, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/-trump-rally-shooting-assassination-attempt-secret-service-rcna161768,"“Zero Fail.” That’s how the U.S. Secret Service describes its mission. Yet, you’d be hard-pressed to find a Secret Service agent who would claim that Saturday’s assassination attempt on presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump was anything other than a failure. But for an inch or so, the iconic agency almost lost a protectee to an assassin’s bullet. One spectator was killed and two others were injured. The nation needs answers to several questions, and the investigation to find out those answers has already begun — even as the Secret Service prepares to secure the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week. Here are three hypothetical scenarios that most likely explain Saturday’s failure and should help guide investigators as they figure out what went wrong and led to Trump’s nearly losing his life: 1. The Secret Service left the rooftop and building from which the would-be assassin fired out of its rally security plan. 2. The Secret Service delegated responsibility to local or state law enforcement to secure that building and they failed to adequately secure it. 3. There was confusion over which agencies had which assignments. No matter what happened, though, the buck stops at the Secret Service. Though it can’t be ruled out, it’s highly unlikely that the Secret Service left the rooftop of the building the shooter used out of its security plan. That’s because the estimated distance between that rooftop and Trump’s podium was about 150 yards, well within the accuracy range of the type of rifle reportedly used by the shooter. Further, the building’s roof provided an elevated location and therefore a tactical advantage for an attacker. The relatively short distance from the building to the podium and its elevation mean the Secret Service should have evaluated it as a risk. The building and rooftop may have been assessed by the Secret Service but determined to be a lower risk for some reason, designated as outside the event’s perimeter and/or delegated for coverage to local or state police. If security for the building was outsourced to other departments, then the failure of those departments to prevent the shooter from entering the building and ascending to the roof proved to be fatal. However, even if we find that a local or state department didn’t carry out an assignment, in such a scenario, it still would have been the Secret Service that delegated that responsibility. There may have been a critical error in communicating who was responsible for the building and how that responsibility was to be executed. The Secret Service would have to own such a decision. Of course, there may have been a case of mixed assignment of responsibilities. We know that at least one Secret Service sniper had a line of sight to the rooftop used by the shooter. As soon as shots rang out, Secret Service personnel “neutralized” the shooter, Anthony Guglielmi, the agency’s chief spokesperson said. Theoretically, the Secret Service could have decided it would be responsible for covering the rooftop, while the local police would be assigned to prevent anyone from reaching the rooftop. Reporting from The Associated Press adds credence to the possibility that local police were responsible for at least the entrances of the building.  According to officials who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity given the ongoing investigation, an officer reportedly climbed to the roof, encountered the shooter and retreated, and the would-be assassin quickly took a shot at the former president. Mixed responsibilities for the same threat location can result in a lack of clarity. It makes for a kind of “too many cooks spoil the broth” scenario. Further, The Wall Street Journal has reported, and the FBI has confirmed, that suspicious devices were found in the shooter’s vehicle, rendered safe by FBI bomb technicians and transported to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. Was the use of bomb dogs in the parking area of the rally considered? If so, who was responsible for doing that? To use bomb-sniffing dogs or not to use bomb-sniffing dogs would have been a Secret Service decision. There have already been multiple calls for inquiries into which, if any, of these scenarios might have played out to cause Saturday’s tragic events. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but its focus will not be on the security failure. Rather, inquiries into the Secret Service’s inability to live up to its “Zero Fail” mission will be led by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general and, according to President Joe Biden, “independent” investigators. The answers will come. They better come quickly. If the failure on Saturday was even partly because of limited resources of the Secret Service, at a time when a significant proportion of its personnel are in Milwaukee for the RNC, then we need to figure out if the Service is stretched so thin that it can’t simultaneously address multiple major events without a risky overreliance on local police. The Secret Service protects our president and former presidents, their families, candidates and their families and many others. Importantly, that also means it helps preserve the security of America’s brand and reputation. We need to help it get whatever it needs in order to get it right."
"From Oval Office, Biden forcefully condemns political violence, attempted Trump assassination",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 14, 2024, 5:04 PM PDT / Updated July 14, 2024, 6:05 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-trump-rally-shooting-oval-office-address-rcna161816,"In remarks delivered from the White House's Oval Office, President Joe Biden on Sunday forcefully condemned political violence and called for national unity following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump a night earlier. ""I want to speak to you tonight about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics,"" Biden said. ""We must stand together."" The shooting ""calls on all of us to take a step back, take stock of where we are, how we go forward from here,"" he added. Biden's historic remarks come roughly 26 hours after a shooter, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire at a Trump campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement officials are investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt against Trump, who said a bullet ""pierced"" part of his right ear during the attack. Rally attendee Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the attack and two other spectators — 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver — were injured. Both men were listed in stable condition. As Politico reported Sunday, Biden has delivered just two other speeches from behind the Resolute Desk: In June 2023, ""to mark the passage of legislation averting a federal default, and in October, to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East."" In the address, Biden reminded Americans that political differences should be resolved ""at the ballot box ... not with bullets."" ""The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a would-be assassin,"" he continued, adding: ""Here in America we need to get out of our silos. ... Let’s remember here in America our unity is the most elusive of our goals. Nothing is more important for us now than standing together. We can do this."" The address came the night before the Republican National Convention officially nominating Trump was set to begin in Milwaukee, a political reality that Biden acknowledged, saying that both sides will be offering a vision for the country in the upcoming week. Biden said the country faces ""deeply felt, strong disagreements"" about its future in this election, arguing that ""the choice we make in this election is going to shape the future of America and the world for decades to come."" Although he did not make the comparison directly, Biden used language similar to what he's used in other speeches in which he argued that Trump and his allies do not respect American democracy. He said he would continue to advocate for ""an America not of extremism and fury but of decency and grace."" ""I will continue to speak out strongly for our democracy, to stand up for our Constitution and the rule of law, to call for action at the ballot box, no violence on our streets,"" he said. ""That’s how democracy should work."" In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, some prominent Trump allies blamed Biden's rhetoric on the campaign trail, claiming it inspired the attack. Law enforcement officials have not identified the shooter's motive. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Republican Sen. JD Vance, one of four finalists on Trump's vice presidential shortlist, wrote on X. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Biden spoke at the White House earlier Sunday, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Merrick Garland. In that address, Biden again condemned the shooting and said he had a “short but good conversation” with Trump on Saturday night. “Jill and I are keeping him and his family in our prayers,"" the president had said."

Heritage’s ‘simulation’ of the 2024 election was deeply flawed,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 14, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/heritage-foundation-2024-trump-fair-election-rcna161567,"Republicans from former President Donald Trump on down have been careful about their answers when asked if they’ll accept the results of this year’s presidential election. Trump has repeatedly said he’d do so only “if everything’s honest.” It’s a transparent hedge when placed against his continued false claims of election rigging. But now a group of conservative nerds has already pre-emptively declared that the 2024 election results will be illegitimate. Despite being one myself, I use the term “nerds” here in the pejorative. It’s the only proper way to describe the people who gathered at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, to “war game” the upcoming election. The so-called simulation they ran wasn’t designed to help understand weak points in our election infrastructure, however, but to lay a foundation to justify tossing out any results that don’t put Trump back in the White House. “As things stand right now, there’s a zero percent chance of a free and fair election,” Mike Howell, the executive director of Heritage’s Oversight Project, told The Washington Post. “I’m formally accusing the Biden administration of creating the conditions that most reasonable policymakers and officials cannot in good conscience certify an election.” That’s a bold statement to make, and it isn’t even credibly backed up by the group’s own findings, especially given the biases baked into its exercise. I’ll pause here to say that I’m not an expert in this field. There are many legitimate war game designers out there, several of whom I’ve had the pleasure of interacting with, including Rex Brynen, a political science professor at McGill University, and Ellie Bartels, who works at RAND. But I did participate in my share of Model United Nations conferences between high school and the years after undergrad (if anybody is checking my nerd bona fides). The Heritage initiative, called the “2024 Transition Integrity Project,” is a pale imitation of a simulation of the same name conducted by a bipartisan group of experts ahead of the 2020 election. The latter was based on what’s called a “Matrix Game” design, where groups representing different stakeholders are given a starting point, declare what they would do in response, then make arguments for why such an action would or wouldn’t work. Success is determined through the strength of those supporting arguments and dice rolls (to introduce an element of chance, like in a Dungeons & Dragons session). The 2024 version, by contrast, involved a much looser system, where “players” reacted to a series of “real world” updates crafted by the team running the project, who then incorporated those reactions into their plot. Having read through summaries of both versions, the Heritage version had way too many stakeholders, leading it to sound more like a zany Model U.N. exploit instead of a sober look at what could happen this fall. Beyond the Biden administration and the Republican National Committee, it featured conservative participants representing China, Mexican drug cartels and “Black Lives Matter/Antifa/Pro-Hamas” groups. As the Post noted with a straight face in its coverage, the simulation at one point has pro-Hamas terrorists kidnapping Barbra Streisand as an event that could affect the election’s outcome. Now, I’m not saying that Babs being taken hostage wouldn’t be a crisis of monumental proportions — but I am saying it’s hard to see what useful election insights can be gleaned from that gratuitous plot point. Moreover, Heritage’s 2024 simulation begins with an assumption — Democrats cheated by gaming the system in 2020 — then works backward from there. This leads its administrators to write in their report that they came to a similar conclusion as the 2020 TIP’s work: “The incumbent is always the greatest threat to a peaceful and effective transfer of power,” the conservative game-runners wrote. This is noted without irony or any mention whatsoever of Trump’s own well-documented attempts to prevent just that after the 2020 election. During one of the two 2024 sessions, this premise culminated in the Biden administration proxies pulling a bizarro-world scenario as one of their last major actions: Rather than admit a narrow defeat, “[Attorney General] Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice arrested Donald Trump on November 7 at Mar-a-Lago, charging him with mishandling classified documents and with insurrection due to the events of January 6, 2021.” Specifically, the Garland stand-in opted to arrest Trump and charge him with treason, a stunt that feels about as far outside of Garland’s M.O. as you can get. Heritage’s coup-hungry cosplay also stands in stark contrast to the 2020 version, in which both sides of the simulation attempted to swing the narrative after an inconclusive Election Day result. But unlike Team Trump, which the facilitators wrote “was consistently more ruthless [and] more willing to ignore existing democratic norms,” the group representing Team Biden in the 2020 exercises “generally felt constrained by a commitment to norms and a desire to tamp down violence and reduce instability.” Much like Trump himself, the 2024 TIP’s biggest blind spot — and its biggest tell — is that everyone involved couldn’t help but believe both sides to be equally willing to shatter norms to remain in power. In doing so, the starting assumption became one in which Biden pulls a Democrat-coded version of the power grab that Trump attempted after losing in 2020. That warped logic is then used to justify whatever attempts to delegitimize a potential Biden win that Trump and the RNC’s “Election Integrity Project” cook up. That effort is already underway, as Republicans gear up to challenge a Trump loss in court in a more organized version of the 2020 legal efforts. It’s entirely likely that the Heritage-backed report will be included as evidence in some of the briefs that are eventually filed. It’s incumbent on any court that receives such a lawsuit to understand that rather than a serious academic work, the Heritage Foundation has produced a very self-aggrandizing piece of unhinged fan fiction."
America was already on edge. Then shots rang out at Trump's campaign rally.,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 7:37 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/-trump-shooting-pennsylvania-rally-rcna161753,"Long before Saturday evening’s shooting at a rally for former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, America was already on edge. Maybe it’s because November’s election will be the first since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Maybe it’s because there’s been so much uncertainty about whether the two presumptive nominees would be on the ballot on Election Day — whether Trump’s indictments and convictions would render him ineligible and whether Biden would be replaced by another Democrat. November’s election feels more consequential than any one presidential election should ever be. Polarization is off the charts. Supreme Court rulings seem unmoored from precedent — and the Constitution. And polls show that a shockingly high percentage of Americans think violence against one’s political adversaries is justified. It was in that context Saturday afternoon that we saw Trump reach for his right ear and then duck behind the lectern. And we saw the Secret Service surround him and rush him off the stage. Trump said in a social media post that his upper ear was ""pierced"" by a bullet. The shooter and one spectator are dead. Two other spectators are wounded, according to the Secret Service. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the shooting. Biden, speaking from Delaware, said there was “no place in America for this kind of violence.” “It’s sick. It’s sick. It’s one of the reasons we have to unite this country,” Biden said. “We cannot condone this.” The shooter’s identity and motivations remain unknown. But we do know that Americans have had a serious knot in our stomachs for months now, if not for years, about the direction our country is going.   Such dread is likely to only grow stronger the closer we get to November. Whatever facts emerge, we can count on a significant number of Americans discounting them. Some will discount them because they can’t conceive of something happening the way the evidence suggests that it happened. Others will discount them because they see an opportunity to exploit the event for political gain. In a social media post after Saturday’s event, Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., claimed that “Joe Biden sent the orders.” Subsequently — contradicting his previous post — Collins declared that “the Republican District Attorney in Butler County, PA, should immediately file charges against Joseph R. Biden for inciting an assassination.” Such statements couldn’t have been more irresponsible or more dangerous. Again, a shocking number of Americans talk of civil wars and revolutions and claim that there is a righteousness to political violence. We don’t need lawmakers responding to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump by suggesting the leader of the opposing party is to blame. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana was one of several Republicans on Saturday who blamed Democrats for telling the public what’s at stake during the upcoming election. He tweeted, “For weeks Democrat leaders have been fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America. Clearly we’ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop.” Let’s hope he tells his colleague from Georgia that. Scalise was my representative in Congress for years when he was shot in 2017 while practicing for that year’s congressional baseball game. I opposed (and continue to oppose) just about everything Scalise says. But I was mortified that someone who disagreed with his politics lay in wait for him and tried to murder him. This may be nostalgia taking over, but there seems to have been an understanding six years ago that we need to eschew incendiary language in such moments and use cooler, more unifying rhetoric. But it seems naive now to even wish for such calls. Beyond the hugely significant fact that someone may have tried to assassinate a political candidate, one of the reasons that Saturday’s shooting is so worrisome is that it seems almost guaranteed to lead to an even more dangerous political climate. And the climate already feels unsurvivable."
"President Biden, political leaders condemn violence after shooting at Trump rally",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 6:00 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-rally-shooting-political-leaders-condemn-call-for-unity-and-peac-rcna161743,"After the shooting at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, leaders from across the political spectrum were quick to issue statements condemning the act of violence, expressing gratitude to the Secret Service and wishing the former president a speedy recovery. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he had been briefed and was “grateful to hear” that Trump is “safe and doing well.” The Biden campaign said in a statement that it was working to suspend its political ads. At a news conference shortly afterward, the president said: Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the attack “outrageous and tragic.” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., posted: “Pray for President Trump. And for justice,” a sentiment that was similar to one expressed by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Sen. JD Vance, an Ohio Republican who is among the final four candidates to be Trump’s running mate, was quick to point the finger at Democrats, writing: “Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must bre stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Without waiting for further information about the incident, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., concluded that it must be liberals’ fault: “This isn’t some unfortunate incident. This was an assassination attempt by a madman inspired by the rhetoric of the radical left.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., likewise put the blame on Democrats, saying, “The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they’ve demonized him [Trump] and his supporters.” A fellow Georgia Republican, Rep. Mike Collins, went even further, suggesting without evidence that the president was somehow criminally responsible: “The Republican District Attorney in Butler County, PA, should immediately file charges against Joseph R. Biden for inciting an assassination.” Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News, in reference to Biden’s speech Friday night in Detroit, that “after last night’s speech by Biden, I have zero ability to control myself right now.” Gingrich said that Biden “spent 15 minutes describing Trump in language that can only be called incitement. ... If you’re a good, loyal active nutcase, you just heard the president of the United States tell you what you’re about to do is acceptable.” Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was defiant, posting a photo of his father being escorted off the stage with his fist in the air. He wrote that his father will “never stop fighting to Save America.” Democrats across the board were quick to denounce political violence, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama. The foundations of former Presidents Ronald Reagan — the target of an assassination attempt in 1981 — and Jimmy Carter cautioned against a rush to judgment and called for civility. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, herself a victim of political violence, wrote on X: “Political violence is terrifying. I know. I’m holding former president Trump, and all those affected by today’s indefensible act of violence in my heart. Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable—never.” A number of House Democrats who have been vocal in their opposition to Trump also issued statements repudiating political violence, including Reps. Ted Lieu and Adam Schiff of California, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Congressional Republican leaders, at least, were measured in their responses. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell thanked the Secret Service and said that “violence has no place in our politics.” House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed that sentiment: “This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned.” Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced on X that he intends to hold a hearing with the director of the Secret Service."

Bernie Sanders reiterated his support for President Joe Biden to remain at the top of the Democratic ticket on Saturday, writing in a New York Times op-ed that Biden is “the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.” Although he and Biden have had strong disagreements on issues like Israel’s war on Hamas and the relative success of the Affordable Care Act, Sanders wrote that the president has a “record of real accomplishment,” as well as a vision that stands in stark contrast to that of Trump. The Vermont independent (who caucuses with Democrats) also railed against the media’s recent scrutiny of Biden’s every move and lamented that “too many Democrats have joined that circular firing squad.” He wrote: Sanders’ position is in line with the left-leaning “squad” members in the House, most of whom have issued public statements in support of the president. More than a dozen congressional Democrats have publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the race after his weak debate performance. Biden, meanwhile, has continued to insist that he will not step aside. Sanders still maintains a reputation as a progressive champion, and his support for Biden is likely to carry some weight among voters on the left. But an 82-year-old senator asking voters to accept an 81-year-old nominee who is, as he put it, “not an ideal candidate” is not exactly a resounding vote of confidence. Sanders is himself running for re-election this year to what would be his fourth six-year term."

Nikki Haley has, in fact, been invited to speak at the Republican National Convention next week. Citing two unnamed sources, NBC News says that details have yet to be finalized. The RNC, the Trump campaign and Haley's camp did not immediately return NBC's request for comment. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have released a list of headliners and keynote speakers for next week’s convention in Milwaukee, where Donald Trump is set to accept the party’s nomination for president once again. The list names dozens of lawmakers and GOP candidates for office, including the four people reported to be at the top of Trump’s short list for vice president: Sens. Marco Rubio, JD Vance and Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. (Trump has described the vetting process for his running mate as a “highly sophisticated version of ‘The Apprentice.’”) Also slated to speak are some of Trump’s fiercest supporters in Congress, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Elise Stefanik. Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, who is currently serving a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena, is also on the bill; The Associated Press reports he’s scheduled for release on July 17, which “would give him just enough time to board a plane and make it to Milwaukee before the convention wraps Thursday.” Among the nonpoliticians on the list are social media pundit Tucker Carlson, country singer Lee Greenwood, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, and model and TV personality Amber Rose. Notably absent is former South Carolina governor and presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who was not invited, unlike other 2024 competitors Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump’s two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, will also be speaking at the convention. The presumptive GOP nominee’s wife, Melania Trump, is not on the list, though she will reportedly attend the convention. Ivanka Trump also is not scheduled to headline any programs at the event, but her spokesperson told Vanity Fair that she’ll attend. Both women spoke at the 2016 and 2020 conventions. Here’s the full list of speakers as they were listed in an email from the Trump campaign:"
"Robert Kennedy Jr. texts apology to woman who accused him of sexual assault, claims he doesn’t remember",Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 12:08 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/robert-kennedy-apology-sexual-assault-text-rfk-jr-rcna161708,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose bid for president as an independent candidate has brought to light disturbing allegations from his past, tried to apologize last week to a woman who accused him of sexual assault, insisting that he had no memory of the alleged encounter. The woman, Eliza Cooney, told Vanity Fair earlier this month that Kennedy had groped her or behaved inappropriately with her on several occasions when she worked as a babysitter for his children in 1998. (MSNBC has not independently verified the allegations, and Kennedy did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment.) Kennedy, who was in his 40s at the time of the alleged incidents, declined to respond specifically to the accusations in an interview with the podcast “Breaking Points” on the day the accusations were revealed, but said that he had a “rambunctious youth.” “I’m not going to comment on the details of any of them,” he said when asked about Cooney’s allegations, “but it’s — you know, I am who I am.” However, NBC News reported that Kennedy reached out to Cooney two days after the Vanity Fair article was published, and when Cooney didn’t respond, he texted her: “I have no memory of this incident, but I apologize sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable.” His campaign did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Kennedy also texted Cooney that he wanted to apologize to her in person, according to The Washington Post, which was the first to report on the text messages. Cooney told the Post that Kennedy’s texts were “disingenuous and arrogant,” and she questioned his suggestion to meet in person. “Meet ‘face to face?’ What woman wants to do that?” she said. Although Kennedy has previously alluded to having “so many skeletons in my closet,” recent reporting on allegations against him are not likely to improve things for his flailing presidential campaign. In May, The New York Times reported that Kennedy had said in a 2012 deposition that part of his brain had been eaten by a worm. The Vanity Fair report also included a suggestion that Kennedy may have eaten dog meat; he told “Breaking Points” that the barbecued carcass in the photo was actually a goat.

How Alec Baldwin’s ‘Rust’ manslaughter trial came to such an abrupt end,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 10:20 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alec-baldwin-rust-trial-dismissed-manslaughter-rcna161700,"Actor Alec Baldwin sobbed and embraced his defense lawyers after the judge in his “Rust” involuntary manslaughter trial dismissed the case on Friday evening, finding that prosecutors had suppressed evidence. “The state’s willful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,” 1st Judicial District Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said. “If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith as to show signs of scorching prejudice.” If convicted, Baldwin could have faced up to 18 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter after a revolver he was rehearsing with on the “Rust” movie set fired a live round and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. Baldwin has said that he didn’t pull the trigger, telling ABC News that “I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them. Never.” The armorer on the set, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and in April was sentenced to 18 months; her lawyer told NBC News later on Friday that they intend to file a motion next week to have her case dismissed. In Baldwin’s case, the evidence in question was ammunition that a witness had turned over to the state earlier this year. Investigators did not enter the ammunition into the case file, nor did prosecutors reveal it to the defense; its existence came to light on Thursday when Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office crime scene technician Marissa Poppell was being cross-examined on the stand. Baldwin’s lawyers then filed a motion to dismiss the case, accusing the state of hiding the evidence to prevent them from determining for themselves the ammunition’s relevance to the case. In an extraordinary turn of events just three days into the trial, special prosecutor Kari T. Morrissey took the stand on Friday, telling the judge that she had only seen a photo of the undisclosed ammunition and didn’t think it matched the rounds on the film set. Yet when the judge inspected the evidence herself — donning latex gloves to examine the rounds and asking a technician to identify each one — at least one of the bullets was found to be similar. Morrissey disputed that the state had hidden the evidence from the defense, saying she did not believe the ammunition had “evidentiary value” in the case. She also revealed that another special prosecutor appointed in the case had resigned earlier that day. In her decision to toss the case, Sommer excoriated the prosecutors. “There is no way for the court to right this wrong,” she added. The case was dismissed with prejudice, which means the state cannot bring charges against Baldwin again in Hutchins’ death."
Why AOC's case for impeaching Thomas and Alito is strong,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/aoc-supreme-court-impeachment-clarence-thomas-samuel-alito-rcna161380,"The Supreme Court’s most recent term was, to be blunt, a nightmare. The few minor victories, often on narrow grounds or issues of standing, were deeply outweighed by the massive blows to democracy and good governance. These attacks were made even more galling by the continued participation of Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, the far-right flank of a deeply conservative bench, who are each mired in what should be disqualifying ethics scandals. Senate Democrats, despite holding a majority, have largely shown little interest in holding the two rogue justices accountable. It was a relief then when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced a pair of resolutions in the House on Wednesday calling for their impeachment and removal. Though the articles against Thomas and Alito will not pass in this Congress, they show that the charges against Thomas and Alito are strong and should stand as a rallying point for Democratic candidates this fall. Both resolutions focus on two main points: the personal enrichment of the justices without their disclosure; and their refusal to recuse themselves from cases despite clear conflicts of interest. The first of the three articles against Thomas cites the over $1.5 million in goods, cash equivalents and services from billionaire benefactor Harlan Crow that he failed to disclose over the years despite federal reporting requirements. The second and third are centered on the pro-insurrection activities of his wife, Ginni Thomas, and his subsequent involvement in the Jan. 6-related cases that reached the Supreme Court. It’s a testament to the sweep of Thomas’ blatant conflicts of interest that the two articles against Alito seem mild in comparison. For his part, he is accused of violating his oath of office by sitting in judgment of the Jan. 6-related cases at the same time that he allowed an upside-down flag to be flown outside his home, an apparent show of bias in favor of attempts to overthrow the 2020 election. Alito is also similarly accused of failing to disclose gifts from billionaire businessman Paul Singer and then voting in favor of a ruling that produced a substantial profit for Singer. “Corruption, without consequence, infects all it touches,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her floor speech introducing the articles, which have 18 co-sponsors. “And that is why this body, Congress, has a constitutional and moral obligation to hold these justices accountable, to maintain the integrity of our courts, and to uphold the standards of the judiciary and our institutions.” Unlike the House GOP’s stunt impeachment of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas earlier this year, the articles filed on Wednesday are on much more solid constitutional grounds. Mayorkas was impeached for the supposed crime of enacting the president’s immigration policies. Unsurprisingly, he was acquitted in the Senate (though even if he had been removed, his successor almost certainly would enact the exact same policies). In contrast, it is not policy differences with Alito and Thomas that are sparking Democrats’ desire to remove them, though there are many. Note that there aren’t similar calls for impeaching Justices Neil Gorsuch, who sides most often with Alito and Thomas, or Chief Justice John Roberts, who led the way on gutting the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and granting former President Donald Trump sweeping criminal immunity this term. Instead, it is Thomas and Alito’s actions that call into question their ability to issue rulings free from bias, financial gain or malice. Specifically, in her speech Ocasio-Cortez accused the justices of violating the the Constitution’s “Good Behavior” clause. Article III, Section 1 states that federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, “shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” Broadly speaking, this means that there is no specific term that justices are limited to, nor can they simply be replaced because a new administration is in the White House or control of Congress has flipped. But many (though not all) legal scholars believe that the phrasing implies a higher standard for judges than other federal officers who are subject to impeachment. None of the articles filed against Thomas and Alito explicitly make this case in the text. Instead, they both frame the charges as violating the more traditional impeachment standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” as laid out in Article II, Section 4. While neither set of articles outright accuses the justices of being bribed, one of two specific crimes delineated in Article II, both call out the justices’ refusal to disclose those financial ties and recuse themselves from related cases. This does little to weaken the Democrats’ arguments, as each article cites relevant criminal laws that Thomas and Alito have allegedly violated. It is important to be realistic about the prospects for these articles. There is no chance that they will be voted on, let alone pass. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has staunchly defended Thomas and Alito’s documented improprieties. But Ocasio-Cortez is right to place in the record that at least some legislators take issue with the behavior on display and have determined it is unbefitting members of the nation’s highest court. Further, given the importance of the decisions that these two justices, or their successors should their seats become vacant, will be called upon to make in the coming years, it is incumbent on Democrats to highlight Thomas and Alito’s mockery of an impartial judiciary. Impeachment is a political act, meant to punish political crimes against the country, committed by those empowered with the public’s trust. It is fitting then that their removal for breaking that trust should be front and center in the political campaigns of those who would want to see trust in the court’s decisions restored."
Trump's lawyers are taking full advantage of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-lawyers-judge-merchan-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-rcna161477,"Last month’s landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, Trump v. United States, holding that former presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for official acts, has gifted former President Donald Trump with yet another legal delay tactic. And sure enough, on Thursday, the day Trump was supposed to be sentenced for his Manhattan business fraud felonies, lawyers formerly asked a state court judge to vacate the former president’s historic hush money conviction.   This motion was not a surprise. New York Criminal Procedure Law 330.30 allows a defendant to request that the trial judge set aside the guilty verdict at “any time after rendition of a verdict of guilty and before sentence.” The grounds for doing so are limited, but within hours of the Supreme Court decision, Trump’s lawyers told Judge Juan Merchan in a letter that Trump’s conviction should be set aside.   The Supreme Court’s decision at first blush appears not to be relevant to the New York case. After all, the efforts to cover-up allegations of infidelity ahead of the 2016 election occurred when Trump was a candidate and not yet in the White House. However, Trump’s lawyers are arguing that evidence was shown during his trial that included White House “official acts."" This evidence, Trump's legal team says, “should never have been put before the jury.”    Merchan, with the consent of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, rescheduled Trump’s July 11 sentencing to Sept. 18. At that point, he will decide whether the Supreme Court decision requires the 34 guilty counts to be set aside. That decision held that presidents have absolute immunity for official acts that relate to their core constitutional authority, presumptive immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial acts. Determining which acts fit into which category remains untested territory. But not for long.   Trump’s lawyers previewed their motion in their letter to Merchan. In the letter, Todd Blanche and team argue that during trial and summations jurors heard testimony and saw documents that placed “highly prejudicial emphasis” on evidence that should be considered “official acts.” They argue this evidence includes Trump’s social media posts and public statements while in office; witness testimony regarding events in the Oval Office (most likely that of former communications director Hope Hicks and executive assistant Madeleine Westerhout); toll records reflecting calls Trump made while president; and an ethics financial disclosure form he filed in 2018.  Merchan will need to parse through these various actions and determine which, if any, should be entitled to absolute or presumptive immunity. Arguably, I could see a case for why Hicks' and Westerhout's testimony could be covered by official acts immunity. But the Supreme Court's guidance on how courts should make the distinction between official and unofficial does not provide Merchan with broad discretion. The Supreme Court directs that in distinguishing between official and unofficial conduct “courts may not inquire into the President’s motives,” nor can they “deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.” And in a footnote of his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts advises that the “prosecutor may not admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.”    In New York, jury trial convictions are rarely reversed by appellate courts. When a reversal occurs on prejudicial evidence grounds, the appellate court has found that the improperly admitted evidence was so highly prejudicial it denied the defendant a fair trial. So it's possible Merchan and the New York appellate courts may find that the admission of official acts evidence during trial was prejudicial, but not so highly prejudicial that it denied Trump a fair trial, especially in light of the overwhelming mountain of evidence of guilt.    It is unclear, however, whether the U.S. Supreme Court would agree that the conviction should survive.   Roberts in the majority opinion accused the dissenters of striking a “tone of chilling doom” about the decision. Chilling or not, it’s clear the decision will have major ramifications beyond the New York case — and for years to come. "

Why Barack and Bill are right to stay quiet — for now,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 13, 2024, 3:00 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/are-obama-bill-clinton-not-talking-joe-biden-rcna161656,"While former President Barack Obama did post on X in the days following the first presidential debate and former President Bill Clinton did as well, both Democratic leaders have largely remained out of the spotlight. So where have they been? Exactly where they should be right now: behind the scenes, acting as sounding boards with other party leaders like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, donors and members of Congress. Because while both Obama and Clinton are widely respected elder statesmen, there are several reasons why they can’t just put an end to the re-election drama surrounding President Joe Biden and tell the party who should be the nominee in August. For one thing, the Democratic Party — including party insiders — do not like being told what to do (most of the time). Hillary Clinton didn’t win the nomination in 2008 even though she had the strong endorsement of her husband. And the progressive wing of the party didn’t love it when Obama came close to endorsing Clinton during the primary process in 2016. A clear and unified statement could certainly tamp down some of the speculation about whether the party should take a different route for the nominee — and that uncertainty is one of the biggest challenges right now. But while both men are generational talents as politicians, even Obama has been out of the electoral game for 12 years. County, district and state maps as well as voter outreach strategies have changed a lot since then. Obama and Clinton swooping in to tell everyone what to do could backfire in other ways as well. As imperfect (to put it mildly) as this moment is in the Democratic Party, it’s important that any debate within the party is conducted fairly and legitimately. I don’t know what is going to happen, and with every day that passes it feels more likely Biden will hold on. But once a final decision is made, Democrats will need all the party unity they can muster. And that means Obama and Clinton are smart to wait until the question is settled to weigh in. That’s the moment when they can maximize their collective impact. This may happen next week, or the week after, or maybe at the convention. But once it does happen, the focus can return back to Donald Trump and the true threat America is still facing. Clinton and Obama remain two of the most popular politicians in the Democratic Party, and their voices will be needed on the campaign trail. With everything else going on this week, you may have missed key members of the Senate Judiciary Committee — and one very well-known House member — getting a bit spicier when it comes to holding two of the most ethically dubious members of the Supreme Court accountable. On Tuesday, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Ron Wyden, D.-Ore., urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate the alleged ethics violations of Justice Clarence Thomas. In their letter to Garland, Whitehouse and Wyden cited a “willful pattern of disregard for ethics laws” by Thomas, suggesting that his conduct surpasses that of other government officials previously investigated by the Department of Justice for similar issues. This escalation didn’t come out of nowhere. Thomas’ concurring opinion in Trump v. United States questioned the legality of Jack Smith’s special counsel appointment. While there is no evidence proving Thomas wrote this opinion with the knowledge that he could someday become the subject of a special counsel investigation himself, it’s hard not to see the opinion as “convenient” — to say the least. At the same time, in the House of Representatives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filed articles of impeachment against both Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito. While the articles are not going to advance in the Republican-controlled House, Ocasio-Cortez’s move marks one of the boldest efforts yet from Democrats to push for accountability — at least in the court of public opinion. Those of you following my personal Instagram already know I have been counting down the days to the Paris Olympics. One of the athletes in this year’s Games I am absolutely floored by is USA swimming star Katie Grimes. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Grimes was the youngest member of Team USA at just 15 years old and finished fourth in the women’s 800-meter freestyle. She secured her ticket to Paris with a third-place finish in the 10K open-water swim at the 2023 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka. Despite similarities between Grimes and fellow swim star Katie Ledecky, who qualified for her first Olympics at 15, the two athletes are friends, not rivals. In fact, Ledecky is incredibly supportive of her fellow swimmer. The duo has even earned the nickname “Katie squared.” What show are you bingeing right now? A little late to the party on this one, but I’m catching up on “This Is Us.” I’m also getting ready to binge the Olympics and cheer on America’s athletes as they go for gold in Paris! What’s the last book you read? “La Nueva California” by David Hayes-Bautista. It’s a fascinating perspective on the history of Latinos in California — and a glimpse at the future of the United States. What time do you wake up on the weekends? 6 a.m. I have three kids! How do you take your coffee? Usually with light cream. Sometimes I treat myself with half a packet of sugar."
Democrats’ infighting over Biden becomes fuel for right-wing conspiracy theories,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 3:27 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/democrats-biden-drop-out-conspiracy-theories-republicans-rcna161527,"The tumult within the Democratic Party over President Joe Biden’s fitness for office and ability to win in November has become rich fodder for right-wing conspiracy theories. One running theory, as The New York Times reported Friday, is that Biden’s poor debate performance was somehow the result of a sly maneuver by Democratic Party elites to push him off the ticket: The theory aligns with an unfounded claim that has long circulated among the right and has even been promoted by some prominent Republican lawmakers — that the party has secretly wanted to replace Biden on the top of the ticket with another Democrat, such as former first lady Michelle Obama. It’s not unlikely that that conspiracy theory is rooted in Biden’s pronounced aging — after all, he already was the oldest person to be elected president in the U.S. But there’s no evidence whatsoever that Democrats have been working behind the scenes to push him out; the fact that the party is in such disarray right now should speak to that. The party’s woes have nothing to do with an imaginary plot to toss him off the ticket and everything to do with the reality of his age. The theory also is directly contradicted by another conspiracy theory: that Democrats and the media have been conspiring to shield the public from the truth about Biden’s health. Furthermore, with Vice President Kamala Harris viewed as a potential replacement should Biden step aside, years-old conspiracy theories about her are making a comeback. It’s no surprise that such absurd ideas are so rife among the right: Republicans have long embraced conspiracy theories. And their standard-bearer, who launched his political career with a racist lie about then-President Barack Obama, remains one of the fiercest peddlers of the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. But as we’ve seen, these conspiracy theories are often in conflict with one another — and they make even less sense when taken together."

The dismissal of Giuliani’s case does not absolve him of his debts, and his creditors can now go after his assets to try to recover some of the money they’re owed.

Texas’ power grid wasn’t made for the rapid succession of storms it sees now,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 2:04 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-beryl-power-outages-houston-tracker-maps-rcna161474,"When Hurricane Beryl tore through Houston this week, it knocked out power to about 2.26 million power customers. Beryl, which struck the Texas coast as a Category 1 hurricane Monday morning, was the third major storm to strike the nation’s fourth largest city in less than two months. To our knowledge, that’s unprecedented and is a reminder that climate change can rear its ugly head by intensifying storms in unforgiving ways. On May 16 and 17, a derecho with straight-line winds of 100 mph hit Houston with little notice. It blew out thousands of windows in downtown skyscrapers, killed eight people and toppled transmission towers, cutting off power to almost 1 million customers. Before May ended, a destructive storm knocked out the power for 325,000 customers (By our calculations, that's about 875,000 people.) Though power was restored quickly in both cases, two powerful storms in quick succession left the system battered and weakened. Add in the fact that it’s been a relatively wet year. The soft soil makes it easier for trees and poles to fall over when the wind blows. Oftentimes repair crews will make temporary fixes to quickly restore power with plans for permanent repairs to follow. In this case, it is unlikely that all repairs from the previous two storms were complete. Then Beryl struck. It’s always dramatic, dangerous and damaging when a hurricane strikes a major city. Houston is no stranger to hurricanes. But they don’t usually strike this powerfully this early in the season, and never before has a hurricane struck so quickly on the heels of two other significant storms. The aftermath is a crisis. Losing power briefly is inconvenient, uncomfortable and disruptive to the economy. But going without power for multiple days during a heat wave can be downright deadly. The total toll in lives and dollars is huge.  It’s clear now: The weather has changed, but the power grid has not. So, what can innovators, markets, utilities, cities, states and the federal government do to prepare for and recover from storms? The first thing we need to realize is that for the most part we designed and built our grid decades ago, when the weather was milder. This quick succession of three major storms followed by a heat wave is unprecedented but could be a preview of the future. The stakes are high, and there are solutions at hand we can implement. So what steps can we take to better our chances for the next storm? The first step after a crisis is acceptance. We need to understand that storms like these can happen and are going to happen more often. The Gulf of Mexico is getting warmer with climate change, and warmer oceans are more fuel for hurricanes. Hurricane Beryl set multiple records, including as the only Atlantic Category 4 storm to form in June and the strongest July hurricane we’ve ever seen. We need better communications with those affected by storms. In our modern world, we have come to expect prompt and near constant lines of communication, especially in times like these. Utility outage maps were down even before the storm hit, leaving people to rely on the Whataburger store app to know which parts of the city had power. Though people only use outage tracker maps in rare instances, when they need them, they really need them to be robust. We need to spend the effort to better model the impacts of storms on the electricity sector. Utilities in the paths of storms should be modeling thousands of future hurricanes and their impacts on the electricity sector. Finding where these storms have common areas of damage overlap and focusing grid hardening efforts in those areas could reduce the impacts for when those storms eventually do hit. The vast majority of the time, customers lose power because of damage to the distribution system, the small wires and poles that take power the last mile to your home or business. These parts of our infrastructure are the most visible and sometimes are left more vulnerable by our own well-meaning actions, such as pushing back against tree trimming efforts by local utilities. While it is often more expensive up front, we need to consider putting more of our electricity infrastructure underground and installing stronger poles, such as those made of concrete, steel or composites, in critical areas where older, fragile wooden poles are waiting to fail. Even with our best efforts, we will not be able to guarantee that the system will be invulnerable against anything thrown at it by nature or humans. We should be looking into strategically deploying energy storage, solar and microgrids (smaller electricity systems that can provide local power when the big grid is down) to particularly risky or important areas. Though much of the electricity system was still down after Beryl, the sun was back up the next day, and the same sun that is making the conditions unbearable could be used to make electricity where it is needed, as long as that infrastructure to store and use it were also hardened to the storm. Building more efficient homes means they will stay at a more comfortable and safe temperature for longer after the power goes out. And we need to make sure that there are plenty of places where those without power can access safe community cooling centers. For instance: schools with solar panels that can host those without power and provide a safe and healthy place for families to wait for the power to be restored. In the end, we have to decide resilience is worth the investment. Regulators and rate payers often balk when rates go up to invest in a better system. So, we usually don’t spend the money and we stick with a fragile system that can fail. However, it would be cheaper and more equitable to pay for a better system that stands up more robustly against powerful weather. It feels more expensive up front, but it saves money in the spared lives and in the outages and damages that are avoided. Saving money up front feels prudent, but it’s costly when the system fails to withstand the storm. Ultimately, intensifying weather is a threat to the power system and modern society, but we have solutions. We should implement them."
Project 2025’s plan to criminalize porn has a sinister subplot,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 1:42 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/project-2025-porn-ban-lgbtq-transgender-rcna161562,"Amid the 920 pages' worth of conservative ideas in the Project 2025 plans for a second Donald Trump administration, one stands out for its sheer improbability: criminalizing pornography. Just five pages into the foreword by the president of the far-right Heritage Foundation think tank, the proposal stakes out an uncompromising position that porn should be banned, porn producers and distributors should be sent to prison, and tech companies that circulate it should be shut down. It's true that politics makes strange bedfellows, but we're talking about anti-porn crusaders teaming up with Trump, who has literally had his share of strange bedfellows. To recap: Trump has said, unconvincingly, that he does not know the people behind Project 2025 and does not support all of its proposals. But on this subject, he has previously endorsed a similar idea, signing a pledge from the group Enough is Enough in 2016 to crack down on porn and potentially appoint a presidential commission to look at the ""harmful public health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture."" (He did neither.) As with other sections of Project 2025, one of your first thoughts when reading it is: Who wants this? The polling is mixed, at best. Gallup’s annual social survey has found that only 38% of Americans think that pornography is “morally acceptable,” down slightly from a high of 43% in 2018 but still higher than the low of 30% in 2011. That puts it somewhere between the number who think “sex between teenagers” and “cloning animals” is morally acceptable. (The question specifically states that this is regardless of whether you think it should be legal.) Digging into the crosstabs is instructive, though. The groups that are most accepting include people aged 18 to 35, college graduates and liberals, while the least accepting were people over 55, people who didn’t finish college and conservatives. In other words, banning porn would be popular with Trump's voter base, and unpopular with everyone else. But the Project 2025 proposal is even more sweeping than the one Trump endorsed in his first campaign, indicating that its anti-porn language may be covering for a broader crusade against LGBTQ rights. It's worth reading in full: That's a lot to unpack. Under this proposal, Stormy Daniels might be the one at the defendant's table next time, and Trump's new friend Elon Musk might see X shuttered for being too XXX. But the giveaway here is in the two examples provided at the beginning ""transgender ideology"" and ""sexualization of children."" That echoes similar rhetoric being used by groups such as Moms for Liberty to oppose everything from drag queen reading hours to LGBTQ books in school libraries, but the rest of the paragraph takes it to another level. After all, ""transgender ideology"" is a broad enough term to not just cover specific books that some parents might find objectionable, but the very idea that people can be transgender. Other sections of Project 2025 make this clear, calling for barring transgender Americans from serving in the military, reversing anti-discrimination rules that bar employers from firing workers for being LGBTQ and issuing regulations that declare that gender reassignment surgery is ""dangerous"" and should not be covered by health insurance. But while recent clashes around LGBTQ rights have revolved around removing books from the shelves or even, in one case, barring children from a public library entirely, the broad wording in the Project 2025 proposal could be read as a call for forcing teachers and librarians to register as sex offenders for merely stocking books that acknowledge that transgender people exist. That could even end up including classics such as Ovid's ""Metamorphoses,"" Virginia Woolf's ""Orlando"" or Armistead Maupin's ""Tales of the City."" Unlike other, more detailed proposals in Project 2025, it's unclear exactly how this would be put into place. As the foreword glancingly acknowledges, the Supreme Court has held since 1973 that obscenity laws only apply to works without any ""serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value"" — although the current conservative majority has been known to overturn decisions from that far back. A number of states have passed laws requiring age verification to access adult content online, though the proposal doesn't mention that approach. Perhaps, as with Trump's 2016 pledge, the vague proposal to ban porn may go nowhere in a second term. But the anti-LGBTQ proposals that it portends almost surely will."
Controversial judges block Biden protections for LGBTQ+ students,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 1:16 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/controversial-judges-block-biden-protections-lgbtq-students-rcna161641,"When conservative opponents of the Biden administration’s protections for LGBTQ+ students decided to go to court, they knew exactly which jurisdictions to file their cases. Reuters reported: The injunctions don’t come as much of a surprise, and they represent the first step of a legal process that will continue to unfold. But it’s worth noting which specific judges blocked the White House’s policy. One of the jurists was U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who, as regular readers know, is a Trump-appointed judge in Texas. He’s also earned a reputation as one of the most controversial members of the federal bench. It was, for example, Kacsmaryk who took it upon himself to suspend the FDA’s approval of mifepristone last year, relying in large part on highly dubious studies — which have since been retracted. (The ruling was ultimately overturned for procedural reasons.) When a federal judge blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a new rule in Texas that would require firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows, that was Kacsmaryk, too. When a conservative group wanted to challenge energy efficiency standards, they figured it’d be a good idea to file the case in Kacsmaryk’s district. When a conservative group wanted to challenge the administration’s protections for LGBTQ+ students, they did the same thing. The right’s assumptions are well grounded, as we were reminded again today. The other judge was U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, whose name might also sound familiar. The week before Christmas in 2018, for example, O’Connor agreed to strike down the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, root and branch. Even many conservatives and ACA critics agreed that the ruling was indefensible, and reactions tended to include words and phrases such as “pretty bananas,” “embarrassingly bad,” and “absurd.” The New York Times noted soon after that Republicans had a habit of bringing their cases to this specific district court because of their confidence that O’Connor would give them everything they wanted: “He ruled for Texas in 2015 when it challenged an Obama administration measure extending family leave benefits to married same-sex couples. ... He also ruled for Texas in 2016, blocking the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines expanding restroom access for transgender students.” In 2022, the same judge, nominated by George W. Bush, also undermined the Navy’s vaccine requirements, ignoring generations’ worth of precedent. A year later, O’Connor took steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act again. The tactic goes by different names. I’ve seen it referred to as “forum shopping,” “judge shopping,” “venue shopping,” and “court shopping,” but the phrases all mean the same thing: Instead of simply taking one’s chances in the judiciary, many litigants effectively try to hand-pick ideologically aligned jurists, filing their cases in specific districts in the hopes of guaranteeing success before the process even begins in earnest. In Trump’s hush-money case, his GOP allies were invested in the idea that prosecutors engaged in court shopping, pursuing an indictment in a court where a conviction was more likely. That never made any sense: Trump’s crimes were committed in the district in which he was charged. If Republicans are looking for some actual examples of court shopping, I’d refer them to Kacsmaryk’s and O’Connor’s docket. This post updates our related earlier coverage."
Judge dismisses Rudy Giuliani's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 12:11 PM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-dismissed-chapter-11-rcna161580,"A judge has dismissed Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case, nearly seven months after the disgraced lawyer filed for Chapter 11 protection. In a decision on Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane cited a list of factors to support the dismissal, including that remaining in Chapter 11 would “erode much, if not all, of the value of the estate” due to Giuliani’s lack of cooperation, which he noted is unlikely to change if a trustee were appointed. Lane also cited Giuliani’s outstanding lawsuits with most of the creditors, writing that those cases are “better resolved outside the bankruptcy forum.” The dismissal of Giuliani's case does not absolve him of his debts, and his creditors can now go after his assets to try to recover some of the money they're owed. It also means that Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the Georgia election workers whom he defamed after the 2020 election and whom he was ordered to pay nearly $150 million, can begin to collect on that sum. Proceedings can also resume in other lawsuits that have been on hold since Giuliani declared bankruptcy, including defamation suits by two voting machine companies and a sexual harassment claim from a former employee (a representative for Giuliani said it was a ""consensual relationship""). The former lawyer for Donald Trump is also barred from filing for bankruptcy again in the next 12 months to provide his creditors with time to enforce their judgments or pursue lawsuits. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December after the judgment in Freeman and Moss’ defamation case was handed down, and bankruptcy protection prevented them from immediately collecting the money. (Giuliani’s appeal in that case can move forward now that his bankruptcy proceedings have ended.) But his bankruptcy case did not go smoothly. Giuliani’s creditors accused him of using bankruptcy to avoid paying the money he owes and expressed deep frustration at what they characterized as attempts to obfuscate his assets. Giuliani also filed reports to the court about his spending and earnings that The New York Times described as ""incomplete and confusing."" At a hearing on Wednesday, Giuliani erupted at the accusations of fraud, calling them “highly defamatory.” His lawyer Gary Fischoff told the judge that his client “would not commit any bankruptcy fraud.” In his decision, Lane criticized Giuliani’s conduct in the case, which he said hindered the bankruptcy process. “The record in this case reflects Mr. Giuliani’s continued failure to meet his reporting obligations and provide the financial transparency required of a debtor in possession,” he wrote. In a contentious hearing earlier this week, Lane had indicated that he was inclined to dismiss the case. Giuliani’s creditors had been seeking the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee to control his assets, but Moss and Freeman — the only creditors who have a judgment in their civil lawsuits against Giuliani — split from the group and asked the case to be thrown out. And although Giuliani initially requested that his case be converted to Chapter 7 so that his assets could be liquidated, his lawyers earlier this week agreed with Freeman and Moss to dismiss the case."
U.S. intel officials: Russia wants to boost Trump in 2024 race,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 11:30 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/us-intelligence-officials-russia-wants-boost-trump-2024-election-rcna161613,"Shortly before the presidential debate two weeks ago, NBC News reported on a network of pro-Kremlin social media accounts that were “attempting to spread false narratives.” Not surprisingly, those narratives were intended to help Donald Trump. This was not an isolated incident. The Wall Street Journal reported this week: A senior official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters, “We haven’t observed a shift in Russia’s preferences for the presidential race from past elections.” That seemed like a polite way of effectively saying, “Moscow wanted Trump in power before, and Moscow wants Trump in power now.” What’s more, Russia’s interest in the outcomes of our election is especially acute right now because of the United States’ support for Ukraine. Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy of the German Marshall Fund, who tracks foreign disinformation efforts, told NBC News earlier this year, “Not that they didn’t have an incentive to interfere in the last two presidential elections. But I would say that the incentive to interfere is heightened right now.” But as Moscow’s efforts come into focus, it’s worth appreciating the familiarity of the circumstances. In 2016, Russia targeted U.S. elections. There used to be a bipartisan consensus on this obvious and uncontested fact. In 2018, Russia targeted U.S. elections. Though Trump, for reasons that have never been explained, rejected his own country’s intelligence on the matter, the United States’ top national security officials made it categorically clear that Russia took deliberate steps to interfere in the midterm cycle. In 2020, Russia targeted U.S. elections. In fact, intelligence officials told Congress about the evidence showing that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign for the express purpose of trying to secure a second term for Trump. In 2022, Russia targeted U.S. elections. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported last year, “The Russian government and its proxies attempted to denigrate the Democratic Party and undermine voter confidence ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.” And in 2024, Russia is once against targeting U.S. elections. The pattern isn’t exactly subtle. But as Rachel has explained on the show, one of the most important differences between the Kremlin’s latest efforts and the Putin regime’s earlier intelligence operations is that many Republican officials no longer bother with the pretense that Russian intervention is a problem.

Voter apathy this election cycle is another privilege Black Americans do not have,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 11:22 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joyce-beatty-black-voter-turn-out-biden-rcna161584,"UPDATE (July 23, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET): This column has been updated to include Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nevada and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus who was on the panel at the Essence festival that addressed the need to vote. To many Americans, our democracy is a given; yet, for African Americans, it is a lifesaving gift demanding our unwavering defense. This gift promises not only prosperity but shields us with the strength of pluralism. In the crucible of the past three years, the visionary leadership of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris has steered us through the darkest days of the worst pandemic since the 1920s. Their administration unveiled a monumental infrastructure bill that has not only rebuilt our roads and bridges but also our communities. The administration's persistent commitment to prosperity for all Americans has created 2.6 million jobs for African Americans, unlocked historic educational opportunities through the expansion of Pell Grants, increased access to housing, and broadened health care for Black communities by increasing Black enrollment in the Affordable Care Act by 49%. These are not just policy achievements; they are critical lifelines, and now we fear that we may lose the immense progress we have made. It would be a death blow. At the Essence Festival of Culture this month, even the sweltering heat and humidity of New Orleans paled in comparison to the deep anxiety brewing over the future of our nation’s democracy. We have watched the erosion of the sacred right to vote, once safeguarded by the Voting Rights Act, and now witness our political systems — created to protect us — seemingly turn against us. This betrayal menaces our dreams of security, equality and prosperity. With the Supreme Court appearing to sanction abuses of power, our hearts sink. We fear our democracy is dangerously close to collapsing under the weight of countless challenges to its institutions and norms. Should our democracy falter, Black Americans know that we would be the first to suffer the impact. That’s why my Democratic colleagues Rep. Maxine Waters of California, Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana and Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, rallied with me at Essence fest, the country’s largest showcase of African American music and culture, to urge attendees to vigorously defend democracy. We reminded everyone of the stark choice before us: advance with Joe Biden or decline with Donald Trump. We must not retreat from our sacred duty to vote. Indifference is a luxury we cannot afford. While some dismiss concerns about our democracy’s stability, their detachment echoes the complacency of those who, during the civil rights era, ignored the urgent cries for equality. Fully enjoying their rights, they boldly proclaimed to those who didn’t: “Wait, your time will come.” They have not had to march in the streets against bigotry to receive the rights they were promised at their nation’s birth. They’ve never had to vote as though their freedom depended on it. They are silent about the erosion of rights because they don’t belong to a group at risk. But we are a member of the endangered group. We do not have the privilege of apathy. The fight for freedom has always been and is once again at our doorstep and we cannot afford apathy when oppression knocks on our door. As a morally bankrupt Donald Trump, who’s been convicted of 34 felony counts, runs for the presidency again, our nation is at risk of backsliding beyond where we’ve been before. Despite his claim to have been the best president for Black Americans since Abraham Lincoln, Trump has sanctioned white supremacy, directed his harmful rhetoric at communities of color and threatened to cut federal education funding. He is driven not by a vision for prosperity, but by retribution against his political rivals. In contrast, President Biden and Vice President Harris are propelling our country forward, envisioning a future where jobs flourish, health care is accessible and reproductive rights are protected. They celebrate our diversity. The choice is clear and binary: Biden vs. Trump. We don’t have the luxury of voting for a third party or not voting at all. Given the strong turnout expected from Trump’s supporters, every other voter must support the best alternative for protecting our democracy: the Biden-Harris ticket of the Democratic Party. Vice President Harris, addressing the Essence festival, declared the upcoming November election the most consequential of our lifetime. She’s right. Turning away from democracy now would mean abandoning the freedoms we have so fiercely fought to secure. We cannot succumb to disillusionment or a ""nothing will change"" mentality while so many continue to fight for their rights at risk. The stakes are too high, and our resolve must be equally high. We must still venture to hope. We must look toward that bright picture in New Orleans, where prideful music and empowered voices rang through the air and see the work that has brought our community this far. The sacrifices of the past have led us here, and an equally passionate mobilization today will ensure that their work was not in vain. Our determination today will shape the destiny of future generations. We must vote like our lives depend on it because they do. "
Melania Trump to make rare public appearance at the Republican National Convention,Not Avaiable For MSNBC,"July 12, 2024, 9:56 AM PDT",https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-republican-national-convention-2024-rcna161552,"After months of being conspicuously absent from the campaign trail, Melania Trump is scheduled to attend the Republican National Convention next week. A source familiar with the convention's plans told NBC News that the former first lady will be at the four-day event in Milwaukee, where Donald Trump will officially accept his party's nomination. It's not yet clear if she will join the lineup of speakers at the convention or how she might formally participate in the event's programs. One of the more inscrutable figures in her husband’s orbit, Melania Trump shares his disdain of the media and has kept a low profile in this election. The presumptive nominee told NBC News’ “Meet The Press” in September that his wife would be on the campaign trail with him “pretty soon.” But to date, she has only made two official public appearances for his campaign: joining him when he announced his re-election bid in November 2022 and voting for him in the Florida primaries in March this year. She has also attended several private fundraisers, as well as a dinner at Mar-a-Lago for Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán in March. The former first lady has otherwise not attended any of Trump's rallies or public events, and she did not accompany him to court during his hush money trial. There will be heightened focus on Melania Trump if she does address the convention this year. In 2016, her RNC speech was found to have plagiarized parts of Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. She also spoke at the convention in 2020, though much of that speech focused on her experience as first lady."
