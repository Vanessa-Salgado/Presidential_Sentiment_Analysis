Live updates: Trump apparent assassination attempt on Florida golf course | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-16T10:54:15.892Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-attempt-election-news-09-16-24/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Monday told followers on X to “join me live from Mar-a-Lago” on X Spaces at 8 p.m. ET.  Trump had been scheduled to launch a new cryptocurrency business called World Liberty Financial at 8 p.m. on X Spaces. Trump’s post suggests the launch is moving forward as planned despite the assassination attempt that took place at Trump International Golf Club the day prior. One of the two federal gun laws Ryan Wesley Routh has been charged with has come under judicial scrutiny in recent years as courts have reexamined the nation’s gun laws in light of a 2022 landmark Supreme Court decision expanding Second Amendment rights. Routh, the suspect of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday, was charged Monday with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and possession of a firearm while a convicted felon.   The constitutionality of the federal law underpinning the second charge has been examined by federal courts around the country in recent years after some people convicted under it or subject to its prohibition have tried to take it off the books.   Courts have been divided on whether it is constitutionally sound. In one case, a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court that had initially said the law was constitutional as applied to a man convicted of welfare fraud said that the federal law violates the Second Amendment. It cited the 2022 Supreme Court decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, that said firearm laws must be rooted in historical tradition. But other federal courts have upheld the prohibition, including in cases concerning people convicted of violent and non-violent felonies.   The Supreme Court was asked this year to settle the question for good, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying in court papers that disagreement among lower courts about the law’s constitutionality “is undermining public safety.”  This June, the Supreme Court said that some types of regulations can withstand the strict test it created two years ago. The Supreme Court has now asked lower courts to look at cases involving the felon disarmament law with that revised structure in mind. When there were rumors of a plot against the life of Abraham Lincoln before his 1861 inauguration, there was no official protection for the president-elect. Southern states were seceding from the Union in protest of Lincoln’s election, and the rumored plot out of Baltimore led Lincoln, at the urging of the private detective Allan Pinkerton, to sneak into Washington, DC, disguised on a late-night train. During his presidency, Lincoln eschewed bodyguards despite threats. The night Lincoln was shot at Ford’s Theatre the following year, his lone guard was at a saloon next door. But incredibly, it was on the day Lincoln was shot that the president had signed legislation creating what is today the US Secret Service. However, the agency was commissioned within the Treasury Department, and the Secret Service was entirely focused on counterfeit money. The Secret Service didn’t start protecting presidents until 1894, and only part time, after agents probing a group of gamblers discovered an assassination plot aimed at then-President Grover Cleveland. Two more presidents — James Garfield in 1881 and William McKinley in 1901 — would be killed before Congress officially tasked the Secret Service with protecting US presidents full time. McKinley’s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was the first president to get round-the-clock protection, but only two agents were assigned full time to the detail. What was once just two full-time agents assigned to protect Roosevelt in 1902 has now grown to a force of thousands under the Department of Homeland Security. The entire Secret Service employs nearly 8,000 people, and it secures thousands of events each year. In fiscal year 2023, it guarded 33 “protectees.” Read more here President Joe Biden decried Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and condemned political violence in remarks from Philadelphia on Monday. Biden, speaking at the National HBCU Week Conference, commended the Secret Service for its “expert handling” of the situation and said the acting head of the agency, Ronald Rowe, is in Florida “determining whether any further adjustments need to be made to ensure the safety of our former president.” The president added that assassination “solves nothing. It just tears the country apart. We must do everything we can to prevent it and never give it any oxygen.” Attorney General Merrick Garland promised in a Monday statement to use “every available resource” in the investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump. Garland said that “the FBI is continuing to investigate what appears to be an assassination attempt of former President Trump” and that “we are grateful that the former President is safe.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, has an extensive criminal history in North Carolina, records show.  In 2002, he was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges, including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon and ID card fraud.  Those are the most serious charges he faced, but the records also show a litany of less serious accusations as well — some of which were dismissed. He has faced multiple charges related to worthless checks in separate cases. While some cases were dismissed, he pleaded guilty to one such charge in 2003.  In 2009, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. The case was dismissed.  In 2010, he was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods and received three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, though a court docket states the case was dismissed.  He has faced various other charges related to traffic issues. For example, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to driving with no registration. Separately, state and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. He faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. The Pennsylvania State Police provided the bipartisan congressional task force investigating the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump with the documents it requested due Monday, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  “They were responsive to our request,” the source added.  The request included a slew of documents and information from the Pennsylvania State Police, including transcripts of interviews, body-camera footage and radio communications.   The task force also requested internal communications and other information related to the July 13 event in Butler, Pennsylvania. Some background: The task force, made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was approved by the House in July in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, but the appointment came at a fraught political time as members work to prove to both parties that they’re thoroughly investigating the attempted assassination. The 13 lawmakers have until mid-December to issue a final report and recommendations in the investigation. Members of the task force promised last month to get to the bottom of the security failures even if it may be a “slow process,” after the group toured the Pennsylvania rally site where the shooting took place. The FBI is investigating what it said is an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Florida golf club Sunday, the second time in two months there has been an apparent attempt on the former president’s life. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. Federal and local law enforcement are expected to provide updates on the investigation at a news briefing later today. Here’s where things stand now: Former President Donald Trump on Monday continued to try to blame Vice President Kamala Harris’ rhetoric for the apparent assassination attempt at his golf club on Sunday. In a new post on social media, the former president pointed to Harris’ statements during the ABC presidential debate, without specifying which ones.  “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Trump has repeatedly claimed the debate last week was “rigged” against him and has bashed the debate moderators and said he will not participate in another debate before the election. He also continues to baselessly claim that the criminal charges he faces and his felony conviction were masterminded by President Joe Biden and Harris because Trump is running for president.  In his first interview after the apparent assassination attempt in West Palm Beach posted earlier on Monday, Trump also sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life and argued in his first interview since the incident that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.”   Authorities recovered an SKS-style rifle with a scope from the area Ryan Wesley Routh fled Sunday after he was spotted by a Secret Service agent, according to newly unsealed court documents.  An affidavit from Mark A. Thomas, an FBI special agent, said Secret Service agents recovered a “loaded SKS-style 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope,” as well as a digital camera and two bags, including a backpack. The affidavit included a black-and-white photo of the items law enforcement found. Routh was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.  He could face years in prison if convicted of the two charges, according to court documents. The felon in possession of a firearm charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, while the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum of five years in prison and three years of supervised release. Officials from the Secret Service, the FBI and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office will hold a public briefing at 4 p.m. ET to provide updates on the investigation into Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The briefing will take place near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump tried to bring people over to fight in Ukraine via non-official means, against the advice of the International Legion in the country, and had “delusions of grandeur,” according to a former recruiter for the military unit. Evelyn Aschenbrenner, an American citizen who served for two years in the International Legion in Ukraine, a military unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces that is composed of foreign volunteers, told CNN they warned Ryan Wesley Routh several times to use official routes to recruit people to fight in Ukraine and bring them across the border — but he just wouldn’t listen. Aschenbrenner, who identifies as gender fluid and uses “they/them” pronouns, worked as an administrator and then in an official recruiting role within the International Legion. “In August 2022, Routh put my phone number and another recruiter’s phone number on a website that he had designed. I got angry. I told him, ‘Take this down. You didn’t get our permission. The legion already has a recruiting website, there’s no need for you to be doing this. There’s already enough disinformation about Ukraine. Don’t start adding to it,’” Aschenbrenner said. Instead, Routh kept trying to bring people over the border into Ukraine, Aschenbrenner said. “In August 2022, for Ukraine’s Independence Day, there was a high security risk, with curfews in place in Kharkiv and other cities. And Routh messaged me asking to get some random person over the border and he sent me this poor woman’s passport,” they said. Aschenbrenner replied to Routh, saying they had no authority to bring people over, and highlighted the strike alert all over the country. “It’s a military. There’s a chain of command,” Aschenbrenner said they told Routh. “You need to be okay with possible delays. It’s an active war zone.” But Aschenbrenner said Routh got mad about that and replied to them in a message, which was seen by CNN: “I’ll tell the world Ukraine does not want help…it is obvious.” Aschenbrenner said they never saw Routh in Ukraine, neither in a combat zone nor in a military base.  “He seemed to have this delusion of grandeur thing, where he was the … I’ve seen this with some other volunteers on smaller scales … they’re the only one really helping Ukraine,” Aschenbrenner said. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office released bodycam video of the apprehension of Ryan Wesley Routh on Sunday on an interstate in Florida. Routh, who is suspected of planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf on Sunday, was stopped on the highway after authorities say a Secret Service agent engaged a suspect near Trump’s golf club after noticing the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. Bradshaw said a witness saw a man run from the bushes. Routh was later detained in Martin County, about an hour drive from Trump’s golf club. See video of the moment: CNN’s Evan Perez, Holmes Lybrand, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed reporting to this post. In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted at Trump’s golf club was “unreadable to the naked eye.”   One of the charges Routh is facing has to do with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number — meaning that when law enforcement recovered the weapon Sunday, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump, made his initial court appearance Monday morning at a federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court sketches show Routh standing before the judge. Ryan Wesley Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, law enforcement got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 am local time Sunday until 1:31 pm local time, when a USSS agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. The court document also details Routh’s past run-ins with the law, including felony convictions in North Carolina. He was convicted in 2002 for “possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction,” and he was convicted in 2010 for “multiple counts of possession of stolen goods.” Federal law prohibits individuals convicted of a felony from possessing firearms. The arrest of the Trump attempted assassination suspect Sunday was a “textbook case of a traffic stop of a known felon,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said Monday at a news conference. At about 1:55 p.m. Sunday, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office got a BOLO – or “be on the lookout” alert – about a suspect in the case heading north on I-95, with a vehicle description and a tag number. Every available unit – about 30 in all, he estimated – went out to search. One patrol deputy saw the suspect vehicle at about Mile Marker 110 and alerted others but did not immediately try to stop the vehicle, Snyder said. Instead, the deputy waited for two large F-250 pickup trucks to get in place on the highway. Those trucks surrounded the vehicle, he continued, and forced it to a stop at about Mile Marker 112. Officers then did a “felony stop,” calling the suspect out of the vehicle. He came back and was handcuffed, the sheriff said. They turned the suspect and his vehicle over to the FBI. Snyder praised his team for following procedures designed to avoid a high-speed chase or a shootout. The sheriff also praised the witness who told authorities he had seen a suspect flee the golf course and get into a Nissan. “That witness deserves a lot of credit,” Snyder said. A criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, was unsealed shortly before noon ET Monday after he made his initial court appearance where federal prosecutors charged him with gun-related charges.  An affidavit in the court file details what unfolded Sunday at Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida where a US Secret Service agent thwarted an apparent assassination attempt. Read the full criminal complaint below: Former President Donald Trump is still planning on attending his previously scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump’s virtual address on cryptocurrency on Monday evening will continue as planned. Trump is expected be in Flint, Michigan, tomorrow, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday and Washington, DC, this week. One of the charges Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, is facing involves possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. That means when law enforcement recovered Routh’s weapon, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. It’s a common charge you see with drug and gang suspects. Most times people don’t manage to obliterate the serial numbers in every place it is imprinted on the gun. They can do the ones readily visible but not others in harder-to-reach places.  In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number was “unreadable to the naked eye.”  So far, Routh has been charged with two firearm counts. Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach, Florida, said Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, will face federal, not state charges.  Aronberg told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. It may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it would be very difficult to argue insanity in this case because Routh fled the scene, showing he was aware his actions were wrong. Aronberg told MSNBC the evidence left behind including the two bags, ceramic tiles, GoPro, AK-14 rifle and scope will be key in making the case against Routh for attempted murder. The 2024 presidential election is less than 50 days away and the campaigns and their allies are continuing to blitz battleground states with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advertising, Pennsylvania looming largest. Since July 22, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out to September 16, the top seven battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada — have seen $688.7 million in combined presidential advertising. During that stretch, Democrats lead Republicans — including campaigns and outside groups — by about $369.3 million to $315.3 million. Here are the latest numbers by broken down by state:  Pennsylvania Michigan Georgia Wisconsin Arizona North Carolina Nevada Pennsylvania remains the premier battleground, accounting for about $185.3 million in total ad spending since Biden dropped out, and Democrats are beginning to open a meaningful edge there after weeks in which the parties have been running close. As of today, Democrats have spent about $100 million on presidential ads in Pennsylvania, compared to about $84.3 million for Republicans. Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to blame President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life at his Florida golf club. During an interview with Fox News Digital the former president said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.”   The former president pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.”   He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” Trump said. Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Donald Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought against Ryan Wesley Routh, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors are seeking to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate what the FBI has said appears to be an attempted assassination. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he has not yet spoken with former President Donald Trump after what appeared to be an attempted assassination on him as he played golf on Sunday, but reiterated that his state was doing its own investigation as “there is a need to make sure that the truth about all of this comes out in a way that is credible.” While taking questions, DeSantis explained his reasoning for why Florida was doing its own, separate investigation to the federal one. DeSantis said more details about the investigation would be announced in the coming days. He first announced the investigation on Sunday on X. DeSantis made the comments at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, where he appeared alongside education leaders in the state. During Monday’s hearing in federal court in Florida, Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect behind the apparent assassination attempt, answered the judge’s questions with nods and “yes judge” responses. The judge found Routh couldn’t afford his own attorney after he said he had “zero funds” in savings. He was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, Routh told the judge, but had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Prosecutor Adam McMichael said they would be asking for pre-trial detention, citing a risk of flight and danger to the community. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf on Sunday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, has been charged with two firearm counts. The counts include possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.   A detention hearing has been set for September 23 and the arraignment is set for September 30. The White House weighed in on the now-deleted post from Elon Musk, calling the comment “irresponsible” and saying violence should be “never encouraged or joked about.” Musk deleted a post Monday morning questioning why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is holding a news conference in Orlando, Florida, a day after an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is speaking at an elementary school, addressed tertiary education across Florida and did not mention the incident involving Trump. Yesterday, the Florida governor announced on X that his state will conduct its own investigation of the incident. The apparent assassination attempt took place at Trump International Golf Club, which is located in West Palm Beach. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed to this report. Kamala Harris’ campaign does not plan to address the weekend’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in a political manner, sources said, and any forthcoming remarks from the vice president on the developments are expected to closely mirror her statement released by the White House Sunday night. Both President Joe Biden and Harris were briefed on the incident in West Palm Beach, and both were quick to condemn all kinds of political violence and express relief that the former president was not harmed. Harris said in a statement — released in her official capacity as vice president via the White House — that she was “deeply disturbed” by the apparent assassination attempt. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said. “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe.” Harris is participating in a meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, this afternoon. She is also spending part of the day preparing for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump,  is in federal court for an initial appearance Monday morning. Routh is wearing dark prison scrubs, and his feet and hands are shackled. He has been escorted to a holding area to await his appearance. Federal prosecutors have not yet announced what charges Routh will face. He was taken into custody Sunday after being stopped on the highway following the shooting incident. Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe is on the bench. Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe plans to remain in Florida “indefinitely” as the investigation into an apparent second assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump plays out, according to USSS spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.  Rowe will also meet with local law enforcement today and then do a walk through of the golf course this afternoon, Guglielmi told CNN on Monday.  He was appointed to the position on July 23, after Kimberly Cheatle resigned after Trump was shot in the ear in an attempted assassination. Trump and Rowe will meet today in Florida this afternoon, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this post. The man detained in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was so calm when he was stopped it was “perplexing,” the sheriff of Martin County, Florida, recalled.  “His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Sheriff William Snyder told CNN on Monday morning. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.” Despite the commotion surrounding his apprehension – the area “crawling with law enforcement … SWAT team (that) had gotten out their rifles, helicopter, I-95 shut down, a bomb dog” – the man never even asked why he got pulled over, Snyder said. The traffic stop unfolded after the sheriff’s office got a BOLO – a “be on the lookout” alert – with a vehicle and tag description, Snyder said. A road patrol deputy spotted the vehicle, followed it for a couple miles and waited for big trucks with heavy bumpers to get there and force the vehicle to a stop, he said. Deputies then conducted a felony stop and safely brought the man out of the vehicle into custody, Snyder said. Ryan Wesley Routh is appearing in federal court Monday morning. Now, Snyder’s main concern is to investigate whether anyone else was involved, he said. “Are we tracking with a conspiracy?” he asked. “That’s the question that I think has to be answered.” As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states this week, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. President Joe Biden wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the second apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, he told reporters Monday.  “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said. Asked by CNN’s Kevin Liptak what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. The Secret Service faced significant scrutiny following the first assassination attempt against Trump when he was struck in the ear during a rally in July. Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. He later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read more about the impact the assassination could have here. Ryan Wesley Routh, the detained man behind Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt, was a small business owner in Hawaii and avid supporter of the Ukrainian war effort. CNN spoke to another Hawaiian business owner and a journalist in Ukraine, both of whom had interacted with Routh in the past. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with the AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” In another instance, Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 upfront to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained Sunday in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, was driving his daughter’s car when he was apprehended, according to a law enforcement source. Routh was detained after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. He then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The person detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt Sunday on former President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course did not fire any shots, the Palm Beach County sheriff said Monday morning. The man is detained at a “federal holding facility,” Bradshaw added. Asked whether he is talking, Bradshaw responded: “No.” Bradshaw also praised the quick action of the Secret Service for keeping the former president safe. “This is not like what happened in Butler,” he said, referring to the assassination attempt against Trump two months ago in Pennsylvania that sparked scrutiny of the Secret Service. A photo of the moment 58-year-old Ryan Routh was detained by police in Florida, after allegedly being caught with a rifle on a golf course where former President Donald Trump was playing has been released. The Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence on Sunday and agents fired at Routh, who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. It is believed he then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office shared the image with CNN on Monday. Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secures the areas before he arrives. Read the full story. Ryan Routh attended a demonstration in support of a Ukrainian National Guard brigade in Kyiv in 2022, according to images verified by CNN. But in an official statement, the 12th National Guard Azov Brigade told CNN: “He has nothing to do with our brigade.” Other Ukrainian military groupings have issued similar statements saying Routh was not involved with them despite him expressing interest in aiding Ukraine.  A representative from Ukraine’s Land Forces Command foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted it several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. The Ukrainian military’s International Legion of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, another foreign legion organization, also said Routh had “never served” and “has no relation to the unit.” Ryan Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and had visited the country. Routh’s time in Ukraine: In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  He used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war, trying to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. “The US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line and this matter is under investigation,” the Secret Service representative said. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. “We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Bradshaw said. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. “In the bushes, where this guy was, is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope; two backpacks, which were hung on the fence and had ceramic tile in them; and a GoPro. … So, those are being processed right now,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said."
New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s administration is in chaos as federal probes target his inner circle | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:22 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T10:45:41.284Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/eric-adams-new-york-mayor-chief-counsel/index.html,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s administration is unraveling. Late Saturday night, the mayor abruptly announced the resignation of his top lawyer and most ardent public defender. Days earlier, his police commissioner stepped down under pressure as a quartet of federal probes targeting numerous members of Adams’s inner circle hits a boil. The stunning departure of chief counsel Lisa Zornberg, a former federal prosecutor, opened up a new and troubling chapter in the political and legal crisis now gripping City Hall. “I am tendering my resignation, effective today,” Zornberg wrote in a short letter, “as I have concluded that I can no longer effectively serve in my position.” Adams in a statement thanked her and said he would name a temporary replacement in the coming days. “These are hard jobs and we don’t expect anyone to stay in them forever,” Adams added in a bid to downplay the remarkable nature of Zornberg’s decision. By Monday, at least three Democratic officeholders – progressives from the state assembly, Senate and city council – had called on Adams to resign. The mayor rejected the notion in a call with reporters and suggested his critics, particularly those who have sparred with him before, were politically motivated. “Any time anything happens in this city, and they call for me to leave, are we supposed to listen to them now?” Adams said. “I was elected by the people of this city and I am going to continue to meet my obligation to the people of this city.” Adams has been fending off allegations that corruption and malfeasance permeate the highest ranks of his administration for months, first stemming from an active federal investigation into corruption and illegal campaign donations linked to Turkey and foreign travel, according to a source familiar with the matter. Adams is now entering an already fraught 2025 re-election bid under the cloud of at least four separate federal investigations – a political and legal onslaught that New York Democrats broadly expect to ramp up in the coming weeks and months. Adams has not been accused of any wrongdoing and the administration has said it will cooperate with all investigations. Brian Blais, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, spoke to CNN about the potential problems Adams could face. “If campaign finance related charges are brought, or FARA (foreign agent registration act) charges relating to acting as an agent of the Turkish government, or bribery charges to the extent he was taking favorable actions in exchange for those campaign contributions, those are all serious charges, and those carry significant consequences,” said Blais.
“There’s at least some real degree of legal peril for the mayor.” The growing probes – underscored by increasingly aggressive tactics from prosecutors, who stopped Adams on the street last year to seize his phone – also signal mounting political trouble for the retired police captain who outlasted a crowded field of Democrats in 2021 on his way to winning the city’s top job. Even before he was elected, Adams embraced the national media spotlight, declaring himself the “face of the new Democratic Party” and, after being invited to the White House, described himself as “the Biden of Brooklyn.” But the luster quickly faded. First with Biden, after Adams publicly criticized the president’s handling of the border and a migrant crisis that hit hard in New York. The mayor’s reputation for enjoying the nightlife – at the expense, Adams’s critics say, of his day job – and repeated clashes over city spending, especially on education, dimmed his political star. Adams’s political troubles, though, have been magnified and multiplied by the federal probes, which are picking up pace as the 2024 political season heats up. Investigators in the Southern District of New York have been circling Adams and his administration for nearly a year. Last November, the mayor’s chief fundraiser was raided by FBI agents. Days later, Adams himself was presented with a federal search warrant for his electronics. That remarkable escalation by federal prosecutor Damian Williams was followed by a period of relative quiet until earlier this month, when FBI officials issued search warrants and showed up at the homes of several Adams administration officials. The group included the city’s First Deputy Commissioner Sheena Wright, the Schools Chancellor David Banks and the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks III, according to multiple sources familiar with the probe. Investigators also issued a subpoena to Terence Banks, the youngest of the Banks’ brothers – who ran a lobbying firm that advertised “government relations” and promised to help private sector clients navigate “New York’s intricate infrastructure and political landscape.” Tim Pearson, a former NYPD officer and adviser to the mayor, was also included in the searches, sources briefed on the investigation say. None of the officials have been accused of any crime. Wright said in a briefing last week, “I’m confident that I have done nothing wrong,” and was “cooperating fully.” David Banks said in a statement he was “cooperating with a federal inquiry.” An attorney for Phil Banks said in a statement, “In my judgment I don’t believe he has any criminal liability in this investigation whatsoever.” An attorney for Terence Banks told CNN, “We have been assured by the Government that Mr. Banks is not a target of this investigation.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Pearson for further comment. US attorneys’ offices and the FBI have declined to comment. But the most shocking blow landed at One Police Plaza. NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, the leader of the largest and most expensive police force in the nation, had his phone seized along with several other police officials’ devices as part of an investigation into a nightclub security business run by his twin brother, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. He resigned under pressure days later, saying in a statement that “news around recent developments has created a distraction for our department.” Caban’s lawyers said on Thursday they’ve been informed he is not a target of any investigation and he expects to cooperate fully with the government. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Adams’s top spokesperson touted the administration’s record on public safety and affordability, and suggested New Yorkers were not paying close attention to the investigations. “We are investing in the programs and initiatives that working-class New Yorkers care about – that’s what our city’s residents and our administration are focused on every day,” said Fabien Levy, the deputy mayor for communications. “No matter what is going on in our city, New Yorkers recognize that we are in a much better place today than we were 2.5 years ago.” While the spate of aggressive investigative maneuvers sent shockwaves through political and law enforcement circles, Adams has not been charged with any crime. That decision will ultimately come down to the discretion of Williams’s office, compounding the pressure on the prosecutor as he seeks to navigate a fraught moment – with the presidential election less than two months away. “If something is going to happen, if there are people in the mayor’s political orbit, or the mayor himself, who is going to be charged, I think that, in DOJ ‘s view, it likely needs to happen by March (2025),” said Blais, now a partner at the law firm Ropes and Gray. “So you’re talking about a six-to-seven month window left before any significant action is likely, or during which any significant action is likely to occur.” Other observers are predicting a shorter timeline at least in part because of the uncertainty surrounding this November’s election. Victory for former President Donald Trump, who would again take over the Justice Department, could upend Williams’s office. One former top aide to top prosecutors in New York told CNN that Williams, “a very thoughtful, considered guy,” is conscious of the stakes – both in this election cycle and the broader sweep of city history. “He’s aware of all the implications here,” the former aide said. “He’s aware that this is the second Black mayor. He’s aware that he’s a Black prosecutor. None of this is happening without that awareness, which to me makes it even more scary if I’m Eric Adams.” Williams on Monday, while announcing public corruption charges against two former fire department chiefs in what is believed to be an unrelated probe, demurred when asked what he would tell New Yorkers concerned over the City Hall investigations. “I am constrained on what I can say,” Williams told reporters. “I speak when there is something to be said and I don’t have anything to say about that at this point.” He did, however, offer a pointed message about his office’s work. “We are determined to address it from root to branch, and our work is far from done,” Williams said. “If you are aware of and participated in corrupt activity in our government, now is the time to come forward to get on the right side of the law.” For his part, the mayor has insisted that he never broke the law, nor knew of any of his friends and colleagues’ potential wrongdoing. During brief remarks to reporters after Caban stepped down, Adams insisted again that he was “surprised” by the breadth of probes and said he was taking “them extremely seriously.” “I’ve spent more than 20 years in law enforcement, and so every member of my administration knows my expectations that we must follow the law,” Adams said, repeating a variation on a message he’s given a handful of times now. This latest round of phone seizures and subpoenas have, as a political matter, all but guaranteed that Adams will face a robust set of Democratic primary challengers next year. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie of Brooklyn is expected to launch his bid soon. City Comptroller Brad Lander is already in, along with his predecessor, Scott Stringer, who also ran in 2021. Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, kicked off her campaign on Friday, less than a day after Caban resigned. Others, including state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani could still join the fray. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 with impeachment looming following the release of a report that found he sexually harassed 11 women, has also seeded rumors about a potential run. Cuomo has denied the allegations. Adams’s record as mayor, headlined by controversial budget cuts and what critics call a lack of a signature program or legislative achievement, always seemed bound to attract intra-party challengers. But the close-to-home nature of the federal probes appear – at least to some rival Democrats – to be a uniquely damaging development. “Crises are a problem when they bring up for an incumbent candidate things people were already feeling and double down on or amplify something that was already out there,” said Stringer adviser Alyssa Cass. Another veteran New York campaign strategist with experience in City Hall but no ties to this race and speaking anonymously because of the sensitive nature of the latest developments, warned that Adams’s challengers needed to carefully calibrate their messages. Their attacks, so far, have mostly focused on a perception of “chaos” in the administration and an argument that Adams is a weak manager. “Adams does not lose unless you start taking away some part of his coalition,” the strategist said. “And that is a working-class coalition. You don’t need to speak about who’s managing city operations, you need to talk about who’s getting you what you need, to (argue that) Adams has been compromised and is totally beholden to these shady special interests. And it’s hurting you.” As those political chips fall in place, other Democratic strategists and operatives say now is the time for Adams to focus on that base, with its backbone in Southeast Queens, and remind supporters why they voted for him in the first place. “Just because Caban resigned doesn’t mean that the problems are going to go away, even if he tries to cut ties with some of these folks,” Camille Rivera, a New York City-based political strategist, told CNN. “I would run a campaign now, I would be out there in the community, running my town halls, being in the districts, having conversations with my people and solidifying my base if I feel like I’ve done nothing wrong.” That message, though, has become increasingly tough to get across – and not only because of his Covid quarantine. In some of the most recent, in-depth polling, from December 2023, when he was only facing a probe into his campaign fundraising, Adams’s overall approval rating dropped to a staggering 28%, according to a Quinnipiac University survey. Hispanic voters, a critical part of his base, came in even lower at 20%. Among Black voters, Adams was still favored by 10 points, 48% to 38%, an advantage he cannot afford to forfeit. The mayor’s office lashed out over the poll, with a spokesman criticizing its methodology and pointing to falling crime – which has gone down in the city and nationally – and an improved economic outlook. Adams received a boost earlier in the summer when the Rev. Al Sharpton wrote an op-ed backing the mayor and suggesting that the opposition was racially-coded, recalling the defeat of the city’s first Black Mayor, David Dinkins, to Rudy Giuliani in 1993. “The criticism of Adams and the disconnect between perception and reality of his administration of this city is extreme,” Sharpton wrote. “Somehow it seems easier for those who are against him to get their message through, and for the damning, coded, curse of incompetence to be laid on his head.” Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a Brooklyn Democratic leader and top ally, delivered a similar message last year, telling reporters she was “concerned about whether these investigations are just targeting him because he’s a Black mayor.” Adams has not directly embraced that narrative, but he has repeatedly cast himself as unduly persecuted – including referencing the Biblical Book of Job, the story of a righteous man whose faith is tested by a series of personal calamities. “I wish I could tell you that I had one moment in my life that was a Job moment. But I did not have one, I had many,” he said during a visit last Sunday to the Power and Authority Evangelical Ministry in East New York, another political stronghold. Adams is not the first mayor to find himself under investigation, but if prosecutors decide to bring charges, he could become the first New York mayor indicted in the modern era. Mayor Jimmy Walker resigned in 1932 while facing an investigation. More recently, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself in the crosshairs of investigators because of his fundraising practices before the US Attorney’s Office declined to bring charges against him. It’s still unclear when each of the Adams administration’s investigations began, but former Assistant US Attorney Jennifer Beidel says it’s possible that a phone seizure in one case could lead investigators onto another totally different case. “That’s one of the most dangerous things about having your electronic devices seized. We all have a lot of material on it,” said Beidel, now a government investigations attorney at the law firm Dykema. “So you don’t have much ability to limit where law enforcement takes that info after.” Despite the ongoing cases, Biedel told CNN it has become clear that federal law enforcement agencies are zeroed in on City Hall. “The goal in the public corruption unit is to focus their resources on conduct that is concerning,” she said. “They wouldn’t continue that apparent focus if they didn’t believe there was something there.” That reality, in legal but also political terms, is setting in among some of Adams’s closest allies and friends in the administration. “I had a number of FBI agents who came to my home and wanted my personal phone and my DOE phone, outside of that I don’t know a lot,” David Banks, the city schools chancellor, said on Friday, adding that federal agents have not yet returned his phones. “We will all wait and see where these investigations go.”"
Speaker Johnson navigates Trump and a narrow majority in government funding fight | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T10:00:19.741Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/government-funding-johnson-trump-narrow-majority/index.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson is once again facing a major challenge as he navigates a government funding fight while under pressure from an extremely narrow majority in the House and former President Donald Trump. Congress is up against a shutdown deadline at the end of the month, but so far there is no clear consensus on a path forward. Adding to the urgency is the fact that vulnerable lawmakers hope to hit the campaign trail for the final stretch ahead of the November elections as soon as possible, and the threat that a shutdown could lead to fallout at the ballot box. The course the speaker charts could also factor into whether he can hold onto his leadership post after the election. Trump has also waded into the funding fight, a dynamic that could further complicate the effort to avert a shutdown. The GOP presidential nominee has said that if Republicans don’t receive “absolute assurances” on election security, they should not pass a funding extension. The move comes as Trump continues to sow doubts over election integrity in the run-up to the 2024 elections. If Trump digs in on his demand, that could make it even harder for Congress to ultimately pass a “clean” funding extension, which is widely viewed on Capitol Hill as the only viable way to avert a shutdown. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has been pushing a six-month funding plan that includes the SAVE Act, a controversial GOP-led bill that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. But the plan is viewed as a non-starter in the Senate and faces opposition within the House GOP conference as well. The speaker has emphasized agreement with Trump, but he has limited options and little margin of error with such a narrow majority in the House and with Democrats in control of the Senate. Johnson pulled a vote on the GOP funding plan last week after at least eight Republicans had publicly come out against it, enough to sink the bill in the House along with Democratic opposition. “Congress has a lot of responsibilities, but two primary obligations: responsibly fund the government and make sure that our elections are free and fair and secure, and that’s what we’re working on,” Johnson told reporters as he announced the vote would be pulled. “We’re going to continue to work on this. The whip is going to do the hard work and build consensus. We’re going to work through the weekend on that.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said last week that Johnson is “not getting anywhere” by trying to pass a funding package without Democratic support. “We need a bipartisan bill where everyone comes together and figures out what to do,” Schumer said. “You’ve seen the chaos in the House because Speaker Johnson is trying to do this in a partisan way, guided by the far right. He’s not getting anywhere.” As the November elections dominate the political landscape, however, bipartisanship may be even more difficult to achieve. Schumer has announced that that the Senate will once again vote on an IVF bill, after the same bill failed to advance in June amid widespread GOP opposition and after Trump said in August that he will implement a policy as president that would pay for in vitro fertilization treatments, without specifying how the treatments would be paid for. “Republicans can’t claim to be pro-family, only to block protections for IVF,” Schumer said. “The American people deserve another chance to see if Republicans are for access to IVF or against it.” CNN’s Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox and Aaron Pellish contributed to this report."
Analysis: New apparent Trump assassination bid is another dark moment with unpredictable political consequences | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:44 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T04:00:19.798Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/political-consequences-trump-assassination-attempt-analysis/index.html,"There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. In his most expansive reaction to what happened, Trump posted on his Truth Social network Sunday evening about what he described as “certainly an interesting day!” “I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE,” Trump wrote. “THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” Vice President Kamala Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and President Joe Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” As crass as it may be to consider political ramifications in the immediate aftermath of an apparent assassination attempt, everything in America is politicized within minutes — especially with 50 days left until a close election. Trump — who within seconds of surviving his first, much closer assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, stood up and said, “fight, fight, fight” — quickly released a fundraising email on Sunday afternoon that read, “I am Safe and Well!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” Trump wrote in the email that linked to a site allowing supporters to donate. And one of the ex-president’s top allies, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, released a statement reprising the idea Trump was spared by divine providence, which was a recurrent theme at the Republican National Convention. The House GOP conference chair suggested that after what had happened, the country now had a duty to elect Trump. “Thankfully, God continues to watch over President Trump. As Americans we must unite behind him in November to protect our republic and bring peace back to the world,” she said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, after visiting the former president at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Sunday, also suggested that Trump had benefited from divine intervention and played into the narrative that Trump is unbeatable. “No leader (in) American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable.” That sense of Trump being protected by God animated his supporters’ feeling at the Milwaukee convention that he was destined for victory. Such assumptions were dampened, however, when Biden shelved his reelection bid, allowing Harris to jump in and transform the contest. The man detained in the apparent assassination attempt had been spotted by the Secret Service several holes ahead of the former president at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Stefanik asked how “an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again?” She wrote: “There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida.” The New York Republican’s questioning of the Secret Service is likely to foreshadow debate in the coming days about the level of the former president’s protection — especially given what happened in Butler. Trump has already suggested, without evidence, that the Biden administration and Harris were complicit in the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania because he claims they weaponized the Justice Department against him. But all of Trump’s criminal problems have proceeded through regular order in the courts, and there is no evidence that the White House is in any way involved. The second apparent assassination attempt comes against the backdrop of a turbulent campaign that has defied convention and predictions. For the first time since 1968, a sitting president folded his reelection campaign within months of the election, reluctantly making way for his vice president, who has a chance to become the first Black woman and South Asian commander in chief. The Republican nominee is a convicted felon who is facing multiple criminal charges over his unprecedented attempt to stay in power after losing the last election. If he is returned to the White House, Trump would be only the second president who lost reelection to win a nonconsecutive second term. The ex-president’s actions in the coming days will be closely watched. After the first assassination attempt, the former president called on the country to come together. But his unity pledge didn’t last much longer than the first third of his speech at the Republican National Convention, which degenerated into the characteristic divisiveness on which he built his political career. Trump has also repeatedly ignored the advice of senior Republicans and his campaign team to stick to a sharp, concise argument against Harris. They’d like him to focus on her role in the Biden administration’s economic policy at a time when many voters are still struggling with high prices despite a lowering of the inflation rate. So even if his aides counsel him to renew his national unity theme, there’s no guarantee Trump will listen or consider it in his political interests. Another apparent attempt on his life is likely to have some level of personal impact on the former president. In the days after narrowly cheating death or serious injury in Pennsylvania when a bullet grazed his ear, Trump seemed chastened. But ever since, he has returned to his rambunctious self and, if anything, his rhetoric has become even more extreme. He’s recently been warning his political opponents that he will turn the law against them and lock them up if he considers the election fraudulent, and he has doubled down on his baseless claims that the last election was stolen. In the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s incident, the focus of most Trump opponents was on maintaining calm at a volatile moment. There can be no justification in a democracy for attempting to silence any political figure by violence. At the same time, however, in the coming days, there will be debate about the extent to which the former president — a uniquely inflammatory figure — has helped to stoke the nation’s divides. Earlier this weekend, for example, the ex-president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had been heightening political tensions. Both Republicans have highlighted baseless claims that Haitian refugees in Springfield, Ohio, have been stealing and eating pets. Trump’s opponents have warned that his continued racial demagoguery is putting lives at risk. In a contentious interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Vance insisted that the claims about the Haitian migrants — who are in the United States legally — were validated by complaints from some of his constituents. And far from backing away from the story — despite testimony from multiple local officials that there’s no truth to the rumor — Vance angrily condemned suggestions that recent bomb threats against the city had anything to do with him and Trump escalating the claims. He told Dana Bash: “This town has suffered terribly under the problem — under the policies of Kamala Harris.” But Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, asked on ABC on Sunday whether he had seen any evidence of the pet-eating rumors, said, “No. Absolutely not.” The Ohio governor added that the Haitian migrants, whom Trump threatened on Friday to deport to Venezuela, were in the country legally. In normal circumstances, an apparent assassination attempt against a presidential candidate might be expected to unleash a surge of sympathy that could translate into a political boost. But the latest near-miss for Trump comes at a moment when the race with Harris is neck-and-neck. While both candidates are fighting over perhaps several hundred thousand movable voters in swing states, it’s not clear how much room remains for changing perceptions about Trump, who has been a polarizing figure ever since his 2015 launch of his first national campaign. The former president is all but certain to use the latest events to reinforce his baseless claim that he’s a victim of persecution meant to keep him from power. But it’s too early to say whether the second apparent assassination attempt will have greater political impact than the first. Ultimately, it’s going to be up to voters to sort out this unpredictable and dangerous campaign season."

Earlier, Henry Winkler and Ron Howard appeared onstage to reminisce about the legendary series that made them household names, “Happy Days.” While things are pretty contentious these days, it was a joy to remember when simply picking which channel to watch was the most stressful part of TV. But all isn’t lost and there was also plenty to remind us that the industry is still churning out some pretty good work, even in the face of the ever-expanding crush of content. Jean Smart’s joke about believing the hit Netflix series “Baby Reindeer” was about Rudolph the red-nosed one was well-timed, providing the perfect setup for that show to win the Emmy for limited/anthology series, along with acting trophies for star and creator Richard Gadd and his costar Jessica Gunning. The dark drama is actually based on Gadd’s experience with a woman he said started as a friend and turned into a stalker. He had some words of wisdom in one of his acceptance speeches. Hopefully, Hollywood continues to take note regarding good storytelling, and leans into Gadd’s urging to “dare” and take risks. Ultimately, though, Emmys night kept coming back to the theme of representation and the constant need to do better. Colón-Zayas became the first Latina to ever win in her category, which was a good reminder that there are still some hills left to climb in Hollywood. “Shōgun” won top honors as outstanding drama show, becoming the first ever non-English language series to win the award. And “Hacks” was somewhat of a surprise winner in the outstanding comedy series category, placing a women-led series that deals with sexism and later-life career struggles in the spotlight. Encapsulating the energy of the night, John Leguizamo gave an impassioned speech paying tribute to the historic Latinx nominees and recognizing other minorities in the Emmy nominee pool, saying he was “one of Hollywood’s DEI hires,” going on to define DEI as “diligence, excellence and imagination.” “We are all DEI hires,” Leguizamo said. It was Rose family reunion on the Emmys stage Sunday evening when “Schitt’s Creek” stars Catherine O’Hara and Annie Murphy joined hosts Dan and Eugene Levy. Murphy, with the Levys, took to the stage at first, with Murphy joking that she heard they’d asked the “shining star of ‘Schitt’s Creek’” to present the final award. Dan Levy then broke the news to his onscreen sister that the person in question actually wasn’t her, and the three of them then introduced O’Hara to present the final award of the evening. O’Hara, who played Rose family matriarch and TV icon Moira Rose on “Schitt’s Creek,” joked that she was “shocked and delighted” to be presenting the award for best comedy series. After O’Hara jokingly tore up the winner’s envelope, crying out about why “must we really choose a winner,” she pulled out the actual winner’s envelope and announced that “Hacks” won the Emmy for best comedy. “Hacks” has won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series, earning the top award despite stiff competition from “The Bear.” Writer and co-creator Paul W. Downs thanked the cast, crew and writers of the show and made a case for more representation onscreen while accepting the award. The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. The third season of “Hacks” finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. Red carpet season is underway: The biggest names in television descended on LA’s Peacock Theater for the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards tonight.  Check out some of the most memorable looks from the night:  See all the best photos from the red carpet here. “Shōgun” has won the Emmy for outstanding drama series, making it the first ever non-English language series to do so. Hiroyuki Sanada, who won an Emmy for outstanding lead actor from the show, then gave his speech in Japanese, which Marks translated. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. About a week after its debut, Disney reported that the first episode garnered 9 million views globally across its streaming platforms Hulu+, Disney+ and Star+, making it the company’s top scripted general entertainment series premiere globally. CNN’s Christy Choi, Julia Chatterley and Lisa Respers France contributed to this post. Anna Sawai took home the Emmy award for outstanding lead actress in a drama series for her role as Lady Mariko in “Shōgun.” It’s her first Emmy win and nomination. While accepting her award, she thanked the Television Academy, her fellow nominees within the category, her family as well as her cast and crew. “This is to all the women who expect nothing and continue to be an example to everyone,” she said. “Shōgun,” the epic historical drama, is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. CNN’s Christy Choi and Julia Chatterley contributed reporting. Christine Baranksi, Viola Davis and Gina Torres appeared on stage to argue their case for why lawyers are among some of television’s favorite — and most astute — characters.  “The lawyer sees our witness,” Baranski — who played Diane Lockhart on “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” — said.  Davis, who portrayed professor of defense law Annalise Keating in “How to Get Away with Murder,” added one caveat: “Lawyers have seen every combination of the human condition and their efforts.” Torres added that in so many ways, lawyers work to “better the human condition.” The actress embodied Jessica Pearson in the legal drama series “Suits.” The trio appeared on stage to present the award for lead actress in a drama series. The Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series goes to Hiroyuki Sanada. This is his first nomination and first Emmy win. “Shōgun” is notching some major victories tonight, and is one to watch later tonight. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, is only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The series is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. CNN spoke with Sanada, who plays Lord Yoshii Toranaga, about how showrunners brought the series to life. CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this post. The dark Netflix hit “Baby Reindeer” took home the Primetime Emmy award on Sunday night for best limited or anthology series. He introduced and thanked the show’s cast and crew who was onstage alongside him. Gadd also went on to highlight the show’s willingness to take risks and encouraged other showrunners to do the same. “There’s no set formula to this,” he said, urging people to “take risks, push boundaries, explore the uncomfortable, dare to fail in order to achieve.” Jodie Foster, the two-time Oscar-winning actress, has won the first Emmy of her career. Foster was recognized as best lead actress in a limited series, anthology or TV movie for her work in “True Detective: Night Country.” “This is an incredibly emotional moment for me because ‘True Detective: North Country’ was just a magical experience,” Foster said. She thanked her “champ and my partner in crime” Kali Reis, her costar on the show.  Foster also highlighted the indigenous people of northern Alaska, who figure in the show. Richard Gadd has won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a limited series, anthology or TV movie, earning recognition for “Baby Reindeer,” a project he created based on his own harrowing experience with a stalker. While accepting his award — which is his second Emmy of the night — Gadd thanked the show’s directors “for bringing out the best in me,” as well as his parents.  “They’re the best,” he said of his mom and dad, adding that they’ve been through “some trying times as a family.” “Baby Reindeer” is a dramatized version of real events that happened to series creator and actor Gadd. In the show, Gadd’s character, Donny, meets Martha (Emmy-winner Jessica Gunning) at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, generating headlines and speculation about the characters and who inspired them. Gadd’s story is real, but he says the version that appears in his thriller miniseries has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. CNN’s Sydney Bishop and Hilary Whiteman contributed reporting. Jimmy Smits, Niecy Nash-Betts and Don Johnson pulled up to the Emmys stage to reflect on their roles as TV cops.  Smits described his “NYPD Blue” character, Det. Bobby Simone, as a “strong and sensitive, street-smart type,” while Nash-Betts joked her “Reno 911!” character, Deputy Raineesha Williams, got by on the job by only having “marginal knowledge of the law.”  Johnson’s character in “Nash Bridges,” meanwhile, played by his own rules but always brought the bad guy to justice.  Smits begrudgingly then pointed out that his “NYPD Blue” character died by the end of it, but Nash-Betts had better luck — her characters always survive.  This year’s In Memoriam was a little bit country with award-winning country singer Jelly Roll performing. Jelly Roll performed his song “I Am Not Okay” and talked about the “healing power” of music and storytelling. Dionne Harmon, one of the awards shows producers, told Variety the singer took a break from his tour to perform for the Emmys Sunday. “He is literally stepping off tour for a day and going right back on the road when he’s done,” said Harmon. “So, we’re so grateful to him. Jesse did a lot of begging to get that!” Music director Rickey Minor told the publication before the show he thought the “decision of what particular song to do will touch everyone.” “I cry every time I hear it,” Minor said. “Everyone at home, make sure you have tons of tissue around.” Following the performance Jimmy Kimmel remembered legendary comedic actor Bob Newhart who died this year. Actor John Leguizamo appeared on stage to recognize the diversity among the nominees at Sunday’s ceremony and speak to representation in Hollywood. He started off specifically honoring the many Latinx nominees present in the audience, including Selena Gomez, Nava Mau and Liza Colón-Zayas. Leguizamo joked that he’s one of “Hollywood’s DEI hires,” going on to define DEI to mean “diligence, excellence and imagination.” (DEI is an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion, and has been a political flashpoint.) Leguizamo spoke about how when he was younger, he didn’t know that people like him, a person of Latin descent, could be actors.  Leguizamo then recalled the full-page ad he took out in the New York Times directed at the Television Academy, calling on voters to “recognize candidates of color,” joking wryly that the ad alone had solved all the problems in the industry. This year’s list of nominees, he said, is “among the most diverse” in history. With more of the drama categories now in focus, we might be entering the “Shōgun” period of the program. The historical drama just won for best directing in a drama series. “Thank you so much for this,” director Frederick E. O. Toye said.  He thanked Hulu, Disney and FX for giving him the honor to participate in the project.  He thanked the “team of amazing actors and actresses who led the way. I owe them everything,” he said. The historical drama, based on James Clavell’s bestselling novel, became only the second non-English language program to be nominated in the outstanding drama category. The epic historical drama is set in feudal Japan in 1600. Most of the cast was hired from Japan, and the majority of the dialogue in the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. About a week after its debut, Disney reported that the first episode garnered 9 million views globally across its streaming platforms Hulu+, Disney+ and Star+, making it the company’s top scripted general entertainment series premiere globally. CNN’s Christy Choi and Julia Chatterley contributed to this report. The Emmys went for the gold Sunday night. Jane Lynch and Brendan Hunt — who played coaches on “Glee” and “Ted Lasso,” respectively — presented the best directing for a drama award and had some fun while they were at it, appearing in a locker room set and cracking some jokes. Lynch, who also played Sue Sylvester on “Glee,” teased Hunt that his role as Coach Beard on “Ted Lasso” was just an assistant coach, while she was a head coach. They were joined on stage by several Olympic athletes, including Olympic gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik, who captured hearts this summer as the “Clark Kent” of pommel horse. The FX restaurant dramedy “The Bear” is having a very strong night, as expected. It just picked up another Emmy, this time recognizing Christopher Storer for best directing in a comedy series. Season two of “The Bear” produced some of the most memorable episodes in the series’ history, with the cameo-heavy midseason Christmas episode “Fishes,” earning Storer the win tonight. The episode — a moving portrait of family trauma — generated buzz with its ensemble of guest stars, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, John Mulaney and Jon Bernthal.  Welcome back to the Fonz. The man who played that beloved character, Henry Winkler, reunited with his “Happy Days” costar, Ron Howard, for a little bit of throwback love for the popular series. The pair came together to present an award, but also to remind us all of how much we enjoyed the wholesome show in which Howard started out playing teen Richie Cunningham and introduced the world to his friends and family. “Happy Days” ran over the course of 11 seasons from 1974 to 1984, and won one Primetime Emmy for film editing in 1978. The show enjoyed several other Emmy nominations, including three for Henry Winkler for playing Arthur “The Fonz” Fonzarelli. “Happy Days” firmly put Winkler on the showbiz map, as it did Howard. The Oscar-winning director got his start playing Richie Cunningham on the series. “Happy Days” also led to popular spinoff series including “Joanie Loves Chachi” (1982–83), “Laverne and Shirley” (1976–83), and “Mork and Mindy” (1978–82). The show also helped make the phrase “jump the shark” a thing after Winkler’s character did just that as the series waned in popularity towards the end. The Fonz literally jumped a shark on the show. Richard Gadd took home the Emmy award for outstanding writing for a limited series, anthology or movie. Gadd marked the moment by making a heartfelt speech, reflecting on his personal experience to offer up inspiration for those going through a hard time. A twisty and engrossing tale involving stalking, grooming, abuse and artistic license, “Baby Reindeer” was a sensation when it debuted and has since remained a focus of attention, with some of the real-life players behind it disputing the story’s veracity. Lawsuit context: The series is actually the subject of a lawsuit. Netflix said in June that it would fight a multimillion-dollar claim for damages brought by a Scottish woman who alleges she was defamed by the hit show and its portrayal of a female stalker.  Fiona Harvey is seeking a jury trial and damages totaling $170 million for “mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of business,” according to a complaint filed in the District Court for the Central District of California. The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the “biggest lie in television history” by claiming the story is true. For his part, Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is “very emotionally true” but that he wanted the series to exist as a piece of art and protect the identities of those involved. His repeated requests, however, for viewers to cease trying to find out the real-life identities of the figures in his story went unheard. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix said, “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” CNN’s Dan Heching and Hilary Whiteman contributed reporting. Actors Mindy Kaling, Zach Braff and Mekhi Phifer, who have all played TV doctors, appeared on stage to present the award for outstanding writing for a drama series. Phifer, who played a doctor on the hit NBC medical drama “ER,” said he was “so honored” to play a doctor on the show and that he was inspired by all of the physicians he’s known.  Kaling starred as an OB/GYN on her namesake series “The Mindy Project,” and said she was inspired to play a doctor because of her mother, who was also an OB/GYN.  Braff, however, didn’t have as moving of a statement when it came to sharing the inspiration behind playing his beloved role as a doctor on the long-running sitcom “Scrubs.”  “I was inspired to not live like that anymore,” Braff joked.   Lamorne Morris takes home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a limited series or TV movie for his role on “Fargo.” Morris thanked God, his mother, daughter, cast, the category’s other nominees as well as FX and Hulu while accepting his award. “Oh my god I’m forgetting so many people,” he said, adding that he will thank those he didn’t mention in his speech later, on his podcast. A fan-adored anthology crime series conceived from the Oscar-winning 1996 film of the same name, “Fargo’s” fifth season is in the mix this year with 15 Primetime Emmy nods, having previously won six statuettes in years past. CNN’s Dan Heching contributed reporting. The Emmy for outstanding talk series is awarded to “The Daily Show,” and longtime host John Stewart is up on the stage with the rest of the cast. It was the TV moms’ turn when Susan Kelechi Watson, Connie Britton and Meredith Baxter appeared on stage to present the award for comedy writing.  Britton, who famously played a mom on “Friday Night Lights” and “White Lotus,” said that TV moms “do it all,” whether that be a country music star (on “Nashville”), the head of a “haunted household” or a school principal.  Kelechi Watson, who played mom Beth Pearson on NBC hit show “This is Us,” added that “TV moms are no longer one dimensional… We have choices.”  Kelechi Watson also joked that “it’s ok to ask for as much money as a TV dad.” Baxter — classic TV mom of “Family Ties” fame — also touched on how far TV mom roles have come, saying she’s thankful “we are way past the days where we couldn’t even say the word ‘pregnant’ on ‘I Love Lucy.’” “Hacks” earns the award for outstanding writing for a comedy series at the Emmys, and the cast used their acceptance speech to crack a few jokes. Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky took the award for the episode “Bulletproof.” It’s the second Emmy win for the “Hacks” writers in this category. Downs said the trio of writers chose to write about comedy because they were “three weird lonely kids — it was the thing that made us feel connected to other people.” Statsky and Angelo then playfully corrected Downs, whispering in his ear for him to say they weren’t unpopular. The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. The third season of “Hacks” finds Vance trying to secure a gig as a late-night host, an opportunity she lost earlier in her career over sexism. While presenting the award for writing for a variety special, “Saturday Night Live” vets Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Bowen Yang and Seth Meyers took the opportunity to poke fun at their current and former boss, “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels.  Wiig joked that Michaels has “lost the Emmy” over 80 times. “You do have value. You are worthy and you are not, and have never been a loser, even though you have lost a lot,” Wiig joked, speaking directly to Michaels in the audience.  Rudolph went on to joke that he was “robbed” every single time he lost, while Yang playfully kept pronouncing his last name wrong.  Meyers pointed out that “SNL” has won many Emmys, with the long-running sketch comedy series earning over 300 nods with 90 wins. “I can’t believe that you’re complaining about this Lorne,” Rudolph said. “Not to be rude but, grow up!” Michaels has won 21 Emmys. It’s never been uncommon for presenters and winners to make political statements at award shows, but it’s especially prevalent in years when there are major elections. This year, with the presidential election happening in just a few weeks, it was to be expected. Then, just hours before Sunday night’s Emmy Awards, there was an apparent second assassination attempt against Republican former President Donald Trump. That could make taking jabs at Trump fraught, but a few people have still worked in some form of political statement. Billy Crudup, who won outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his work on “The Morning Show,” shouted out his wife, Naomi Watts. Watts scored a nomination for her performance as Babe Paley in FX’s anthology series “FEUD: Capote vs. The Swans.” Immigration is a major topic in this year’s election, particularly over the past week, when the GOP ticket has made increasingly inflammatory remarks about Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio. “Murphy Brown” star Candice Bergen drew some laughs by referencing Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s now infamous comment about “childless cat ladies,” after reminiscing about making TV history when her character was attacked in the media by Republican Dan Quayle for a plot line about her being a single mother. Near the top of the show, Selena Gomez also made a reference to the “childless cat ladies” phenomenon when onstage with her “Only Murders in the Building” costars Steve Martin and Martin Short. Jessica Gunning wins outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or TV movie at the 76th Emmy Awards for her twisted role in “Baby Reindeer.” “Oh my goodness me. Blinking heckers, thank you so much,” Gunning began her remarks. “I’m so proud to be a part of ‘Baby Reindeer,’” she said. Gunning then gave an emotional nod to creator of and lead actor in the show, Richard Gadd. “Thank you for trusting me to be your Martha. I will never ever forget her or you,” she said. More on the show: “Baby Reindeer” is a dramatized version of real events that happened to Gadd. In the show, Gadd’s character, Donny, meets Martha at the pub where he bartends. After he offers her tea on the house, Martha begins to stalk and harass Donny, sabotaging his life. “Baby Reindeer” has topped most-watched lists worldwide since its debut in April, generating headlines and speculation about the characters and who inspired them. Gadd’s story is real, but he says the version that appears in his thriller miniseries has been altered for artistic and privacy reasons. CNN’s Sydney Bishop and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report. The antics continued with hosts Dan and Eugene Levy, who awkwardly introduced actors and TV villains Kathy Bates, Antony Starr and Giancarlo Esposito from opposite sides of the aisle.  “I don’t know where my dad is,” Dan Levy said, looking around for Eugene Levy, who eventually waved from the ‘wrong’ aisle.  Dan Levy hilariously admonished his father for getting lost in the theater, to which Eugene Levy replied, “I don’t like doing bits in the audience. Never have!” Selena Gomez and her boyfriend Benny Blanco, along with Steve Martin and Paul Rudd, were all in the frame laughing along to the lost Levys bit. The Emmy for outstanding reality or competition series goes to “The Traitors.” The show’s host Alan Cumming thanked Peacock, the cast and crew as well as his home country, Scotland, while accepting the show’s award. The 10-episode reality competition murder mystery show features 20 contestants — 10 of whom have previously appeared on reality programs like “Survivor,” “Below Deck,” “Big Brother” and “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” — competing for $250,000. CNN previously spoke to Cumming about packing for “The Traitors.” Read what some of his travel must-haves are here. CNN’s Jolie Kerr contributed reporting. Jean Smart takes home the award for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for her role in “Hack” at the Emmys. “Thank you so, so much,” Smart began her speech. “It’s very humbling, it really is and I appreciate this because I — I just don’t get enough attention,” she joked.  Tonight’s win is Smart’s third for “Hacks.” She has won six Primetime Emmys in total. More on the show: The Max comedy series follows aging stand-up comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) who joins forces with the young comedy writer Ava Daniels (played by Hannah Einbinder) to save her act at a casino in Las Vegas. In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace earlier this year, Smart said she was a bit apprehensive to play opposite Einbinder, a comedian in real life and the daughter of the “Saturday Night Live” original cast member Laraine Newman. Smart said she had never done standup comedy before taking on the role of the brilliant and biting comedian Vance. CNN’s Tori B. Powell and Marianne Garvey contributed to this report. Elizabeth Debicki takes home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series. While accepting her award, Debicki — who starred as the “People’s Princess” in “The Crown” — thanked the show’s creator Peter Morgan, as well as the cast and crew behind the series. This is Debicki’s first Emmy win. More on the show: Netflix’s jewel, “The Crown,” has traversed 60 years of world history through the lens of the British monarchy. Debicki played Princess Diana in the most recent season as well as the fifth — a performance for which she earned Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. She’s previously appeared in the BBC’s crime series “The Night Manager,” plus two “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” and Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” among others. CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom and Sandy Thin contributed reporting. The Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series goes to Liza Colón-Zayas for her role in “The Bear.” “Thank for lowering the microphone for me, thank you so much,” Colón-Zayas began her speech. She then noted how her husband told her not to write a speech. “How-how could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence” of her fellow nominees including Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett, she asked. “I love you all. I revere you all to the bottom of my heart,” she said. Colón-Zayas also thanked the cast and directors of the show. “Thank you for giving me new life with this show,” she said.  And finally she had a message “to all Latinas who are looking at me, keep believing and vote, vote for your rights, thank you,” While presenting the Emmy for lead actor in a comedy series, famed TV dads Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Damon Wayans and George Lopez took the opportunity to thank their TV wives (and husband). “To be a great TV dad,” Lopez said, you have to have a great TV spouse. Wayans thanked his “My Wife and Kids” co-star Tisha Campbell, Lopez thanked his “George Lopez” show TV wife Constance Marie and Ferguson thanked his “Modern Family” TV husband Eric Stonestreet. “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White wins outstanding lead actor in a comedy series at the 76th Emmy Awards. “This show has changed my life,” White said while accepting the award for his lead role in Hulu and FX’s beloved culinary series. “It has instilled a faith that change is possible,” he continued, adding, “if you are able to reach out, you are really truly never actually alone.” He also thanked the Television Academy as well as his cast mates and his family. White plays Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, the nervy, ultra-talented chef who returns to his hometown of Chicago following the tragic death of his brother. The chance to take over his family’s restaurant comes with a return to the Berzattos’ fraught relationships and past traumas. The show is buoyed by a stellar supporting cast as it explores Carmy’s personal and professional life through the brooding performance of White. CNN’s Matt Meyer contributed reporting. Billy Crudup earned the award for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his role in “The Morning Show” at the Emmys.  “This is an incredible honor, thank you all,” Crudup said. He then gave a shoutout to his wife, actress Naomi Watts, who he noted is an immigrant, and listed her many accolades and successful endeavors.  “This process has been incredible for me and I hope everybody else that’s involved knows how much it means to me,” he said. More on the show: The stakes were raised even higher in the third season of the “The Morning Show” of this taut workplace drama featuring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The show has already taken home three Primetime Emmys in years past, including one in 2020 for supporting actor Billy Crudup. CNN’s Lisa Respers France and Dan Heching contributed to this report. Ebon Moss-Bachrach wins outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series at the 76th Emmy Awards. While accepting his award, Moss-Bachrach said he’s “so grateful” for “The Bear” and spoke about how much of a “privilege” it was to work with his cast members, whom he referred to as his “incredible family.” Moss-Bachrach also thanked his parents, who he joked are “taking such nice care of my cat” as well as his children. Hulu and FX’s beloved culinary series is about the inner workings of a high-pressured chef and his staff in a Chicago restaurant. Nominally considered a comedy at tonight’s awards, “The Bear” can be very funny. But it’s best known for its tension-drenched scenes inside the kitchen and its moving exploration of family dynamics. The show has risen from a favorite of TV nerds to the next “prestige TV” hit, while the restaurant at the center of the series has transformed from a sandwich shop to a high-end eatery. Father-son duo and Emmys hosts Dan and Eugene Levy kicked off Sunday’s ceremony joking about how hosting is a new experience for the pair, who joked they “more like actors acting like hosts.”  Dan Levy acknowledged this is the first time they worked together since starring alongside each other in “Schitt’s Creek,” which ended in 2020. Eugene Levy spoke of his famed roles playing movie and TV dads — including his role in “American Pie” — and joked that his best “dad role” was in “Schitt’s Creek” because it won him his first Emmy. The Canadian-bred actors joked about how they don’t wish to cut any winners off early while they make their acceptance speeches, with Eugene Levy saying, “If you’re going to say anything meaningful or emotional or, god forbid, political, just keep it short…” Schitt’s Creek ran from 2015 to 2020 and starred Catherine O’Hara, Annie Murphy, Emily Hampshire and Noah Reid, among others. The series won nine Emmys during its run, with five of those wins coming in 2020 for the beloved series’ final season. Dan Levy, Eugene Levy, O’Hara and Murphy all swept the acting categories, and the show won best comedy. Lots of the evening’s men are eschewing traditional black-tie in favor of something more flamboyant. “Abbott Elementary” star Chris Perfetti impressed in a theatrical ruffled shirt from Christian Siriano’s Spring 2025 ready-to-wear collection and “Fallout” star Aaron Moten arrived in an all-red Kenzo suit with a Nehru collar. “The Traitors” actor Alan Cumming and fellow Scot Richard Gadd, creator of “Baby Reindeer,” both wore kilts (in black and traditional tartan, respectively), with the former’s plaid cummerbund train emerging from his cream Teddy von Ranson jacket to double up as a scarf.Even those men opting for more conventional tailoring incorporated playful touches, from host Dan Levy’s sculpted Loewe neckline to the silky unbuttoned shirt of Jonathan Bailey’s Giorgio Armani suit.

Adapted by Ron Nyswaner, the central relationship in “Fellow Travelers” features Bomer and Bailey as two officials working in the orbit of red-baiting Sen. Joe McCarthy (Chris Bauer) and his closeted right-hand man Roy Cohn (Will Brill), who are determined to root out gays to advance their political objectives.

The reality competition series, where drag queens battle it out in glamorous challenges for the crown, first aired in 2009 on Logo TV. It has exploded in popularity with more than 15 seasons across three networks, winning 29 Primetime Emmys and spawning a spinoff “All Stars” series, international versions and even a Monopoly game along the way.

He’s also repeatedly urged fans not to seek out the real-life inspirations for the project, which is about a man who is aggressively stalked by a woman he meets in a London bar. But that hasn’t dissuaded super-fans and online sleuths, and now a Scottish woman who says she was defamed by the hit show is seeking a jury trial and damages totaling $170 million for “mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of business,” according to California court filings. The document alleges that the defendants and Gadd told the “biggest lie in television history” by claiming the story is true. For his part, Gadd previously told UK newspaper The Guardian the story is “very emotionally true” but that he wanted the series to exist as a piece of art and to protect the identities of those involved. In a June statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Netflix said, “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” Selena Gomez has arrived on the red carpet. “Only Murders in the Building,” which Gomez acts in and produces, scored 21 primetime Emmy nominations this year, including her first individual acting nomination. The series stars Gomez, Steve Martin and Martin Short as three neighbors in an upscale New York building who are true crime fans.

The one Harris comment Trump and his allies have spent $38 million for voters to see | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T16:00:19.735Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/kamala-harris-bidenomics-trump-advertisements/index.html,"On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” It was a fateful declaration, one that has dogged Harris since she took over as the Democratic standard-bearer and has attempted to seize the mantle of change candidate in the 2024 presidential race. The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. One of the ads, backed by more than $13 million, simply juxtaposes Harris on the campaign trail in 2024, speaking to voter concerns about rising prices, with the clip from 2023, and includes no other narration. “Everyday prices are too high – food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes,” Harris says in the clip featured in the ad. What Immediately follows is the 2023 clip of her saying, “That is called Bidenomics.” Another one of the ads, also backed by more than $13 million, contrasts news coverage of inflation with the same 2023 clip, taking the same spare approach, also with no other narration. A third ad from the Trump campaign, launched last week and already backed by more than $3 million, opens with the clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working,” before a narrator cuts in with “It’s not” and references more critical news coverage of inflation. “Yet Harris still says, ‘Bidenomics working.’ No, it isn’t,” the ad ends. A fourth ad featuring the soundbite went up Friday. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris – on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing in recent weeks as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. The ads are aimed at leveraging the advantage that polls show voters give Trump on economic issues and magnifying persistent concerns about inflation and a potential recession – even as inflation in the actual economy has slowed and job growth has continued. Harris and her allies, meanwhile, have made a concerted effort to blunt those criticisms, also leaning into economic messaging in their campaign advertising. Last week, Harris’ campaign launched a series of ads on her economic pitch, specifically tailored to key swing states. “Lowering the cost of living will be a defining goal of my presidency. I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone. And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gouging on food. More than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. We will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,” Harris says in the ads. In addition, her campaign has spent more than $10 million airing an ad in which Harris says, “You want lower prices and lower taxes. I believe you want to just not get by, but you want to get ahead,” before delivering her pitch for an “opportunity economy.” And another top Harris ad contrasts her approach with Trump’s. “It’s a very different vision than Donald Trump’s. His plans will raise costs and taxes on the vast majority of Americans. We need to be thinking about the future and how we make it better for families like yours,” Harris says in the ad. Democrats – including Biden and Harris – ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record, including during her first sit-down interview as the nominee last month with CNN. “So you maintain Bidenomics is a success?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris during an exchange about her economic plans. “I maintain that when we do the work,” Harris responded before launching into a litany of the administration’s achievements. “I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work.” The backdrop to the back-and-forth over who is best for voters’ pocketbooks is a US economy that has continued to post solid data, even as prices are higher than four years ago and interest rates are elevated. Inflation has slowed significantly from its peak in 2022, and the US economy added 142,000 jobs in August, marking stronger growth than a worrisome lower number in July. Still, the ads from the Trump campaign also reflect the basic conundrum facing all politicians – they spend hours before the public, staking out positions and making statements, all while political operatives and ad-makers watch for a moment to capitalize. Harris, standing in southeast DC in August 2023, could not have known that exactly one year later, she would face the challenge of pitching an entirely different vision to voters."
Manchin signals he could endorse Harris while Romney stays coy | CNN Politics,"Published 8:50 AM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T12:50:19.636Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/joe-manchin-mitt-romney-intv/index.html,"Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat-turned-independent who had toyed with a presidential run and has long been a thorn in the side of the left, has been mum about the candidate he’s backing in November. But that could soon change. In an interview with CNN, the veteran West Virginia senator signaled he may get off the sidelines. And he plans to speak to Vice President Kamala Harris soon. “Oh I could see that, yes,” Manchin told CNN when asked if he’d endorse a candidate before November. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee who voted twice to convict former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trials, reiterated his disdain for Trump – and objected to the former president’s refusal to say at last week’s debate that he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia. Asked twice if he would endorse Harris, Romney pointedly refused to say. “I’m certainly not going to be voting for former President Trump, and I think that’s been very clear,” Romney said when asked the first time whether he’d back Harris. Asked again about supporting Harris, Romney said: “I don’t have anything on that at this stage.” The comments by Manchin and Romney – two retiring senators who have been on the outs with their respective party’s base – underscore how Trump has turned off some more moderate voters but also how Harris herself has yet to close the deal with right-leaning voters skeptical of the former president. A third Trump detractor, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, doesn’t plan to vote for Harris, even as she said of the former president’s debate performance, “I don’t think it was Donald Trump’s best evening.” Manchin, who refused to say in 2012 if he’d vote for Barack Obama for reelection, seems most likely of the three to endorse Harris. The former Democrat downplayed Harris’ more liberal politics and sounded positive about the direction of her campaign. And he rebutted criticism that she was too far to the left for him. “I think she’s moving in the right direction. Things I’m hearing are sounding very good,” Manchin said, adding that he wants to make sure the two have “a very good conversation. We will do that.” “She comes from California. I expect her to be different than where I came from,” Manchin added. “She seems to be looking at the larger picture now, which is very encouraging.” Manchin said he’s been playing phone tag with Harris and is “looking forward to a conversation” about energy, the national debt and keeping in tact the Senate’s filibuster, the potent stall tactic that requires 60 votes to overcome. “I would like to make sure that she understands the need for us to have a filibuster in the Senate, being a former senator, of how it kind of calms things down, makes us work together,” he said. “If they’re willing to discard all of that, they’re willing to throw caution to the wind, we’re in serious problems.” In the interview in the Capitol last week, Romney heavily criticized the former president’s refusal to say that Ukraine should win the war against Russia and his use of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a character witness of sorts. “The president surely had to say, ‘Of course, I want Ukraine to win. I want Ukraine to be successful,’ and then he can talk about how you define success and winning. But we stand with democracies. We stand with nations that are now being invaded by their neighbors, particularly invaded by Russia,” Romney added. “So, it was a huge gap that I think caused a collective gasp from nations around the world.” Romney contended that Orban’s “authoritarian tendencies” are well known, “and that’s not someone who I would say, ‘This is a badge of honor, you know, he’s the guy who likes me.’”"
Live updates: FBI investigating apparent assassination attempt of Trump in Florida | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-15T12:30:37.321Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-15-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump has moved here. Ryan Routh had repeatedly called for bolstering Taiwan’s defenses against China and hoped to set up a foreign legion akin to that in Ukraine.  The man, who was detained in connection with an apparent attempt to assassinate former president Donald Trump on Sunday, is listed as an “International Volunteer Center Coordinator” on a website named Taiwan Foreign Legion.  The group claims it is “recruiting former military and civilians from around the world” willing to defend Taiwan in the event of a war with China.  CNN reached out to over a dozen people listed as “supporters” on the group’s website. But several said they had not heard of the group or its activities, and some had never heard of Routh.   All claimed they did not know how their names and contact information had been shared on the pro-Taiwan website.  Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan does not have an official foreign legion. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry declined to comment on Routh.  China’s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The US is bound by law to supply the self-governing island with weapons to defend itself, and support for Taiwan is a rare issue of broadly bipartisan consensus in Washington.  Ryan Wesley Routh decried Donald Trump as an “idiot,” a “buffoon” and a “fool” in his self-published book on the war in Ukraine and geopolitics. The 58-year-old, who was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Trump, wrote last year about his unsuccessful efforts to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia and also weighed in on multiple global crises. Routh wrote that the former US president’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 was a “tremendous blunder” that drove Tehran closer to Moscow, which it has supplied with drones that have caused devastation across Ukraine. Routh also gave his opinions on the political situation in Afghanistan, and urged Afghan refugees to fight for Ukraine. He also wrote about Taiwan, North Korea and Venezuela, drawing comparisons between the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro and the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Appearing to reference his former support for Trump, Routh wrote that he must take part of the blame for electing him as president, writing: “but I am man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake.” Leaders around the world are condemning the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump and offering their support. Here’s what they’re saying: The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and visited the country in 2022. Routh traveled to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor more than two years ago, according to video and images geolocated by CNN to Kyiv’s Independence Square, as well as interviews with foreign press. Video shows Routh attended a rally at the square in support of Ukrainian troops on May 1, 2022, and visited the same location about six weeks later, where a photo shows him standing beside a Ukraine flag emblazoned with an appeal for international volunteers to support the war effort In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  Routh then used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   This post has been updated with more information on Routh’s time in Ukraine. A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion confirmed with CNN that Ryan Wesley Routh had contacted them several times but said he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Shaguri said “the best way to describe his messages is — delusional ideas.” Routh expressed support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts in 2022, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” He also visited Ukraine in 2022, according to video and photos geolocated by CNN as well as media interviews he gave while there.  Routh then used his Facebook account last year to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea, who met the man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Ukraine on several occasions, told CNN he was surprised by Ryan Routh’s involvement in the incident. Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June of 2022, where Routh was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. At the time, Routh gave Newsweek Romania an interview where he said: When Cernea met Routh again about a year later, he said, Routh was visibly frustrated that more people had not come to Ukraine’s help. “Why aren’t there thousands of people here in Kyiv coming to support and join the foreign legion, why aren’t they here?” Cernea remembers him lamenting. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: This post has been updated with the latest developments. Ryan Wesley Routh, the 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, self-published a book last year detailing his efforts to support Ukraine in the war against Russia. In the 291-page book, Routh described his disillusionment with the war in Ukraine, which he called “unwinnable.” The book also discussed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and the political situation in Taiwan, which has faced growing military threats from China. The book, released on Amazon with no publisher listed, is titled: “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” CNN has not independently verified his accounts in the book. In it, Routh describes how he had traveled to the Poland-Ukraine border in an effort to enlist in the war — but “at 56 with absolutely no military experience I was reluctantly turned away by the staff” at the border office. Instead, he tried to enlist more fighters for the war effort — traveling to Kyiv and setting up a makeshift volunteer center at Independence Square before it was disassembled by police. He then “lost all arguments and calls to city hall,” he writes, and spent several months camped out in protest at various locations around the city. “I had given every ounce of motivation and energy that I could muster for Ukraine and came up empty handed,” he said, describing his unsuccessful attempts to build drones for the Ukrainian army with a team of international engineers.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was shocked after hearing about the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. “Sara and I were shocked by the second assassination attempt against President Trump and were relieved to hear that it too failed. But we should not rely on luck,” he wrote on X. Federal agents investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday expect a federal court in South Florida will require “a mental health assessment” of Ryan Wesley Routh before any possible criminal proceedings, a law enforcement source told CNN.  Based on numerous “unusual rants” believed to be posted by Routh online regarding international geopolitical events, the source said federal investigators expect his mental health will be examined as part of court proceedings to determine whether he is fit for any trial.  No charges have been filed, but mental health assessments are not uncommon in cases involving threats to federal officials by individuals who may be experiencing mental health issues, the source said. CNN is attempting to determine if Routh has attorney representation.  There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speaks to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read the full analysis. Former President Donald Trump on Sunday thanked the US Secret Service and other law enforcement officials after an apparent assassination attempt while he was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. The former president was not harmed in the incident. He had been golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when shots were fired, according to a source familiar with the matter. The presence of law enforcement outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach remains heavy, and the road nearest the apparent assassination attempt was still closed nine hours after the incident, CNN Correspondent Randi Kaye reported from the scene. Heavily trafficked roads around the golf club are also still closed and there has been a regular stream of police vans going in and out of the gates. At Summit Boulevard, just in front of the golf club gate, there are a lot of bushes between where the 5th and 6th hole comes together, Kaye said, where perhaps somebody could have poked their way through until they reached the fence. The person detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. Trump International Golf Club abuts three heavily trafficked roads: Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is also nearby. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Florida remained silent when he was apprehended by law enforcement, according to a local state attorney.  Aronberg did not name the suspect but said he had a “rap sheet.”  The person detained is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources.  Aronberg described the apparent assassination attempt as “another too close for comfort incident.” But he also praised the US Secret Service for quickly spotting the alleged shooter and firing shots at him.  Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who serves on the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July, said people in Congress are “bewildered why we’re in this situation for a second time.” He says the protocols and resources committed to the former president “seem to be wholly inadequate,” especially in outdoor environments. Moskowitz said that, although much remains unknown, the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt on Trump on a golf course should not have been able to obtain a firearm in the state of Florida. He said it should not be ruled out that the man may have brought the weapon into the state. Motorist Daniel Rodriguez told CNN that he and his family were driving back to Orlando on the I-95 interstate from a soccer match when they encountered a “wild scene” as sheriff’s deputies stopped a suspect after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Rodriguez said that they initially thought it was an accident. Rodriguez said they were then stuck in traffic for two hours. Former President Donald Trump’s golf game on Sunday was a last-minute addition to his schedule, two sources familiar with the matter said. Trump had no public events on his schedule for Sunday. Vice President Kamala Harris said she is “disturbed” and condemns “political violence” after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday. “I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said in a statement released by the White House on Sunday night. The FBI’s investigation into an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida has gone global as officials work to flesh out the background of Ryan Wesley Routh, the individual detained, a law enforcement source tells CNN. Authorities are working to obtain search warrants on social media accounts believed to be associated with Routh, the source said. Some of Routh’s suspected online activity also involved using platforms headquartered outside the United States, the source said, which will involve working with international partners to identify everything the FBI possibly can about the detained individual. The FBI is also aware of Routh’s suspected online claims about foreign travel, the source said, which will be part of the bureau’s investigation. While early in the investigation, authorities have not identified any co-conspirators potentially targeting Trump, the source said. Records from North Carolina, dating back a couple decades, show that the man detained in the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday has had previous scrapes with the law.    In 2002, Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm and then drove and barricaded himself in a business, according to a Greensboro News & Record article that year that cited police. Law enforcement confirmed the arrest to CNN on Sunday.   Public records reveal several court cases involving Routh since the 1990s.   State and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. For example, he faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records.  In 1998, the state alleged he committed an offense related to a “worthless check,” though that case was dismissed.   Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits.  Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.”   The son wrote, “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.”  A 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida is a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who went on social media to weigh in on politics and current events, at times criticizing the former president.   Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf, posted comments on an X account linked to him referencing the assassination attempt on Trump in July.    Routh tagged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, in separate posts, encouraging them to visit those injured at the rally.  “You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them,” he wrote in a post directed at Harris.  In an April post on X tagging Biden’s presidential account, he wrote Biden’s campaign should be: “called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA …make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.”   Ronald Rowe, acting director of the US Secret Service, is traveling to Florida in the wake of the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, a law enforcement source familiar with the matter told CNN. The official declined to comment on Rowe’s itinerary.  Rowe has been in the top job at the Secret Service since Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid scrutiny over security lapses related to the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.  Rowe also visited the site of the Butler shooting, and he has testified on Capitol Hill and briefed members of Congress about the investigation into that shooting. Rowe has been asked to brief lawmakers about the Florida incident as well.   Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced his state will conduct “its own investigation regarding the attempted assassination” of former President Donald Trump, his one-time GOP primary opponent, in West Palm Beach. “The people deserve the truth about the would be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,” DeSantis wrote on X. President Joe Biden commended the work of the Secret Service and law enforcement following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, saying he was “relieved” to hear that Trump was unharmed. He also condemned political violence or “any violence” and said that he has directed his team to ensure that the Secret Service has all the resources necessary to protect the former president. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety,” he added. The son of the person detained following the shooting incident on former President Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida on Sunday told CNN that he hopes everything has “just been blown out of proportion” and that it’s not like his father “to do anything crazy, much less violent.” Oran Routh, son of Ryan Routh, said his father is loving, caring and hardworking. CNN reported earlier that officials detained Ryan Routh following the shooting incident on Sunday, according to three law enforcement sources. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday condemned violence against public officials and candidates. In a post on X, Mayorkas also commended the US Secret Service for “its quick action to preempt this apparent assassination attempt and protect the former President.” “DHS and the Secret Service are closely working with federal, state and local law enforcement partners to learn all of the facts surrounding this incident. The safety and security of Presidential candidates and other protectees is the highest priority for the Secret Service, ” Mayorkas said.  Former President Donald Trump was at his Trump International Golf Club, between the fifth and sixth holes, when the Secret Service fired on a suspect spotted some distance ahead of the former president on the course. Here’s where the incident happened: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday he is “very grateful President Trump is safe after another attempted assassination attempt.”  “There is no place for political violence in our country, and those responsible for it must be held to account. I hope and expect (the Secret Service) and the FBI will conduct a thorough, swift, and transparent investigation,” the Kentucky Republican wrote on X. Former President Donald Trump updated his fundraising website with a defiant message after the security incident. “FEAR NOT! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God! But, there are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us.I will not stop fighting for you. I will Never Surrender,” the website says. “I will always love you for supporting me. Through our UNITY we will Make America Great Again.” House Speaker Mike Johnson met with Donald Trump this afternoon following what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt against the former president in South Florida. Donald Trump’s campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles updated staff after shots were fired near the former president Sunday, telling them in an email that “safety is always our top priority.” CNN previously reported that Trump’s campaign office in West Palm Beach, Florida, went into lockdown after the Sunday incident. LaCivita and Wiles also praised the Secret Service. “President Trump and everyone accompanying him are safe thanks to the great work of the United States Secret Service,” they said. Former President Donald Trump said in a second fundraising email Sunday that his “resolve is only stronger” after shots were fired near him at the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida. “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” the email said. “I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!” The FBI “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump, the agency said Sunday, just two months after an attempt on the former president’s life at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president is safe after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. Here’s what happened: US intelligence officials recently briefed Donald Trump’s campaign about new indications that Iran was planning to escalate attacks on the former president and those around him, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. At this point, there is no indication that the intelligence is related to the apparent second assassination attempt against on Trump on Sunday, the sources said. The intelligence briefing given in recent days related to potential physical and cybersecurity attacks, adding to the overall elevated security threat against Trump. CNN previously reported that authorities had obtained intelligence about a plot by Iran to assassinate Trump in the weeks before the attempted assassination of the former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July. There has been no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who was shot and killed that day, was connected to the plot. Separately, the US government has concluded the Iranian government is behind a hack-and-leak operation targeting Trump’s campaign and also attempted to target the Biden-Harris campaign. The congressional task force investigating the first attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is requesting a briefing with the US Secret Service following the Sunday security incident at Trump’s golf club in Florida. The person in custody in connection with the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. What we know so far about the person detained: Not too long ago, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a staccato of shots rang out in the middle of his speech, killing one attendee and severely injuring two others. According to the FBI, either a bullet or a bullet fragment struck Trump, wounding him on the ear. The incident sparked a broader investigation around lapses in Trump’s security apparatus, increasing scrutiny on the Secret Service. Amid a possible second assassination attempt, lawmakers and officials are still in the process of investigating the first attempt on Trump’s life. A flashback to Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania: Video showed some attendees noticed the gunman on the roof at least one minute and 57 seconds before the shooting began, and several rally attendees tried to call attention to the gunman as Trump was speaking on the stage. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was fatally shot at the scene. Secret Service boosts security: Since the incident, the Secret Service has bolstered Trump’s security detail and surrounds the former president with bulletproof glass at campaign rallies. A senior official told CNN additional security measures would also include increasing the number of agents and certain technological changes, though the official declined to provide more details. The fallout: Then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid criticism for security lapses related to the assassination attempt, and the agency is under continued pressure from lawmakers to hold individuals accountable for those failures. Ronald Rowe, now acting director of the Secret Service, had said several times he would wait until the results of internal investigations into the shooting before making personnel decisions over that day’s failures. Multiple Secret Service personnel from the Pittsburgh Field Office and one member of Trump’s security detail involved in the planning for the July 13 rally were reassigned to administrative duties and ordered to work from home. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he has been briefed by acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club near former President Donald Trump. “I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety,” Schumer added. “There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz said he and his wife are “glad” that former President Donald Trump is safe following what the FBI is saying is an apparent assassination attempt against him. The statement, which follows closely to what Vice President Kamala Harris wrote earlier, also condemns violence. Golf courses, and in particular Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while the commander in chief plays, according to people familiar with the matter. A golf course is often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements like trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the president as he plays and secure the areas in the several minutes before he arrives. Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach abuts three heavily trafficked roads: Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is also nearby. As president, Trump could often be spotted from across from Kirk Road when he was playing golf. But members of the media were not permitted to stand on the sidewalks near the golf course when Trump was playing. After he left office, some of those restrictions were lifted. Members of the public were able to have a clear view of Trump from the sidewalks on Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. In a briefing Sunday, the Palm Beach County sheriff acknowledged that with Trump now not a sitting president, the Secret Service was “limited” in its ability to fully surround the golf course. When he was president, Barack Obama’s most frequent golf outing was to the links at Joint Base Andrews, which, by its nature on a military installation, had restricted access — both to the course itself but also its surroundings. President Joe Biden rarely golfs. Former President Donald Trump is back at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida following what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt. The former president and his motorcade left the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach after Secret Service spotted and engaged with a gunman who was positioned on the perimeter of the club. The suspect fled the scene in a car but was later detained by law enforcement. Former President Donald Trump’s South Florida golf course would have been “surrounded” with protection if he were the sitting president, but the US Secret Service was “limited” in the areas it was able to cover ahead of Sunday’s incident, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference. “The golf course is surrounded by shrubbery, so when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they’re pretty much out of sight, all right, and at this level that he is at right now, he’s not the sitting president,” Bradshaw said. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible. So, I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there’ll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter. But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.” Watch here: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he spoke with former President Donald Trump after the security incident in Florida on Sunday “before the news was public.” “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” Vance said in a social media post. “Still much we don’t know, but I’ll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude,” the Ohio senator added. Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. The suspect has not made any statements regarding his involvement in the alleged assassination attempt, said Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Authorities have not named the suspect. Donald Trump’s campaign office in West Palm Beach, Florida, went into lockdown after shots were fired at his golf course Sunday. There were several staffers in the building at the time, a source familiar told CNN. The lockdown has since lifted.  A man taken into custody after gunshots were fired near former President Donald Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, was “relatively calm” when detained, Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said Sunday.  “He was not displaying a lot of emotions. Never asked, ‘What is this about?’” the sheriff said.  Snyder said the unnamed suspect was not armed when law enforcement officials took him out of the car. Snyder said the sheriff’s office would take the vehicle to FBI custody, which will take over the investigation, along with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office and the US Secret Service. Snyder said his agency “flooded” Interstate 95 and closed a large swath of the highway before eventually safely stopping the suspect vehicle.  “I have a clear understanding from investigators that we actually do have the suspect that they’re looking for in Palm Beach County,” Snyder said. An FBI representative asked the public to submit any helpful information regarding the security incident investigation via a tip line, 1-800-CALLFBI, or on the FBI’s website. “What we need right now is for the public to avoid the area around the golf course. We will continue support this investigation with the full resources of the FBI,” said Special Agent Jeffrey Veltri of the Miami field office at Sunday’s news conference. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man. Watch: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. This post has been updated with additional information. The FBI said Sunday it is responding to West Palm Beach, Florida, and “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of former President Donald Trump. A suspect has been detained by local police after shots were fired at Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach.  Florida Republican Rep. Michael Waltz called for the US Secret Service to brief Congress this week after the security incident near former President Donald Trump. “As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing. As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week,” he wrote on X. Waltz is a member of a bipartisan congressional task force made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans established to investigate the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13. Former President Donald Trump was moving between holes five and six at his South Florida golf course when the security incident happened Sunday, a source briefed on the matter told CNN.   The suspect, who the Secret Service engaged with, was a number of holes ahead of the former president, according to two law enforcement sources.   The Secret Service fired at the suspect as a protective measure, that source said. Trump was golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when the incident happened, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Former President Donald Trump is in “good spirits” after the security incident that occurred at his golf course earlier Sunday, according to Trump ally Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. of South Carolina. “Just spoke with President Trump. He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known. He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country,” Graham wrote on social media platform X. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance did not address reporters as he boarded his campaign plane Sunday following a security incident involving former President Donald Trump in South Florida. Vance, Trump’s running mate, was boarding the plane at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to return to Washington, DC. One reporter yelled out to ask whether Vance had talked to Trump or heard anything about the shots fired near the former president while he was playing golf. Former President Donald Trump said in a fundraising email that he is “safe and well” following the security incident at his golf course in South Florida earlier Sunday. A suspect who authorities believe is connected to Sunday’s incident at Trump International Golf Course has been taken into custody, according to a Facebook post from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. The sheriff’s office “has stopped a vehicle and taken a suspect into custody,” the post said. A section of Interstate 95 near State Route 714 in Martin County is shut down, the office said. “We will update this information as it becomes available,” the post continued. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, where Sunday’s incident at Trump International took place. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on the security incident involving former President Donald Trump in Florida Sunday, according to the Department of Justice. DOJ spokesperson Dena Iverson said Garland is monitoring the situation and is receiving regular updates following the security incident at the Trump International Golf Club. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are both “relieved to know” that Donald Trump is safe and have been briefed on the security incident involving the former president while he was golfing earlier Sunday, according to the White House. Biden and Harris, both of whom are in Washington, DC, with no public events today, will be kept updated by their team. “The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing. They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team,” according to a statement from the White House. In her own statement posted on social media Sunday, Harris said, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.”  This post has been updated with additional information. A person has been detained in connection to the incident at Trump International Golf Club on Sunday, according to a law enforcement source. Secret Service fired at the suspect, according to multiple sources. A long gun has been recovered, according to the source. Officials believe an armed individual intended to target former President Donald Trump at his golf club, according to sources briefed on the matter. Officials believe an armed individual intended to target former President Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Club, according to sources briefed on the matter. A car has been stopped in relation to the incident nearby, according to a law enforcement official. The Secret Service said on X that it is working with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to investigate a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump. The Secret Service said the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m. ET. The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office is planning to speak at 3:15 p.m. ET to share more information, spokesperson Teri Barbera told CNN. Former President Donald Trump is safe “following gunshots in his vicinity,” his campaign said Sunday. Trump was playing golf at Trump international Golf Club in West Palm Beach when shots were fired. The course was immediately locked down, according to a source familiar.  As the 2024 campaign enters its final sprint, the candidates are hitting the trail this week, with Vice President Kamala Harris visiting key swing states and former President Donald Trump holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. The city of Springfield, Ohio, is going through “a very difficult time,” the mayor said Sunday, adding that it would be helpful if politicians who amplified false rumors about immigrants eating pets in his city “understood the weight of their words.”  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said city officials, including city commissioners, have received threats for the past three days. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance reiterated the false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of Springfield residents in an interview with Bash earlier Sunday. But he rejected the notion that his rhetoric has led to the bomb threats against city officials, schools, hospitals and universities in Springfield. Rue said he has not heard from Vance directly, “and that’s fine,” but said that he and others propagating the rumors should know that authorities in Springfield are telling the truth. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday criticized GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance for his lack of “partnerships” with local officials, after the Ohio senator continued to spread baseless rumors about migrants eating pets in the state. Moore said Vance emphasizing a handful of constituents and dismissing the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, shows he does not understand the importance local politicians play.  “It just gives a sense about how he views partnership and how he views the intelligence that’s coming from us.” Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday the false claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance, a Republican from Ohio. Rue on Thursday night urged national candidates — a clear reference to Trump and Vance — to “pay attention to what their words are doing to cities like ours.” “We need help, not hate,” Rue said. Kamala Harris’ campaign on Sunday slammed Donald Trump in a statement filled with Taylor Swift song references after the former president expressed hatred for the singer. Trump had posted to his Truth Social platform earlier Sunday, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” The music superstar endorsed Harris after the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday, ending speculation about whether she would share her political views ahead of November’s election. On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris — on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. Democrats — including Biden and Harris — ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record. Read more here Federal Reserve officials won’t say how former President Donald Trump winning a second term could impact the economy, striving to stay apolitical. But transcripts of closed-door Fed meetings from Trump’s first term, now publicly available, give some clues about top economists’ true feelings about the former president’s economic agenda. “So it seems to me that we may be trading a greater likelihood of a sustained expansion over the next year or two for a greater likelihood of a hard landing later,” Dudley added. A hard landing refers to when the Fed is unable to bring inflation down without causing the economy to enter a recession. Dudley, who is now president of Washington and Lee University, did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment. If voted into office in the November presidential election, Trump has promised to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on all foreign imports, up to 60% for some Chinese products, and levies as high as 100% for countries that abandon the dollar as their reserve currency. If enacted, those policies could have wide-reaching effects on the US economy as well as economies across the globe. The Fed declined to comment to CNN. Read more here Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Saturday claimed that he’s under investigation for collecting a whale’s specimen nearly two decades ago. Kennedy likely misspoke about the name of the investigating agency, as the National Marine Fisheries Services is an organization that falls under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CNN has reached out to the agencies for comment. On Saturday, Kennedy claimed he wrote a letter in response, accusing the investigators of killing whales and marine wildlife with “giant offshore wind farms off the East Coast.” A story resurfaced last month that Kennedy once used a chainsaw to cut off the head of a dead whale carcass that washed onshore of his Cape Cod family home and then drove the whale head back to New York. The story was recounted by Kennedy’s daughter Kathleen “Kick” Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country Magazine. An environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, had called for Kennedy to be investigated over the incident, arguing in a letter to NOAA that his actions could have jeopardized scientific research . Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Sunday condemned Republican vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance for refusing to walk back his baseless claims that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.   Shapiro’s comments came after Vance defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets earlier Sunday in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. Officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. Shapiro also told CNN that he anticipates a close race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania but noted that he’s optimistic his state will show up for Harris.  “I think what I’m seeing more and more of is not just the folks who are lining up to vote for her, but those who are enthusiastic about her candidacy in communities that oftentimes are not enthusiastic about Democratic candidates — and encouraging their neighbors to be for them as well,” Shapiro said. “So I’m really hopeful.”  Former President Donald Trump on Sunday continued raising doubts about election integrity and claimed, without evidence, that it was “not possible” for the US Postal Service to properly “run the 2024 Presidential Election.” “The United States Postal Service has admitted that it is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before. With this being the FACT, how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024 Presidential Election? It is not possible for them to do so. HELP!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  While election officials have warned that the US Postal Service may delay mail-in voting, citing systemic issues in the postal service as more Americans prepare to cast their ballots by mail, there is no evidence that its “not possible” for the postal service to handle mail-in ballots. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Sunday flatly denied the false rumor spread by Donald Trump that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio and praised immigrants for their positive influence on the community. “No. Absolutely not,” DeWine said when asked if he’d seen any evidence of the pet-eating rumor, a tale many Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have promoted. “Let me tell you what we do know, though. What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal,” the governor said on ABC’s “This Week.” “They came to Springfield to work.” DeWine acknowledged the city was having some issues adjusting to the influx of mostly Haitian immigrants through a federal immigration program, but he said they were working to deal with the issues. “When you go from a population of 58,000 and add 15,000 people onto that, you’re going to have some challenges and some problems,” the governor said. “And we’re addressing those. We’re working on those every single day.” But the governor said the Haitian immigrants in Springfield are “positive influences” on the community and “any comment about that otherwise, I think is hurtful and is not helpful to the city of Springfield and the people of Springfield.” Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday said he learned his lesson about speaking for Donald Trump after previously stating the former president would veto a national abortion ban.  “I think that I’ve learned my lesson on speaking for the president before he and I have actually talked about an issue. What he has said at the debate, which is quite explicit, is he doesn’t support a national ban. He thinks it’s ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn’t going to come before the president in the first place,” Vance said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” On the debate stage, Trump said that he doesn’t support a national abortion ban, but wouldn’t explicitly say he would veto one, rather that it wouldn’t make it through Congress. “We hadn’t discussed it,” Vance said. “We still haven’t discussed it, by the way, because it’s not realistic.” Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday sought to distance the Trump campaign from far-right agitator Laura Loomer, stating that while he doesn’t agree with her comments about Vice President Kamala Harris, it is not “an issue of national import” or insulting to talk about “dietary preferences.”  Two days before the ABC presidential debate, Loomer said if Harris, whose mother was from India, wins the 2024 election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Pressed on whether he disavows those comments, especially considering his wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants, Vance said, “I just told you I don’t like those comments, and I think that we ought to focus on Kamala Harris’ policy failures.” When Trump landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday before his debate against Vice Kamala Harris, Loomer was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane. He said Friday that he doesn’t control Loomer, whom he described as a “free spirit” and “supporter.” Former President Donald Trump on Sunday said he hates Taylor Swift, days after the pop megastar endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Swift endorsed Harris after the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday, ending speculation about whether she would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift posted on Instagram. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift continued. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Asked about the endorsement on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Former President Donald Trump has conjured up an inflammatory false claim about Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy positions — baselessly saying Friday that Harris is talking about forcing Americans to serve in the military. Trump claimed at a rally in Las Vegas that voting for Harris means voting for war with Russia and voting to bring back the draft, a system in which some men are conscripted into involuntary service in the armed forces. Trump continued: “Would anybody like to be drafted, in the audience? Because that’s what they’re doing. She’s already talking about bringing back the draft. She wants to bring back the draft, and draft your child, and put them in a war that should never have happened.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris is not talking about bringing back the draft and has not put forward any proposals to bring back the draft. Trump’s campaign did not respond Saturday to CNN’s requests for any evidence for his claim. A Harris campaign aide said, “We have no idea what he’s talking about.” The US has not had a draft since 1973, the year it completed its military withdrawal from Vietnam. (Trump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War draft, four because he was a college student and a fifth on account of a doctor’s diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.) Since 1973, the country has used an all-volunteer force. Regardless of the wishes of any president, launching a new draft would require Congress to pass legislation. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Asked to support his claims, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening, though he didn’t provide the evidence.  Bash replied, “You just said that this is a story that you created.” Vance said, “It comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents. I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it. I didn’t create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield thanks to Kamala Harris’ policies. Her policies did that. But yes, we created the actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering caused by Kamala Harris’ policies.” The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor about immigrants eating pets. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. On Tuesday, Vance said it’s possible the false claim might not be true, but he encouraged his followers to continue posting “cat memes.” As CNN reported, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday that the claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance.  US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday swiped at former President Donald Trump over the baseless claims he’s pushed that immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating pets. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. Buttigieg continued, “They go for something that is so outrageous that you actually can’t ignore it. The media can’t ignore what’s going on, because very real pain has been inflicted on and fear, by the way, on people in this community and other communities around the country.” Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat-turned-independent who had toyed with a presidential run and has long been a thorn in the side of the left, has been mum about the candidate he’s backing in November. But that could soon change, as Manchin signaled he may get off the sidelines and plans to speak to Vice President Kamala Harris soon. Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee who voted twice to convict former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trials, reiterated his disdain for Trump – and objected to the former president’s refusal to say at last week’s debate that he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia. Asked twice if he could endorse Harris, Romney pointedly refused to say. The comments by Manchin and Romney – two retiring senators who have been on the outs with their respective party’s base – underscore how Trump has turned off some more moderate voters but also how Harris herself has yet to close the deal with right-leaning voters turned off by the former president. A third Trump detractor, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, doesn’t plan to vote for Harris, even as she said of the former president’s debate performance, “I don’t think it was Donald Trump’s best evening.” Read more here. Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, is taking “extreme precautions” in response to an email that threatened an on-campus shooting targeting Haitians on Sunday, according to university officials. The threat comes as several prominent Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. The threat to Wittenberg University “targeted Haitian members of our community,” a statement released Saturday said. “Wittenberg Police are cooperating with the Springfield Police Division and the FBI to investigate this threat.”   All activities have been canceled on Sunday, and the Springfield Police Division will increase patrols on campus, the university’s statement said, adding that those who are on or near campus should “prepare for additional instructions or a lockdown if we learn more from the ongoing investigation.” Wittenberg University had 1,288 undergraduate students enrolled in the fall 2023 term, according to its website. CNN has reached out to the Wittenberg Police Department for additional information.  Donald Trump wanted to spend this week attacking one of Democratic rival Kamala Harris’ biggest political vulnerabilities. Instead, he spent most of the week falsely claiming that migrants are eating pets in a small town in Ohio and defending his embrace of a far-right agitator whose presence is causing concern among his allies. Trump’s repeated parroting of unfounded social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets stole headlines during a trip West, including stops in Arizona and Nevada, late this week. The promotion of the claims overshadowed a series of speeches aimed at the economy and blaming Harris for border security failures. Trump, in a news conference in California on Friday, promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio — the town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States.

New polling post-debate from ABC News and Ipsos finds Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump among likely voters, with the margin in the race unchanged from ABC News polling conducted in late August.  Overall, 52% of likely voters back Harris, 46% Trump in the poll, the same margin the pollsters found among likely voters in an August 23 through 27 poll. Among adults, the survey suggests little change in the dynamic between the candidates on the campaign’s central issues. Trump continues to be more widely trusted to handle the economy (46% Trump to 39% Harris) and immigration (47% Trump to 37% Harris), while Harris is broadly more trusted on abortion (48% Harris to 34% Trump) and protecting American democracy (45% Harris to 38% Trump). The ABC News poll was conducted online Sept. 11-13 among a random national sample of 3,276 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 points. For results among the 2,196 likely voters, the error margin is plus or minus 2 points. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Nebraska Democratic officials are keeping a close eye on any last-minute efforts to change the election law that awards the state’s electoral votes by congressional district, rather than statewide winner. Nebraska’s unique law presents an opportunity for Democrats to secure one of the state’s votes by winning the district surrounding Omaha — a critical blue dot in a sea of red. The state’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear Friday that he is willing to call a special legislative session on changing the state to a “winner takes all” model before the November election — but said in a statement that he doesn’t yet have “concrete and public indication” that enough lawmakers would back the move. Nebraska Democratic chairwoman Jane Kleeb said Saturday that Pillen’s statement signals Republicans “do not have the votes to change the fair electoral system we have in Nebraska.” When the matter of changing the law came up for a vote in the state legislature earlier this year, it was 17 votes shy of passing. Kleeb said Saturday that those 17 votes remain “very solid.” Bottom line: If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot vote in Nebraska, she can likely reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. That means a potential change to the law — which would be a shocking development so close to the election — could have serious implications for each presidential campaign. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz made a direct pitch to Muslim and Arab American voters in Michigan, addressing those concerned about the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. The Minnesota governor used an interview Friday to reiterate Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and argued Trump’s record of targeting Muslim Americans is “not in your best interest.” Harris is more cognizant of the suffering of Palestinians than Trump, Walz said in the interview with WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, addressing those from the “Abandon Harris” movement. Illustrating the constant balancing act for the Democratic ticket on the Middle East, Walz also emphasized the importance of Israel’s self-defense. “That’s why she’s the person to move us toward a two-state solution, where Israel can be protected, we get our hostages back, and Gaza can be self-determined,” he added. Walz contrasted Harris’ view with Trump’s previous support of a travel ban that targeted people from Muslim-majority countries, and his calls to send some Muslim members of Congress to their countries of origin. “Donald Trump is offering you nothing,” Walz said, to voters skeptical of Harris over the issue. “That is not in your best interest.”"
House GOP split on how to address IVF messaging as some push Speaker Johnson to hold a vote before the election | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T10:00:19.718Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/house-republican-ivf-fight/index.html,"Multiple House Republicans have been working behind the scenes to convince Speaker Mike Johnson to hold a vote on legislation supporting in vitro fertilization before the November elections but told CNN their efforts have so far been brushed off or even denied. The direct pressure campaign from lawmakers across the GOP conference has ramped up in recent weeks as those Republicans running in competitive races want to showcase their support of IVF, which Democrats have called into question after the Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that frozen embryos are human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. The resistance from Johnson to take up legislation on the issue up until this point, according to conversations with some of the lawmakers involved, stems from concerns that Republicans could fail to pass it in their narrowly held Republican majority, and the fear of putting members in a worse spot politically. There is also an acknowledgement that Johnson is trying to balance the needs of his vulnerable members who support the fertility treatments with small-government deficit hawks who resist mandates and conservatives who are against IVF for religious reasons. One GOP lawmaker characterized Johnson as “placating” the situation by being intentionally vague about whether he would commit to bringing up IVF legislation. “You’re dealing with some people who have older views and tougher districts, and you know, they’re not going to move,” the lawmaker said of Johnson and his House GOP leadership team. Another GOP lawmaker said Johnson simply said no when asked for legislation supporting IVF to be brought up, telling CNN, “He’s been more direct with me.” “Multiple members have had conversations with leadership about IVF,” the lawmaker added. “Multiple members have filed bills about IVF. It’s something, particularly if you’re in a purple district or a swing district, that would be really helpful, but they haven’t done anything on it yet. I don’t know why.” While a third GOP lawmaker, who has also made the case to Johnson about the need for House Republicans to take a public stance on IVF, said the hesitancy among his party’s leadership is starting to thaw. “My conference is hesitant to move on bills of this nature, but I think they understand more and more that there is a need to,” the lawmaker said. With the House only scheduled to be in session for a few weeks before the presidential election, Johnson’s top priority has been to keep the government open past the September 30 deadline, which has already hit serious roadblocks. But when asked about his conversations with members and if he supports bringing forward IVF legislation before the election, Johnson told CNN, “I think we’ve been very consistent. Our party is in support of IVF in every way, shape or form. If there’s a legislative opportunity to vote on it, I’m sure we would. I’ll have to see. I’ve been busy on a lot of other things but will check into that.” Six months earlier, Johnson said he did not believe Congress had a role to play, dismissing the need for IVF legislation. Republicans have been on the defensive with their reproductive health care messaging since the overturning of Roe v. Wade more than two years ago, and many have tried to develop a pro-IVF message in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling to win back moderate women. Former President Donald Trump called himself a “leader on IVF, which is fertilization” during the presidential debate this week and has introduced a policy that would pay for treatments. House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik told CNN following the debate, “President Trump has been very clear, I’ve been very clear. We support IVF. We are pro-babies, pro-families.” But Republicans have so far failed to channel their support into a legislative response. Senate Republicans voted down a bill in June that would have guaranteed access to IVF nationwide, arguing that the legislation was unnecessary, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is bringing the bill up for a vote again ahead of the election to keep the pressure on Senate Republicans. And while House Republicans project that there is universal support for IVF within their conference, some were less than enthusiastic about voting on legislation in support of the treatments, particularly in the lead up to the election. “I’m disinterested in this topic,” GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky told CNN. GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas stated that Republicans should keep a narrow focus on government funding, inflation and the US-Mexico border “and then get the friggin’ hell out of here.” And GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, a doctor, told CNN that while the treatments were legal, “I don’t prefer it in my family. In my family, we had a son and then adopted a daughter.” GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa became the latest Republican to introduce a pro-IVF bill last week. Miller-Meeks said the legislation, which would provide a fully refundable tax credit up to $30,000 for IVF expenses, stemmed from ongoing conversations with other Republican women that picked up over the summer. “We have bantered back and forth,” Miller-Meeks told CNN. “We have talked about legislation. And so finally, for me, it was, I’m tired of hearing criticism from the other side of the aisle on something that we support, and the majority of Americans support, and so we’re going to put forth legislation.” A flurry of other bills and resolutions have been introduced, many in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, that range in effectiveness and policy goals. Democratic Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania led a bill to codify an individual’s right to IVF access in January. Wild had been searching for a Republican cosponsor in 2023 to introduce the bill, but did not get any Republican support until after the Alabama ruling, a source familiar with the process told CNN. There are now four Republican cosponsors, out of 202 cosponsors, but none of them signed on to Wild’s attempt in July to bypass Republican leadership and force a floor vote. Most of the Republican-led efforts in the House, including from Republican Reps. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, are largely symbolic non-binding resolutions that express support for IVF. GOP Rep. Zach Nunn of Iowa introduced a bipartisan bill with Wild to protect access to fertility treatments. “I feel very strongly about this,” Nunn, who has talked to House GOP leadership about his bill, told CNN. “This is the right move forward. Look, regardless of party, coverage for IVF or starting a family is something that every American should be able to pursue.” Responding to the other efforts to support IVF in the House, Wild told CNN, “I invite all my colleagues, Democrat or Republican, who claim to support IVF to put their money where their mouth is, cosponsor my bill and sign the discharge petition to force a vote on the floor.” Rank-and-file members across the conference, not just in swing districts, agreed that voting on pro-IVF legislation, particularly before the election, would be beneficial to Republicans. “I think it will help the party immensely, you know, to go on the record,” GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas told CNN. GOP Rep. Cory Mills of Florida echoed: “I think it is an important vote. I think it shows our stance.” But others, even those who support IVF, don’t see the need for Republicans to force any sort of vote on it and argue that forcing a vote before the election would simply be playing politics. “I still don’t even understand why we’re being asked about do Republicans support IVF,” GOP Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida said. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who supports IVF, poured cold water on the idea that Republicans could vote on any type of IVF legislation before the election, particularly given their current government funding predicament: “We can’t even do anything right now.”"
Both parties court Navajo voters in battleground Arizona | CNN Politics,"Published 2:00 PM EDT, Sat September 14, 2024",2024-09-14T18:00:19.754Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/14/politics/navajo-voters-arizona-election/index.html,"Nearing the end of the annual Navajo Nation parade route last Saturday, the Arizona Republican Party’s float — pulled by an 18-wheeler and adorned with Trump-Vance campaign signs — came to a halt. Some parade watchers, who lined Highway 264 with their lawn chairs, began booing. “Get out of here,” one woman shouted. President Joe Biden won Arizona by just 10,000 votes – the first Democrat to do so since 1996 – and the state is once again a key battleground this year with Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascendance on the ticket seen as putting it back in play for Democrats. The Navajo Nation makes up the largest tribe in Arizona, with about 131,000 members, according to the US Census. The presence of both parties at Saturday’s parade underscored the electoral importance of those tribe members, who could help make a difference not just in the race for the White House in Arizona, but in a key US Senate race that will shape the balance of power in Washington next year. For the first time in its history, the Arizona GOP set up a field office in Window Rock, the capital of Navajo Nation, according to state GOP chair Gina Swoboda. And last Sunday, the state party, along with the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee, hosted another field office opening in Flagstaff. “Democrats are very comfortable that they own this vote bloc,” Swoboda told CNN after the parade. “And no one owns anybody, and no one has the right to expect your vote. They have to earn your vote.” Asked about the GOP’s reception at the parade, Swoboda said that it’s “important to not let that dissuade you” and that the Republican Party needs to be present in the community. “If the Nation itself said we don’t want you, that would be different. … I feel that it’s urgent to do the outreach, and we’re not going to stop. As long as we are welcome, we will continue to be here,” she said, adding that “there’s no vote that I’m going to leave on the table.” But the Harris campaign in Arizona says it’s not taking any votes for granted. It opened a field office in northeast Apache Junction, closer to several reservations, plans to spend on media campaigns in both English and in the Navajo language on Tribal radio, and hold early vote events in the Navajo community. The campaign also walked the Navajo Nation parade route last weekend, which ran more than three miles long, with its float featuring a sign that read “skoden vote” — Indigenous slang for “let’s go then.” Highlighting the stakes of the vote here, both Senate candidates – Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and GOP nominee Kari Lake – joined the parade, greeting and shaking hands with attendees as part of their outreach to Indigenous voters. The area congressional district’s candidates – GOP Rep. Eli Crane and his Democratic challenger, former Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, attended too, although the district is not seen as competitive this fall. In one of the most crucial Senate races in the country, Lake and Gallego are vying to replace retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who still caucuses with Democrats. Defending her seat is a priority for Democrats looking to hold onto their narrow Senate majority. This summer, Lake – who lost a 2022 gubernatorial bid – toured the Navajo Nation Museum, met with voters at the fairgrounds and visited the Navajo Code Talker Memorial with Navajo Nation’s former Vice President Myron Lizer, according to her campaign. Gallego, who is attempting to visit all of Arizona’s 22 federally recognized tribes, told CNN that he’s working to get the Native American population out to vote. “Democrats and Republicans don’t actually go and talk to our Tribal leadership, citizens — see what they actually need. They go to maybe one tribal nation and think that that represents everyone, and that’s not the case,” Gallego said on Saturday. A Marine veteran, Gallego said his ties to the Navajo Nation stem from his military veteran friends from the tribe. His campaign website touts his push to improve access to health care and voting for Native Americans and his work highlighting the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Voters at Saturday’s parade said they are ready to vote in the presidential race. Danielle Doctor, a 48-year-old Navajo Nation member and educator who made the five-hour journey from Phoenix for the parade with her family, said she’s backing Harris for president and was encouraged by the difference in the reactions to the two campaigns’ presence at the parade. And she especially pointed to the historic potential of Harris’ candidacy – as she tries to become the first woman president – and how that could resonate. “I believe we have many strong, educated women, especially on the Navajo Nation. We’re a matrilineal society. Women run things here, and I love seeing a woman in office. I want to see that, I want that for my nieces and my students,” Doctor said. Tom Ranger, a 67-year-old Republican and the owner of a movie theater in Window Rock, sees things differently. While claiming his party affiliation puts him in the minority here, he feels the sentiment among the tribe’s voters is changing and that they are turned off by the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the economy. But he and other voters from the Navajo Nation – regardless of political affiliation – with whom CNN spoke last weekend felt that more outreach could be done by both parties. Navajo tribe members said they face challenges with access to water, groceries, electricity, internet and health care. A 2024 report from Democrats on the House Administration Committee found that Native Americans also face several barriers to voting, including having to travel long distances often on dirt or poorly maintained roads for in-person voting, inadequate transportation, slow mail service, and lack of residential addresses on reservations. The US Supreme Court last month ruled that Arizona can enforce part of a law that requires would-be voters to document their citizenship before registering to vote on a state form. The 2022 law had been challenged by the Biden administration, as well as tribal and civil rights groups who felt it would disproportionately impact Native Americans. Diné, or Navajo, activist Allie Young has been organizing to get Native American voters to the polls through trail rides since the 2020 election. This weekend, she will lead “Saddle up for Change” – a six-stop, multiday horseback ride, to honor ancestors who rode miles to vote because they didn’t have vehicles, through the rural parts of Navajo Nation to register voters and update their registration status. Her “Ride to the Polls” campaign in 2020, she wrote for CNN the following year, was inspired by “the insufficient number of ballot drop boxes, early voting and Election Day polling places, and very limited hours of operation across the Navajo Nation.” Democratic voter Loretta Charley, who traveled from the rural Navajo community of Rocky Ridge for last weekend’s parade, stressed the importance of voting, but told CNN that she feels that she has not seen the improvement in infrastructure within her community. “Personally, I’m very hopeful when I cast my vote, but then the promises made when they’re on their campaign, whatever they promised on their platform, it dwindles down. And I understand how the red tape goes, you know,” she said. “Not everybody wants to help the Indigenous.” Her remote part of the Navajo Nation rarely gets visitors, let alone campaigns knocking on her door. “I think we’re neglected because of the distance. I won’t say forgotten, but I will say we’re neglected because of the distance so far out there,” she said. “Who’s going to drive clear out there?”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris warned Saturday that a second term for former President Donald Trump poses a “profound threat” to the vision of the nation. While delivering remarks at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Awards Dinner, Harris claimed Trump and his allies “intend to take our nation backward.”   Harris railed against the former president’s policies, criticizing his inability to outline his plans for health care during Tuesday night’s debate. She touted her plans to build intergenerational wealth, her economic agenda, and her determination to fight for reproductive freedoms, telling the CBC, “When you pass a bill to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.” Harris also emphasized the stakes of the election, telling attendees, “The baton is in our hands.” ##Harris## President Joe Biden on Saturday slammed former President Donald Trump for his divisive rhetoric and conspiracy theories while praising Vice President Kamala Harris and telling Black Americans to “keep the faith.” Speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Awards, where he received a lifetime achievement award, Biden touted his legacy and looked ahead to the election. Biden specifically responded to the false rumor spread by the Trump campaign that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are stealing and eating people’s pets. “He says immigrants, Black and brown immigrants, poison the blood of our country. Right now, his running mate is attacking Haitian Americans in Ohio. It’s wrong,” Biden said. The president touted his accomplishments in lowering health care costs, his efforts to forgive student debt, his climate actions and his appointment of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Biden stressed that “we have work to do” in the limited time before the election. “So, my challenge to you is to keep the faith. Do the work, because we know faith without works is dead,” he said. While introducing Harris, Biden called his vice president “the best decision I’ve made.” Former President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would make up the lost tax revenue from his tax proposals with increased funds from drilling and by imposing tariffs on foreign nations. Trump has proposed eliminating taxes on tips, ending taxes on overtime pay and cutting income taxes on Social Security benefits. When asked in an interview with Las Vegas TV station KNTV how he plans to replace decreased revenue from the federal budget, Trump said, “Drill, baby drill.” Trump defended his tariffs plan when asked whether he believes the levies would cause prices to increase and wipe out any advantage from his tax proposals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz questioned why working-class voters might support former President Donald Trump during a rally in Superior, Wisconsin, on Saturday, while relating to fellow Democrats in exasperation over “friends, neighbors, family” who support Trump’s policy proposals. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, whose brother and distant cousins have expressed support for Trump, laid out conversations he’s had with voters about why they support the Republican nominee. Walz’s comments come as the Harris campaign is aggressively courting independent and Republican-leaning voters in rural areas, including places like northwest Wisconsin, where the governor spoke Saturday. Walz also repeatedly stressed in his remarks the importance of bringing Vice President Kamala Harris’ message to Republican voters. His trip to Superior marks the end of his first solo swing through Michigan and Wisconsin as the Democratic vice presidential candidate. The town sits in a county President Joe Biden won by 9 points in 2020, but borders rural counties where the campaign is hoping to cut into Trump’s margins. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance criticized the federal immigration parole program that allows Haitian immigrants to be in Springfield, Ohio, legally, arguing that “only people who actually enrich” the country should be here. Vance’s response was to a question about the potential backlash immigrants are facing after his recent false claims about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield. Local officials have repeatedly said there are no credible claims about such animal abuse, and following the evacuation of two schools and a bomb threat on the city hall, the city’s mayor urged former President Donald Trump and Vance “to pay attention” to the impact of their rhetoric. Vance on Saturday also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies, which include the immigration parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the US, according to the city of Springfield’s website. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who all condemned far-right agitator Laura Loomer’s racist comments and expressed concern about her ties to former President Donald Trump, issued a joint statement Saturday saying they are glad “Trump has made clear he disavows Laura Loomer’s offensive comments.” But at a Friday news conference, Trump didn’t make it exactly clear he condemns Loomer’s comments. In response to questions about Loomer’s racist and conspiratorial statements, Trump said that he had just heard about them and that Loomer was a person with “strong opinions.” “I do know that she may have said something based on what you’re telling me, but I don’t know what she said, but I’ll go take a look and I’ll put out a statement later on,” Trump said.  When asked by CNN’s Kristen Holmes about his allies expressing concerns, Trump said, “Laura’s been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign. … I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit.” Later on Truth Social, Trump said he disagreed “with the statements” Loomer made but didn’t specify which statements.  Vice President Kamala Harris told donors at a fundraiser in Washington, DC, on Saturday that the contrast with former President Donald Trump was “very clear” on the debate stage this week. In the days following the debate, Harris has repeatedly blasted the former president for his performance. She criticized him Saturday for having “no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people” before hitting him on policy issues including his promise to replace the Affordable Care Act without offering a plan to do so. “So he’s saying that again, that he wants to replace it. And then remember what he said about how he’s going to do it? You guys watched the debate. Concepts of a plan. That’s right. Concepts of a plan. No actual plan,” she said. Harris reminded donors of the stakes of the election, telling them the “clock is ticking” with only 52 days until Election Day and urging them to volunteer and mobilize their friends to vote.  Donald Trump said Saturday that Springfield, Ohio, has “been taken over by illegal migrants,” and that he doesn’t know about the bomb threats the town has been receiving since he and other Republicans spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets there. Some context: The claim went viral a few weeks ago and has been promoted by prominent national-level Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials have repeatedly tried to end the rumor, and the city has said there are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” As CNN reported, Springfield City Hall was forced to close due to a bomb threat on Thursday. Two elementary schools were also evacuated Friday “based on information received from the Springfield Police Division,” the city’s school district said. Trump said Friday that the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” rather than the bomb threats in Springfield.  The city notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the US. Trump’s remarks Saturday were the latest in a string of inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants this week. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance stopped by Sup Dog, a bar in downtown Greenville, North Carolina, ahead of the East Carolina v. Appalachian State football game, which Vance is attending. With music blasting on the outdoor patio, the Ohio senator walked up with a drink in his hand and sat down at a picnic table with three young men. Vance, who was joined by his wife, Usha, made his way to different tables, greeting people, chatting and taking photos.  “Remember to vote November, right,” Vance told a group of people. “Y’all going to the game or are you just here to drink?” One of the men asked, “Any chance you want to get drinks at the bar?” Vance laughed and said he already had one. “If I take shots all of these reporters will cover it negatively, so I can’t do it,” Vance joked. Pigskin politics: Last week, the Democratic National Committee flew planes over college football games in Midwestern battleground states featuring banners linking Vance and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, to the controversial conservative policy platform Project 2025. Trump has previously enjoyed warm welcomes at red state college games. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Nebraska Democratic officials are keeping a close eye on any last-minute efforts to change the election law that awards the state’s electoral votes by congressional district, rather than statewide winner. Nebraska’s unique law presents an opportunity for Democrats to secure one of the state’s votes by winning the district surrounding Omaha — a critical blue dot in a sea of red. The state’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear Friday that he is willing to call a special legislative session on changing the state to a “winner takes all” model before the November election — but said in a statement that he doesn’t yet have “concrete and public indication” that enough lawmakers would back the move.

Kleeb said Saturday that those 17 votes remain “very solid.” Why this is so important: If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot vote in Nebraska, she can likely reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. Prominent GOP backer: Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who has led a rallying cry in favor of changing the election law, is returning to the state Saturday to appear at a GOP tailgate party before a Nebraska football game. Kleeb dismissed Kirk’s involvement in the state as “bullying and bluster.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz made a direct pitch to Muslim and Arab American voters in Michigan, addressing those concerned about the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. The Minnesota governor used an interview Friday to reiterate Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and argued Trump’s record of targeting Muslim Americans is “not in your best interest.” Harris is more cognizant of the suffering of Palestinians than Trump, Walz said in the interview with WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, addressing those from the “Abandon Harris” movement. Illustrating the constant balancing act for the Democratic ticket on the Middle East, Walz also emphasized the importance of Israel’s self-defense. “That’s why she’s the person to move us toward a two-state solution, where Israel can be protected, we get our hostages back, and Gaza can be self-determined,” he added. Walz contrasted Harris’ view with Trump’s previous support of a travel ban that targeted people from Muslim-majority countries, and his calls to send some Muslim members of Congress to their countries of origin. “Donald Trump is offering you nothing,” Walz said, to voters skeptical of Harris over the issue. “That is not in your best interest.” A social media account run by Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has been repeatedly deceptive. The campaign deploys the @KamalaHQ account as a kind of irreverent attack dog, using jocular posts to draw attention to controversial, incorrect or dubious comments by Trump and his allies. But the account, which the Harris campaign calls its “official rapid response page,” has itself made inaccurate comments on multiple occasions. In one example, an August 17 post from @KamalaHQ strongly suggested Trump had gotten confused about what state he was in during an event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The post said, “Trump: Would that be okay, North Carolina? (He is in Pennsylvania).” It included a six-second video clip in which Trump said, while pointing to his left, “Would that be OK, North Carolina? I don’t think so, right.” The Harris campaign was explicit about its intentions in the version of the post it made on the Instagram @KamalaHQ account, saying, “Donald Trump is lost and confused.” But Trump was not lost or confused. The full video of the rally shows that earlier in the speech he had pointed to the same part of the crowd to acknowledge a group of ardent supporters from North Carolina. Later, in the moment shown by @KamalaHQ, he pointed to these supporters again and referred to them as “North Carolina.” On Thursday, the @KamalaHQ account made a new attempt to suggest that Trump was confused about his location, but again left out key context. Read about that post and six more examples in the full fact check. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will make campaign stops in Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign announced Saturday.  The Democratic vice presidential nominee will speak at an event in Macon, Georgia, in the morning before making stops in Atlanta later in the day, the campaign said. In the evening he’ll fly to Asheville, North Carolina, where he’ll speak at a campaign rally.  The trip marks Walz’s first solo visit to Georgia and his second solo trip to North Carolina since becoming Harris’ running mate. Both states are among the key battlegrounds expected to determine the 2024 presidential election. Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick on Saturday condemned former President Donald Trump’s false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and warned that his rhetoric could spark violence against immigrants.  “My first reaction was just pure disgust and disdain,” the Florida congresswoman and House Haiti Caucus co-chair said Saturday on CNN’s “First of All with Victor Blackwell.” “For him to say that they’re actually committing crimes and stealing pets is a big lie.”  Cherfilus-McCormick is the only Haitian American currently serving in Congress and says she’s “absolutely” concerned that immigrants will get hurt if Trump continues with this inflammatory message. “We’re feeling the combativeness, we’re feeling the death threats,” the lawmaker said, adding that she’s “hearing that from people all across the country.” Remember: Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, continue to promote false claims that Haitian immigrants are killing and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. The rumor appears to have started on a local Facebook group for the community, which has seen an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants under the Immigration Parole Program, and has been amplified by right-wing voices as part of their broader anti-immigrant messaging. At a rally Friday, Trump ramped up his rhetoric about immigrants, also doubling down on false claims that Venezuelan gangs were “taking over” Aurora, Colorado.  CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a wave of new efforts targeting Latino voters during Hispanic Heritage Month to mobilize the key demographic in battleground states. Part of its outreach includes a $3 million investment into Spanish-language radio for September, which the campaign said is among the largest investments into Hispanic media ever. The investment consists of engagements with influential radio personalities, sports-themed creative and advertising during local baseball, football, and soccer team coverage.  The campaign also released a new ad on Friday titled, “My Voice,” featuring Victor Martinez, an Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Lehigh Valley host of La Mega Radio who highlighted Harris’ efforts to lower costs for Latino working families. Throughout the month, surrogates will be deployed to events, including Saturday night’s fight between world champion boxer Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga, Mexican Independence Day celebrations, and the Detroit Tigers Hispanic Heritage Tailgate. Additionally, organizers will focus on an aggressive push of bilingual phone banking, in-person organizing events and training to help reach the constituency.  Harris is also set to deliver remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual conference on Wednesday. Republicans haven’t given up on turning Nebraska’s blue dot red. Republican Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement Friday that he’s prepared to call a special session of the Nebraska legislature before the November election to change the state law that awards electoral votes by congressional district, rather than awarding all of them to the statewide winner. But, Pillen said, he would only do so if there was sufficient support from state lawmakers. Pillen’s statement underscores his willingness to change state law — an extraordinary move, given the election is less than two months away — but only if Republicans could persuade 33 senators to change their mind and support the bill. So far, support for a switch to the “winner takes all” format has been a few votes short. Key context: Omaha’s blue dot refers to Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and its single electoral vote, which is considered competitive for Democrats in the otherwise red state, thanks to the current system of awarding electoral votes proportionally. If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot, she can reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that award electoral votes by congressional district, rather than by statewide winner. Barack Obama in 2008 and Joe Biden in 2020 are the Democratic Party’s only two candidates to reap a single electoral vote reward. The effort to change the law now signals concern by Republicans that Trump is struggling to win the district. The Harris campaign is spending millions to win there. Signs with a blue dot have been appearing on yards across Omaha in recent weeks. Here’s a look at what the 2024 presidential campaigns are up to on Saturday: Harris: Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to make remarks this afternoon at a fundraiser in Washington, DC, that will not be open the media. Harris is then expected to attend the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Award Gala dinner in DC on Saturday evening, where she and President Joe Biden will deliver remarks. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is also expected to attend. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will speak this afternoon at a campaign rally in Superior, Wisconsin.   Trump: Former President Donald Trump remains in Nevada for an event today in Las Vegas. His running mate Sen. JD Vance is expected to attend the Appalachian State vs. East Carolina college football game in Greenville, North Carolina, which kicks off at 4 p.m. ET. Former President Donald Trump said at a rally Friday that if he’s reelected, he will deploy federal law enforcement officials to “liberate parts of our country,” as he continued to claim without evidence that Venezuelan gangs were taking over parts of Colorado. Trump’s comments were part of a series of remarks this week ramping up his rhetoric and stoking fears about both undocumented immigrants and migrants who have entered the country legally. Trump said he would launch a special task force to address organized crime and foreign gangs, which he said are “conquering” the country. Some context: Trump was referencing rumors that Venezuelan gangs are “taking over” buildings in Aurora, Colorado, which have been amplified by Republicans as another flashpoint in the debate over immigration. Police in the Colorado community say Venezuelan gangs are present there, but their influence is “isolated” and has been “overstated.” Here’s a closer look at what’s going on in Aurora. More from Trump: The former president also claimed without evidence that armed undocumented immigrants are “taking over our country from within.” Trump also used the rally to further amplify debunked social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets. Former President Donald Trump on Friday promoted a baseless claim circulating on right-wing social media that Kamala Harris wore an earpiece at Tuesday’s ABC presidential debate and again baselessly suggested that the vice president received the debate questions in advance.  The conspiracy theory about the earpiece has been promoted by far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has traveled with Trump in recent days. “Interesting choice of earrings tonight, @KamalaHarris…” Loomer posted Wednesday on social media, including a screenshot of an article about “audio earrings.” As CNN previously reported, several people close to Trump say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories the former president has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the ABC debate was “rigged,” and he has previously baselessly suggested that Harris was provided the questions in advance. The former president said this week that he won’t participate in another debate, while Harris has called for another face-off. Trump suggested Friday, though, that he may change his mind about another debate. President Joe Biden criticized former President Donald Trump’s recent disparagement of Haitian migrants during a Black Excellence brunch hosted at the White House on Friday.  Biden condemned the false claim promoted by Trump at this week’s presidential debate that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating other people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. Other high-level Republicans, including vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, have propagated the lie. Trump’s debunked claims: Trump has pledged “large deportations” from Springfield, which has become a political flashpoint as Republicans spread the false claims about migrants in the Ohio community. Springfield has had an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants, who are in the US legally under the Immigration Parole Program. The unsubstantiated claims about animals being harmed in the community appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. City officials have said there are no credible or specific claims of pets being harmed by immigrants in the community. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday continued to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump as she seized on post-debate momentum in Pennsylvania.  Harris again slammed his debate performance, calling it a “tired playbook,” while claiming he failed to address the needs of Americans. “Well, folks, it’s time to turn the page. Let’s turn the page… And we are not going back, because America is ready for a new way forward,” she said. The vice president stressed the importance of small businesses and she repeatedly hit her opponent on his economic agenda, including attacking Trump for suggesting he only has “concepts of a plan” to end the Affordable Care Act, but not laying out how he would replace it. While touting her economic own plan, Harris also focused part of her message on job opportunities that don’t require 4-year degrees. Harris’ visited Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre on Friday, both in counties that Trump won in 2016 and 2020."
Green Party urges Supreme Court to intervene in Nevada ballot dispute | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:29 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T22:08:04.176Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/green-party-jill-stein-supreme-court-nevada/index.html,"The Nevada Green Party on Friday asked the US Supreme Court to weigh into an election dispute with potentially significant implications in the presidential battleground, asking the high court to pause a state court ruling that would keep candidate Jill Stein off the ballot. Green Party candidates were “ripped from the ballot,” according to the emergency appeal and “Nevadans who would vote for them in this election are robbed of the opportunity to do so.” The Green Party is being represented by Jay Sekulow, one of former President Donald Trump’s personal attorneys. The emergency appeal follows a decision from Nevada’s high court last week that found the Green Party used an incorrect form when collecting signatures to get their candidates’ names on the ballot. The original lawsuit against the Green Party was filed by the state Democratic Party. The wrangling underscores the significance of third-party candidates on the ballot in a state where polling indicates a thin margin between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Nevada’s State Democratic Party sued the state’s Green Party to keep Stein off the ballot, arguing that the Green Party had used the wrong form to collect and submit the signatures needed to get this candidate on the ballot. A lower court in the state sided with the Green Party, but the Nevada Supreme Court ruled this month that Stein should be kept off the ballot, holding that the Green Party “did not substantially comply with the requirements” that needed to be met to get Stein on the ballot. The state Supreme Court said in its ruling that an “unfortunate mistake” had occurred when the Nevada secretary of state’s office provided the Green Party with the incorrect form used in the signature collection process. The application was filed with Justice Elena Kagan, who handles emergency cases arising from some of the nation’s Western states. Kagan requested a response in the case by Tuesday."
"Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones won’t be charged in Trump election subversion case, prosecutor says | CNN Politics","Published 5:29 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T21:29:24.704Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/burt-jones-georgia-2020-election/index.html,"The special prosecutor appointed to investigate Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones’ role as a fake elector after the 2020 election announced he will not move forward with criminal charges against the former state senator. Jones is one of 16 Republican fake Trump electors who signed on to the “unofficial electorate certificate” at Georgia’s state capital in December 2020 in a plan to subvert the Electoral College after that year’s presidential election. Jones had been a target of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in her investigation that led to a sprawling racketeering election subversion case against former President Donald Trump and several of his allies. “My review of the evidence finds this matter does not warrant further consideration,” Pete Skandalakis, executive director of a bipartisan group that oversees all prosecutors in Georgia, said in a written statement on Friday. “The evidence reveals Senator Jones acted in a manner consistent with his position representing the concerns of his constituents and in reliance upon the advice of attorneys when he served as an alternate elector,” Skandalakis wrote. “The evidence also indicates Senator Jones did not act with criminal intent, which is an essential element of committing any crime.” A Georgia judge blocked Willis from investigating Jones in July 2022. Jones was then a Republican state senator, and Willis was reprimanded by the judge for hosting a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate who was running against Jones to be Georgia’s next lieutenant governor. In his four-page written statement on Friday, Skandalakis said that Jones “fully cooperated” with the lengthy investigation over the course of four interviews. The prosecutor said he examined the evidence and Jones’ motives, noting Jones called for a special session in Georgia’s General Assembly after the 2020 election to investigate complaints made by constituents. Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, declined to hold a special session to overturn the results. In his statement, Skandalakis said Jones “understands he is subject to a witness subpoena and may be called to testify at any pending federal or state trial.” “I have always wanted to tell my story in front of a fair and unbiased prosecutor, “Lt. Gov Burt Jones told CNN in a written statement. “I look forward to being able to focus on the work I was elected to do.” Willis’ office told CNN that it can’t comment on the decision."
"Pennsylvania mail-in ballots with flawed dates on envelopes can be thrown out, court rules | CNN Politics","Published 5:19 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T21:19:02.044Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/pennsylvania-mail-in-ballots-flawed-dates/index.html,"Pennsylvania voters could have their mail-in ballots thrown out if they do not write accurate dates on envelopes they use to return them under a state Supreme Court ruling issued Friday that could impact the presidential race. The state’s high court ruled on procedural grounds, saying a lower court that found the mandate unenforceable should not have taken up the case because it did not draw in the election boards in all 67 counties. Counties administer the nuts and bolts of elections in Pennsylvania, but the left-leaning groups that filed the case only sued two of them, Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. Commonwealth Court two weeks ago had halted enforcement of the handwritten dates on exterior envelopes. The Supreme Court’s reversal of that decision raises the prospect that thousands of ballots that arrive in time might get thrown out in a key swing state during what is expected to be a close presidential contest. Far more Democrats than Republicans vote by mail in Pennsylvania. In recent elections, older voters have been disproportionately more likely to have had their mail-in ballots invalidated because of exterior envelope date problems. The justices ruled 4-3, with two Democrats joining both Republicans on the Supreme Court to vacate the Commonwealth Court decision. The dissent by three other Democratic justices said the high court should have taken up the dispute. “A prompt and definitive ruling on the constitutional question presented in this appeal is of paramount public importance inasmuch as it will affect the counting of ballots in the upcoming general election,” wrote Justice David Wecht. He and the two other dissenters would have ruled on the matter based on written briefs. The lawsuit, brought in May, argued that the mandate was not enforceable under a state constitutional provision that says all elections are “free and equal.” Based on recent Pennsylvania elections, more than 10,000 ballots in this year’s general election might be thrown out over bad or missing envelope dates, which could be enough to swing the presidential race. Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes make it the largest prize among the seven swing states. Pennsylvania voters will also decide whether to replace incumbent US Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, with Republican challenger Dave McCormick. Also on the ballot are 228 state legislative contests and elections for state treasurer, auditor general and attorney general. Messages seeking comment were left for lawyers on both sides of the case."
"Pope Francis criticizes Trump and Harris, says voters must choose between ‘lesser of two evils’ | CNN Politics","Updated 4:17 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T17:53:55.179Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/pope-francis-trump-harris-abortion/index.html,"Pope Francis on Friday described the choice US voters must make in the presidential election as one between the “lesser of two evils,” deeming former President Donald Trump’s anti-migrant policies and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights as both being “against life.” “One must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that gentleman? I don’t know,” Francis said during a press conference on the papal plane, referring to Harris and Trump. “Everyone with a conscience should think on this and do it.” Francis has been more vocal about politics than his predecessors and has moved to make the Catholic Church more open. While he has consistently and strongly defended the Catholic Church’s teaching that abortion is the deliberate destruction of a human life, Francis has also insisted it cannot be isolated from other issues concerning human life, including immigration. “To send migrants away, to leave them wherever you want, to leave them … it’s something terrible, there is evil there. To send away a child from the womb of the mother is an assassination, because there is life. We must speak about these things clearly,” he said. Francis has previously weighed in on political issues, signaling more progressive stances by allowing priests to forgive abortions, authorizing blessings for same-sex couples and repeatedly warning about climate change. He has challenged Catholic bishops in the US who have insisted that abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, arguing that the plight of migrants is also about the defense of life. In 2016, Francis described then-presidential candidate Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop migrants from crossing the US-Mexico border as “not Christian.” And when bishops were debating in 2021 whether to deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights, including President Joe Biden, Francis urged them to make their decisions from a “pastoral” viewpoint and not a political one. The pope has said he has never denied communion to anyone. Francis has criticized couples who choose to have pets rather than children, aligning with views expressed by Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, a converted Catholic who has derided women without kids as “childless cat ladies” and described those in the country’s “leadership class” who don’t have children as “more sociopathic.” US Catholics also have a range of views. According to Pew Research, 52% of Catholic registered voters describe themselves as being or leaning Republican, while 44% say they are or lean Democrat. Catholic voters were split in 2020, with 50% voting for Biden and 49% supporting Trump, according to Pew. But a majority of Catholics – 61% – believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

Slower inflation is boosting Americans’ attitudes toward the economy | CNN Business,"Updated 11:48 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T14:28:05.291Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/economy/consumer-sentiment-september-inflation/index.html,"Americans are feeling a greater sense of optimism about the US economy this month, thanks to slower inflation. Voters also see a greater likelihood that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November election. The University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey, released Friday, showed that Americans’ attitudes toward the economy improved notably this month, rising 2% from August, according to a preliminary reading. That broke a monthslong spell of consumer sentiment mostly holding steady, aside from a modest increase last month. Sentiment is now 40% higher than the record low reached in June 2022, when inflation was running red hot, but it still remains below pre-pandemic levels. “Consumer sentiment rose to its highest reading since May 2024, increasing for the second consecutive month and lifting about 2% above August,” Joanne Hsu, director of the university’s Surveys of Consumers, said in a release. “The gain was led by an improvement in buying conditions for durables, driven by more favorable prices as perceived by consumers.” The survey also noted that “a growing share of both Republicans and Democrats now anticipate a Harris win,” a few days after Harris and Trump went toe-to-toe during their first presidential debate, hosted on Tuesday by ABC. US consumers also felt more upbeat about inflation’s future. Expectations for inflation rates in the year head declined for the fourth-straight month in September, according to the report, reaching its lowest reading since December 2020. The US economy clearly looms large this election season, from the country’s housing affordability crisis to the state of inflation — and it was the first topic discussed during this week’s Harris-Trump debate. How the economy evolves between now and early November, when voters head to polls, could continue to shape voters’ perceptions. Inflation is down substantially from the 40-year highs of summer 2022, and after a rough patch earlier this year, it’s perched at an annual rate of 2.5% as of August, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which the Federal Reserve uses for its official 2% inflation target, has similarly shown easing price pressure over the past two years. Price increases across the board have come down markedly compared to two years ago, especially for gasoline — which plays a prominent role in influencing consumers’ perception of prices. “If consumers are focused on the cumulative increase of prices over the last four years, that favors Trump. But as we’re looking at the progress toward getting inflation back down to 2%, the Fed’s target, that’s tilting voters’ perceptions in favor of Harris,” Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN in an interview. Trump and Harris have both laid out proposals for an electorate worn out by years of high inflation and elevated interest rates."
GOP-aligned group airs antisemitic ads in Michigan featuring Doug Emhoff and highlighting Harris’ Jewish ties | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:27 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T14:01:20.704Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/super-pac-michigan-kamala-harris-doug-emhoff/index.html,"A super PAC with Republican ties is running digital ads in Michigan promoting the Jewish faith of Kamala Harris’s husband and touting the vice president’s support for Israel in an apparent play to undercut Harris with the battleground state’s large Arab American population amid ongoing political fallout over the war in Gaza. Future Coalition PAC has spent nearly $60,000 running several YouTube ads targeting Michigan, according to Google’s Ads Transparency Center. Each of the ads emphatically states Harris’ support for Israel, and many pointedly highlight her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. The ads are replete with images of the Israeli flag, and multiple spots refer to Emhoff as Harris’ “top adviser,” playing into antisemitic tropes that American Jews have dual loyalties to the US and Israel. The ads appear aimed at stoking divisions within the Democratic coalition that have been exacerbated in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza. Anger among the Democratic Party’s pro-Palestinian factions over the Biden administration’s continued support for Israel’s military operation in Gaza has led to demonstrations around the country calling for an immediate ceasefire. And the issue is especially relevant in battleground Michigan, where Arab and Muslim Americans, many sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, make up a substantial voting bloc. In 2020, nearly 146,000 Muslim Americans voted in the general election in Michigan, according to an analysis by Emgage, a group working to grow Muslim Americans’ political power. Joe Biden won the state by 150,000 votes four years ago. Polls have shown a close contest this year between Harris and former President Donald Trump. One of the Future Coalition ads homes in on Emhoff, including depicting images of the second gentleman wearing a yarmulke and of him visiting the Auschwitz concentration camp. “Kamala Harris is a strong leader for these difficult times. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top adviser, Doug Emhoff. Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff: making history, standing up for what’s right, supporting Israel.” Another one of the ads opens, “Vice President Harris has chosen a side, the right side. Harris has made herself clear: She stands with Israel and the Jewish people. She has, again and again. She understands the unbreakable bond between the US and Israel.” The ad continues, “So when (Israeli leader Benjamin) Netanyahu came to DC, Harris hosted the prime minister at the White House. And when supporters of a free Palestine stood up for Gaza, Harris put them in their place. And supporters of free Palestine? They hate her. Because Kamala Harris gets it. We can trust she’ll always support Israel.” Other ads from the group contain similar themes. “This November, let’s make history. Together, we will put a real pro-Israel president in the White House. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top advisor, Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Only in America: Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff.” Formed earlier this month, Future Coalition PAC has not yet filed a report detailing its donors or fundraising with the Federal Election Commission. Other filings by the group, however, suggest its GOP links: The group lists as its assistant treasurer Cabell Hobbs, who served as the treasurer for a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential bid. CNN has reached out to the PAC for comment. This story and headline have been updated."

The former president said this week that he won’t participate in another debate, while Harris has called for another face-off. Trump suggested Friday, though, that he may change his mind about another debate. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said Friday that former President Donald Trump should debate Kamala Harris for a second time and consider changing his approach in order to reach swing voters. “Look, anytime you can spend more time in front of the voters when you’re in a close race, it’s a positive,” the Republican governor told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” Sununu, who has been critical of Trump in the past and is retiring at the end of his fourth two-year term next year, added that the former president “knows what he wants to say” but he should adapt his style to debating Harris. “So there’s an opportunity there, but they have to use the opportunity the right way and really re-establish a connection with those voters that they had in 2016,” he said. Take a look at the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country that has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began last October. Harris: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Joe Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.” The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris said that as president, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and “ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.”  Trump: The former president also met with Netanyahu in July, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict. In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.” Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.” Read more about the candidates and where they stand on key issues. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday continued to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump as she seized on post-debate momentum in Pennsylvania.

Harris’ visited Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre on Friday, both in counties that Trump won in 2016 and 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris told a local Pennsylvania station Friday she thinks she can win over voters who may align with former President Donald Trump’s values but are tired of divisiveness. Pressed on how she differs from President Joe Biden, who recently campaigned with Harris in Pennsylvania, Harris responded, “I’m obviously not Joe Biden, and you know, I offer a new generation of leadership,” saying she recognizes in her economic approach “some of the stuff we could take for granted years ago, we can’t take for granted anymore.”  She said people are “exhausted” by Trump’s approach and want a leader who has “common sense and tries to find common ground,” pointing to her recent endorsements by Republicans including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former congresswoman Liz Cheney. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to increase her travel to more rural counties that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 in the coming weeks, as the campaign tries to pick up voters and drive down support for her Republican rival, according to two sources familiar.   The vice president’s stops in Pennsylvania today are the latest reflection of the campaign’s hopes to make inroads with voters who may not be die-hard Democrats but are uninterested in former President Donald Trump.  On Friday, Harris returned to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Trump won by double digits in 2020.  That also includes building out infrastructure and field offices in those counties. The Harris campaign recently opened its 50th campaign office in Pennsylvania.  Late last month, Harris similarly did a swing through south Georgia, a region that typically leans Republican, in another attempt to curtail Trump’s advantage in rural areas. The strategy is also a play to reach Nikki Haley voters, sources say, including in areas like Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Gov. Tim Walz campaigned in Lancaster County last week.  CNN previously reported that many conversations at Harris campaign headquarters focus on the 5-6% of voters who are still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record during her campaign and outlined her policies. Trump’s attacks stem from President Joe Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.

Read more details here about the dispute in Nevada Just hours after Donald Trump claimed Friday he wasn’t aware of Laura Loomer’s controversial past statements, the former president wrote on Truth Social that he disagreed with her.  Trump did not specify in the post which past statements by Loomer he disagrees with. Loomer, a far-right provocateur, has for years pushed baseless conspiracy theories, including a post last year that claimed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US were an “inside job.” She has a long track record of racist and Islamophobic social media posts that have at times resulted in her losing access to her social media accounts.  Just hours before joining Trump on a flight to the Philadelphia debate on Tuesday, Loomer posted a racist comment about Vice President Kamala Harris’ Indian heritage. She also previously pushed a baseless attack accusing Harris of hiding her Black identity, which Trump later echoed in remarks he made at an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to use her remarks in Pennsylvania tonight to speak directly to voters who might gravitate to former President Donald Trump, focusing her message on job opportunities that don’t require four-year degrees, according to a campaign adviser.  On Friday, Harris returned to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Trump won by double digits in 2020.  Earlier Friday, she told reporters she felt good about Pennsylvania, a crucial state for her campaign. With Friday’s visits to Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Harris will have spent all or part of seven of the past eight days in Pennsylvania.   Right-wing media outlets are ignoring Donald Trump’s embrace of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, shielding their audience from the uproar amid condemnation from top Republicans. In recent days, Donald Trump has mingled with Loomer, the radical conspiracy theorist who has a well-documented history of pushing racist, sexist, Islamophobic and homophobic hate. Loomer has been banned from most social media platforms for her vile rhetoric, though her account was restored in 2022 on X after Elon Musk, himself an avid Trump supporter, purchased the platform. Loomer’s presence with Trump at this week’s presidential debate and 9/11 memorial ceremonies has drawn widespread attention from mainstream news outlets, with major publications and television outlets spotlighting her appearance with the former president. The move has also ignited public condemnation and disgust even among those in his own party. But right-wing media outlets have largely ignored her close proximity to Trump and the ensuing controversy. On Fox News, the network has mentioned Loomer’s presence just once since she was first seen deboarding Trump’s private plane on Tuesday at the Philadelphia debate, according to TVEyes database searches. A check of the right-wing network’s website also showed zero mentions of Loomer this week. That was also the case in other right-wing outlets, including the websites of Breitbart, Newsmax, The Daily Wire, One America News, and The Gateway Pundit. Read more here about the right-wing media’s coverage The North Carolina State Board of Elections announced a revised schedule for sending out mail-in ballots after a legal battle with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy delayed the process.   Ballots will begin going out in two separate batches on September 20 and September 24, according to the NCSBE. The original deadline to get ballots out was September 6, as state law requires absentee ballots to begin shipping 60 days before the general election. All 100 county boards must send ballots to military and overseas voters who requested them on September 20, allowing the state to avoid missing the September 21 federal deadline to begin sending these ballots.  Absentee by mail ballots for all other North Carolina voters who have requested them will start going out on September 24, more than two weeks after state law requires.  North Carolina was supposed to kick off voting in the 2024 general election last Friday, but a ruling from the state Court of Appeals on a motion from Kennedy to have his name removed from the ballot put that on hold.  This week, the state Supreme Court ordered that new ballots must be reprinted without Kennedy and his We The People party on them.  Each county is responsible for covering the costs to recode, reprocess and reprint the ballots. The NCSBE said that, through Thursday, “more than 166,000 voters – including more than 13,600 military and overseas voters – have requested ballots in North Carolina.” Due to the federal deadline, preparing and sending military and overseas ballots was made a priority and the board determined the only way to do this was to have two different dates for sending them. Abortion and reproductive rights are a key issue in the 2024 campaign. Here’s a look at where each candidate stands on the topic. Kamala Harris’ stance: Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the Biden administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic. On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. The issue was a key part of the programming at the Democratic National Convention this summer and Harris’ campaign announced the launch of a 50-stop bus tour last month — starting in Trump’s backyard of Palm Beach, Florida — focused on reproductive health care. Donald Trump’s stance: Trump last month said he will not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida just 24 hours after suggesting he might. The rush to clarify his stance followed intense blowback from anti-abortion advocates online, leading to concerns among Republicans that Trump’s continued waffling on abortion might lose him some deeply religious voters in a tightening race. Trump, whose ever-evolving views on reproductive health have traversed every side of the debate, has long expressed concerns about the political fallout from the 2022 Supreme Court decision to end the constitutional right to an abortion. Though he has sought credit for installing the three conservative justices that tipped the court to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump earlier this year said future questions about access should be left to the states. Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that abortion laws should be decided by states. He’s also said that he supports exceptions in cases of rape and incest and when the life of the mother is under threat. Trump said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions. In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for. Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Former President Donald Trump suggested Friday that his mind might change about a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.  On Thursday, Trump shut down the idea of a second debate with Harris, announcing on Truth Social that “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!” Reporters asked Trump what he would need or want in order to participate in another debate. “I wouldn’t need anything. I could do it tomorrow, but I’ve done two debates,” Trump said, referring to his first debate with President Joe Biden in June.   Earlier in his remarks, Trump dismissed a reporter’s question about Republicans who’ve said that he missed the mark in the debate with Harris.  “Most of my Republican allies had said I was great in the debate,” Trump said. Senate GOP Whip John Thune on Friday said Republicans would consider campaign trail proposals made by former President Donald Trump when working to advance tax policy if they regain the Senate majority, and made clear that renewing Trump’s 2017 tax cuts were the top priority. Asked on a press call with Wisconsin Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde how the GOP could advance Trump’s most recent proposal to eliminate taxes on overtime pay, Thune said it would be helpful “obviously, if we can get a majority, and Eric is certainly key to that,” touting the entrepreneur’s experience with managing payroll and workers. Trump said in Arizona on Thursday that he would back legislation to get rid of taxes on overtime if he’s reelected. He previously has said he would also work to eliminate taxes on tips, another policy aimed at appealing to working Americans.  “There have been a lot of proposals that have been made throughout the course of the campaign,” Thune acknowledged, adding that extending the 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025 is an issue the Senate will have to deal with immediately. Vice President Kamala Harris said she’s feeling “very good” about the state of the race in battleground Pennsylvania during a campaign stop here on Friday. Harris vowed to spend significant time in the state ahead of the election, focusing on mobilizing voters. Harris stopped by the store, called Classic Elements, alongside the state’s Democratic Sen. John Fetterman. She spoke to the owners of the shop before addressing a small crowd. The vice president said small businesses are a way to “lift people up,” and credited the owners for creating a safe community gathering place at a time when there are forces “trying to kind of make people feel alone or divide us.” More on the Pennsylvania swing: Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre — where Harris will hold a rally later today — are in two counties that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 and 2020. Harris has spent seven of the last eight days in the Keystone State, punctuating her campaign’s emphasis on the battleground. Former President Donald Trump promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio, a town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets.  According to the city of Springfield’s website, the total immigrant population is estimated at about 12,000 to 15,000 in Clark County, though it does not designate from which countries. The frequently asked questions section on its website notes that Haitian immigrants are there legally under the Immigration Parole Program. Trump claimed “nests of bad people” are being emptied into the United States, calling it “an invasion from within.”  Throughout his campaign, Trump has vowed to have the biggest mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.  “It’s going to get worse at a level like nobody’s ever seen before,” Trump said, speaking more generally about immigration and the border. Former President Donald Trump on Friday escalated his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2021 Kabul airport attack during the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Trump said during a news conference in Los Angeles that the 13 US military service members were killed “as though Kamala shot them with a pistol in her hand, or his hand; they were killed by (President Joe) Biden and Kamala.” Trump made the comments as he spoke about his recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery, in which he participated in a wreath-laying ceremony with family members of those who were killed during the Kabul attack and visited a location where some of the US service members are buried. The former president was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity, and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.” For context: Trump frequently criticizes Harris and Biden for the Afghanistan withdrawal on the campaign trail. It was a central line of attack on Biden when he was running for reelection, and now that Harris is the Democratic nominee, Trump has shifted to seeking to place blame directly on her for the chaotic withdrawal and the attack. Former President Donald Trump said he doesn’t control far-right agitator Laura Loomer, whom he described as a supporter and a “free spirit.” Trump was responding to a question from CNN about his allies expressing concern about his close relationship with the provocateur in recent days. Loomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump and appears often at events where he is speaking, and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack. Pressed about his allies’ concern, Trump said, “Look, I can’t tell Laura what to do.”   In response to questions about her racist and conspiratorial comments, Trump said he’d just heard about it for the first time. Two days before the debate, Loomer said that if Vice President Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins the election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Trump ally and conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene condemned the remark, calling it “appalling and extremely racist.” Former President Donald Trump on Friday said the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” when asked about bomb threats in Springfield, Ohio, and schools being evacuated as Trump and his Republican allies spread a debunked conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants in the area eating pets.  A reporter at a news conference in Los Angeles started asking Trump about the false claims, and the former president said, “No, no. The real threat is what’s happening at our border.” Trump said earlier in the news conference that “maybe” he would hold a campaign event in Springfield.  “We could, and maybe we’ll do that,” Trump said. Trump repeated the debunked conspiracy theory during the presidential debate earlier this week and at his campaign event in Arizona on Thursday. Pope Francis on Friday described the choice US voters must make in the presidential election as one between the “lesser of two evils,” deeming former President Donald Trump’s anti-migrant policies and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights as both being “against life.” The pontiff was asked what his advice to Catholic voters would be when choosing between the candidates.  The head of the Roman Catholic church said that deporting migrants is “evil” and that not giving migrants work and not helping them is “a sin against life.” Meanwhile, Francis described abortion as an “assassination.”  “Whether you like the word or not, it is killing,” he added. President Joe Biden celebrated the contributions of Black Americans and offered criticism of former President Donald Trump’s disparagement of Haitian migrants during a Black Excellence brunch hosted at the White House Friday.  Biden condemned the false claim promoted by Trump at this week’s presidential debate that Haitian migrants are stealing and eating other people’s pets. Other high-level Republicans, including vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, have propagated the lie.  Biden touted his efforts to place racial equity “at the center of everything we do,” and made a joke about Black jobs, a jab at Trump.  “We created over 2 million new Black jobs for Black Americans,” he said to laughter, adding, “By the way, the next Black job to be filled is as president of the United States.” Vice President Kamala Harris, who was originally set to attend the brunch, was not present, with her office citing “scheduling conflicts.” Biden said she “wanted to be here.” Biden offered praise of the leadership of Black Americans at the conclusion of Congressional Black Caucus Week, highlighting the community’s support for his political career as it reaches its close: “The Black community has always had my back and I’ve always had yours.” The crowd chanted, “Thank you, Joe” in response.   “This nation would not exist – this is literal – without the blood, sweat, and tears, without the determinations, dreams, and contributions of Black Americans,” Biden said in front of the White House, a building built by enslaved people.  Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump, and their respective allies are unleashing a flood of new campaign ads heading into the weekend as the candidates fan out to battleground states and they press their message on the airwaves. Harris ads: On Friday, Harris’ campaign went up with a series of TV ads focused on the economy and tailored to the critical battlegrounds, containing the same narration and messaging, but with images of different cities and local landmarks. The ad features Harris making her economic pitch. Her appearance in it reflects a concerted effort by the campaign to put the candidate in front of the camera, often narrating. The ads began airing in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia — and one is even tailored to Nebraska, where Democrats are hoping to secure one of the states’ up-for-grabs electoral votes. The ads come as Harris is set to hold several campaign events in Pennsylvania today. The Harris campaign is also up with its first ad featuring clips from Tuesday’s debate, highlighting the moment that Trump was pressed on his abortion policy. Trump ads: Countering those efforts, the Trump campaign and its allies have also launched a series of new ads heading into the weekend, leaning into an anti-Harris messaging campaign that has been increasingly focused on the economy. On Friday, the Trump campaign launched its latest ad slamming Harris and the Biden administration for inflation. It follows a new ad in Pennsylvania that the Trump campaign launched on Thursday about fracking. The pair of new ads from the Trump campaign, both focused on key economic issues, reflect an evolving messaging approach. While Trump and his allies have consistently criticized all aspects of the Biden-Harris administration record, the emphasis lately has been on the economy as opposed to immigration and crime.  At Kamala Harris’ campaign headquarters, aides are already working toward more appearances like the vice president’s online conversation next week with Oprah Winfrey, instead of any big speeches or more policy rollouts like her economic plans, unless the campaign sees ways to leverage those into grabbing more attention. Yet Harris advisers are running into limits of the calendar: Unless they succeed in goading Trump into accepting a second debate, the only big event left before Election Day is the Tim Walz-JD Vance vice presidential debate on October 1. David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager, is leading the push among Harris advisers for breakthrough moments and innovative appearances. Harris and many around her tend to be dismissive of the value of traditional media, and believe they get more of a boost from putting her in situations like hugging voters during a brief Sunday stop at a spice store in Pittsburgh than she ever would from any interview. Plouffe’s role is in part affected by the simmering tension between different factions —carryover Biden aides, new staff who came with Harris, a clutch of Obama alumni who parachuted in together, and the core group of advisers who tend to spend the most time with the candidate on the road and at the Naval Observatory — although the infighting looks nothing like the dysfunction of Harris’ 2019 bid. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon’s leadership retreat last week, for example, was part therapy for aides coming off their rollercoaster summer. But it was also part information sharing — amid the massive divergence in political conditions, ballot propositions and candidates that Harris aides believe could upend the trend of recent elections where states move in regional blocs. Translating the summer enthusiasm into fall work without the enthusiasm draining won’t be easy, said Dan Kildee, a retiring Democratic congressman from the critical battleground of Michigan. He said he’s heartened that 35,000 new volunteers signed up in his state since Harris became the nominee, but he said that won’t matter unless they’re managed and deployed correctly. Obama is expected to be central in that effort, with aides working to add to his usual slate of late fall battleground campaign rallies — in person or with online influencers, whom he’s been pushing to use their platforms to get followers to vote. Read more about how Harris’ campaign is looking to build momentum. High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. In CNN polling released earlier this month of six swing states, economic issues remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters in their choice for president. Below is a snapshot of what the candidates have proposed so far: Highlights of Kamala Harris’ economic promises Highlights of Donald Trump’s economic promises Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Americans are feeling a greater sense of optimism about the US economy this month, thanks to slower inflation. And voters also see a greater likelihood that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November election, according to the latest consumer survey from the University of Michigan. The survey, released Friday, showed that Americans’ attitudes toward the economy rose 2% from August. Sentiment is now 40% higher than the record low reached in June 2022, when inflation was running red hot, but it still remains below pre-pandemic levels. The survey also noted that “a growing share of both Republicans and Democrats now anticipate a Harris win,” a few days after Tuesday’s presidential debate. US consumers also felt more upbeat about inflation’s future: Expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead reached the lowest reading since December 2020. Rose Goute Creole restaurant does a bustling business in Springfield, Ohio, with clientele drawn to its pots of perfumed rice, fried pork and fish, and golden plantains. Rosena Jean Louis runs the front, offering free coffee and patiently managing a jostling lunch crowd. She and her coworkers are proud of the food they serve, feeding a Haitian expatriate community that has grown quickly in Springfield over the past few years. When asked about a lie that has taken hold in some corners of the internet that their countrymen are stealing and eating people’s pets, she rolls her eyes in exasperation. When CNN visited on Wednesday, the restaurant’s manager, Romane Pierre, recalled his incredulity at the claim that has been promoted by prominent national-level Republicans, including Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials have repeatedly tried to stop the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” The state’s highest Republican official, Gov. Mike DeWine, also dismissed the rumor, noting there was “no evidence of that at all.” And Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday the false claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance, a Republican from Ohio. Read the full story. The great showman just turned his back on tens of millions of viewers. Donald Trump’s refusal to take part in another presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris marks a significant moment in the 2024 campaign — and hints at vulnerability for a political career built on the foundation of his television fame and mastery of stagecraft. The ex-president said he doesn’t need a rematch because he won the debate, despite overwhelming reviews saying he bombed against a vice president who outdid a former reality star. But there’s an alternative possible explanation: that Trump — who usually can’t resist a chance to dominate the small screen — doesn’t relish a repeat of a showdown in which he was unprepared and unfocused and squandered his best chance to take down his opponent in a cliffhanger election. He might be right to mitigate the risk: polls show he’s in a dead heat with Harris in a race where the fundamentals on top voter priorities like the economy and immigration may favor him. Harris said she and her opponent owed it to voters to debate again. Trump’s move opened the way for her team to boast that he is scared to debate her and to boost a performance in which she mocked and rebuked an ill-tempered ex-president with a swagger and a smile. The Republican nominee often changes his mind. But his announcement that there wouldn’t be another debate seemed more adamant than many of his previous statements. Read the full analysis. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris could have a significant impact on key battleground states, new numbers from the nonprofit, nonpartisan voting organization Vote.org shared with CNN suggests.  Since Swift’s post encouraging her supporters to get registered, 52,222 Americans have registered to vote via Vote.org, and 144,243 people have verified their registration status.  That has included thousands of registrations in swing states where both the Harris and Trump campaigns are expecting razor-thin margins.  From 11:00 pm ET on Tuesday to 1:00 pm ET Thursday:  The Democratic Party is also seeking to harness Swift’s political potency, launching Swift-inspired digital billboards featuring images of Harris. One of the billboards is 22-stories atop the iconic red steps in New York’s Times Square. The other is in Las Vegas. This comes as the Harris campaign sold out of Swift-inspired friendship bracelets, and former President Donald Trump’s campaign has also sought to get in on the action, selling Eras Tour-inspired t-shirts with Trump’s likeness. A super PAC with Republican ties is running digital ads in Michigan promoting the Jewish faith of Kamala Harris’ husband and touting Harris’ support for Israel — an apparently cynical play to undercut Harris with the battleground state’s large Arab American population amid ongoing political fallout over the war in Gaza. The super PAC, Future Coalition PAC, has spent nearly $60,000 running several YouTube ads targeting exclusively Michigan, according to Google’s Ads Transparency Center. Each of the ads emphatically states Harris’ support for Israel, and many pointedly highlight her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. The New York Times first reported on the ads. One of the ads from the group hones in on the role of Harris’ husband Emhoff, including images of Emhoff wearing a yamaka, and of the second gentleman visiting the Auschwitz concentration camp. “Kamala Harris is a strong leader for these difficult times. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top adviser, Doug Emhoff. Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff: making history, standing up for what’s right, supporting Israel.” Another one of the ads opens, “Vice President Harris has chosen a side, the right side. Harris has made herself clear: she stands with Israel and the Jewish people. She has, again and again. She understands the unbreakable bond between the US and Israel.” The ads — which are framed positively and accompanied by stirring music — would appear to be in support of Harris’ presidential bid – but the group behind them and their precise targeting in battleground Michigan suggest a more cynical motive. Formed earlier this month, Future Coalition PAC has not yet filed a report detailing its donors or fundraising with the Federal Election Commission. Other filings from the group, however, include GOP links; the group lists as its assistant treasurer Cabell Hobbs, who served as the treasurer for a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential bid. In addition, the ads are exclusively running in Michigan, one of seven top battleground states that are poised to decide the 2024 election, and which is home to a large Arab American population. The ads appear aimed at stoking divisions spilling from the ongoing war in Gaza, and undercutting Harris’ efforts to patch up the fraying Democratic coalition that includes those voters there. If anyone was in doubt about Kamala Harris’s electoral strategy, a glimpse of her calendar gives you a clue. With Friday’s visits to Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Harris will have spent all or part of 7 of the past 8 days in Pennsylvania. Yesterday, when she traveled to North Carolina, was the only day in the past week she hasn’t set foot in the Keystone State. After traveling to Pittsburgh for a five-day debate camp, she went to Philadelphia for the debate itself and returned a day later to Shanksville for a 9/11 commemoration. She’ll return Friday to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Donald Trump won in 2020, hoping to convert voters as she enters a grind-it-out phase of her campaign. It’s all an indication that even as Harris looks to open up multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes, Pennsylvania remains a linchpin of her strategy.  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said that the false claims being promoted by Donald Trump’s campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community.” Asked what he would say to the former president, Rue said: “we need help, not hate.”  Rue also stated that it is “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Trump’s running mate JD Vance, who is a Republican senator in the state. City Hall in Springfield was forced to close on Thursday due to a bomb threat issued to multiple facilities. Rue told CNN that there are currently no leads into who was behind the threat that was sent via email.  Rue also revealed that city officials, including himself, have received hateful phone calls and emails.  At a leadership retreat for top aides last week, Jen O’Malley Dillon – the campaign chair hired by Joe Biden and retained by Kamala Harris – ticked through the battleground states and warned them: the vice president still did not have any one sure path to 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania looks rough, though very possible, by their internal numbers before the debate. North Carolina, disappointing Democrats every election for the last 15 years, is feeling better to them this time than Arizona, which Biden narrowly won four years ago. Nevada and Georgia seem possible, though depending on the poll, can take a lot of squinting. Michigan and Wisconsin are looking like the best of the bunch for Harris, according to the campaign’s internal numbers. That makes for a lot of potential paths to victory based on the current and projected internal data, O’Malley Dillon told them, but multiple top aides on the Harris campaign told CNN they fear that if the election were held next Tuesday instead of eight Tuesdays from now, Trump still would be in a good position to win. Leading Democrats are stressing out that Harris could be in danger of losing the excitement and good vibes they need to overpower what they expect to be high and devoted turnout for Trump. But that is not the feeling in Harris’ campaign headquarters, where many conversations focus on the 5-6% of voters still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump, and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Read the full story. Most likely voters in six key battleground states express at least some confidence in their state’s election process, according to recent CNN polling conducted by SSRS. But far fewer of them have high confidence in the process, with that mistrust driven largely by voters who support former President Donald Trump. Overall, two-thirds or more of likely voters in each of the six states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be cast and counted accurately, ranging from 68% in Arizona to 79% in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is the only state where a majority – 52% – say they’re very confident about the accuracy of their state’s voting process, with 46% in Michigan and only about 4 in 10 in the remaining states expressing similarly high confidence. But the results in each state also show a wide and continuing political gulf on faith in the electoral system, echoing Trump’s repeated efforts to undermine confidence in it. At Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump again refused to acknowledge his election loss in 2020 – a stance that follows social media posts made last week in which he threatened to prosecute election officials if he retakes the presidency and raised baseless attacks on the validity of mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. While 71% of Harris supporters in the six states are, on average, very confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted, an average of just 15% of Trump supporters across these states feel the same way. And sizable shares of Trump voters lack even modest confidence in the system. Read more about this polling. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to travel to Pennsylvania as she seeks to capitalize on post-debate momentum in key battleground states, according to her campaign. Harris will visit Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre — located in two counties that former President Donald Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. The campaign believes the vice president must take her message directly to swing voters in counties where she seeks to grow her support. In Johnstown, Harris is expected to visit a local small business alongside Sen. John Fetterman as she highlights her “opportunity economy” agenda, which includes a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new businesses.  She will then travel to Wilkes-Barre and deliver remarks at a campaign rally. The vice president will be introduced by Mary-Grace Vadalla, a local Republican nurse who lost her mom to COVID-19 and is married to a public school teacher. Additional speakers include Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Bob Casey. Harris’ team has developed a plan for the coming days and weeks to place her in front of battleground state voters, which began Thursday with two stops in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. In both the Keystone and Tar Heel states, early voting is already about to get underway, and a campaign official tells CNN it’s no coincidence that this is where Harris is hitting the trail this week. The campaign will deploy some of its top surrogates today. Gov. Walz will make tour stops in Grand Rapids, Lansing, Michigan and Wausau, Wisconsin. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will stop in The Villages, Florida, and Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz will be in Bangor and Portland, Maine. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today as they make their pitch to voters with less than two months until Election Day. Harris will be making campaign stops in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Trump is will holding a press availability in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and holding a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, tonight; Harris’ running mate Tim Walz will participate in political events in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and in Wausau, Wisconsin. Donald Trump said he would not participate in another presidential debate with Kamala Harris. At a rally in Charlotte, Harris said: “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” Here are other headlines you should know: After the debate: The Taylor Swift effect: New ads launched: Trump campaign proposals: Trump legal woes: Former Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton praised Vice President Kamala Harris in the epilogue for her upcoming book, “Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty,” calling Harris’ historic run “exciting” and “exhilarating.” Clinton said Democrats “will miss Joe Biden’s steady leadership, deep empathy and fighting spirit. He is a wise and decent man who served our country well, yet we have gained much too—a new champion, an invigorated campaign and a renewed sense of purpose.”  In the audio recording of the epilogue, Clinton details her first reactions after she got off the phone with Harris, saying she looked at former President Bill Clinton “with a huge smile and said, this is exciting.” Clinton, who ran against Trump but lost in 2016, said she imagined Harris taking the oath of office as the first woman president, saying “it will prove that our best days are still ahead and that we are making progress on our long journey toward a more perfect union.”  MSNBC first reported on the audio of Clinton’s reaction to Harris becoming the nominee. As Donald Trump posed for pictures with firefighters in New York City to observe the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attack, a small entourage of the former president’s inner circle looked on. The group included the two most powerful individuals in Trump’s orbit, his co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Standing near them was another figure whose sway with the Republican nominee also cannot be discounted: the far-right provocateur Laura Loomer. Last year, Loomer posted a video on social media claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job,” an illogical but pervasive conspiracy theory. Asked why Loomer joined Trump for his Patriot Day travels in New York and then Pennsylvania, a campaign official declined to address her presence directly. Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN, said: The former president has long embraced conspiracy theories and has regularly aligned himself with those who peddle them, especially if they support him.  Read the full story. Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants.” Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. Election Day is less than two months away, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule of campaign events today following their presidential debate. Trump said he would not participate in a third debate, while the vice president’s campaign called for another one following Tuesday night’s event on ABC. Here’s more on the campaign:"
"Trump supporters drive lack of high confidence in election process in six battleground states, CNN polling finds | CNN Politics","Published 7:00 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T11:00:19.922Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/cnn-poll-confidence-election-process-trump/index.html,"Most likely voters in six key battleground states express at least some confidence in their state’s election process, according to recent CNN polling conducted by SSRS. But far fewer of them have high confidence in the process, with that mistrust driven largely by voters who support former President Donald Trump. Overall, two-thirds or more of likely voters in each of the six states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be cast and counted accurately, ranging from 68% in Arizona to 79% in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is the only state where a majority – 52% – say they’re very confident about the accuracy of their state’s voting process, with 46% in Michigan and only about 4 in 10 in the remaining states expressing similarly high confidence. But the results in each state also show a wide and continuing political gulf on faith in the electoral system, echoing Trump’s repeated efforts to undermine confidence in it. At Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump again refused to acknowledge his election loss in 2020 – a stance that follows social media posts made last week in which he threatened to prosecute election officials if he retakes the presidency and raised baseless attacks on the validity of mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. While 71% of Harris supporters in the six states are, on average, very confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted, an average of just 15% of Trump supporters across these states feel the same way. And sizable shares of Trump voters lack even modest confidence in the system. A 61% majority of Trump supporters in Georgia and 58% of Trump supporters in Wisconsin say they’re at least somewhat confident that their states’ votes will be accurately handled, but that falls to 50% in Nevada and lower in Pennsylvania (47%), Arizona (46%) and Michigan (44%). In Georgia, where the Republican-controlled state election board recently approved new rules that critics say form a framework that could be used to contest the election results, the gap between backers of Harris and Trump in confidence is significantly smaller. Harris supporters here in the Peach State are less likely than those in other states to express at least some confidence in the system – 82% do so, compared with 92% or more in each of the other five states. That’s only about 20 points above the level of confidence among Trump’s backers in Georgia, compared with gaps between 40 and 50 points in each of the other five states. The findings are similar to the overall picture two years ago, when between 40% and 48% of likely midterm voters in five of the same states said they were very confident in election accuracy. (The same question was not asked in Georgia that year.) The results echo other recent polling on attitudes toward the country’s election system, including a national ABC News/Ipsos poll released just before Labor Day weekend that found a 92% majority of Harris-supporting adults saying that they were prepared to accept the election outcome, falling to 76% among Trump-supporting adults. In a July CNN poll, 71% of Americans said they doubted Trump would concede if he loses this year, up from the 58% who said the same in October 2020, ahead of that year’s presidential election. The same poll also found that 85% of registered voters and 77% of voters who support Trump said the loser of the presidential election had an obligation to accept the results and concede. Harris supporters’ expressions of confidence in the election process come amid a campaign that many of her backers view as a referendum on democracy itself. In each of the six states, Harris supporters choose “protecting democracy” as the most important issue in this year’s election, with an average of 43% in each state calling it their top voting issue. By contrast, only 9% of Trump supporters, on average, say the same. Interviews for the CNN polls were conducted August 23-29, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 682 voters in Arizona, 617 in Georgia, 708 in Michigan, 626 in Nevada, 789 in Pennsylvania and 976 in Wisconsin. Results for likely voters, which include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election, have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 points in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania; plus or minus 4.9 points in Michigan and Nevada; and plus or minus 4.4 points in Wisconsin.

How Harris aims to keep drawing eyeballs as the hard campaigning begins | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T09:00:19.681Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-momentum/index.html,"At a leadership retreat for top aides in Wilmington last week, Jen O’Malley Dillon – the campaign chair hired by Joe Biden and retained by Kamala Harris – ticked through the battleground states and warned them: the vice president still did not have any one sure path to 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania looks rough, though very possible, by their internal numbers before the debate. North Carolina, disappointing Democrats every election for the last 15 years, is feeling better to them this time around than Arizona, which Biden narrowly won four years ago. Nevada and Georgia both seem possible, though depending on the poll, can take a lot of squinting. Michigan and Wisconsin are looking like the best of the bunch for Harris, according to the campaign’s internal numbers. As pumped as Harris aides are about her debate performance earlier this week, they don’t think it changed any of that. That makes for a lot of potential paths to victory based on the current and projected internal data, O’Malley Dillon told them last week, but multiple top aides on the Harris campaign told CNN they fear that if the election were held next Tuesday instead of eight Tuesdays from now, Trump still would be in a good position to win. After two and a half slower weeks since she closed out her convention in Chicago, a number of leading Democrats are stressing out that Harris could be in danger of losing the excitement and good vibes they need to overpower what they expect to be high and devoted turnout for Trump. But that is not the feeling in Harris campaign headquarters, where many conversations focus on the 5-6% of voters still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Top aides tend to talk these days about “eyeballs” and “moments,” and however many different plays they can come up with. They will keep having Harris at big rallies, but slip smaller events in between, building out the affinity groups and leaning into targeted appeals like playing up the endorsement from former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney. Harris’ appearance with the National Association of Black Journalists next week, for example, scheduled for Philadelphia on National Voter Registration Day, was a very orchestrated choice. “There’s a quiet confidence and security in what we’re doing and the mission, but no one thinks we have this in the bag,” said a Harris campaign aide. “It’s going to be a grind until Election Day, and after.” Harris advisers are spending their days cutting campaign ads from the debate and poring through data that they believe may show she got an important sliver of a bump. An internal summary of the campaign’s “dial groups” measuring immediate reactions, which was described to CNN, says that Harris’ best rated moment was when she spoke about abortion and Trump’s worst rated moment was when he cited a fake story about immigrants eating pets. But a dozen leading Democratic operatives and officials told CNN they worry what will happen if the campaign reverts, as it has done this week after the debate, to the standard rhythm of bus tours and stump speeches and teases of an unconventional interview or two. Some Democratic officials have been wishfully scrolling through Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour schedule – which features three shows each in Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis in the lead up to the election — and have begun reach out to try to get Swift to translate her endorsement into campaign concerts. The dream scenario in the minds of several of the people talking about this: either joint or parallel Swift appearances with Beyoncé. Harris has “become a cultural political icon — politics is too small to hold it. You’ve got to do something that transcends it,” said one top Democratic official trying to make the shows happen. “An unconventional campaign means you have to do unconventional things.” At campaign headquarters, aides are already working toward more appearances like Harris’ online conversation next week with Oprah Winfrey instead of any big speeches or more policy rollouts like her economic plans, unless the campaign sees ways to leverage those into grabbing more attention. Yet Harris advisers are running into limits of the calendar: unless they succeed in goading Trump into accepting a second debate, the only big event left before Election Day is the Tim Walz-JD Vance vice presidential debate on October 1. David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager, is leading the push among Harris advisers for breakthrough moments and innovative appearances. Harris and many around her tend to be dismissive of the value of traditional media, and believe they get more of a boost from putting her in situations like hugging voters during a brief Sunday stop at a spice store in Pittsburgh than she ever would from any interview. Plouffe’s role is in part affected by the simmering tension between different factions —carryover Biden aides, new staff who came with Harris, a clutch of Obama alumni who parachuted in together and the core group of advisers who tend to spend the most time with the candidate on the road and at the Naval Observatory — although the infighting looks nothing like the dysfunction of Harris’ 2019 bid. O’Malley Dillon’s leadership retreat last week, for example, was part therapy for aides coming off their rollercoaster summer. But it was also part information sharing — amid the massive divergence in political conditions, ballot propositions and candidates that Harris aides believe could upend the trend of recent elections where states move in regional blocs. This year, what Plouffe is running up against is Democratic trauma from the last two presidential elections that they’ll miss basics or take advantages for granted. Plouffe himself famously predicted in June 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win over 350 electoral votes, and that was before she was widely seen to have won all three of her debates. And four years ago, Biden’s polling lead this far out from November was clearer than any that Harris has. Translating the summer enthusiasm into fall work without the enthusiasm draining won’t be easy, said Dan Kildee, a retiring Democratic congressman from the critical battleground of Michigan. He said he’s heartened that 35,000 new volunteers signed up in his state since Harris became the nominee, but he said that won’t matter unless they’re managed and deployed correctly. “The heft of the campaign is greater, but the work is phone calls, it’s door knocks. It’s the kind of boring stuff done with enough volume and enough repetition that we increase it,” Kildee said. “Then there’s the special sauce: can we get some of that magic?” Obama is expected to be central in that effort, with aides working to add to his usual slate of late fall battleground campaign rallies – in person or with online influencers, whom he’s been pushing to use their platforms to get followers to vote. The first taste of that will come next Tuesday, for National Voter Registration Day: Obama already recorded videos and other content in Chicago and at home in Washington that his office estimates will be hitting 30 million users across social media, aimed at younger voters. “Our boss always wants to push the envelope, and the teams are aligned there. We’ll definitely be having some fun,” an Obama aide told CNN. The former president will kick off his work at a fundraiser he’s hosting for Harris next week in Los Angeles. Former first lady Michelle Obama, who delivered a rallying cry speech in Chicago, is not expected to campaign, instead sticking with her officially non-partisan voter registration efforts. When it comes to volunteers and on-the-ground organizers, Democrats believe they will have an edge over Trump. They think that’s particularly true after his handpicked new chairs shut down many of the in-state offices the Republican National Committee had opened, outsourcing much of his outreach and turnout operations to outside groups. But much like when many were working on Biden’s campaign — although to a lesser degree — Harris aides and other Democratic operatives say they know they’re still running up against voters who aren’t and won’t ever really tune in or pay attention to any of the traditional ways of getting in touch. “The big thing we know about those voters is that they weren’t responding before and they’re voters that don’t respond to traditional media,” said Ben Wikler, the Democratic chairman in Wisconsin, where a range of in-person and texting voter-to-voter community outreach has been underway since the spring. “But also we need everyone who does pay attention to traditional media—so we have to do both.” Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who moved from being a Biden campaign co-chair to a Harris campaign co-chair, told CNN on Thursday that he’s realistic about the difference between the first 50 days of Harris’ campaign, when she was energizing Democrats whom Biden had sent panicking, and the 53 days left, when she has to try to close the deal. “She’s still trending in the right direction. And every day she’s won. And every day we’ve actually gone up a little bit,” Landrieu said. “At some point in time, you have to stop expecting it to keep going up because there’s not that many fish left in the sea.”"
"Smartmatic’s case against Newsmax over 2020 election lies will proceed to trial this month, judge rules | CNN Business","Updated 12:18 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-12T22:10:10.571Z,https://www.cnn.com/smartmatic-newsmax-trial-2020-election-fox/index.html,"A major defamation case against Newsmax will proceed to trial later this month, a judge ruled Thursday, dealing a blow to the right-wing network and setting the stage for the 2020 election to be relitigated during the final stretch of the 2024 race. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis rejected Newsmax’s attempt to shut down the case, which was brought by the voting technology company Smartmatic, without even holding a trial. Instead, Davis concluded that key questions about Newsmax’s actions in 2020 would be weighed by a jury, barring a pre-trial settlement. “Newsmax reported on allegations regarding the Election and Smartmatic, but there remains a dispute as to whether Newsmax recklessly disregarded the truth,” Davis wrote. “The jury must determine if Newsmax was doing what media organizations typically do — inform the public of newsworthy events—or did Newsmax purposely avoid the truth and defame Smartmatic. The trial is scheduled to begin September 30. However, defamation cases like these are often resolved, even at the last minute, with an out-of-court settlement. The rulings come weeks after a major hearing where Smartmatic argued that Newsmax knowingly peddled the debunked lie that its machines were involved in rigging the 2020 election against Donald Trump. Newsmax argued that its actions in 2020 were protected by the First Amendment because it was covering newsworthy attempts to contest the results. In a partial victory for Newsmax, Davis kept alive one of the key defenses that the network hopes to present to the jury: that it was neutrally reporting on Trump’s election claims but was not endorsing them. “With these facts, a reasonable jury could find Newsmax was reporting on a matter of public concern without endorsing the allegations surrounding the Election,” Davis wrote. “However, a reasonable jury could also find that Newsmax provided its viewers with a report of the newsworthy event but that the report was not a disinterested report of the newsworthy event.” While neither side got everything they were seeking in Thursday’s rulings, the outcome is nonetheless a major blow to Newsmax. If the outlet doesn’t settle, its executives and on-air personalities could be forced to publicly testify about their contacts with Trump during the 2020 election and their controversial post-election coverage. Newsmax denies defaming anyone. The right-wing network published and aired a “clarification” in December 2020 declaring that the network hadn’t uncovered any evidence that Smartmatic or another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, ever “manipulated votes in the 2020 election,” despite what some guests had claimed. “Newsmax’s own people knew they had no proof that Smartmatic was involved in any type of fraud involving the 2020 election, and yet they continued to peddle that false narrative,” Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said in statement. “Newsmax must be held accountable to the fullest extent under law. We look forward to going to trial and presenting our case.” Responding to the ruling, Newsmax said Davis hampered “the free press being allowed to do its job,” but praised his decision to let the network present evidence about Smartmatic’s past ties to Venezuela, which Trump’s allies used to smear the company in 2020. “While Newsmax is disappointed that any part of Smartmatic’s lawsuit is going to trial, as we believe it is a threat to a free press, we are pleased that the Court found no evidence that Newsmax acted with evil intent toward Smartmatic and that the neutral and fair reporting privileges are available to Newsmax at trial,” network spokesman Bill Daddi said in a statement. The judge also went out of his way to make clear that nothing in his ruling is meant to suggest that there was anything questionable or illegitimate about the 2020 election results. Smartmatic machines are not used widely in US elections – they were only in Los Angeles County in 2020. “The factual record is clear that no one ever alleged that votes in Los Angeles were altered or manipulated or otherwise questionable,” Davis wrote. “Accordingly, statements regarding Smartmatic software or voting machines altering the results of the Election are factually false.” In a subsequent decision Friday, Davis rejected an attempt by Newsmax to delay the September 30 trial. Newsmax’s attorneys claimed they deserved more time to gather evidence about Smartmatic’s alleged criminality, after its president was indicted by the Justice Department in August in connection with a bribery scheme in the Philippines."
Judge throws out two charges Trump faces in Georgia election subversion case | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:35 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T20:18:12.379Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-georgia-election-subversion-charges/index.html,"A judge on Thursday threw out three charges in the sweeping Georgia election subversion case, including two charges that former President Donald Trump faces. The decision hasn’t yet been formally applied to Trump because his case has been paused pending appeals. In a separate ruling, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee also upheld the marquee racketeering charge in the case, which Trump is also facing. Trump lawyer Steve Sadow hailed the rulings as a victory. “President Trump and his legal team in Georgia have prevailed once again,” Sadow said in a statement. “The trial court has decided that counts 15 and 27 in the indictment must be quashed/dismissed.” McAfee threw out one count of filing false documents and one count of conspiring to file false documents, both stemming from the Trump campaign’s efforts to put forward a slate of fake GOP electors in Georgia. Trump was only named in the conspiracy count. In the ruling, McAfee also threw out a separate count of filing false documents, which Trump was charged with. That count relates to untrue statements about supposed voter fraud that were included in one of Trump’s lawsuits in December 2020 that attempted to negate the election results. These rulings only narrowly took effect for former Trump lawyer John Eastman and Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still, who were involved in the 2020 fake electors plot. Their cases are not currently paused. Trump was only named in two of the three charges that McAfee threw out Thursday. The awkward ruling from McAfee comes as he has only partial jurisdiction over the 2020 election meddling case. Trump and most of his remaining co-defendants are seeking to have an appeals court disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from overseeing the case. So, their cases are paused with McAfee, who presides in a lower court. But two defendants, Eastman and Still, opted to move ahead with their cases in the lower court rather than join the appeal over whether Willis should be prosecuting the case. Willis, a Democrat, originally secured a 13-count indictment against Trump last summer, related to his multi-pronged attempts to overturn his 2020 defeat in the Peach State. McAfee already threw out three of Trump’s charges in March. Willis’ office declined to comment. McAfee’s chambers did not immediately return a request for additional clarification. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Is America’s housing crisis determining how you vote this November? | CNN Business,"Published 4:16 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T20:16:43.402Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/economy/housing-elections-callout/index.html,"It’s hard to overstate how tough it has become for millions of Americans to purchase a home — a cornerstone of the so-called American Dream. Home prices are sky-high, mortgage rates remain higher than anything seen from 2008 to 2022 and housing supply is not keeping up with demand. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the two leading candidates for US president, both recognize that Americans are dealing with a housing crisis. Building on plans proposed by President Joe Biden, Harris unveiled her solutions for housing last month, which include up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers, a $10,000 tax credit for first-time buyers, tax incentives for builders that build starter homes, and an expansion of a tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. Experts praised some parts of Harris’ plan, but were skeptical of others, CNN previously reported. Trump, meanwhile, has proposed using federal land to help alleviate the housing shortage. The Republican National Committee said that its party will “promote homeownership with tax incentives and support for first-time buyers and cut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs.” With housing costs likely the largest monthly payment for Americans, the issue can weigh heavily on voters’ minds.

Analysis: What the data actually shows about whether undocumented immigrants vote in US elections | CNN Politics,"Published 2:41 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T18:41:31.965Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/undocumented-immigrants-voting-what-matters/index.html,"House Republicans are flirting with the idea of forcing a government shutdown over the issue of noncitizens voting in US elections. Government funding authority runs out on September 30, and House Speaker Mike Johnson — at the all-caps urging of former President Donald Trump in social media posts – wants to pair a temporary spending bill to keep the government running along with a bill that would require proof of citizenship for every American in order to register to vote. The funding bill does not yet have enough support to make it through the House with just Republicans, and Democrats will likely oppose it. Appearing Tuesday on “The Lead,” Johnson didn’t get into specific details when he argued in favor of the citizenship legislation, known as the SAVE Act. “We have a number of states who have done audits of their voter rolls and found thousands of noncitizens on their voter rolls. And it’s in some of the swing states — Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia — states that could determine the outcome of the election,” Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Johnson also later referenced Texas as a state where undocumented immigrants have tried to register to vote. “There are a number of states who have shown they have noncitizens on their voter rolls. That is enough to create chaos in the election. And we have to stop it,” he said. Critics argue it’s already illegal for noncitizens to vote and the risk of prosecution and deportation is an effective deterrent for people who have already sacrificed to come to the US. It’s already a best practice for states to check voter registrations against their Department of Motor Vehicles or Social Security files, and reviews of voter rolls have shown very few noncitizens try to vote. Reviewing voter rolls is a regular thing for states, and in a country of more than 330 million people, there will be a few glitches. “If someone moves out of the state, it’s proper that that voter registration be flagged and ultimately removed because they’re no longer an eligible voter in that state. That’s a normal process that happens in every single state, blue and red,” David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, told me in an interview for the What Matters newsletter before Johnson made his comments. CNN has also fact-checked claims of widespread voting by undocumented immigrants. With that in mind, here’s a look at the evidence in the specific states Johnson mentions about the infinitesimal number of undocumented people registering to vote or actually voting in US elections. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced last month that an ongoing, yearslong review of voter rolls in Texas, which has nearly 18 million voters, had identified more than 6,500 “potential” noncitizens on the voter rolls. Of those, less than 2,000 have a voter history. He referred the latter to the state attorney general’s office “for investigation and potential legal action,” but no one has been accused of voting illegally. In 2019, a review of voter rolls in the state seemed to suggest 95,000 noncitizens were on the rolls. But a closer look told a different story, according to a Texas Tribune report at the time. Texas used an old list of people who at one time had told the state they were noncitizens, but it turned out that many of those people had become citizens. Texas agreed to a court settlement to end the review. More recently, there have been claims that the number of people registering to vote in several states has increased. Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson, a Republican, issued a statement in April refuting that claim and pointing out that Texans must provide either a driver’s license number or Social Security number to register to vote. “We know that this system that we have in place is effective,” Becker told me. “States have routinely done checks for noncitizens in just the last couple of years. They found literally zero noncitizens to cast a vote. Even Texas had found only 0.03% possible noncitizens. And based on previous activity in the last few years, it’s likely that every single one of those had been recently naturalized.” In a state with about 8 million registered voters, a recent review of Ohio’s voter rolls resulted in the removal of 154,995 abandoned or inactive voter registrations. A far smaller number, 597, have been referred by Secretary of State Frank LaRose to the state’s attorney general for “further review and potential prosecution” for possibly registering to vote as a noncitizen. However, an even smaller number, 138, “appear to have cast a ballot in an Ohio election,” he said in a statement. LaRose, a Republican, wants more power to require proof of citizenship for voter registration. No one appears to have been charged with any crime. “It’s rare. But we keep it rare by enforcing the law,” LaRose said of noncitizens casting ballots during a hearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where he pushed for the legislation to require proof of citizenship to register. Giving the opposing argument at the same hearing, Arizona’s secretary of state, Democrat Adrian Fontes, argued that a 2004 ballot initiative that created a requirement for proof of citizenship to register to vote in his state had disenfranchised 47,000 people. “I take no pride in the idea that we have denied eligible citizens the right to vote in far greater numbers than we would have prevented the vanishingly rare noncitizen voting that is alleged to be happening across the United States of America,” Fontes said. Even though the instances of undocumented voter registration or voting are so rare and the few known instances are referred for prosecution, LaRose said during the hearing there should be “zero tolerance,” because, “every year, dozens of elections in Ohio come down to a single vote. And those are usually local elections, but those matter.” In 2022, Georgia, which has more than 7 million registered voters, announced the results of the first-ever citizenship review of its voter rolls. It found a grand total of 1,634 people “who had attempted to register to vote were not able to be verified,” according to a statement that year from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican. They were placed into “pending citizenship” status. None of the questionable registrations were associated with a vote in an election, although Raffensperger supports an additional citizenship verification requirement to register to vote. In a state with more than 8.6 million registered voters, an admitted glitch in Pennsylvania’s voter registration process enabled noncitizens legally in the US to unwittingly register to vote for a time. Between 2006 and 2017, when the glitch was discovered, at least 168 unauthorized people are thought to have been registered to vote in Philadelphia, a city of more than 1.5 million people. Those figures on the glitch come from a Republican member of the city’s election commission. Johnson didn’t mention Kanas, but it’s worth noting that in that state, where there are nearly 2 million registered voters, a federal court threw out a 2020 law that intended to require proof of citizenship to vote —– because the state planned to force more than 30,000 people to re-register to vote, when it was only 67 noncitizens, at most, who registered or attempted to register to vote in 19 years, according to an Associated Press report at the time. Of the 39 noncitizens actually found on the Kansas voter rolls, the ruling said the district court found that many could be explained by “administrative anomalies.” Finally, in terms of cases that have actually been prosecuted, the conservative Heritage Foundation — which argues there are too many vulnerabilities in the US election system — has documented a total of 25 instances of prosecution for voter fraud in which citizenship was an issue over more than 20 years."
"In purple North Carolina, Democrats hope to defeat a MAGA candidate for governor even as the presidential race remains close | CNN Politics","Updated 1:16 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T11:00:20.036Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/north-carolina-governor-election-robinson-stein/index.html,"Four years ago, North Carolina voters handed Democrats one of the party’s toughest losses and one of its most consequential wins. Despite years of Democrats hoping that changing demographics in the fast-growing state would tip the presidential race, Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden here by 1 point, his narrowest winning margin in the country. But further down the ballot, voters reelected Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who has spent much of the next four years serving as a check on the Republican-controlled legislature and advancing priorities such as Medicaid expansion. With 54 days until the November election, voters in the Tar Heel State seem equally split this year. At the presidential level, Trump and Kamala Harris have increased their campaigning in the state, where both have made multiple visits and ramped up ad spending. On Thursday, Harris will return, rallying supporters in Charlotte and Greensboro. The race to succeed the term-limited Cooper, however, seems to be leaning toward the Democratic nominee, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. Stein and his Democratic allies have covered the airways with millions of dollars worth of devastating TV ads highlighting Republican opponent Mark Robinson’s past remarks on abortion and a troubled day care center he and his wife ran in the early 2000s – spending the GOP hasn’t yet matched. Prominent state Republicans, including Sen. Thom Tillis and former Gov. Pat McCrory, have declined to endorse Robinson, the incumbent lieutenant governor. Democrats have a new presidential nominee who has energized the base, and recent polls have shown Stein edging toward a double-digit lead. But North Carolina is still a purple state with a history of elections decided by razor-thin margins. Democrats are hoping that Stein’s record as attorney general and his centrist, economy-focused campaign will win over voters, regardless of what happens at the presidential level. Republicans argue that Robinson’s focus on parental rights in schools will boost him and that conservatives will choose even a controversial Republican over a Democrat come November. Both parties acknowledge that early polling leads don’t preclude close races as past cycles have shown. “We obviously feel good about what we’re seeing in the polling, but this is North Carolina,” said a source familiar with the Stein campaign’s thinking. “This is going to be a tight race.” Jonathan Felts, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Council of State committee, said Democrats had failed to finish off Robinson before Labor Day and predicted that Republicans’ core support would stabilize in October. “We are a cantankerous lot who find fault with everything,” Felts said of his party. “And then, when it’s time to actually make a binary decision – Democrat vs. Republican – our base comes home.” Historically, North Carolina voters have favored ticket-splitting. In the 12 presidential elections of the past half century, the state has backed the Democratic nominee just twice – Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008. But the state has only elected three Republican governors in the past 100 years – the most recent being McCrory in 2012. McCrory’s 10,000-vote loss in 2016 has been attributed in part to legislation he signed that forced transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender matching their birth certificate in state government buildings. The law, HB2, led to massive boycotts from companies and missed revenue opportunities, before being repealed in 2017. That same year, however, Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 4 points. “There’s no connection between the gubernatorial ticket and presidential ticket,” said North Carolina Republican strategist Paul Shumaker. “There’s still a good 25% of voters who don’t even know who the gubernatorial candidates are right now. The presidential candidates are much more better defined.” A Quinnipiac poll of likely voters released this week had Stein leading Robinson 51% to 41% overall, with the attorney general holding a 38- point advantage among women. A Fox News poll from last month found the attorney general up 54% to 43% among registered voters, with a 21-point advantage among women. Both polls showed Stein winning the support of virtually all the Democrats surveyed, leading with independents and capturing the support of about a tenth of Republican voters. Both polls also showed the presidential race with no clear leader. Democrats have swamped Republicans on the airwaves, according to AdImpact data through September 11.  America Works USA, a political action committee allied with the Democratic Governors Association, has spent $18.3 million on TV ads, while Stein has spent more than $29 million in ads touting his work to clear a backlog of rape kits in the state and criticizing Robinson over the day care center he operated with his wife. The most damaging ads have featured Robinson’s past remarks criticizing abortion. Robinson has said he supports the state’s 12-week abortion limit, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, despite his past support for bans with no exceptions. He’s attributed his opposition to the procedure to his and his wife’s decision to seek an abortion 30 years ago. “Everything Josh Stein and his campaign say about Mark Robinson is either an outright lie or twisted so far out of context it might as well be,” Robinson campaign spokesman Mike Lonergan said in a statement. Robinson’s campaign has spent more than $8.9 million on the airwaves through September 11, and the Republican Governors Association has spent $9.9 million attacking Stein’s law enforcement record. One Robinson ad, in particular, criticized Stein’s handling of racial justice protests in 2020. “As Attorney General, Josh Stein has been intent on keeping North Carolina communities safe – whether it be urging Congress to spend $300 million to detect fentanyl at the border, clearing the rape kit backlog, or putting drug traffickers, murderers, rapists and child sex abusers behind bars,” Stein campaign spokeswoman Morgan Hopkins said in a statement. Robinson also has the support of Trump, who called him “Martin Luther King on steroids” as he endorsed the lieutenant governor in March ahead of the state’s Republican primary. Robinson has embraced the former president’s backing and campaigned with him in Asheville last month. There, the lieutenant governor made an argument that many of his own supporters have made for him: It’s not about the personality or how “brash” Trump may seem, but his policies. “We’re suffering because of bad policy,” Robinson said. “We need to get the good times back. And how do we get the good times back? We reelect President Donald Trump to fix this economy.” The governor’s race may come down to how much Robinson has turned off moderate and independent voters after years of comments in interviews and Facebook posts that have been criticized as anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic and misogynistic. Stein has sought to capitalize on that history by arguing that Robinson is unfit for the office and framing his inflammatory comments as distractions. “We have to focus on the fundamentals: great schools, solid infrastructure, affordable and accessible health care, safe communities,” the attorney general told voters at a campaign event with business leaders this summer. “And we must leave to the side these job-killing culture wars.” Robinson has also made an economic pitch, focused on his experiences growing up in poverty, being laid off and watching his jobs get sent overseas. Susan Myers, an entrepreneur from Pink Hill, North Carolina, said those experiences showed that Robinson has “lived a real life.” Myers said she was a longtime supporter of the lieutenant governor and had held a fundraiser for him at her home during his 2020 race. “I was amazed at the turnout in a very rural area,” she told CNN. “He’s a rock star. He draws people across racial and sexual and income and education barriers, and that’s what we need.” She was willing to look past his history of contentious remarks. “There are a lot of lies, a lot of taking a little bit here, a little bit there,” Myers said of the criticisms of Robinson. “Mark’s not a lifelong politician, so he said things off the cuff that maybe he shouldn’t have said.” Democrats say Stein’s record – and his lack of viral moments – is part of his appeal. “He is a public servant,” state party chair Anderson Clayton said. “He’s not a showboat. Stein grew up in Chapel Hill, where his father – civil rights attorney Adam Stein – helped found the state’s first racially integrated law firm. The attorney general received a bachelors degree from Dartmouth and law and public policy degrees from Harvard University. He’s also highlighted his work clearing the state’s massive backlog of untested rape kits. During his first term in office, Stein worked with the Republican-controlled legislature to conduct an audit that revealed there were more than 16,000 untested rape kits in the state and to pass legislation to clear the backlog and reform the testing system. Stein’s office announced in April that the backlog had been cleared. Republicans have argued that despite his inflammatory comments, Robinson appeals to working-class North Carolina residents in a way that the Ivy League-educated, two-term attorney general may not. Robinson grew up in Greensboro, the ninth of 10 children, and speaks often of how his mother kept the family afloat after his father died. After serving in the Army Reserves and briefly attending college, Robinson spent years working in furniture manufacturing. In 2022, he received a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. In 2018, he rose to prominence after his remarks at a Greensboro City Council meeting defending gun owners’ rights after the Parkland , Florida, school shooting. (Months earlier, Robinson took to Facebook to label survivors of the shooting calling for gun control “spoiled, angry, know it all CHILDREN” and “media prosti-tots.”) Two years later, he won his first political campaign, for lieutenant governor, in the same cycle that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Stein won second terms. Both candidates have centered their pitch on the economy and education. Earlier this summer, the two shared a stage for the first time at a town hall style event hosted by the Wilmington Business Journal. Stein spoke first, touting his record as attorney general and repeating his warning of “job-killing culture wars” and the memory of the state’s bathroom law. Then he blasted what he called Robinson’s “division and hate,” and ran through a list of his opponent’s past comments, including describing homosexuality as “filth,” calling public school teachers “wicked people,” suggesting that Pearl Harbor and 9/11 might have been inside jobs, and referencing women who “can’t keep their skirts down” to explain his support for banning abortion. “Friends, being governor is not performative outrage,” Stein told the crowd. “It is a real job. It’s an important job. It is a hard job.” When he took the stage minutes later, Robinson said he would be focused on the economy and education. “There are a lot of folks are going to say that Mark Robinson is some culture warrior, is going to be focused on the culture wars. That is not true,” he told the crowd. “That is not the message that we have been presenting, and that is not what we will be doing as governor.” A few minutes later, however, the topic turned to those battles when Robinson was asked to elaborate on his pledge to remove what he believes to be inappropriate materials from classrooms. He pointed to the book “Gender Queer,” a memoir about coming out as nonbinary and frequent target of bans. Deloris Rhodes, a former high school principal who moved to Wilmington after she retired, said she’s been following Robinson since he was elected lieutenant governor in 2020. She bristled at his efforts to overhaul public school education in the state. In his 2022 memoir, Robinson called for eliminating science and social studies classes for elementary school students, a proposal he later backed away from, and shuttering the State Board of Education. “Anyone that has common sense knows that they’re going to vote for Josh Stein,” Rhodes said. Heather Horak, a 48-year-old Wilmington resident who attended the event, said she appreciates Robinson’s approach to education policy. Horak is an unaffiliated voter whose politics defy easy categorization. She supported Democratic presidents – including Obama twice – until 2016, when she backed Trump. Her support for Trump this year was only solidified after independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr dropped out and endorsed the former president. At the same time, Horak also supports abortion rights. Horak said she wasn’t focused on negative ads about Robinson’s conduct because it didn’t affect the issues that matter to her. She wanted people to vote on policy, not emotions, she said. “If – whoever your candidate is – is just triggering your emotions and you say, ‘I don’t like that person because I think they’re a bully, I don’t like that person because he’s got a harsh tone,’ let’s be realistic and look at the facts,” she said. “That’s my biggest concern.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that the ad that criticized Josh Stein’s handling of racial justice protests in 2020 was from Mark Robinson’s campaign."
Fact check: Trump falsely claims every poll says he won the debate | CNN Politics,"Published 12:39 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:39:12.470Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/fact-check-trump-claims-won-debate/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump has returned to a time-honored tradition of his: citing junk online polls to claim he was the clear winner of a presidential debate that scientific polls found he lost. He did it in 2016 after his debates against Hillary Clinton. He did it in 2020 after he debated Joe Biden. And he did it again on Wednesday after facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris the previous night. He wrote on social media on Wednesday afternoon: “Every Poll has us WINNING, in one case, 92-8, so why would I do a Rematch?” “We won the debate according to every poll — every single poll, I think,” Trump told reporters later in the afternoon. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. As of Thursday morning, every major scientific poll about the debate — every poll that used random sampling techniques to try to obtain a representative picture of US public opinion — had found that Harris won. The polls in which most respondents said Trump won were unscientific junk polls — open questions posted online — that allowed an unlimited number of people to click and respond no matter how old they are or what country they live in, making the results useless as a measure of US public opinion. Here are the results of three scientific polls about the debate from established nonpartisan pollsters. The first two were released before Trump made his Wednesday claims that every poll showed him winning. CNN poll conducted by SSRS (605 registered voters who said they watched): 63% said Harris did a better job in the debate, 37% said Trump did a better job. YouGov poll (2,166 registered voters who said they watched): 54% said Harris won the debate, 31% said Trump won, 14% weren’t sure. Leger poll for the New York Post (1,002 US adults who said they watched): 50% said Harris won the debate, 29% said Trump won, 21% said nobody won or that they didn’t know. Scientific debate polls from a Democratic pollster and a Republican pollster also found Harris ahead. So while scientific polls are certainly imperfect, it’s clear that Trump’s claim that he won the debate “according to every poll” is wrong. Trump was citing junk polls Trump indicated on social media on debate night and in a Fox News interview the next day that — as he has in the two previous presidential elections — he was citing junk polls as the basis for his claims that polls showed he was the clear debate winner. Trump said on Fox that “every single poll last night had me winning like 90 to 10” and “we have one here: 92 to 7.” Here’s an example of one poll that had him winning by a massive margin like that: an unscientific web survey from Newsmax, a right-wing television station that invited viewers to go to its website and say who they thought won. Such polls are used by media outlets and social media accounts to generate engagement among their audiences. That’s fine. But the polls’ uselessness as an accurate gauge of public opinion is obvious. Newsmax fans were more likely to know this poll even existed than other people were. People could vote multiple times if they owned multiple web-connected devices. And people could vote even if they are a child or a foreign citizen living somewhere else in the world. In the Fox interview, Trump also cited an 80-20 lead he said he had at one point in a C-SPAN poll. C-SPAN is a nonpartisan entity that broadcasts the proceedings of the federal government. But its poll, too, was a junk poll; C-SPAN simply posted an open question on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Supporters of either candidate, no matter where in the world, could share the C-SPAN link with an unlimited number of like-minded people."
Harris campaign guarding against overconfidence after her debate performance sent Democrats’ spirits soaring | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:05 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:15:58.677Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-overconfidence/index.html,"Kamala Harris just roasted her opponent on national television. After months of anticipation, the world’s biggest pop star finally endorsed her. She is swimming in a veritable ocean of cash. So why is Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell still feeling anxious about November’s election? “I was ecstatic like every other Democrat as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin,” Dingell said Thursday on “CNN This Morning,” before recounting the reality check she’d been delivered in an early morning phone call from an official in her state. “Six-fifty yesterday morning, one of my township supervisors called me and wanted to know what I thought,” Dingell said. “That discussion brought me right back down to Earth.” Burned before by overconfidence, Democrats this cycle are running against two opponents. Yes, Donald Trump is the name opposite of Harris’s on the ballot. But it is complacency in their own ranks that many of Harris’s allies are working just as hard to protect against in the final sprint toward Election Day. Polls provide one reason why. Surveys in battleground states indicate an extraordinarily close contest, perhaps the closest in recent memory, which many Harris allies fear is being obscured by the swell of momentum on Harris’ side. Trump’s stranglehold on his own supporters is another. Harris’s aides view his base of support as highly motivated, and note his favorability is higher than when he lost the 2020 election. Yet perhaps the biggest motivator — embossed on the minds of so many operatives who now are working to elect Harris — is the memory of 2016, when Hillary Clinton’s campaign believed it was coasting to victory only to see support in the so-called “blue wall” crumble. Democrats are hardly in despair. Last month’s convention in Chicago was practically euphoric in its celebration of a new nominee that, unlike President Joe Biden, does not seem predestined to lose. And Harris herself has embraced the new sense of joy among the party, casting it as the alternative to Trump’s divisiveness. Yet in practically every conversation, public or private, Harris aides and the candidate herself have interjected with a reality check. They have tempered expectations, tamped down on confidence and announced themselves as the underdog, despite their ostensible success in orchestrating an unprecedented candidate swap 100 days before the election and consolidating new Democratic enthusiasm. Huddled at their campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after the debate, Harris’s campaign aides determined the event would likely do little to change the overall trajectory of the race. Their earlier projections that the results in November will amount to a razor-thin margin — likely to be as close or closer than the results in 2020 — remain the same. Instead, they have developed a plan for the coming days and weeks that will place Harris directly in front of battleground state voters, beginning Thursday in North Carolina and continuing Friday in Pennsylvania. Those stops for the “New Way Forward” tour aren’t just to any battleground state. They’re the states where voting is already about to get underway. And a campaign official tells CNN that’s no coincidence. North Carolina, a purple state where Harris and running mate Tim Walz will make two stops Thursday, is racing to reprint and send out mail-in ballots after the state’s Supreme Court ruled Monday to exclude Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has exited the race. About 161,000 people have already requested mail-in ballots, according to the NC Board of Elections. Trump won the state in 2020 by less than half that number of votes. Next week, Harris will participate in a roundtable with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, which has been withholding an endorsement for the first time in decades. She will also participate in a Q&A session with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, with whom Trump appeared in late July and remarked that Harris “turned Black.” The campaign is expecting to rake in millions in new funds, with a Harris-helmed fundraiser in Washington on Saturday, an Oprah-headlined virtual event next week and several other high-dollar events in the works, according to people familiar with them. That cash, the campaign has said, must be quickly tabulated and quickly deployed in states where voters are beginning to head to the ballot box. In addition to rallies, Harris also plans more local media interviews in the swing states and appearances that bring her into direct contact with voters. Campaign officials spent part of Wednesday looking through debate footage to identify moments that would make effective television ads. The first spot features Harris framing the race as a choice between “two very different visions for the country, one that is focused on the future, one that is focused on the past.” Even as they applauded Harris’s success on the debate stage, however, aides and allies remained cautious about declaring victory too early. “We haven’t won anything yet!” Doug Emhoff, Harris’ husband, declared to supporters at a debate watch party in Philadelphia moments after she stepped off stage. “We have a lot of work to do,” Harris followed up. The next morning, it was more caution. “Debates don’t win elections,” Harris’s team emailed supporters. That type of message is hardly new for a campaign that is looking to maintain its fundraising, motivate its volunteers and convince its pledged voters that they still, in fact, need to cast a ballot. Al Gore even wore an “underdog” costume for Halloween in 1999 as he was seeking the Democratic nomination. Yet the messaging this time appears to go deeper than simply a galvanizing tactic. In battleground states like Dingell’s, where a small slice of undecided voters is likely to determine the next president, Harris and Trump remain in a neck-and-neck contest. While some surveys in Michigan indicate Harris with a small edge, Dingell suggested the numbers could be an illusion. “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” she said. “There’s just a lot of people in the middle … it’s just closer than people realize.” Not every Democrat on Harris’s side seems gripped with caution. “This is the easiest election in my lifetime. I love where we are,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on “CBS Mornings” on Tuesday ahead of the debate, rejecting the “underdog” label for Harris: “She’s not. I don’t like hearing about that.”"
Harris campaign seizes on abortion exchange in Tuesday’s debate in new ad | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:00:19.725Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/harris-campaign-seizes-abortion-ad-debate/index.html,"The Harris campaign is launching a new abortion-focused ad Thursday, capitalizing on what officials believe was one of the most pivotal exchanges between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during Tuesday’s presidential debate. Harris’ team prepared the vice president to confront Trump on nationwide abortion restrictions. Her aides argue the preparation paid off, crediting her needling him on reproductive rights for throwing him off balance the rest of the debate. And now, they’re turning that moment into an ad that will run in battleground states, including in Arizona and Nevada where Trump heads this week. The newly released ad includes both candidates’ responses on abortion on the debate stage. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said, referring to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Harris, in response, ran through personal stories of women struggling to get health care while navigating abortion restrictions. “I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government,” she said. Campaign officials cited the vice president’s response as one of the strongest moments of the debate, based on internal data suggesting that the stories of miscarriages and victims of rape and incest resonated the most with undecided voters. In a statement announcing the ad, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said abortion is “one of the top issues in this election, and the difference between the candidates could not be clearer.” It comes as Harris arrives in North Carolina – a crucial state that President Joe Biden narrowly lost in 2020 but one where campaign officials say they’re trying to make inroads with voters who may be put off by Trump and controversial GOP gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson. North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny Tuesday he believes Harris will move the needle in his battleground state after her strong showing in Philadelphia. The vice president’s focus on protecting abortion rights and health care, Cooper said, could be key to bolstering Democratic efforts to deliver the state in a presidential race for the first time since 2008. Harris campaign officials spent Wednesday poring over footage of the debate to identify key moments to put into new campaign TV and digital ads, according to the campaign, seeking to amplify what they perceive to be the strongest debate exchange. The latest ads are part of $370 million set aside for digital and television between Labor Day and Election Day."
US imposes sanctions on Venezuelan officials who Biden admin says obstructed fair election in country | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:20 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T15:01:15.985Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/us-venezuela-sanctions/index.html,"The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on 16 Venezuelan officials aligned with embattled President Nicolas Maduro for what the Biden administration claims is their role in obstructing a free and fair election in the country. The sanctions come more than a month after Venezuela’s presidential election and days after opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez fled the country, which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday called “the direct result of the anti-democratic measures that Nicolás Maduro has unleashed on the Venezuelan people, including against González Urrutia and other opposition leaders, since the election.” The new sanctions “include leaders of the Maduro-aligned National Electoral Council (CNE) and the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) who impeded a transparent electoral process and the release of accurate election results, as well as the military, intelligence, and government officials responsible for intensifying repression through intimidation, indiscriminate detentions, and censorship,” a press release from the Treasury Department said. Those officials were appointed by Maduro, who was sanctioned in 2017. At the same time, the State Department “is imposing new visa restrictions on a significant number of Maduro-aligned officials who’ve undermined the electoral process in Venezuela, and are responsible for acts of repression,” a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. “We are taking these actions today because it has become abundantly clear to us not only that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s presidential election on July 28th, but also that Maduro and his representatives are intent on denying this fact, and instead seek to cling to power at all costs,” the official said. The official added that they believe the sanctions are “an important step in shaping the overall context of the political trajectory in Venezuela.” They described them as being imposed as part of a broader campaign with allies to pressure Maduro to respect the results of the July 28 election. The US has acknowledged Gonzalez as being the candidate who received the most votes in that election but has not formally recognized him as president-elect of Venezuela. Venezuela rejected the sanctions “in the strongest terms” later on Thursday, describing them as “unilateral, illegitimate and illegal coercive measures.” “The wrongly designated ‘sanctions,’ which have been shamefully promoted by the fascist extreme right, break and violate agreements signed in Qatar and seek to impose on an entire country and its institutions policies of regime change as part of the Monroe Doctrine,” the Venezuelan foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. “There is clear evidence that Mr. González Urrutia won the most votes in this election, and therefore that fact needs to be respected and validated by Venezuelan authorities,” the official said Thursday. The US “has sanctioned over 140 Venezuelan individuals and 100 Venezuelan entities” overall and has imposed sanctions “on nearly 2,000 Venezuelan individuals for their role in undermining democracy, significant corruption and human rights violations,” the official said. However, those sanctions appear to have done little to change Maduro’s behavior."
First on CNN: Biden to host ‘Quad’ leaders in Delaware hometown as he bolsters foreign policy legacy | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:32 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T14:11:34.243Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/joe-biden-quad-leaders-meeting-wilmington-delaware/index.html,"President Joe Biden will welcome the leaders of Australia, India and Japan this month for the final “Quad” summit of his term, adding a personal touch to the event by hosting it in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, senior administration officials tell CNN. The gathering comes as the president has recalibrated plans for the final months of his term in office, shifting from campaigning for reelection to refocusing his attention to domestic and foreign policy issues, including working to shore up alliances as he prepares a handoff to the next administration. Biden has long made fostering personal relationships a signature piece of his foreign policy work, making the hometown summit a fitting coda for a partnership that has been central to the president’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad summit, which will include Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, will take place on September 21 ahead of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York City, senior administration officials previewed to CNN. India was initially this year’s host country for the leaders’ event, but officials agreed to move the summit to the US as world leaders traveled to the UN General Assembly, with plans for India to host next year. Officials said the decision to host the meeting in the president’s hometown instead of on the sidelines of UNGA in New York City was intentional, stressing Biden’s commitment to reinforce his personal relationships in his alliance-building strategy. White House officials have zeroed in on planning for the summit in recent weeks, looking to incorporate personal touches, including places of significance to the president’s life. Biden’s advisers have viewed the decision to elevate the Quad relationship to the leader level in 2021 as key to reinvigorating alliances in the region in the face of China’s growing influence. “What the Quad really shows us is that the region and our partners were eager for this mini-lateral approach, and that it has indeed paid off in its effort to try to build collective capacity in ways that genuinely allow us to deliver for the region and to help keep it more peaceful and stable, in spite of all the challenges that it faces,” a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday. The official added, “The act of bringing together these four leading maritime democracies … really is exactly the type of alliance activity we need in this moment.” The group has met in person three other times — once in the US and twice in Japan — and the president has hosted each leader for a state visit at the White House as he’s sought to deepen cooperation with the countries. The leaders are expected to have “strategic conversation” and to produce “concrete deliverables” during the summit, including a “major signature initiative in the health and health security space,” a collaboration “in the humanitarian and natural disaster space,” and efforts to build on the existing Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, a key initiative aimed at countering China’s aggression in the South China Sea, the official said. The meeting will come just weeks before the November election, which world leaders are watching with anticipation as they wait to learn whether they will work with Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump when Biden leaves office in January. But the leaders also have an eye on setting up the alliance for the future. “While the Quad is certainly a centerpiece of President Biden’s legacy in the Indo-Pacific, it is also increasingly an institution that you can expect will be here to stay as part of our foreign policy,” the senior official said, previewing future funding to support the alliance through national budgets and “steps to demonstrate that the Quad is a bipartisan initiative that will have support over the long term, including support from the US Congress.” Kishida also is set to leave office this month after forgoing a reelection bid, setting up a farewell moment next weekend for half of the leaders comprising the Quad. Kishida’s successor, the official said, is expected to “commit fully to the Quad” going forward. The leaders have developed “deep personal relationships” over the past three years, the official noting that they are facing “common challenges.” “When these four leaders meet in a room, they could basically finish each other sentences. They know what strategic issues are most salient to the other,” the official said. As he enters the lame-duck phase of his presidency, advisers have indicated the president will lean into foreign policy issues as he seeks to bolster his legacy in his closing months in office. That includes possible travel to the G20 Summit in Brazil and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Peru in November. White House officials also are eyeing possible Biden trips to Germany and Africa as soon as October, a source familiar with the matter said. “The president will be day in, day out engaged with counterparts around the world, engaged with his own national security team to deal with the crises and also seize the opportunities that lie ahead,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a call with political appointees last month. Biden’s team is also laying the groundwork for a call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks. Sullivan left open the possibility that the two could meet on the sidelines of upcoming summits in November. China has bristled at times at the United States’ efforts to bolster alliances in the region, including through the Quad partnership. The Quad summit will mark the first time Biden is welcoming world leaders to his hometown just over 100 miles from the White House since taking office. Last year, he hosted Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David for a trilateral summit. There is some precedent for hosting world leaders in a president’s hometown. Former President George W. Bush welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, for talks on nuclear weapons in 2001. Former President Barack Obama held the NATO summit in Chicago in 2012. And Trump held sit-downs with world leaders such as Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
Trump allies do damage control as Harris rides fresh momentum post-debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:19 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T04:00:19.736Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-harris-debate-fallout-analysis/index.html,"Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation. It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day. Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case. The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase. But history suggests that a first debate between two candidates is not historically a reliable predictor of who wins the election. Despite Harris’ strong performance, it’s not yet clear how much progress she made in building the path to 270 electoral votes. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who consistently warns Democrats not to take her swing state for granted, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday that Trump’s base is energized and that the race could not be closer. “I was ecstatic, like every other Democrat, as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin. He reminded much of America about who he was and what he was. She showed people she could be the commander in chief,” Dingell said. But, she added: “At 6:50 yesterday morning, one of my township supervisors called me and wanted to know what I thought. And I said, ‘Well, what did you think?’ And that discussion brought me right back down to Earth.” “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” she said. Meanwhile, Harris’ allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.” “He was all over the place but to some extent structured,” Reines said, referring to Trump when he took on former Secretary of State Clinton. “Now, he’s all over the board.” He added: “I think he’s losing (his) train of thought and he’s just blurting out the next thing in his mind.” Hours after the debate, the political bile briefly eased as Harris and Trump, along with Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, gathered at Ground Zero in New York to honor the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The general election rivals only met for the first time at the debate, but they shared their second handshake in 12 hours in a gesture of national unity orchestrated by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. In a more light-hearted scene Wednesday, a grinning Biden took the extraordinary step of donning a Trump 2024 baseball cap. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the president gave a hat to a Trump supporter during a visit to a fire station in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, near where the fourth hijacked jet crashed short of its target on 9/11 after a passenger revolt. The Trump supporter had said that “in the same spirit POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it,” Bates said. But it was only a temporary respite to the bitter fallout from the debate. The former president did what he always does when presented with unfavorable political facts — deny them. He declared on Fox News on Wednesday that he had “one of my better debates,” despite sweeping negative reviews of his showing. Trump also launched an attack on ABC News, claiming the debate was “rigged” and faulting moderators who fact checked him for setting up a “three-to-one” tag team against him. But one of his newest associates, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may have inadvertently highlighted Trump’s deficiencies in the debate even as he tried to praise the ex-president whom he recently endorsed. Kennedy said on Fox News that while Trump won the debate on “substance,” Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.” “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.” Still, Trump’s complaints were more eagerly picked up among his longtime boosters in conservative media, underscoring the way that the Republican Party always falls in line behind its leader. However, Trump’s narrative that he was thwarted by two TV anchors sat uneasily with his claim on stage that he’s such an intimidating figure that US enemies were simply scared of him. Trump was correct in arguing that he was fact-checked more thoroughly than Harris on Tuesday night by moderators who missed several chances to correct the vice president or to hold her to account for dodging questions. But Harris said nothing that compared to the gusher of untruths from the former president, which included a claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were slaying and eating residents’ dogs and cats. (That racist claim was debunked Wednesday by Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who said there was “no credible evidence.”) Adopting a more sinister tone in his interview with Fox, the former president accused ABC of putting on a “rigged deal” and warned officials “ought to take away their license.” His comments were ominous considering he’s vowed to wage a presidency of “retribution” if he is elected to a second term in November that would include the use of presidential power to punish his enemies. The former president also Wednesday publicly toyed with the idea of a second debate, after the Harris campaign challenged him to another round. But the former president, smarting from his treatment at the hands of the vice president on Tuesday, doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to renew the performance. One the one hand, he may have little incentive to show up again given that he was widely seen to have suffered a drubbing on Tuesday. But if the polls show him trailing in the run-up to the election, there might be a rationale for a do-over. The Harris campaign has a similar conundrum. There’s a case for the vice president folding her tent given that she might not be able to repeat Tuesday’s performance. Trump, however, is trying to change perceptions of the debate after the fact. “In the World of Boxing or UFC, when a Fighter gets beaten or knocked out, they get up and scream, ‘I DEMAND A REMATCH, I DEMAND A REMATCH!’ Well, it’s no different with a Debate. She was beaten badly last nigh. Every Poll has us WINNING,” he wrote on Truth Social, “so why would I do a Rematch?” As is often the case, the ex-president’s reading of polls was exaggerated. A flash CNN poll performed by SSRS after the debate found that watchers thought Harris put in a stronger performance by 63% to 37%. History suggests that it takes at least a week for the full impact of a debate to filter down into the electorate. And the fundamentals of the neck-and-neck race with Harris still seem to favor the former president, whose campaign ads are targeting the vice president over the current administration’s record on the economy, including high prices, inflation and immigration, with an intensity and level of focus that Trump as a candidate has come nowhere near matching. Trump’s running mate has also been more effective at delivering a sharp political message than his boss. He weaved a dismissal of the Swift endorsement for Harris into a wider attack on the vice president on Fox News. “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift,” Vance said. “When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country.” The challenging political backdrop explains why things are still tense at Harris headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. A senior campaign aide told CNN’s MJ Lee that the assumption was that the election remained a 50-50 proposition. “It’ll be incredibly close. We cannot take our foot off the gas, even when the moment feels really good,” the aide said. Harris also faces choices beyond whether she’ll agree to another debate. While her performance was stylistically strong on Tuesday, she still dodged key questions — for instance, the very first one on whether she believes Americans are better off now or when Trump was in office. The Trump campaign is sure to keep up its drumbeat of complaints that she’s avoiding deeper media scrutiny. And there are many signs that voters want more substance from the Democratic nominee. Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, told CNN’s John King that Harris did well in the debate but several also cautioned she was not sufficiently specific in explaining her policies. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs and voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the primary. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. Such doubts are evident in recent national polls too. But they also reflect the fresh complications Trump has caused for himself with his underwhelming debate performance: He may have squandered his best and last chance to expose Harris over those vulnerabilities in front of tens of millions of voters."

Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants.” Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. John Legend took to Instagram to respond to Donald Trump’s baseless claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in the singer’s hometown of Springfield, Ohio. Here’s what he said: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance, while warning Michigan voters that the fight to win battleground states is not over. The Democratic vice presidential candidate said Harris “commanded the room” on Tuesday at the ABC News presidential debate. “Let’s be very clear, none of us were surprised at what happened there,” and saying “no pun intended” that Harris had the “upper hand” from the start, referencing the vice president initiating a handshake with her GOP rival. As former President Donald Trump says there will not be another presidential debate, Walz said he thinks “hell, every day we should do another one,” though, he added, “it’s not going to happen.” He asked the room if they had “eating cats” on their debate bingo cards. The crowd responded by chanting “we’re not eating cats” in the same cadence as the campaign’s now-signature “we’re not going back” chant.  His comments were in reference to a false rumor about Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating their neighbors’ cats that Trump promoted at the debate. Former President Donald Trump announced Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump reiterated this during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, after making the announcement on social media. Harris’ campaign previously called for another debate. She doubled down on that call during a rally in Charlotte on Thursday, saying “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” Here are other headlines you should know: After the debate: The Taylor Swift effect: New ads launched: Lawsuits: Trump campaign proposals: More headlines to know: A noticeable contingent of students from Bennett College were among the supporters at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Greensboro rally Friday evening.   There are nearly a dozen historically Black Colleges and Universities across North Carolina and the campaign is engaged in direct outreach with them.  Harris, a Howard University alum, recently issued a call to action to these students in an open letter.  Bennett is one of only two all-women historically Black colleges in the country. Spelman College in Georgia is the other. Self-described “proud Bennett Belle” Jasmine Rawls introduced Harris and described her excitement as a first-time voter.  “When I go to that voting booth, I will remember that Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz are the only candidates on that ballot that are fighting for a new way forward,” said Rawls. Kamiyah McDowell, 19, — who is studying elementary education — said the debate was “nerve wrecking” to watch both as a college student and as Black woman.   McDowell says she’s most fearful about “how the public is going to react to the winner.”  Former President Donald Trump on Thursday continued attacking the moderators at ABC’s presidential debate and repeated debunked conspiracy theories about migrants taking people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio.  Trump again claimed migrants in Springfield were stealing people’s pets, which is a debunked conspiracy theory that he also promoted during the presidential debate.  “They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park. In the lake. And even walking off with their pets. ‘My dog’s been taken, my dog’s been stolen,’ this can only happen, these people are the worst,” Trump said.  The GOP standard-bearer also attacked Vice President Kamala Harris over her debate performance and said, “She claimed I want to monitor women’s pregnancies. I don’t want to, I don’t want to do that. “It’s a total lie. I don’t want to do that. Women, I won’t be following you to the hospital monitoring.” For more context, here’s our fact check on the ABC presidential debate Former President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that, if reelected, he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.  Trump said “that gives people more of an incentive to work. It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”  The former president previously announced he would push to end taxes on tips and proposed that seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security.  GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized far-right activist Laura Loomer on Thursday, saying that her “rhetoric and hateful tone” is concerning and a problem and “doesn’t represent MAGA as a whole.” The comments from Greene, a Georgia Republican who has her own high-profile history of incendiary and inflammatory remarks, come after the congresswoman called on Loomer to take down an X post, in which Loomer said if Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if she would encourage Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump not to keep close contact with Loomer, Greene said, “This is such an important election. I don’t think she has the experience or the right mentality to advise a very important presidential election.” It’s the latest sign of infighting on the far-right as the presidential election nears, highlighting tension and divisions among Trump supporters over how the Republican Party and its presidential nominee should position itself to voters. Appearing dazed and flustered by an unfamiliar and fast-changing political landscape upended by Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Trump has unleashed a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even close allies and donors have acknowledged as unproductive in recent days. Loomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump, appears often at events where he is speaking and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack. Read more about Greene’s criticism here Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign raised $47 million in the 24 hours following the vice president’s debate against Donald Trump Tuesday night, according to a campaign official, making it, so far, one of the strongest single fundraising days of the vice president’s campaign.  The donations came from around 600,000 donors, the official said, and was “overwhelmingly” fueled by grassroots supporters. The official did not specify how the campaign is defining grassroots supporters. Jen O’Malley Dillon, campaign chair, said in a statement that the haul“reflects a strong and growing coalition of Americans united behind Vice President Harris’ candidacy that knows the stakes this November, and are doing their part to defeat Donald Trump this November.” However, O’Malley Dillon added that “this momentum cannot be taken for granted.”  The statement comes as CNN has previously reported that even after a strong debate performance against Trump, the Harris campaign is insisting that they believe the election will be tough and very close, and that one night would not have changed the trajectory of the race. Vice President Kamala Harris highlighted the contrasts with former President Donald Trump, criticizing him for his answers on several policy issues during his debate performance on Tuesday night while reiterating he was unfit for the presidency. During Tuesday night’s debate, Trump said he has “concepts of a plan” to replace the Affordable Care Act, something he previously promised to do. Harris responded that Trump tried dozens of times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and touted the Biden administration’s work to work to lower prescription drug costs and cap the cost of insulin. She also said she would strengthen the ACA if she were elected president.  The vice president also noted what she said was at stake in the election, specifically women’s reproductive freedom, and reminded a crowd of supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, that Trump would not commit to vetoing an abortion ban when asked on the debate stage. Harris also slammed the former president as somebody who was “not fit to be president of the United States, and should never again occupy our nation’s highest office.” Some context: Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, North Carolina is again seen as competitive, and she and Trump have both campaigned there. Barack Obama won the state in 2008, the only time a Democratic candidate for the White House had carried the Tar Heel state in nearly five decades. A federal appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump’s effort to delay his sentencing in the criminal hush money case because the state judge overseeing the matter already postponed the date. Trump asked the New York-based appeals court to get involved after a federal judge denied his request to move the state case to federal court. While the case was on appeal, New York state Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the state case, agreed to move Trump’s sentencing, then set for September 18, until after the November presidential election, in part to avoid the appearance of aiding one political party or another. The former president’s lawyers argued that even with the state adjournment, they wanted the appeals court to step in and put the case on hold until they can fully litigate their challenge to Trump’s conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records following the US Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity this summer. Rose Goute Creole restaurant does a bustling business in Springfield, Ohio, with clientele drawn to its heaping displays of patties and doughnuts, and pots of perfumed rice, fried pork and fish, and golden plantains. Rosena Jean Louis runs the front, offering free cups of a powerful black coffee and patiently managing a jostling lunch crowd. She and her coworkers are proud of the food they serve, feeding a Haitian expatriate community that has grown quickly in Springfield over the past few years. “I’m always working at the restaurant,” she told CNN. “Everyone likes the food I cook.” But when asked about a lie that has taken hold in some corners of the internet that their countrymen are stealing and eating people’s pets, she rolls her eyes in exasperation. Local officials have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” The state’s highest Republican official, Gov. Mike DeWine, also dismissed the rumor firmly on Wednesday, noting there was “no evidence of that at all.” “The internet can be quite crazy sometimes,” DeWine told CBS in an interview. “Mayor Rue of Springfield says, no, there’s no truth in that. They have no evidence of that, at all. So, I think we go with what the mayor says. He knows his city.” Read more about the debate in Springfield Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would not participate in another presidential debate.   Trump debated President Joe Biden in June and Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this week. Harris’ campaign had called for another debate after she and Trump faced off on ABC on Tuesday.  For now, the Harris campaign says it does not take Donald Trump’s comment at face value.  “He changes his position every day,” a senior adviser said. “I predict there will be another.” This post has been updated with comment from a senior Harris adviser. Asked explicitly if he would consider privatizingthe Veterans Affairs health system, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he’s in favor of giving veterans “more optionality.” “I think I’d consider — and Donald Trump was really good at this, doesn’t get enough credit for this particular innovation — but giving veterans more choice, right?” Vance said on “The Shawn Ryan Show” podcast. Vance described a situation where the nearest VA hospital might be over 100 miles away in a rural area.  Vance also spoke about gutting the federal workforce in Washington, DC, including at the VA.  “Probably 90, 95% of the people who work at the VA are fantastic human beings. But then you’ve got, like, a small slice of the VA that’s bad apples that make it really hard for everybody else to do their job,” Vance said. A judge on Thursday threw out three charges in the sweeping Georgia election subversion case, including two charges that former President Donald Trump is facing. The decision hasn’t yet been formally applied to Trump because his case has been paused pending appeals. In a separate ruling, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee also upheld the marquee racketeering charge in the case, which Trump is also facing. These rulings only narrowly went into effect for former Trump lawyer John Eastman and Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still, who were involved in the 2020 fake electors plot. Their cases are not currently paused. Trump was only named in two of the three charges that McAfee threw out Thursday. Read more about the case. President Joe Biden donned a Trump cap while visiting a firehouse in Pennsylvania on Wednesday as a gesture of “bipartisan unity” while he commemorated the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, according to press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Pictures and videos showed Biden, who was speaking to a crowd at a firehouse near Shanksville Pennsylvania – where United Flight 93 crashed after passengers tried thwarting a hijacking – momentarily putting a Trump hat on at the urging of others in the crowd. Many in the crowd were wearing Trump-branded gear. Biden’s message, Jean-Pierre said, was “that we needed to go back to that bipartisan unity as a country. And so he made those remarks, impromptu remarks, to some of the folks who were there on that day, and he offered a presidential hat to a man who was wearing a Trump cap. And in return, the man said that, in the same spirit, the president should put on his Trump cap. And so the President did very briefly, and that’s what happened.” She added: “It was, it was truly a back and forth about unity, and the president remembering a moment in time after a horrific incident on that day and how the country did come together. It didn’t matter what political party you were part of. It didn’t matter. We came together as a country because we lost so many souls, thousands of souls, more than 2,000 that day.” The White House on Thursday said recent social media comments from Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has been spending time with former President Donald Trump, are “repugnant.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “no leader should ever associate” with someone who spreads “racist poison.” Jean-Pierre was asked about a tweet Loomer posted on Sunday denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris. Loomer traveled to Tuesday’s presidential debate on Trump’s plane and accompanied the former president on Wednesday as he commemorated the 23rd anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. “No leader should ever associate with someone who spreads this kind of ugliness — this kind of racist poison. That’s what this is — and who continues to fan these types of dangerous and insulting conspiracy theories, like the false notion that the tragic 9/11 attacks were an inside job,” she added, a reference to a video Loomer posted last year that suggested a government conspiracy was responsible for the attacks. Read more about Loomer’s possible influence on Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris called for another presidential debate on Thursday, minutes after former President Donald Trump said on social media that he would not participate in a third debate. She slammed Trump for delivering the same “tired playbook” during the debate on Tuesday, reiterating it’s time for the country to move forward. House Republicans are flirting with the idea of forcing a government shutdown over the issue of noncitizens voting in US elections. Government funding authority runs out on September 30, and House Speaker Mike Johnson — at the all-caps urging of former President Donald Trump in social media posts – wants to pair a temporary spending bill to keep the government running along with a bill that would require proof of citizenship for every American in order to register to vote. With that in mind, here’s a look at the evidence in the specific states Johnson mentions about the infinitesimal number of undocumented people registering to vote or actually voting in US elections. Georgia In 2022, Georgia, which has more than 7 million registered voters, announced the results of the first-ever citizenship review of its voter rolls. It found a grand total of 1,634 people “who had attempted to register to vote were not able to be verified,” according to a statement that year from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican. They were placed into “pending citizenship” status. Pennsylvania In a state with more than 8.6 million registered voters, an admitted glitch in Pennsylvania’s voter registration process enabled noncitizens legally in the US to unwittingly register to vote for a time. Between 2006 and 2017, when the glitch was discovered, at least 168 unauthorized people are thought to have been registered to vote in Philadelphia, a city of more than 1.5 million people. Read about the situation in other states here Kamala Harris just roasted her opponent on national television. After months of anticipation, the world’s biggest pop star finally endorsed her. She is swimming in a veritable ocean of cash. So why is Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell still feeling anxious about November’s election? Burned before by overconfidence, Democrats this cycle are running against two opponents. Yes, Donald Trump is the name opposite of Harris’ on the ballot. But it is complacency in their own ranks that many of Harris’ allies are working just as hard to protect against in the final sprint toward Election Day. Polls provide one reason why. Surveys in battleground states indicate an extraordinarily close contest, perhaps the closest in recent memory, which many Harris allies fear is being obscured by the swell of momentum on Harris’ side. Trump’s stranglehold on his own supporters is another. Harris’ aides view his base of support as highly motivated and note his favorability is higher than when he lost the 2020 election. Yet perhaps the biggest motivator — embossed on the minds of so many operatives who now are working to elect Harris — is the memory of 2016, when Hillary Clinton’s campaign believed it was coasting to victory only to see support in the so-called “blue wall” crumble. Democrats are hardly in despair. Last month’s convention in Chicago was practically euphoric in its celebration of a new nominee that, unlike President Joe Biden, does not seem predestined to lose. And Harris herself has embraced the new sense of joy among the party, casting it as the alternative to Trump’s divisiveness. Yet in practically every conversation, public or private, Harris aides and the candidate herself have interjected with a reality check. They have tempered expectations, tamped down on confidence and announced themselves as the underdog, despite their ostensible success in orchestrating an unprecedented candidate swap 100 days before the election and consolidating new Democratic enthusiasm. Keep reading here about where things stand in the Harris campaign. Huddled at their campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after the debate, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign aides determined the event would likely do little to change the overall trajectory of the race. Their earlier projections that the results in November will amount to a razor-thin margin — likely to be as close or closer than the results in 2020 — remain the same. Instead, they have developed a plan for the coming days and weeks that will place Harris directly in front of battleground state voters, beginning Thursday in North Carolina and continuing Friday in Pennsylvania. Those stops for the “New Way Forward” tour aren’t just to any battleground state. They’re the states where voting is already about to get underway. And a campaign official tells CNN that’s no coincidence. North Carolina, a purple state where Harris and running mate Tim Walz will make two stops Thursday, is racing to reprint and send out mail-in ballots after the state’s Supreme Court ruled Monday to exclude Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has exited the race. About 161,000 people have already requested mail-in ballots, according to the NC Board of Elections. Trump won the state in 2020 by less than half that number of votes. Next week, Harris will participate in a roundtable with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, which has been withholding an endorsement for the first time in decades. She will also participate in a Q&A session with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, with whom Trump appeared in late July and remarked that Harris “turned Black.” The campaign is expecting to rake in millions in new funds, with a Harris-helmed fundraiser in Washington on Saturday, an Oprah-headlined virtual event next week and several other high-dollar events in the works, according to people familiar with them. That cash, the campaign has said, must be quickly tabulated and quickly deployed in states where voters are beginning to head to the ballot box. In addition to rallies, Harris also plans more local media interviews in swing states and appearances that bring her into direct contact with voters. Keep reading here about Harris’ campaign plans. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris brought an immediate, tangible boost for two key websites promoting voter registration, the latest signal of the superstar singer’s political potency.  The link that Swift shared in her Instagram story late Tuesday routed fans to Vote.gov, which is the federal government’s voting registration site.  That marked a significant spike to the site’s average traffic. For instance, from September 3 to 9, the site received about 30,000 visitors per day. Vote.gov received “a total of 726,523 visitors between September 10-11, 2024,” the spokesperson noted.  The nonprofit, nonpartisan organization Vote.org also saw a significant spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement.  On Wednesday, there were over 27,000 new registrations and over 80,000 people who verified their registration status on Vote.org, a spokesperson said.  Swift encouraged her supporters to register to vote and research early voting information.  “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. With margins expected to be tight in battleground states this November, Swift’s capacity to shake up the presidential race could make a difference.  Swift also urged fans to register to vote while accepting an award at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday. Vote.org doesn’t have post-VMA data at this point. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer continued on Thursday to tie former President Donald Trump to the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a conservative policy roadmap for a Republican presidential administration. Trump has said that he is unfamiliar with the project, which Schumer called, “an American nightmare. The most conservative, unhinged and extreme agenda we’ve seen in modern times.” He added, “Trump’s first term in office wouldn’t hold a candle to the ideas in Project 2025.” Schumer and several of his Senate Democratic colleagues pointed to parts of the proposal that are “laying the groundwork for a national abortion ban,” and note that it includes a plan to abolish the Department of Education. They also argued that the mortgage policies would “make it harder for Americans to own a home.”  “This is sinister stuff,” said Schumer. “The vast majority of Americans oppose them, yet it is precisely what the hard right is promising the American people if Donald Trump returns to office.” Pressed on Republicans’ insistence that Trump would not sign a national abortion ban —although Trump did not explicitly rule it out at Tuesday night’s presidential debate – the majority leader said, “look at everything he’s said over the years…No one believes him. Everybody knows what he’s going to do.” More about Project 2025: The 920-page document was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.”   Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. A Harris campaign official previously said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.”  Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he believes former President Donald Trump’s across-the-board tariff proposals are part of a negotiation tactic and claimed that tariffs are “not always” inflationary.  “When people say these tariffs are going to have an effect, Donald Trump already imposed specific tariffs on specific industries. You didn’t see the negative consequences come to light. In fact, what you saw was rising wages and rising take home pay. So, when people say you can’t do this in a narrow way, you can’t do it in a broad-based way, I just think that doesn’t actually fit with reality,” Vance said.  Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports and 10% across-the-board tariff on imports from other nations. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar. What experts say: Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that such high levies would raise prices on consumers, especially if they were applied widely — although he cautioned that it’s unclear under what conditions Trump would impose 100% tariffs. Christine McDaniel, a former senior trade official in the George W. Bush administration, called the idea “crazy” and “silly season campaign rhetoric.” Alex Durante, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, told CNN that 100% tariffs would threaten the economy. Attorney General Merrick Garland slammed efforts to turn the Justice Department into a “political weapon” during a fiery speech Thursday to department staff and US attorneys from across the country. Garland decried the “escalation of attacks” against career staff in years through “conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence.” The attorney general’s comments come as former President Donald Trump has claimed that the Justice Department has been weaponized against him amid his criminal prosecutions and suggested that he would politicize the department should he return to the Oval Office. Neither Trump nor his allies were mentioned by name. But Trump and his associates have publicly discussed plans to dismantle the department and its law enforcement components like the FBI, or to prosecute his political enemies. “Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,” Garland added to applause. Garland also thanked the prosecutors and Justice Department staff for refusing to “bend to politics” and “break under pressure.” Read more about Garland’s remarks. The Harris campaign is launching a new abortion-focused ad Thursday, capitalizing on what officials believe was one of the most pivotal exchanges between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during Tuesday’s presidential debate. Harris’ team prepared the vice president to confront Trump on nationwide abortion restrictions. Her aides argue the preparation paid off, crediting her needling him on reproductive rights for throwing him off balance the rest of the debate. And now, they’re turning that moment into an ad that will run in battleground states, including in Arizona and Nevada where Trump heads this week. The newly released ad includes both candidates’ responses on abortion on the debate stage. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said, referring to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Harris, in response, ran through personal stories of women struggling to get health care while navigating abortion restrictions. “I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government,” she said. Continue reading about Harris’ new ad. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance defended former President Donald Trump’s debate performance, and he didn’t explicitly say if he believes there should be a second one.  It wasn’t clear which poll Vance was referencing. In a CNN flash poll, 63% of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate say Vice President Kamala Harris outperformed Trump. Among the group, 31% described themselves as Democrats, 39% as Republicans and 30% as independents or members of another party.  Vance was asked if he had any frustration on what Trump was focusing on in the debate versus what he could have said about Harris.  Vance said he disagrees with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who said that Trump lost the debate.   “When you see how the undecided voters react, that’s what actually matters the most. But it’s telling that immediately after the debate, Kamala Harris came out and said, yes, I’d like to do another debate,” Vance said.  Vance has two fundraisers in New York City today, according to a source familiar. Springfield, Ohio’s City Hall was forced to close Thursday “due to a bomb threat that was issued to multiple facilities throughout Springfield today.” It’s unclear what the nature of the threat was; officials were alerted to the threat via email at 8:24 a.m, ET, according to the city. Springfield has been the center of false claim pushed by former President Donald Trump and others that Haitian migrants in the community are stealing and eating pets. City officials have told CNN they have seen no evidence of that happening. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced on Thursday a grant program that would support new farmers in Minnesota to buy equipment or improve infrastructure on their farm.  The new grant funding comes as Walz seeks to appeal to agriculture workers, farmers and rural voters while campaigning around the country as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.  Under the new program, beginner farmers would be allowed to apply for up to $20,000 grants to purchase farm equipment or improve infrastructure like irrigation systems or livestock buildings. The program expects to award $800,000 in total.  Harris’ running mate has often highlighted his rural upbringing in Nebraska and his connection to rural voters through his time representing rural Minnesotans in Congress and as governor. In an interview with WCMU, a public radio station in Michigan, Walz touted his connection to people in “ag districts” and spoke on how he hopes to win their support.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal warned his fellow Democrats not to get complacent after Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance — citing Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016.  “I’m deeply concerned that this race is going to be neck and neck right to the finish, and the euphoria that a lot of people are feeling right now, while justified, perhaps, after her tremendous performance in the debate, may lead to complacency or overconfidence,” he told CNN. Asked how Harris can protect herself against that trend, the Connecticut Democrat continued, “You avoid that trap by sounding the alarm and raising awareness about past complacency — we have only to look at Hillary Clinton to see how complacency and overconfidence can lead to disaster, especially after a good debate.”  Conservative activist Leonard Leo is threatening to withhold some of his $1 billion in funds from dozens of groups he supports unless they can demonstrate plans to “weaponize the conservative vision.” In a letter obtained by CNN, Leo makes it clear he wants groups that are supported by his 85 Fund to take concrete action to “crush liberal dominance” if they want to continue to receive funding.  The letter outlines how Leo believes left-wing activist groups have used their funds to “weaponize” their philosophy — and he would like to see groups that are supported by his 85 Fund do the same. Leo believes that conservative philanthropy needs to move “less in the direction of research, policy, and general education,” and instead use funding to “operationalize or weaponize the conservative vision.”  In his letter, Leo says the Left has taken this “enormous” step in operationalizing their ideas. Leo is known as one of the architects of Trump’s conservative Supreme Court. He helped Trump select Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Since taking the bench, the Trump’s appointees have been a part of several federal laws — including the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The letter cites groups like Students for Justice in Palestine, Voter Registration Project and World Professional Association for Transgender Health as a few organizations that have benefited from left-wing funding and are using the funds to mobilize their ideology.  The letter does not specifically name any groups that Leo is threatening to withhold funding from. He added that the review of his funds was provoked by, in his opinion, the amount of his funds being put towards “ideation.” This letter was first reported by Axios.  It’s easy to dismiss many presidential candidates’ campaign promises as empty, because Congress would need to approve them. Tariffs are different. Presidents have vast powers to lob tariffs on friends and foes, as former President Donald Trump demonstrated when he waged a trade war starting in 2018. That’s why some experts are alarmed and baffled by Trump’s latest threat to use his favorite economic weapon. During a rally in battleground Wisconsin last weekend, Trump vowed to impose staggering tariffs on countries that snub the US dollar. The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency – essentially a super currency that helps international trade flow and the global economy to function. But Trump’s threat appears to be in response to China, Russia and other countries that have made noise about finding an alternative to the greenback. Taking a hardline on protecting the almighty dollar might sound good on the campaign trail, but experts warn that such a massive tariff would likely backfire on the American people.

Taylor Swift’s call to encourage people to register to vote may be having an impact, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that provides government services. It was not immediately clear how many of those visitors registered to vote.  Vote.gov, which is the link Swift shared in her endorsement, is the federal government’s voting registration site run by the GSA. The website directs voters to their individual states and territories to register to vote and provides answers to frequently asked questions. Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. Vote.org also saw a huge spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement. A spokesperson for Vote.org told CNN there was a 585% jump in voters on the website between 9 p.m. through midnight ET, during the debate and shortly after Swift’s post endorsing the Harris-Walz campaign.  While voter engagement across the country likely increased also due to the debate, the CEO of Vote.org attributed the spike, in part, to the Taylor effect.  “Taylor Swift’s impact on voter engagement is undeniable,” Andrea Hailey, Vote.org CEO, said in a statement to CNN. New York’s highest court rejected two separate attempts to hear Donald Trump’s appeals on the gag order in his hush money case, according to a decision list posted Thursday. The gag order, issued by Judge Juan Merchan in the criminal case against Trump, remains in effect, although Merchan lifted portions of it in June. Trump’s attorneys had challenged both the initial gag order and the modified gag order. The judges wrote that they declined to hear the case about the modified gag order because “no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.” Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment. Trump was found guilty earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sentencing in the case has been delayed until late November. This is one of four criminal cases Trump faces while running again for president. A nearly four-year-old legal effort by Black voters to convince a court to prevent former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party from potentially intimidating voters and poll workers is quietly coming back to life as the 2024 election approaches. First brought in the days following the 2020 election, the lawsuit has moved slowly through the federal courts in Washington, DC, as Trump’s claims of presidential immunity from civil lawsuits were being litigated. It coincidently has landed before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge handling the federal election subversion charges against Trump. But now, the case is beginning to show signs of movement. The case could have enormous implications for this election and future ones: The voters are asking a federal judge to put Trump, his campaign and the Republican National Committee under court supervision that would require them to seek pre-approval before “engaging in any activities related to recounts, certifications, or similar post-election activities,” and to bar the defendants from intimidating voters, poll workers and other election officials. If the plaintiffs ultimately prevail, their victory could provide them with a significant deterrence against potential intimidation and harassment of election workers and voters from Republicans as Trump and his allies signal that they will again try to undermine the results of the election. Read the full story. The Trump campaign is up with a new ad in Pennsylvania warning voters that Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking, despite Kamala Harris’ recent statements to the contrary, seizing on a key issue in the battleground state. “Harris will ban all fracking,” the ad opens, over images of Harris’ high-profile interview with CNN earlier this month, her first sit-down as the new Democratic nominee. The ad proceeds to play a clip of Harris at a CNN Town Hall in 2019, taking a question from a voter. “That will immediately put tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians out of work and send utility bills skyrocketing,” the ad’s narrator says. “Trump will protect clean energy fracking and protect the jobs it creates.”  Harris was asked directly about her position on fracking at Tuesday’s debate, and she answered, “I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.” The new ad from the Trump campaign reflects the salience of the issue. Fracking is a major industry in Pennsylvania, the top battleground state this election cycle, drawing more campaign dollars than any other. And the debate over the industry’s economic and environmental impacts is one of several shaping the fierce contest in the commonwealth. This comes as the Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Trump. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served under Republican George W. Bush, told CNN News Central that he’s backing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris because he believes she is “most likely to be dedicated to trying to unite America. I don’t see that, that discipline, that willingness in Donald Trump.” Gonzales said he felt the need to come out publicly against Trump “because of his lack of, as we see it, his lack of support, lack of willingness to abide by the rule of law,” adding that he believes Harris has “demonstrated fidelity to the rule of law.” “I thought her performance during the convention was good. I thought her performance during the debate was outstanding, quite frankly,” he said. Gonzalez first announced his support for Harris earlier this morning in a Politico op-ed. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell – who warned about Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 – said she was “ecstatic” about Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump until she had a conversation with a local official back home.   “I was ecstatic like every other Democrat as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin,” she told Kasie Hunt of Harris on CNN This Morning.  The Michigan Democrat warned that polls showing Harris leading Trump in her home state, a key battleground, may not be accurate. “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” Dingell explained.  Election Day is less than two months away, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule of campaign events today following their presidential debate. CNN poll of debate watchers found that registered voters who watched the presidential debate broadly agreed Harris outperformed Trump. Despite many saying that Harris won the showdown, the vice president still faces a tight race. Read fact checks and key takeaways from the night. Trump said he is still weighing whether to debate Harris again, while the Harris campaign said it is entering a more aggressive phase as it seeks to build on momentum following the presidential debate and mobilize voters in key battleground states.  Here’s more on the campaign: The Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Donald Trump. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward,” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a news release from the campaign. The 30-second slot shows Trump on the debate stage in what the Harris campaign referred to as “thrashing” the country. “We’re a failing nation. A nation that is dying. We’re a nation that’s in serious decline,” Trump said. “What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do. We all have so much more in common than what separates us. And we can chart a new way forward,” Harris said.  The ad will air across digital platforms and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation. It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day. Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case. The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase. And her allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.” Read Collinson’s full analysis. The Harris campaign says it is entering a more aggressive phase as it seeks to build on momentum following the presidential debate and mobilize voters in key battleground states.  Today, Vice President Kamala Harris will kick off her “New Way Forward” tour through swing states, beginning with two rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. On Friday, Harris will hold events in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a state she has reiterated she needs to win in November. The campaign is expected to launch new TV and digital ads featuring key moments from the debate. The day after Harris’ performance, staffers spent hours poring through debate footage to identify key moments to highlight key issues among voters while offering a stark contrast between Trump. The campaign released its first digital ad yesterday featuring clips from her performance. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a press release from the campaign. More media dates: The vice president is expected to hold more media engagements in the coming days, including in local markets through swing states. It comes as she has faced mounting criticism for not holding more interviews. Next week, she will also participate in a discussion with journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris was unable to attend NABJ’s annual convention due to a prior obligation and opted to reschedule her speaking engagement. Top Harris surrogates will also have a robust schedule on the trail, with less than two months until Election Day. Today and tomorrow, Gov. Tim Walz will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, while Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff attends events in Arizona and Nevada. Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz will travel to Manchester, New Hampshire, and Maine to campaign, including headlining an Educators for Harris-Walz event and visiting a phone bank. The “New Way Forward” tour is also set to include surrogate events to target key voter groups today. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today as they make their pitch to voters with less than two months until Election Day. Harris is heading to North Carolina and will attend two campaign rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro as she kicks off her “New Way Forward” tour through swing states. Trump is heading to Arizona, where he will deliver remarks in Tucson. The former president is also scheduled to attend a fundraising event in Los Angeles, California. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will travel to Michigan to hold a campaign event in Grand Rapids. As soon as Donald Trump exited the debate stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night, he immediately began quizzing those waiting in his viewing room about how the last 90 minutes had gone. While several praised him to his face, telling him he did a “great job,” that’s not what many of them are saying privately.  Instead, those around Trump have described what happened on stage as a draw at best and a loss at worst. Several of them told CNN they were stunned that the former president failed to do a better job executing on the talking points he had prepared against Vice President Harris, her record and her policy reversals.  Trump had done more debate prep ahead of his first meeting with Harris than he did for his debate with President Joe Biden earlier this summer, two people told CNN. Yet Trump didn’t make one of his central arguments against Harris — about why she hasn’t carried out the promises she’s making now in the last 3.5 years in office — until his closing argument, surprising many of them who have heard him make the argument in private and on the campaign trail.  Instead, one person conceded, Trump took the bait every single time Harris offered it. While multiple Trump allies described what happened Tuesday night as a “missed opportunity,” they have since started downplaying the debate’s overall significance, arguing it won’t shift his numbers with voters in states like Pennsylvania.  Trump himself was noncommittal about a second debate Wednesday morning, though almost every ally of his who CNN spoke with said they believe he will ultimately agree to one.  Voters and lawmakers are reacting to the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the countdown to Election Day continues in a very tight race. The two candidates came face-to-face for a second time this week at an event commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks yesterday. Here are the latest developments in the race: The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks, according to Nielsen data. Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia, hosted by ABC News, was aired across 17 television networks and easily surpassed the 51 million who tuned in to the June debate hosted by CNN between Trump and President Joe Biden.  While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year, it represents a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million and Fox News with more than 9 million. Former President Donald Trump said his team is still weighing whether he would engage in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, after her team immediately called for a second debate in October.  “I would do NBC. I would do FOX too, but right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do,” Trump said, after visiting the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department in Pennsylvania. “When you don’t win, it’s like a fighter — when a fighter has a bad fight gets knocked out or loses the fight, the first thing he says is we want a rematch. So, we won the debate according to every single poll, every single poll. Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” Trump said. “But we’ll think about it.” CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. As CNN reported this morning, a top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance. Trump said it was “very polite” between him and Harris Wednesday morning, who shook hands at the 9/11 commemoration ceremony. “Just, uh, very polite, very polite,” Trump said, when asked what he said to Harris."
The ‘sleeper case’ trying to stop Trump and the RNC from intimidating voters and poll workers | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T09:00:21.333Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/sleeper-case-rnc-trump-voter-intimidation/index.html,"A nearly four-year-old legal effort by Black voters to convince a court to prevent former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party from potentially intimidating voters and poll workers is quietly coming back to life as the 2024 election approaches. First brought in the days following the 2020 election, the lawsuit has moved slowly through the federal courts in Washington, DC, as Trump’s claims of presidential immunity from civil lawsuits were being litigated. It coincidently has landed before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge handling the federal election subversion charges against Trump. But now, the case is beginning to show signs of movement. The case could have enormous implications for this election and future ones: The voters are asking a federal judge to put Trump, his campaign and the Republican National Committee under court supervision that would require them to seek pre-approval before “engaging in any activities related to recounts, certifications, or similar post-election activities,” and to bar the defendants from intimidating voters, poll workers and other election officials. If the plaintiffs ultimately prevail, their victory could provide them with a significant deterrence against potential intimidation and harassment of election workers and voters from Republicans as Trump and his allies signal that they will again try to undermine the results of the election. The type of supervision sought by the voters is not new for the Republican Party: The GOP had previously been under a court-ordered consent decree from the early 1980s until 2017 that barred it from engaging in practices that could intimidate or discriminate against Black voters. Rajiv Parikh, an attorney who represented the Democratic Party during part of the long-running case against the RNC that resulted in the now-expired consent decree, said courts play a critical role in preventing the type of intimidation that the Black voters are alleging occurred during the 2020 election. “Just because your intention isn’t to discriminate against a group or to intimidate somebody, if what you do has the effect of doing that, then it really is going to be up to a court as an independent arbiter of what’s appropriate or what’s not to decide that,” he said. At the heart of the lawsuit are claims by Black voters in Michigan that the defendants worked together in 2020 to unlawfully disenfranchise them and other voters in “major metropolitan areas with large Black voter populations” through “disrupting vote counting efforts, lodging groundless challenges during recounts, and attempting to block certification of election results through intimidation and coercion of election officials and volunteers.” In doing so, the lawsuit alleges, the defendants violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction-era law passed to combat violence by the White supremacist group and allow people to take civil action against individuals who “conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat,” participation in US elections. Attorneys for Trump and the RNC have asked to dismiss the case, saying any conduct at issue constitutes protected political speech. “This is simply a transparent attempt to quell political dissent and chill political speech,” a lawyer for Trump and his campaign wrote in a filing last year. “Even assuming all the allegations are true, President Trump and his Campaign engaged in simple and straightforward political speech during an important political dispute.” Chutkan has yet to make any substantial rulings in the matter. She was randomly assigned the pivotal case last October, receiving it months after she started overseeing the criminal case brought by special counsel Jack Smith against Trump. Weeks later, the judge stressed the need to have “some forward motion” in the civil matter as the nation barreled toward the presidential election. “It’s been pending for a long time. At a certain point, a failure to decide means that it effectively denies the plaintiffs their remedy,” Chutkan said during a hearing in late November. The lawsuit, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization v. Trump, is asking both for court supervision of election-related activities as well as monetary damages for the alleged harms that took place around the 2020 election. But in recent weeks, the plaintiffs asked for permission to drop their demand for damages to avoid a protracted fight over whether Trump can avoid liability by arguing that his actions during the last election are shielded by presidential immunity. In a filing Tuesday, lawyers for the Black voters stressed that avoiding litigation over the question of immunity would allow the case to “proceed expeditiously … particularly in light of the upcoming November election.” The now-expired consent decree the RNC had been under for nearly four decades was between Republicans and the Democratic National Committee, which had sued the GOP over alleged intimidation of voters in majority Black areas of New Jersey during the 1981 election. The proposed supervision in the DC case would differ from the earlier consent decree in several key ways. First, it would be between the GOP and nonpartisan voters instead of two political parties. Second, the earlier consent decree was primarily concerned with poll watching, whereas the proposed one seeks to protect both voters and election workers, a group of officials who were targeted by Trump’s allies in 2020 as he pushed lies about the legitimacy of the election and its results. “In this fraught and dangerous climate, twenty percent of election officials polled plan to leave before the 2024 election, in large part due to political leaders’ attacks. Thirty percent of officials know of one or more election workers who already have left their jobs because of fear for their safety, increased threats, or intimidation,” the lawsuit states. Parikh said he sees the court supervision sought as being especially important in swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where Republican lawyers might focus their efforts on areas in those states with large populations of minority voters. The Ku Klux Klan Act has not been well litigated in the modern era, according to legal experts, though in recent years some plaintiffs have leaned on the statute as they’ve sought to hold Trump and his supporters accountable for their actions around the 2020 election, or pursue monetary damages from individuals who have engaged in right-wing political violence. Ruth Greenwood, the director of the Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School, said that the notable thing about the DC case is that “it is seeking to use the KKK Act a lot more for its original purposes.” The Black voters, Greenwood said, are trying to “ensure that there is a court that litigants can rush to if these types of actions are tried again in 2024.” Cases pending in DC that invoke other provisions of the 1871 law have been brought by Democratic lawmakers and Capitol Police officers against Trump and his allies in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Another high-profile use of the law was in a case over conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman’s voter suppression campaign that used robocalls to target Black voters during the 2020 election. A federal judge found the two men liable for targeting Black voters in 2023, saying that their actions ran afoul of the KKK Act, the VRA and other laws. The two later agreed to pay $1 million for the scheme. One of the most notable outcomes of the modern application of the law came in a federal courtroom in Charlottesville, Virginia. A jury fined neo-Nazi and White supremacist organizers and protesters in the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally millions for the distress they gave counterprotesters, including four who were struck by a car. An appeals court later limited the damages for the plaintiffs to about $2 million. Meanwhile, a jury this week is hearing a case in Austin’s federal court where Biden-Harris campaign affiliates in 2020 say they were traumatized by drivers in a “Trump Train” caravan that surrounded their campaign bus on a Texas interstate. The judge overseeing that matter has signed off on the KKK Act being used in the case."
Speaker Mike Johnson’s next steps on government funding fight could determine whether he gets to keep leading the House GOP | CNN Politics,"Published 4:00 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T08:00:20.035Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/mike-johnson-next-steps-government-funding-fight/index.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson has a decision to make. With the election looming and another government funding deadline just around the corner, the speaker must find a way in the next several days to both govern for the country, avoid a shutdown that could cost his members in swing districts and keep the right flank of his party pacified enough to not imperil his own political future. It’s a tightrope he’s walked time and time again in government funding showdowns in the last year, on Ukraine aide and when it came to reauthorizing a key national security program, but this time the course Johnson charts could determine whether he can stay atop his leadership post after the election. “I don’t think he thinks about his speakership first. I think he thinks about the (future) of the country first. But let’s be honest. With him, it’s a very difficult needle to thread,” Rep. Lisa McClain, a Republican from Michigan, told CNN. While many of his allies are bullish on House Republicans’ chances to keep the House in November, they acknowledge there are still a lot of variables that need to play out. If Republicans keep the House, Johnson will need to secure  218 votes to become the speaker in January, a major lift if Johnson once again has a slim or even shrunken majority. Johnson for his part has maintained widespread popularity. Even many of the Republicans who once privately questioned whether Johnson was too green for the job have argued he’s grown quickly into it, taking on his right flank and surviving leadership challenges his predecessor could not weather. “It’s just hard from my standpoint no matter how this fight goes if we come back into the majority, it would be tough to make the argument that he shouldn’t be speaker,” said Rep. Drew Ferguson, a Republican from Georgia. There is also the potential that Republicans lose the House. Then, Johnson would need to convince a majority he’s still up for the job of leading the conference as minority leader, an easier mathematical problem that requires just a simple majority vote but one that could be complicated by a challenger if Republicans lose in a landslide. “When you lose the Superbowl by two touchstones, you fire the coach,” one GOP aide lamented on Johnson’s future if Republicans lose big. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a key critic to Johnson, warned she didn’t see Johnson sticking around if Republicans lose the House. “That’s to be determined, but, you know, based on things that I’ve heard, and I’m not naming names, naming members, I don’t see that happening,” she said. On Wednesday, Johnson announced he was pulling the GOP spending bill that would have funded the government for six months and included the SAVE Act, legislation that requires proof of citizenship to register to vote. The bill was on the cusp of failure after at least eight House Republicans said publicly they wouldn’t support it. But Johnson said that he would continue trying to build support for the bill. “We’re in the consensus building business here in Congress. With small majorities that’s what you do,” Johnson told reporters. But while Johnson maintained he planned to keep whipping the votes on the plan, there is no indication that the dynamics will change, forcing the Louisiana Republican to at some point consider his other options. If Johnson needs to build bipartisan consensus to get a funding bill across the finish line as he has had to do time and time again, Democratic leaders warn he’ll need to drop the SAVE Act from being tied directly to the funding bill. But whether Johnson will relent on the six-month spending bill remains to be seen in part because it could unlock a much easier path for his future. Punting another spending showdown until March could insulate Johnson from having to pass a massive end-of-year spending bill in December and then turn around and convince hardliners that he should keep the speaker’s gavel. Keeping the House might give him a victory to campaign on, but there are several Republicans including Greene who challenged Johnson’s speakership in the spring and who have already publicly registered their displeasure with Johnson. “I think it’s going to be really difficult for him,” Greene told CNN about Johnson’s chances of winning the gavel again if he cuts a spending deal with Democrats. “Eleven of my colleagues voted with me for a motion to vacate. However, you’re seeing a good number of my colleagues that weren’t part of that eleven now turning on him with a CR and SAVE Act because they know the writing on the wall.” Getting Democrats to sign onto a March deadline would be a hard sell for Johnson. Many Democrats want to clear the deck for a potential Harris administration, and the Biden administration has warned that a six-month continuing resolution could have devastating effects on military preparedness and even the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is facing a $12 billion shortfall going into the new fiscal year. A December funding bill would also provide Biden his last opportunity to include other legacy items that often ride along on a massive end-of-year spending bill. The next several days will be critical for Johnson to navigate carefully. “I think he’s doing the best job that he can, small margins that we have. It’s such a tight schedule. I mean, to me, it’s the job that he has I would not want,” Rep. Beth Van Duyne, a Republican from Texas, told CNN. The next several weeks could play out in several ways. Johnson could opt to quickly pivot after Wednesday to a plan to move a short-term spending bill until March that drops the SAVE Act in an effort to win over Democratic votes. On the other hand, Senate Democrats could act swiftly to force Johnson’s hand by offering a short-term spending bill that goes just to December and dare Johnson to reject it and risk a shutdown just months before an election. “He’s in the majority so he’s gotta figure out what the right combination is,” Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, told CNN of Johnson’s calculation. “It’s kind of like a Rubik’s cube.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. The Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Donald Trump. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward,” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a news release from the campaign. The 30-second slot shows Trump on the debate stage in what the Harris campaign referred to as “thrashing” the country. “We’re a failing nation. A nation that is dying. We’re a nation that’s in serious decline,” Trump said. “What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do. We all have so much more in common than what separates us. And we can chart a new way forward,” Harris said.  The ad will air across digital platforms and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played the role of former President Donald Trump in Kamala Harris’ debate preparations, celebrated the vice president’s performance at Tuesday’s debate while reflecting on how Trump has changed since his first presidential run eight years ago. Reines told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday that Harris was successful in carving out the space to remind viewers of Trump’s record while sharing her own plans for the next four years. Reines, who also played Trump in Hillary Clinton’s debate preparations in 2016, argued that that Trump’s messaging is now “all over the board” and described him as a “malfunctioning appliance.” Reines also gave insight that Harris initiating a handshake with Trump was “not a matter of rehearsal.” Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine weighed in on the false claims promoted by the Trump campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Asked about the false claims during an interview with CBS on Wednesday DeWine said: “This is something that came up on the internet, and the internet can be quite crazy sometimes.” Former President Donald Trump repeated the false claim during Tuesday’s debate that had been amplified this week by right-wing media figures and echoed by Republican leaders.   “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump said. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country and it’s a shame.”  In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said: “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” As soon as Donald Trump exited the debate stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night, he immediately began quizzing those waiting in his viewing room about how the last 90 minutes had gone. While several praised him to his face, telling him he did a “great job,” that’s not what many of them are saying privately.  Instead, those around Trump have described what happened on stage as a draw at best and a loss at worst. Several of them told CNN they were stunned that the former president failed to do a better job executing on the talking points he had prepared against Vice President Harris, her record and her policy reversals.  Trump had done more debate prep ahead of his first meeting with Harris than he did for his debate with President Biden earlier this summer, two people told CNN. Yet Trump didn’t make one of his central arguments against Harris — about why she hasn’t carried out the promises she’s making now in the last 3.5 years in office — until his closing argument, surprising many of them who have heard him make the argument in private and on the campaign trail.  Instead, one person conceded, Trump took the bait every single time Harris offered it. While multiple Trump allies described what happened Tuesday night as a “missed opportunity,” they have since started downplaying the debate’s overall significance, arguing it won’t shift his numbers with voters in states like Pennsylvania.  Trump himself was noncommittal about a second debate Wednesday morning, though almost every ally of his who CNN spoke with said they believe he will ultimately agree to one.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged in a Fox News interview Wednesday that while he believed former President Donald Trump won the debate, Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.”  Kennedy predicted the debate may cost Trump support in upcoming polls.  “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.” Kennedy, who dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed Trump, highlighted the exchange on economic policy as “an extraordinary lost opportunity” by the Republican nominee, arguing Trump should have emphasized more strongly the consequences of rising inflation but instead became “distracted.”  Kennedy predicted Trump will see a dip in support in post-debate polling, particularly among independent voters. He also undercut Trump’s claim that rapid reaction polls on the debate universally show he won the debate.  “Polling over the next week is going to show, you know, probably a slight drop in his support, particularly among independents,” he continued.  When asked if he had any reservations about endorsing Trump, Kennedy said he still believes Trump is the better candidate on policy.  “I was listening to the substance, and on the substance, President Trump wins,” he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday she was “proud” of Kamala Harris’ debate performance and hit back at Donald Trump, who name-checked her during Tuesday night’s debate over the January 6, 2021, insurrection. “I was so proud of her,” Pelosi said of Harris, adding that Trump “looked foolish last night. I thought [Harris] looked presidential.” Trump, during the debate, incorrectly claimed that then-Speaker Pelosi was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that she rejected his call to send in the National Guard. Pelosi pointed out Wednesday that the speaker of the House has no authority over the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president. She added that she pleaded with then-President Trump to send in the National Guard “and he never did, until finally he did hours later.” “We’re dependent on the president who has incited the insurrection and refused to send the National Guard,” she said, adding, “You know what? We don’t agonize, we organize. We just us have to win, we have to win big.” Voters and lawmakers are reacting to the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the countdown to Election Day continues in a very tight race. The two candidates came face-to-face for a second time this week at an event commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks Wednesday morning. Here are the key headlines to know: Several House Republicans defended former President Donald Trump’s performance in last night’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting that he was able to communicate his views on the economy, despite moving away from the issues at times. Conservative Rep. Ralph Norman accused the debate of being biased and told CNN’s Manu Raju that Harris did not have to meet high expectations. Norman also baselessly suggested that Harris possibly knew the questions that the moderators would ask ahead of time, but was unable to offer any evidence to back this up. “I think she knew the questions. I think she had her lines rehearsed, but the American people, whatever she says, they’re feeling it at the pump. They’re feeling it, you know, with crime, the policies haven’t worked, she’s been a part of it,” he said. Rep. Anthony D’Esposito a vulnerable New York Republican, praised Trump’s performance and said the former president “did a good job of talking about the issues that matter most to the American people, while Kamala Harris continued to pivot back and forth and spin what it is that she’s trying to portray now.” On the issue of abortion, Rep. John Duarte of California, another vulnerable Republican, argued that Trump “was clear that he wants abortion to be kept in the states,” and didn’t need to explicitly say he is against a national ban. Duarte also said that Trump, “did a great job communicating the economy, communicating inflation being so low under his presidency” and dismissed concerns that Trump focused too much on his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. “I don’t think that’s what voters are voting on. Voters are voting on inflation and opportunity right now, and right now, the American people are seeing out-of-control inflation and their opportunities are falling apart in the job market,” Duarte said. The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks, according to Nielsen data. Tuesday debate in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News and aired across 17 television networks easily surpassed the 51 million who tuned in to the June debate hosted by CNN between Trump and President Joe Biden.  While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year, it represents a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million and Fox News with more than 9 million. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to attend his first campaign event as a Trump surrogate since endorsing the former president last month, according to a news release from the Donald Trump-JD Vance campaign. Kennedy will appear with former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in a moderated discussion at a “Team Trump Reclaim America Tour” event in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. The White House is offering an explanation of a photo circulating that shows President Joe Biden wearing a Trump hat at the firehouse in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, earlier Wednesday. Inside the fire station, Biden briefly donned a Trump hat as an apparent gesture of bipartisan unity. A White House spokesperson said the president was talking about how the country was united in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks and said it needed to return to that. He handed a hat to a man wearing a Trump cap as a gesture, and that man gave Biden his hat to briefly wear, the spokesperson said. Pictures show Biden smiling widely while wearing the hat. Joan London knew when Tuesday’s debate began she would not vote for Donald Trump. But when it ended, she was in a most unfamiliar place: ready to cast her first vote for a Democrat for president. In battleground Pennsylvania, by the way. “Harris clearly won,” said London, an attorney who lives in conservative Berks County. “And I’m now voting for her even though I have many serious policy differences.” London became a Republican when she turned 18, a fan of Ronald Reagan’s brand of conservatism. Earlier this year, she cast a primary vote for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, then switched her registration to independent because she sees Trump as an angry populist. Until this week’s debate in Philadelphia, though, she planned to honor her conservative principles and write in some other Republican. But everything changed when the former president repeatedly refused to say he believed it was critical that the United States stand with Ukraine. Trump said he wanted to end the war, and suggested he could negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine. Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, gave Harris more positive reviews for her debate performance. Several though, significantly, said she was not specific enough in explaining her policy proposals. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, a Haley primary voter who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. Cynthia Sabatini, a Reagan Republican and “never Trump” voter, plans to write in a conservative or vote third party unless Harris wins her over. The vice president did not do so Tuesday night. “She is a good debater,” Sabatini said. “But in my opinion, she needs to answer questions on point.” Specifically, Sabatini said Harris failed out of the gate when asked whether she believed Americans are better off than they were four years ago and again on questions about the border. Read more about what voters had to say about the debate. Taylor Swift’s call to encourage people to register to vote may be having an impact, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that provides government services. It was not immediately clear how many of those visitors registered to vote.  Vote.gov, which is the link Swift shared in her endorsement, is the federal government’s voting registration site run by the GSA. The website directs voters to their individual states and territories to register to vote and provides answers to frequently asked questions. Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post on Tuesday night, Vote.org also saw a huge spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement. A spokesperson for Vote.org told CNN there was a 585% jump in voters on the website between 9 p.m. through midnight ET, during the debate and shortly after Swift’s post endorsing the Harris-Walz campaign.  While voter engagement across the country likely increased also due to the debate, the CEO of Vote.org attributed the spike, in part, to the Taylor effect.  “Taylor Swift’s impact on voter engagement is undeniable,” Andrea Hailey, Vote.org CEO, said in a statement to CNN. The post was updated with more details on the reaction from Vote.org Democratic Sen. Chris Coons praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance in last night’s debate, noting that she was up against a “uniquely difficult” opponent in former President Donald Trump. Asked whether the debate moved the needle at all for voters, Coons argued that it did by mobilizing Harris’ supporters and possibly swaying some undecided voters. “I also think it will move what is a very small number of unpersuaded voters, or voters who’ve gone back and forth,” he said. The senator from Delaware also criticized Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets. “That was a misleading story that had, I would argue, ill intent, that had already been debunked, and was deployed almost on cue by Donald Trump to make what was a fairly vicious anti-migrant slur,” Coons said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a cognitive test to be given to Donald Trump, saying his debate performance Tuesday night left him doubting the former president’s mental acuity. Jeffries pointed to Trump’s echoing of false claims that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating residents’ pet dogs and cats. “It was hard to follow some elements of the debate when the Republican nominee is making up stories about people eating cats and dogs. You can’t make this stuff up,” Jeffries said. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance dismissed the impact of Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Harris, arguing she is a billionaire and is “fundamentally disconnected” from the interests and problems of most Americans.   “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift. When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country,” Vance told Fox News.  Swift signed her endorsement as “Childless Cat Lady,” in obvious reference to Vance’s controversial past comments. Vance said his pitch to women voters is that former president Trump will return public safety and an affordable cost of living. “Donald Trump delivered policies that lower the prices of groceries, lower the prices of housing, and most importantly, Donald Trump delivered public safety in our country,” Vance said.  As the vice presidential debate approaches in October, Vance said he is aiming to be “as well-versed in the policy” as possible. “The way that I think about this is it’s an opportunity,” Vance said. “I get 90 minutes to talk to the American people about how Donald Trump can make their lives better.”  “We’re going to talk about a lot of policy. I’m trying to read and just understand as much as possible, you know, what Tim Walz has done, what policies he supported, and how it’s so different from the prosperity and peace that Donald Trump delivered,” Vance said.  A new ad launched by the Trump campaign on Wednesday features clips of Kamala Harris’ high-profile interview with CNN earlier this month, while slamming the vice president and the Biden administration over inflation. The ad opens with a clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working” — a soundbite frequently referenced in pro-Trump ads — and proceeds to clips of news coverage about inflation, including one from Harris’ CNN interview, in which she is pressed on the cost of living. “When it comes to the economy, groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president,” CNN’s Dana Bash says in the interview clip. The ad’s narrator picks up, “Yet, Harris still says Bidenomics is working. No, it isn’t.” The economy and inflation have been a major point of attack for Trump and his Republican allies, in addition to their emphasis on immigration and crime. Several of the most recent ads from the Trump campaign have focused on prices, including one saying that “Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote that created America’s inflation,” a reference to the party-line vote on the Inflation Reduction Act. The new ad began airing this afternoon in Georgia, and the Trump campaign’s quick deployment of soundbites from Harris’ first major interview since becoming the Democratic nominee underscores the Harris campaign’s cautious approach to press availability, another point of criticism from Republicans.  Former President Donald Trump said his team is still weighing whether he would engage in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, after her team immediately called for a second debate in October.  “I would do NBC. I would do FOX too, but right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do,” Trump said, after visiting the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department in Pennsylvania. “When you don’t win, it’s like a fighter—when a fighter has a bad fight gets knocked out or loses the fight, the first thing he says is we want a rematch. So, we won the debate according to every single poll, every single poll. Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” Trump said. “But we’ll think about it.” CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. As CNN reported this morning, a top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance. Trump said it was “very polite” between him and Harris this morning, who shook hands at the 9/11 commemoration ceremony. “Just, uh, very polite, very polite,” Trump said, when asked what he said to Harris. Several senior Senate Republicans gave former President Donald Trump poor marks for his debate performance last night. Here’s what they said: Others were more critical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz participated in a day of service commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in St. Paul on Wednesday, where he spoke pridefully about Minnesotans coming together in the wake of the tragedy, greeted volunteers and packed donation boxes.   Appearing in his official capacity as Minnesota governor, Kamala Harris’ running mate recalled learning about the attacks on the morning of September 11 in a classroom at Mankato West High School, where Walz taught before entering politics. He said he remembers experiencing “that moment of disbelief” and watching “young faces try and comprehend the horror that was in front of them.” He also reflected positively on the state responding to the tragedy by coming together as a community.  Walz’s remarks were followed by brief remarks from Cindy McGinty, whose husband died in the World Trade Center on September 11 and helped organize a national day of service commemorating the day. Walz then sealed packages of oatmeal and helped put them in boxes to be donated as part of the day of service. Harris, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance are also commemorating the anniversary of the attacks today. All four leaders were in New York on Wednesday for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan. Kamala Harris campaign aides huddled at their Wilmington headquarters Wednesday in the immediate aftermath of the first Harris-Donald Trump debate Tuesday night, strategizing over how best to capitalize on the momentum they felt after the primetime face-off.  But despite the vice president’s team feeling pleased with how the debate went last night – both in terms of what they saw as a strong performance from Harris as well as Trump losing his composure at multiple points – the Harris campaign is emphatic that the debate did not change the trajectory of the race.  Multiple aides tell CNN that post-debate discussions in Wilmington continue to center around the core assumption that Election Day will be extremely close, and that the hardest work remains ahead of them in the weeks to come.   Another aide said from here on out until November, the campaign will continue to operate as though the Harris-Trump race is a 50-50 race.  As for Tuesday night’s debate, the campaign is plotting ways to amplify Trump’s answers that they believed were most substantively problematic. Those answers, aides said, include the former president’s refusal to take a position on a national abortion ban as well as his comments on the January 6 riot. After receiving Taylor Swift’s endorsement Tuesday night, the Kamala Harris campaign quickly began selling “Harris-Walz friendship bracelets” in tribute to the mega star.  Those bracelets have quickly sold out, aides tell CNN. The campaign store page for the “pack of two adjustable, waterproof bracelets with clay beads” — going for $20 each — currently displays a message that the bracelets have in fact sold out.  The campaign says it is taking pre-orders with the next expected release date of September 24. More on Swift’s endorsement: Shortly after Trump’s debate with Harris, Swift wrote on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” she said. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Trump reaction: The Trump campaign responded to Swift’s endorsement of Harris, saying that it is “more evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite.” “President Trump will fight for the American worker, the struggling family who can’t afford groceries and gas, and the angel families who have lost loved ones due to Kamala’s open border policy. Taylor Swift may not understand those problems but President Trump does,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. This post has been updated with reactions from the Trump campaign. The top election officials from six states testified Wednesday on Capitol Hill about efforts torun a clean and fair election, as some of the first ballots for the 2024 presidential election are being mailed out.  The six officials – three Republicans and three Democrats – stressed that the election season is already in full swing, with tens of millions of voters expected to cast early ballots before Election Day in November.  But sharp partisan divides were also on full display. Some Republicans raised fears about widespread voting by non-citizens, even though that doesn’t happen in US elections. And Democrats blamed former President Donald Trump for threatening the safety of election workers by peddling the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, acknowledged that it’s “rare” for non-citizens to cast ballots — a break from Trump and other right-wing influencers like Elon Musk, who claim this phenomenon is swamping the country, and have used this lie to question the legitimacy of the 2024 results before any ballots have even been cast.  LaRose said his office caught about 600 instances last year of non-citizens registering to vote, in a state where nearly 6 million people voted in the 2020 presidential race.   Prodded by GOP lawmakers, the Democratic election officials agreed that non-citizens and undocumented immigrants shouldn’t vote in federal elections. They pointed out that this is already illegal, it happens rarely, and it is easily caught because of the extensive paper trail in voter registration.  Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, accused Republicans of spreading “paranoia around a fake problem.” He said that in his time as an election official, he has seen how these attempts to stop non-citizens from voting actually end up disenfranchising thousands of eligible voters.  “I take no pride in the idea that we have denied eligible citizens the right to vote, in far greater numbers than we would have prevented the vanishingly rare non-citizen voting is alleged to be happening across the United States of America,” Fontes said.  It’s not one election, but 51, that pick the US president. Every state and the District of Columbia has its own rules and deadlines for voting and for counting votes. The first voting officially was already supposed to be underway with mail-in ballots in the key state of North Carolina, but that process was delayed by courts that ruled ballots must be reprinted without the option of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Absentee ballots are now officially available in Alabama, although, somewhat ironically, it is a state that discourages early voting. Others will follow in the weeks to come. When do voting by mail and early voting start? Most states will not offer mail-in ballots until later in September or October. The next firm date on the calendar is September 19, when ballots are supposed to be available in the key state of Wisconsin. For all states, ballots must begin to be sent to military and overseas voters by September 21. Each state has its own rules and deadlines for how and when to request a mail-in ballot and by when those ballots must be returned. In some states, mail ballots must be in the hands of election officials before polls close, but others will count ballots that arrive after Election Day if they were postmarked earlier. Washington, for instance, is one of the handful of states that conducts nearly all of its voting entirely by mail and will accept a mail-in ballot until results are certified in late November so long as it is postmarked by Election Day. Early voting may also be done in person in most states, but that process does not get underway until later in September. Widespread early voting will begin on September 20 in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia. For specifics on your state, visit CNN’s Voter Handbook, which has the dates for every state. And read more here about voting in the 2024 election. Several Senate Democrats expressed concern about the tightness of the presidential race, despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance in Tuesday night’s debate. He added, “The electoral college/popular mismatch is getting more significant, rather than less significant,” noting that the swing states are “all very, very close,” and said that they have to win by a large enough margin that they can easily dismiss claims by former president Donald Trump that the election is rigged. “You want to win big to overcome the electoral college effect. You want to win big so that every reasonable person knows you won, and his lonely complaints about, that he should have won are really just lonely,” said Kaine. Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, also said that he is concerned about the closeness of the race. “This race is going to come down to, you know, just a few 1,000 votes probably,” he said. “Everybody is all hands-on deck. Everybody is. We have a campaign that’s not taking any vote for granted,” he added. What the latest polling shows: Harris averages 49% support across recent polls while Trump stands at 48%, according to the latest CNN Poll of Polls. That average suggests no clear leader in the race just eight weeks until Election Day. The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the six most recent non-partisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards and ask about a 2024 presidential general election between Harris and Trump. Meanwhile, CNN polls across six battlegrounds found Georgia and Pennsylvania are key toss-ups. Senate Republican Whip John Thune said on Wednesday it would be “prudent” for Donald Trump to talk about the future and not continue to say that the 2020 election was stolen, a baseless fraud claim that the former president repeated in the presidential debate Tuesday.  Asked if Trump took Harris’s bait during the debate, such as when she challenged the size of Trump’s rallies, Thune downplayed the impact the debate will have on voters.   “I just think the debate isn’t going to change much and she still has to answer for her record,” he said. Thune said he and most Senate Republicans support Ukraine in in its war with Russia when he was asked about Trump’s refusal to say if Ukraine should win. “My position is that we want Ukraine to win the war. For sure. I will let him speak for his position but we had 32 out of 49 Republicans who voted to support Ukraine in their efforts to defeat the Russians,” he said. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, a former GOP presidential nominee himself, said he’s concerned that former President Donald Trump refused to say that Ukraine should win the war against Russia during Tuesday night’s presidential debate. Romney also said that he doesn’t think the debate will move the needle. “There are a few exceptions to that, but in last night’s debate I thought President Trump prosecuted his case as he wanted to. I think the Vice President was able to demonstrate that people’s questions about could she answer questions from the media or not, those were answered well. She spoke well and clearly, and I think she prosecuted her case as well,” he told CNN. Romney, a frequent critic of Trump, called the debate a “classic President Trump performance,” and added that Harris was able to introduce herself to the American people. “Most people didn’t know her terribly well, other than a few clips that that were not flattering that you might see on the internet,” said Romney. “And people saw, ‘Oh, actually, she’s an intelligent, capable person who has a point of view on issues,’ and she demonstrated that time and again.” The Utah Republican said it was “no surprise” that the baseless claims about Haitian migrants eating pets came from Trump, adding that the former president should “just stick to the issues.” Several Republicans refused to discuss the debate, including Sen. Todd Young, who has refused to back Trump. “I’ll talk to you after the election,” he said. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance visited firefighters at Engine Company 4 Ladder Company 15 in New York City, where they stayed for about 45 minutes. They came to the station after the 9/11 commemoration ceremony held at Ground Zero.  Trump and Vance moved their way through the station, shaking hands, taking pictures and visiting with people. They all took a group photo with Trump and Vance standing in the middle with a large FDNY sign behind them. Trump waved to reporters across the street. He raised his fist and gave a thumbs up.  Five Danish firefighters were at the fire station “to show some respect for the firefighters,” Kasper Hinge said. “The first thing he said was who are these good-looking guys or good-looking gentlemen,” Hinge, one of the firefighters told CNN about their interaction with Trump. “Then we told him that we were firefighters from Denmark and he looked me in the eyes and said, ‘oh, your country has other problems,’” he said. “Then he left, and I’m not sure what he meant about it.” Hinge said he was a little starstruck by Trump’s visit but “we’re not that much into American politicians.” Asked if they believe foreign leaders are laughing at Trump, as Vice President Harris said during the debate on Tuesday night, another firefighter said, “Some might.” Specifically in Denmark, another said, “I don’t think so, because you know it’s one of the most powerful people in the world.” Vance departed about 10 minutes before Trump, who stayed and talked with more people.  Right-wing activist Laura Loomer stood outside on the side of the fire station with Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. She was seen getting off the Trump plane in Philadelphia Tuesday before the debate. This post has been updated with details from the Danish firefighters. Voting for the 2024 general election officially begins today as absentee ballots start going out in Alabama.  Eligible voters can also now request and cast an absentee ballot in person.  In Alabama, voters must have a valid excuse to vote absentee (either by mail or in person) so a relatively small number of ballots are cast that way.  The voting season was supposed to start last Friday with mail ballots going out in North Carolina, but that process is delayed as the state reprints ballots after the state supreme court ruled officials must remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name. Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in a virtual coin toss before their presidential debate – but that’s about all he won. From the opening moments Tuesday night, when the vice president strode over to Trump’s podium and all but forced him to shake her hand, she dictated the terms of their critical clash exactly eight weeks before Election Day. From Harris’ point of view, the night could hardly have gone better. She came across as fresh and energetic and brimmed with a positive future vision. Trump glowered and ranted and blasted America as a failing nation and seemed off his game. The vice president, who has sometimes struggled in spontaneous situations, delivered the most imposing performance of her political career. Trump, who had gone into the debate predicting he’d prove boxing champ Mike Tyson’s maxim that “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,” was himself stunned by multiple jabs and landed few in return. At a time when nearly a third of voters suggested in one recent poll that they wanted to know more about Harris, the vice president’s performance seemed more likely to expand her coalition. Trump, meanwhile, didn’t make much effort to change perceptions about his dystopian intentions among the key swing state voters who will decide the election. While it’s too early to say whether Harris’ performance will translate into new momentum, her campaign will be optimistic that she’s improved her chances among, perhaps, 200,000 movable voters who will decide the next election in a handful of states. Read the full analysis. Oil prices are near three-year lows. Gas prices are sinking below $3 in many parts of America. So why were Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump talking so much about expanding oil production during Tuesday night’s debate? Harris, criticized for her previous stance against fracking, noted that she represented the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to open new fracking leases in 2022. Though Harris also repeatedly touted her support for clean energy solutions, she correctly acknowledged that under the Biden administration, the United States has been producing more oil than any country has in history. Meanwhile, Trump, who supports a rapid expansion of oil production, attacked Harris for policy proposals that he said would decimate America’s fossil fuel business: “If she won the election, the day after that election, they’ll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead. Fossil fuel will be dead,” Trump said. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN in a phone interview on Wednesday that he’s “not at all concerned” about the fossil fuel industry getting destroyed because Americans still rely on oil for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. For all the candidates’ talk of promoting fossil fuel production, it’s not clear that America needs drastically more oil. (And climate scientists say that’s the exact opposite of what the planet needs). US crude prices settled below $66 a barrel Tuesday, their lowest level since December 2021, before bouncing back a bit Wednesday. Gas prices are at a six-month low, according to AAA. Meanwhile, OPEC+, a group of major oil-producing nations, is so worried about excessive supply and weak demand in China that it delayed plans to ramp up production. US oil production has already spiked to a record of 13.4 million barrels per day, according to weekly federal data. Lipow said it would be “difficult” to get US output dramatically above 14 million barrels per day because all of the most efficient and cheapest places have already been drilled. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, is also skeptical that US output can spike. “As a rule, the president doesn’t have the power to quickly ramp up US oil production. The industry operates all out,” said McNally, who served as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush. After closing statements, former President Donald Trump spoke for about 42 minutes and 52 seconds, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for about 37 minutes and 36 seconds. While the debate was designed to offer both candidates an equal chance to respond to questions, they could choose not to use the maximum allotted time. The moderators also allowed more time for responses after some exchanges. Here’s how long each candidate used: Watch CNN’s Daniel Dale fact-check claims made by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during an ABC News presidential debate. Winning a debate hardly guarantees winning an election, but North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he believes Kamala Harris will move the needle in his battleground state after her strong showing in Philadelphia. The vice president’s answers on protecting abortion rights and health care, Cooper said, could be key to bolstering Democratic efforts to deliver the state in a presidential race for the first time since 2008.  “She was really strong on health care,” Cooper told CNN after the debate. “Donald Trump would take it all away, don’t let him fool you.” Cooper, who has known Harris for nearly two decades, said he was surprised Trump took the bait on the size of his crowds and more. “For sure,” Cooper said. “I think she knew that this was a vulnerability of his, but to just become completely unraveled, unhinged and incoherent shows why he should not be president of the United States.” Former President Donald Trump laid into ABC News on Wednesday morning after his rocky debate performance, stating the network should have its broadcast license revoked. ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump throughout Tuesday night’s presidential debate, quickly correcting the record for millions watching at home after the Republican pushed falsehoods on abortion, migrants and the 2020 election. “It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be because when you looked the fact they were correcting everything and not correcting with her,” Trump said Wednesday. The former president also suggested, without evidence, that Vice President Kamala Harris was provided the debate questions in advance. Trump ultimately delivered more than 30 false claims during the debate, CNN’s preliminary count found, while Harris shared just one false claim, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt called last night’s debate “a big success for President Trump.” Leavitt deferred to Trump when asked about the potential for more debates, telling CNN News Central host John Berman, “all of the debates that we have announced on this campaign — and there have been many of them — have come from President Trump directly, so I will let him make an announcement on this front.” “I haven’t talked to the president since he made those remarks,” she said. Leavitt rejected a suggestion from Berman that Vice President Kamala Harris got under Trump’s skin during the debate, saying, “I don’t think that happened at all.” She criticized the ABC News debate moderators, as the former president and other campaign surrogates have done since last night. When asked about Trump’s assertion that he will produce a health care plan “in the not too distant future,” Leavitt said, “I don’t have a date for you this morning, but I’ll definitely get back to you with one as soon as I can.” She later added that Trump’s plan is based on the “free market” in contrast to “Kamala Harris’ radical healthcare plan,” which she called “socialism.” Philippe Reines, the former Hillary Clinton aide who portrayed former President Donald Trump during debate prep with Kamala Harris, shared a photo of his costume and make-up from the run throughs. In the picture, he wears a long red tie and a full face of bronzer, keeping with his method-acting style of debate prep.  In a tweet, he wrote that it was time for a “facial,” a “haircut” and a “spiritual cleanse.” Can I vote early? What deadlines should I know about? Do I need to show an ID? Voters will soon start casting ballots for the 2024 presidential election as in-person, early voting is set to begin in several states later this month.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off on facts, dueled on policy and traded barbs during the presidential debate hosted by ABC News on Tuesday, in which Trump also veered off on a tangent about immigrants eating pets. Here are 27 quotes to understand what happened during their showdown in Philadelphia: This comes from the middle of the debate, but it is perhaps the most important line because this debate was, in every possible way, different than the one between Trump and President Joe Biden in June. That debate eventually ended Biden’s reelection campaign. This one gave Harris an opportunity to laugh at Trump, tell him he was weak and get under his skin in multiple ways. He’s talking here about Harris’ “opportunity economy” plan, but it is a line, replete with insult, that expresses Trump’s theme for the night – which was to tie Harris to Biden and also make her appear to be too willing to change her policy proposals. Read 25 more quotes from the debate here. Vice President Kamala Harris has condemned the killing of American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was killed at a protest last week in the occupied West Bank, and offered sharp rhetoric aimed at the Israel Defense Forces. Harris called Eygi’s death a “horrific tragedy that never should have happened.” Harris also called for “full accountability.” CNN has asked Harris’ office if she plans to reach out to her family. Earlier on Wednesday, President Joe Biden also said he was “outraged” by Eygi’s death and said Israel must “do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.” Harris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe offered a roadmap of some of the key moments from former President Donald Trump at Tuesday’s debate that the Harris team plans to harness in the days ahead.  Those moments include Trump’s comments on healthcare: On abortion: Trump recently said he would not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida, where abortion is now illegal in most cases after six weeks. The ballot measure that Florida voters will take up this fall would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy. And on Ukraine: Plouffe told CNN’s John Berman that those are “three key moments we’ll see a lot about in the coming days and weeks.” Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris shook hands after arriving for the 9/11 memorial ceremony on Wednesday morning. The handshake comes in the wake of the two presidential candidates meeting face-to-face for the first time last night at ABC News’ historic presidential debate, where they traded barbs over inflation, abortion, immigration and foreign policy. The two shook hands last night at the debate, too. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have arrived at Ground Zero, according to pool reporters. Biden and Harris will honor the solemn 9/11 terror attacks anniversary at each of the 9/11 memorial sites today and are not expected to deliver formal remarks, but will interact with families of the fallen. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance arrived at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, where they are attending the 9/11 commemoration ceremony at Ground Zero.  Trump will also travel to Shanksville later today, according to a source familiar with his plans. Wall Street sure is acting like Donald Trump lost the debate Tuesday night. Investors swiftly penalized Trump’s social media business following the former president’s widely panned debate performance. Other so-called Trump trades, including bitcoin and Coinbase, went into reverse Wednesday, while bonds and Asian currencies rallied. And some funds that own solar and other clean energy stocks rose sharply. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plunged 10% in premarket trading Wednesday, leaving them on pace to open at the lowest level since the Truth Social owner went public in late March. The sharp selloff represents an immediate reaction to the ABC presidential debate, where Vice President Kamala Harris successfully threw Trump off his game. It’s the exact opposite of the reaction in Trump Media’s share price on June 28 after President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance in the CNN debate. Trump Media initially spiked 10% that day, before fizzling and ending in the red. ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Donald Trump during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, quickly correcting the record for millions watching at home after the Republican pushed falsehoods on abortion, migrants and the 2020 election. The decision to live fact-check the candidates during the high-stakes telecast marked a departure from recent debates and stood in contrast to the first presidential matchup of the 2024 season, hosted by CNN and moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. During the June debate, the moderators did not correct false claims made by Trump and President Joe Biden. Instead, the network provided a fact check online and on television following the telecast.  Ahead of Tuesday night’s debate in Philadelphia, ABC News did not commit to live fact-checking, but as the event got underway both anchors stepped in to debunk false claims made by Trump on at least three occasions.  Roughly 20 minutes into the debate, the former president claimed Democrats have advocated for abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy or were in favor of “executing” babies “after birth,” pushing a notorious and often-repeated false claim. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, has said “execution after birth is OK,” Trump falsely claimed. Moderator Linsey Davis immediately corrected the record on the abortion issue. “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,” she said. Later in the debate, Trump falsely claimed migrants in Ohio were killing pets and eating them, repeating a debunked claim that had been amplified this week by right-wing media figures and echoed by Republican leaders.  “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump said. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country and it’s a shame.” Muir quickly corrected Trump on the claim. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he didn’t know if he wanted to debate Vice President Kamala Harris again as he claimed he “won the debate.” Trump said if Fox News were to moderate a debate, he “wouldn’t want” Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier as moderators because he didn’t think “were good last night,” as he apparently referenced their on-air reactions to his and Harris’ debate.  Trump had previously agreed to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News with MacCallum and Baier moderating. Harris had not accepted that invitation from Fox.  “I wouldn’t want to have Martha and Bret. I’d love to have somebody else other than Martha and Bret. I’d love to have, frankly, Sean [Hannity] or Jesse [Watters] or Laura [Ingraham], you know, somebody else. Let’s give other people a shot,” he said. Trump baselessly suggested Harris was provided the questions in advance of the ABC presidential debate as he claimed the debate was “rigged.” “They had a rigged show with somebody that maybe even had the answers, I mean, I’ll be honest, I watched her talk, and I said, you know, she seems awfully familiar with the questions,” Trump said.  Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday cast Taylor Swift as a “very liberal person” who “seems to always endorse a Democrat” after the music superstar said she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Shortly after Trump’s debate with Harris Tuesday evening, Swift wrote on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” she said. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller repeatedly stressed that Donald Trump has already committed to additional presidential debates but refused to definitively say whether the Republican nominee would participate with NBC News on September 25 – instead arguing that the “onus” is on Kamala Harris to “quit playing games” and “she won’t show up.” “I thought this was a bit perplexing because President Trump has already said that he is going to do three debates,” Miller told Kasie Hunt on CNN This Morning. “We had the September 4 debate, which was going to be on Fox, and Kamala Harris was a no show. We had last night. And President Trump already said that on September 25, we would do a debate on NBC.” He continued, “But now Kamala Harris seems to have memory holed that and rather than just saying, we’ll see you on September 25 on NBC, is now throwing out some fictional day in October.” “So very clearly, we’re going to have to go back to the drawing board,” Miller added. The Trump campaign senior adviser argued that the Harris campaign is calling for another debate because the Democratic nominee did not effectively break from President Joe Biden or explain why she hasn’t achieved her legislative goals over the past three and a half years she has been in office. Pressed on Trump’s decision to stand by a baseless conspiracy about Haitian migrants eating pets at last night’s debate, Miller pointed viewers to “Federalist.com” for proof and argued that it was “three-on-one” – Harris and the ABC News debate moderators versus Trump. Under the rules of Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the candidates’ microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak. The pool reporter in the debate hall in Philadelphia was able to hear some of what was said when their mics were muted. When Trump claimed that Democrats want abortion access in the ninth month, Harris said, “That’s not true.” When Trump said he was a leader on in vitro fertilization, Harris said, “You have not.” When Trump made the debunked claim about migrants in Ohio eating pets, Harris responded: “What? That is unbelievable.” When Harris said Trump “doesn’t have a plan for you,” the former president responded: “That’s just a soundbite. They gave her that to say.” A top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Vice President Kamala Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance.  Pressed by Hunt on whether she was willing to debate in October but not September, Fulks said that the “two campaigns are going to have to agree on a date,” declining to commit.  He said that a second debate would “absolutely” allow Harris to continue to introduce herself to voters, but suggested that she is doing that in battleground states as she kicks off another tour.  Harris, he added, is “going to be out and about doing interviews.” “We know that that is a part, and we want to make sure that we are speaking to the press. But look – we have 50-something days here. Our priority has to be the American voters… And over the next several weeks, we have to campaign,” he said.  Moments after Tuesday night’s debate ended, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon issued a statement calling for “a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?” Fulks said the campaign is “honored” to have Taylor Swift’s endorsement.  “We’re honored that somebody who has a platform like that would use their voice to speak out on that,” he said. Registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate are closely divided over which candidate better understands the problems facing people like them, according to a CNN poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, with 44% saying Harris does and 40% picking Trump.  That marks a shift in Harris’ favor from prior to the debate, when 43% said Trump had a better understanding of their problems while 39% said Harris did.  But voters who tuned in give Trump a 20-point advantage over Harris after the debate on handling the economy, 55% to 35% – a margin that’s slightly wider than before they took the stage in Philadelphia. The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 6 points likelier to be Republican-aligned than Democratic-aligned, making for an audience that’s about 4 percentage points more GOP-leaning than all registered voters nationally. An 82% majority of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate say it didn’t affect their choice for president. Another 14% said it made them reconsider but didn’t change their minds, with 4% saying it changed their minds about whom to vote for. Debate watchers who supported Trump prior to Tuesday night were modestly more likely than those who supported Harris to say the debate had left them reconsidering. Methodology: The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 605 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Tuesday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the debate and were selected via a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of debate watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points. Taylor Swift has said she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Read the full story. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks today with visits to each of the three sites that were hit. Harris will join Biden for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan this morning. The duo will then travel to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Flight 93 memorial. Later in the afternoon, they will travel to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, for another wreath-laying ceremony. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, are scheduled to appear at Ground Zero, too. Trump will also travel to Shanksville today, according to a source familiar with his plans. It’s unclear whether the two parties will cross paths. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president, will also attend an event to commemorate the anniversary. His office did not say where the event will take place. Most voters in a CNN focus group in Erie, Pennsylvania, say they thought Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential debate on Tuesday. The group of 13 voters had not yet decided on who to vote for before the debate. When CNN’s Phil Mattingly asked the group who won the debate, eight voters said Harris won the showdown. Mattingly noted that Erie is “the swingiest county” in the battleground state. One voter said Harris was “more optimistic” and “more respectful” and could describe her plans more effectively. But another voter, who said she felt Donald Trump won the debate, said she thought the former president is the candidate that could improve things like inflation and the economy. One critical moment of the debate the voters reacted to was when Trump and Harris debated about abortion rights. One voter responded positively to Harris’ answer because the vice president’s “impassioned response” resonated with her. She said she still had a favorable reaction to the moment even though she said she doesn’t agree with all of the vice president’s positions on the issue. Another voter said that although she also doesn’t agree with Harris’ stance on abortion, she thought it was “nice to see the passion and believability that she stands behind and then have something to gauge more of what she says on since she hasn’t spoken a lot, solidly about a lot of issues.” On Trump’s strongest moment, one voter, who is a veteran, said he felt like the former president’s remarks about the Afghanistan withdrawal were strong. Kamala Harris on Tuesday night baited Donald Trump for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate — and the former president took every bit of it. The vice president had prepared extensively for their debate, and peppered nearly every answer with a comment designed to enrage the former president. Trump was often out of control. He loudly and repeatedly insisted that a whole host of falsehoods were true. The former president repeated lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. He parroted a conspiracy theory about immigrants eating pets, and lied about Democrats supporting abortions after babies are born – which is murder, and illegal everywhere. Here are some takeaways from the debate: A turning point when Harris jabs Trump over the size of his rally crowds: Harris came onstage with a clear plan: Throw Trump off his game. It was, by any measure, a dramatic success. When the vice president mentioned Trump’s criminal conviction and outstanding legal issues, he bit. When she called him out for sinking a bipartisan immigration bill, he bit harder. And when Harris suggested Trump’s rallies were boring, he nearly choked on the bait. Rather than engage on the issues raised by the moderators, including a few that Trump considers some of his political strengths, the former president went on at length about the entertainment value of his rallies, claims the Biden administration was legally targeting him and, in a long, bizarre spell, insisted – against all available evidence, that migrants were eating Americans’ pets. Trump indulges in conspiracy theories: Despite signals from even his running mate, Trump did not refrain from repeating the conspiracy theory du jour during the debate. The former president brought up the unfounded conspiracy theory that migrants from Haiti living in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people’s cats and dogs. He said at one point that “in Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of people who live there.” When ABC moderator David Muir pointed out that city officials have denied any evidence that migrants in Springfield were eating pets, Trump doubled down, saying that “the people on television” were saying it. When pressed, Trump just said, “We’ll find out.” When the debate moved to crime, Trump claimed that crime was up in the United States contrary to the rest of the world. There too Muir pointed out that, according to FBI data, crime had declined in the past few years. Fierce argument over abortion, a key issue for both candidates: The vice president, who has long been one the administration’s strongest surrogates on reproductive rights, was able to respond to the former president’s defense of his abortion policy in a way Joe Biden was not. The former president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court judges who voted to overturn federal abortion protections, has sought to moderate his stance on the issue by criticizing six-week abortion bans and reiterating his support for exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But he has also defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Read more takeaways from Harris and Trump’s first debate."
Congress will get increased federal security on Jan. 6 for first election certification since US Capitol attack | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:27 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-12T01:04:21.537Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/increased-federal-security-january-6-election-certification/index.html,"When members of Congress meet on Capitol Hill to certify the electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election, the process, on the anniversary of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, will have the full weight of the federal government behind its security. The certification process on January 6, 2025, was designated as a national special security event by the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in the last week following a request from Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, according to the US Secret Service. The designation is reserved for significant events – including the Super Bowl, presidential inaugurations and this summer’s NATO summit – where security is required on a mass scale. Security for these events include a heightened level of officers on the ground, broader security perimeters and the implementation of technology to detect potential material used in weapons of mass destruction. The FBI will also be involved in monitoring for any threats around the event in the months prior. The Secret Service, which manages the security operations for events under the NSSE designation, announced the decision Wednesday, noting that various congressional reports, including from the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack, had recommended the designation. The Washington Post first reported on the designation. US Capitol Police have been planning for the 2025 certification ever since the attack on the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump in 2020, with a more significant focus – including meetings and other planning exercises – over the last year, one source familiar with the planning told CNN. Over 140 officers were injured during the Capitol riot, according to officials, and the US Attorney in DC has charged more than 1,500 people so far with crimes related to with the attack. The Capitol Police Inauguration Task Force, which also handles security planning for January 6, had already been in the process of sharing security plans with law enforcement partners including DC’s Metropolitan Police Department and has now begun sharing those plans with federal partners as well, the source told CNN. The source told CNN that agencies are still in the early stages of determining the security measures that will be in place for the Electoral College certification. “National Special Security Events are events of the highest national significance,” Eric Ranaghan, the special agent in charge of the USSS Dignitary Protective Division, said in a statement announcing the designation. Ranaghan continued: “The U.S. Secret Service, in collaboration with our federal, state, and local partners are committed to developing and implementing a comprehensive and integrated security plan to ensure the safety and security of this event and its participants.”"
"67 million watched first Harris-Trump debate, blowing past Biden matchup | CNN Business","Updated 9:54 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T23:15:07.922Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/media/debate-ratings-abc-trump-harris-2024-election/index.html,"The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks — blowing well past the 51 million who watched the Republican nominee take on President Joe Biden in June. Tuesday night’s 90-minute matchup in Philadelphia hosted by ABC marked the first time Harris and Trump had met face-to-face, resulting in a high-stakes clash over abortion, immigration and the 2020 election results. Interest in the new Democratic candidate and how she would fare against the former president helped boost interest in the telecast. The viewership easily surpassed the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden hosted by CNN, a face-off that ultimately led to Biden’s withdrawal from the race and Harris’ ascendancy. While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year for a non-sports event, it represented a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC, which hosted the debate, drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million, and Fox News with more than 9 million. The debate was the most-watched on any network in at least 16 years with more than 7 million tuning in on the various Disney-owned streaming platforms, ABC said. While the presidential debates have for decades been held by the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, the candidates bucked tradition this year, agreeing to debates held directly by television news outlets. During Tuesday night’s debate, moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump in real-time, correcting the record at least three times as millions watched at home, drawing fierce backlash from Trump and his allies. Following the broadcast, Trump assailed the network over the fact-checks, calling ABC “the most dishonest news organization, and that’s saying a lot.” The former president, who made at least 33 false claims during the debate, repeatedly insisted the event “was three on one” and suggested Disney’s FCC broadcast licenses should be revoked due to the moderators’ conduct. In the days leading up to the faceoff, Disney pulled its ABC-owned stations from DirecTV, the nation’s third largest pay TV provider, in a bitter and protracted carriage dispute that’s forced ESPN, FX and other networks go dark on the satellite carrier’s lineup. Hours before the telecast, ABC offered to provide DirecTV a free feed of the broadcast for a three-hour period. But the carrier rejected the offer, saying it would only sow confusion and its subscribers could watch the debate on other networks."
Analysis: The long and complex political legacy of 9/11 | CNN Politics,"Published 8:58 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-12T00:58:24.078Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/9-11-political-legacy-2024-election-analysis/index.html,"At least there’s one thing that’s sacred. In a show of unity that lasted barely longer than a moment of silence, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump suspended political hostilities and stood together at Ground Zero in Manhattan Tuesday, marking the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks in 2001. Trump and Harris — who had not met until Tuesday night at their fiery debate – even shook hands for the second time in less than 24 hours. That gesture was apparently orchestrated by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance was there too, wearing a dark blue suit, white shirt and scarlet tie to match Trump’s signature outfit. For a few nostalgic seconds, the commemoration ceremony evoked the now-forgotten national coming together in the horrific days of grief and shock following the attacks. 9/11 is now far enough in the past that it’s taking on a historic hue. But for anyone who lived through it, those days remain visceral. The pain never ebbs for those who lost loved ones in the twin towers of the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, on the four fuel-laden planes turned into weapons by al Qaeda terrorists or those whose relatives perished in the post-9/11 wars. A chance glance at a clock reading 8:46 a.m., the moment the first plane hit the North Tower on a crisp September morning in New York, can bring memories of an early 21st century day that will live in infamy flooding back. The gathering of past, present and future US leaders Tuesday was a reminder of the still unfolding cascade of political consequences triggered by the attacks. The subsequent bloody overseas wars initiated by the George W. Bush administration after the attacks contributed to the public fatigue and loss of trust in government institutions that Trump was able to exploit in his own rise to power. Many of the US soldiers who served multiple tours and died in the global war on terror were reservists from small town America, or what’s now become Trump country. And two decades after the US invasion of Afghanistan, the war is at the center of another presidential campaign as Harris and Trump trade blame over the chaotic US withdrawal in 2021 and a political controversy rages over the deaths of 13 US service personnel at Kabul airport. A chain of unlikely political ramifications can also be traced to the attacks. But for the collapse in Bush’s support after the wars turned into quagmires, there may have been no lane for a young Illinois senator, Barack Obama, who opposed the Iraq war, to become president. In some ways, Trump’s presidency was born out of backlash to the first Black president. And Biden probably wouldn’t have been president without Trump and the chaos he caused. Had Biden not been called back to serve at his advanced age, there’d probably be no opening for his vice president, Harris, to run this year after the president folded his reelection bid amid public concern about his acuity. Vance, who served in Iraq as a combat correspondent, is meanwhile, the first of the post-9/11 generation of enlistees on a major party presidential ticket. Nearly a quarter century on, a renewed Great Power struggle has replaced terrorism as the most prominent geopolitical threat. Osama bin Laden has been dead for more than 13 years. And, underscoring the passage of time, some young voters born after 9/11 will this year vote in their second presidential election. But the world’s worst terror attack still has a powerful psychological and political half-life and is embedded deep in America’s soul, as we are reminded every September."
How Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Harris matters | CNN Politics,"Published 8:28 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-12T00:28:53.389Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html,"It was the Instagram endorsement read ‘round the world: Pop superstar Taylor Swift backs Kamala Harris for president. Swift’s post also directed her followers to register to vote. Swift’s support for Harris and voter registration will likely have some impact, but not as much as some would hope. That said, Harris and the Democratic Party are struggling with young voters and voter registration, so they’ll take any help they can get. Let’s start out with what we know about Swift’s post. More than 330,000 people were redirected to Vote.gov from Swift’s Instagram, as of 2 p.m. Wednesday, according to the General Services Administration, which runs the website. An examination of Google trends revealed a spike in searches for voter registration after Swift’s post, a Washington Post analysis found. We know there was an increase in registrations when Swift made a similar post imploring people to register to vote in 2023. Voter registrations went up by 23% that day compared with the same time the year before. That equated to 35,252 voter registrations in total nationally. These really aren’t large numbers. Let’s assume that all of the people who clicked on Swift’s Vote.gov link have registered to vote. That would amount to about 0.2% of the 2020 turnout. Of course, only a portion of those who clicked on the link will actually register and then actually turn out. And the potential Swift bump comes as registered Republicans have been closing the gap with registered Democrats in several key states over the past few years. Take a look at the most recent data on voter registration reported by government officials in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania – all battlegrounds that allow voters to register by party. Republicans have widened the margin in Arizona and closed the gap with Democrats significantly in other states since September 2020 – picking up anywhere from from more than 60,000 active voters in Nevada to nearly 400,000 active voters in Pennsylvania. The voter registration spikes we have seen historically from Swift endorsement drives would not be enough to make up these GOP gains. Now Swift could help Harris among those already planning to vote. She sported a 52% favorable rating among likely voters in a Grinnell College/Selzer poll published earlier this year. Her unfavorable rating was just 32%. That makes for a net favorability rating of +20 points. A Fox News poll from last year showed the same thing. While she may not be universally popular, she’s far more popular than most politicians. Harris and former President Donald Trump have net favorability ratings of closer to 0 points and -10 points, respectively. Younger “Swifties” could also be helpful to Harris. The vice president is currently struggling, relatively speaking, with younger voters. A recent average of national polls finds her winning voters under the age of 30 by 15 points. That’s better than President Joe Biden was doing when he dropped out of the race in July, but not overly so. Biden was up by 7 points. Both Harris and Biden have done worse among young voters this year compared with where Biden was in September 2020. Back then, Biden held a 25-point lead among young voters. That edge would grow to 29 points by the final 2020 pre-election surveys. Swift, on her own, won’t be able to eliminate that entire gap. Remember: She couldn’t translate her first big political endorsement (Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate in 2018) into success at the ballot box. Bredesen lost by double digits. But there is no doubt that Swift is an asset to Harris and Democrats, even if it is just on the margins. We’re talking about an election that is currently neck-in-neck in the national and battleground state polls. Getting a few voters over to the Democrats and Harris could just be enough."
"The debate didn’t sway some voters CNN talked to, but others know exactly who they’re backing now | CNN Politics","Updated 6:41 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T22:04:58.707Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/debate-reaction-persuadable-voters/index.html,"Joan London knew when Tuesday’s debate began she would not vote for Donald Trump. But when it ended, she was in a most unfamiliar place: ready to cast her first vote for a Democrat for president. In battleground Pennsylvania, by the way. “Harris clearly won,” said London, an attorney who lives in conservative Berks County. “And I’m now voting for her even though I have many serious policy differences.” London became a Republican when she turned 18, a fan of Ronald Reagan’s brand of conservatism. Earlier this year, she cast a primary vote for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, then switched her registration to independent because she sees Trump as an angry populist. Until this week’s debate in Philadelphia, though, she planned to honor her conservative principles and write in some other Republican. But everything changed when the former president repeatedly refused to say he believed it was critical that the United States stand with Ukraine. Trump said he wanted to end the war, and suggested he could negotiate a peace between Russia and Ukraine. “Conservatives do not negotiate with communist dictators who invade other countries,” London said in a post-debate text. “It will take Trump losing decisively to reform the GOP, and I will be back when that happens.” London is one of more the 70 voters across 10 states who are part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states or are part of critical voting blocs. Her decision to back Vice President Kamala Harris was the most significant shift in the reaction we received from this group of voters during the debate and in its immediate aftermath. None of our voters who had settled on a candidate before Tuesday’s onstage meeting were swayed to change their minds, although several Trump supporters shared concerns about his performance. “She was ready,” said Chris Mudd, a Trump loyalist from Cedar Falls, Iowa. But he added: “Trump can make some positive changes. Kamala is all hat and no cattle.” Lisa Reissman, a Harris supporter in Wisconsin, had a very different take. “Harris was remarkable,” Reissman said. “Trump came off as irrational and desperate.” Enthusiasm can matter in close races, and the conversation among Democrats is very different now that Harris has replaced President Joe Biden as the nominee. Even Democrats who had doubts about Biden but would have voted for him anyway use much more energetic language in discussing their support of Harris, including in their debate assessments. “She showed us tonight that she is a president,” said Davette Baker, an African American Democratic activist in Milwaukee. Larry Malinconico, a geology professor at Lafayette College in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, fits in this group. “While I have always been of the mindset to do anything to keep Trump from office, I also am now much more confident that VP Harris is a great presidential candidate.” Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, gave Harris more positive reviews for her debate performance. Several though, significantly, said she was not specific enough in explaining her policy proposals. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, a Haley primary voter who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. “This is why I don’t trust her,” said Rooney, who voted for Trump in 2016, but for Joe Biden in 2020. “She’s not a moderate.” Rooney would prefer not to vote for Trump, but is not a fan of Biden-Harris economic policies. “He’s so disappointing,” she said of Trump’s answer about his conduct on January 6, 2021. “Kamala is right to call him out about this.” Twice Rooney emailed us to say that Trump was “off the rails” during debate discussions about immigration. “I still can’t vote for her,” Rooney said of Harris. “But I don’t want to vote for Trump. … I feel so lonely in the middle.” Rooney is from Media, in Delaware County. So is Cynthia Sabatini, a Reagan Republican and “never Trump” voter who plans to write in a conservative or vote third party unless Harris wins her over. The vice president did not do so Tuesday night. “She is a good debater,” Sabatini said. “But in my opinion, she needs to answer questions on point.” Specifically, Sabatini said Harris failed out of the gate when asked whether she believed Americans are better off than they were four years ago and again on questions about the border. “I’m undecided,” was her post-debate assessment. Antonio Munoz, too, said Harris could have scored a bigger debate win had she been more specific and responsive. Munoz is a veteran and former police officer who now runs a taco restaurant and catering business in Las Vegas. He sat down for the debate leaning Harris but not ready to commit. He remains there after. “Kamala was very poised,” Munoz said of the vice president. “Trump was Trump. Killing babies after they are born. Immigrants eating cats and dogs. How do you defend untruthful comments like that?” But Munoz said he needs to hear more before Harris is guaranteed his vote in battleground Nevada. “Not enough substance on how to continue moving forward,” Munoz said of her debate performance. Zoila Sanchez, on the other hand, is firmly in camp Harris, even though she describes herself as a Reagan Republican. “Her focus on real issues and pragmatic solutions was refreshing,” said Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent. “Donald Trump appeared erratic and out of control. … We need leaders who are grounded in reality.” Allen Naparalla, too, would like more specifics from Harris. But he is now ready to commit, after telling us in July, when Biden stepped aside, that he didn’t see Harris as up to the job. “At this point, I just want to vote for optimism in the world,” said Naparalla, who runs a winery in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. “We need something to be happy about and look forward to. Enough negativity.” Other Harris voters delighted in her success distracting and rattling Trump. “A master class,” said Marvin Boyer, a civil rights activist in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a crucial swing county. “She was calm, focused and collected. He was defensive, angry and out of control.” Several Trump supporters, too, said Harris had succeeded in knocking Trump off his game. “Kamala successfully avoided the questions and triggered Donald,” said Natalya Orlando, a Trump voter in New Hampshire. “The buildup to the debate was exciting but the debate itself was OK. Nothing new.” Likewise, Priscilla Forsyth, an attorney in Sioux City, Iowa, said, “Trump wasn’t at his best and fell for the bait a little too often. But she seemed so fake, especially when she tried to talk about uniting the country. I will never believe she can or would represent my interests.” That was a common theme among Trump loyalists: that Harris isn’t authentic. “Kamala Harris’ incessant posing and disingenuous theatrics while Trump was speaking came across as immature, rehearsed and off-putting,” said Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs. “His defensive reactions were not helpful,” Iowa entrepreneur Jaclyn Taylor said of Trump. “Kamala didn’t feel genuine much of the evening.” Billy Pierce, a Trump backer from South Carolina, pointed to Harris’ time in the administration. “I just can’t believe Kamala is talking about change when she has been in office for three and a half years.” Debbie Katsanos, a Trump supporter in New Hampshire, said, “The status quo has got to change. This was once a great country and now it is not.” Betsy Sarcone, who backed Haley in the Iowa caucuses but plans to vote for Trump in November, said of Harris: “Her memorized and regurgitated lines lack depth.” Several voters who remain unhappy with their choice even after the switch atop the Democratic ticket saw nothing Tuesday night to change their disappointment. “I want better than this,” said Stanley Tremblay, a New Hampshire independent. “I’m just afraid we’ve dug ourselves a hole we can’t get out of.” Gina Cilento, a competitive pickleball player who owns a training studio in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, echoed Tremblay’s dismay. “It’s exhausting,” she texted during the debate. “It just makes me feel so sad. This is the best our country can do?”"
Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes won’t endorse Trump or Harris | CNN,"Published 6:15 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T22:15:26.462Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/sport/patrick-mahomes-trump-harris-spt-intl/index.html,"Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes will not endorse former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. After spending Sunday at the US Open with his wife Brittany, teammate Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift, who backed Harris for president on social media Tuesday night, Mahomes was asked about the former president associating himself with the three-time Super Bowl winner and Brittany. “I don’t want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate or do whatever, either way,” the two-time league MVP said at his regularly scheduled media availability on Wednesday. “I think my place is to inform people to get registered to vote. It is to inform people to do their own research and then make their best decision for them and their family. “Every time I’m on this stage and I get asked these questions, I’m going to refer back to that because I think that’s what makes America so great,” Mahomes said. On Wednesday, Trump appeared on Fox News and was asked about Swift’s Harris endorsement. “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better if you want to know the truth. She is a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan,” Trump said. Mahomes was asked if he had given any thought to Trump, specifically mentioning his wife’s name. “No. I think at the end of the day, it’s about me and my family and how we treat other people,” Mahomes replied. “I think you see that Brittany does a lot in the community. I do a lot in the community to help bring people up and give people other opportunities to use their voice. “So, in the political times, people are gonna use stuff here and there, but I can’t let that affect how I go about my business every single day and live my life - and try to live it to the best of my ability,” he said. Mahomes was asked several times about his name being mentioned in the political space in an election year. “I’ve grown up with people from every aspect of life and every background. I think the best thing about a football locker room, and kind of how I’ve grown up in baseball locker rooms is people can come together and achieve something and achieve a common goal. “I think if we can do that as a nation, I think we can get the best out of each other. “I think that’s something that I do every single day. Whenever I’m hanging out with whoever I’m not thinking about their political views or anything like that. I’m thinking about the people and how they treat other people, and I was with a lot of great people this weekend.” Mahomes and the Chiefs face the Cincinnati Bengals at home on Sunday."
Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president | CNN,"Updated 5:03 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T03:11:08.968Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/entertainment/taylor-swift-endorsement-kamala-harris/index.html,"Taylor Swift said Tuesday she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” Swift wrote on Instagram, shortly after the conclusion of Harris’ debate with former President Donald Trump, her Republican rival, on ABC News. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Harris became the Democratic Party’s nominee in early August following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race. Later that month, Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Swift mentioned Harris’ choice of Walz in her endorsement. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades,” Swift wrote. “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.” Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Asked about the endorsement on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, added in a statement to CNN on Wednesday: “More evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite. President Trump will fight for the American worker, the struggling family who can’t afford groceries and gas, and the angel families who have lost loved ones due to Kamala’s open border policy. Taylor Swift may not understand those problems but President Trump does.” In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Swift has spent most of her nearly two-decade career staying mum on politics until the 2018 midterms, when she endorsed two Democratic candidates out of Tennessee. She has since been vocally supportive of Democratic policies and candidates, often encouraging her supporters to vote and advocating for women’s rights, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights. In her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” Swift expressed regret for not speaking up about political causes sooner, telling her father Scott Swift in an emotionally charged scene that she felt the need “to be on the right side of history.” In another scene, she was critical of Trump. A faction of Swift’s supporters –- known as Swifties -– have mobilized in the 2024 election cycle, forming a Swifties for Kamala community online shortly following Biden’s exit from the race and his subsequent endorsement of Harris. The group, which Swift is not affiliated with and has thousands of followers on X, raised more than $122K during its two-hour kickoff call in August. Speakers included Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and singer Carole King. “We believe Harris-Walz will fight for our rights and the rights of our loved ones, and help make this country safer for everyone,” Irene Kim, communications director of Swifties for Kamala, previously told CNN."
"Trump suggests he won’t debate Harris again, attacks ABC over moderators’ fact-checking | CNN Business","Updated 4:53 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T14:01:46.562Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/media/will-trump-and-harris-debate-again-abc-moderators/index.html,"The day after Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s first presidential debate, it is far from clear if Trump will agree to a rematch. Multiple TV networks are eager to host a presidential debate in October. The Harris campaign, exuding confidence after Harris baited Trump on a Philadelphia stage Tuesday night, immediately said she would agree to a second debate with the ex-president. But Trump is not committing. “Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” he told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’ll think about it.” His comments suggest he is not altogether serious about a sequel. In a morning phone call to the co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” he said, “when you win the debate, I don’t, I don’t know that I want to do another debate.” Then he insulted Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, the two anchors that Fox News has pitched as potential debate moderators in October. “I wouldn’t want to have Bret and Martha,” he said, before proposing Sean Hannity, Jesse Watters or Laura Ingraham instead. It is self-evident that Fox’s prime time stars, who exist more in the realm of entertainment than news, are never going to moderate a general election debate. So if that’s the starting point for negotiations, don’t expect another debate. But Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said on “CNN This Morning” that Trump “has already said that he is going to do three debates.” Miller blamed Harris for dodging Trump’s talk of a September 25 debate hosted by NBC. The Harris campaign, however, wants the vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance to happen next. CBS is hosting that face-off on October 1. That’s why Harris spokesman Brian Fallon said last night, “That was fun. Let’s do it again in October.” NBC and other networks stand ready to host a followup debate. Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he would theoretically show up for a debate hosted by either NBC or Fox, but first “we have to determine whether or not we even want to do it.” Trump claimed that overnight polls showed he had defeated Harris soundly in the debate, as if to suggest that a second face-off wasn’t necessary, but he was referring to highly partisan and unscientific surveys on social media. CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. Regarding a potential Trump-Harris rematch, Trump’s VP nominee JD Vance said it’s ultimately up to the top of the ticket. “Obviously, he likes these debates and he’s good at them, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants to step back in the ring, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t. It’s his choice,” Vance told Fox News. Trump on Wednesday also assailed ABC after the debate moderators fact-checked the former president in real-time during the prime time telecast. “CNN was much more honorable” during its June debate, Trump told “Fox & Friends,” calling Disney-owned ABC “the most dishonest news organization, and that’s saying a lot.” Trump repeatedly claimed the debate “was three on one” and suggested Disney’s FCC broadcast licenses should be revoked due to the moderators’ conduct. “They are a news organization – they have to be licensed to do it – they ought to take away their license for the way they did that,” he said."

Speaker Johnson pulls Wednesday vote on government funding plan amid GOP divisions | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:18 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T10:00:21.740Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/gop-funding-push-house-vote/index.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday that he is pulling a short-term GOP government funding bill from the House floor amid significant defections on his right flank. “No vote today,” Johnson told reporters just hours ahead of the scheduled vote on the bill, which included a controversial measure that targets noncitizen voting. “We are having thoughtful conversations, family conversations within the Republican Conference and I believe we will get there.” The decision to pull the vote once again highlights the deep internal divisions within the House GOP conference and the major challenge facing the speaker as he attempts to navigate an extremely narrow majority as well as demands from former President Donald Trump. Johnson said in announcing that the vote would be pulled, “I want any member of Congress in either party to explain to the American people why we should not ensure that only US citizens are voting in US elections … It’s the most pressing issue right now, and we’re going to get this job done.” The House had been slated to vote Wednesday on the six-month government funding bill that included the voting measure. But at least eight House Republicans have already come out against the funding bill, which is enough to sink it in the House along with Democratic opposition, and the bill is considered dead-on-arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Biden administration has also said the president would veto the measure. If the GOP funding plan cannot pass the House, it would be a major embarrassment for the House GOP and would send Republicans scrambling to determine next steps as a government shutdown deadline looms at the end of the month. But Johnson might need to show that the GOP funding plan does not have the votes to pass to have political cover to then move on to a “clean” funding measure that does not include the controversial voting measure. The expectation on Capitol Hill is that scenario is the most likely path to avert a shutdown with support from Democrats. Adding to the challenges the speaker faces, Johnson is now under new pressure from Trump, who threatens to further complicate the funding fight. Trump has said that if Republicans don’t receive “absolute assurances” on election security, they should not pass a funding extension. Johnson has attempted to argue that he and Trump are on the same page, but If Trump digs in on the demand, that could set up Johnson to come under even more criticism from the right flank of his conference. The six-month funding plan from House Republicans, which cleared an initial procedural hurdle on Tuesday, would extend government funding until March 2025. The proposal includes the SAVE Act, a GOP-led bill that passed the House on a standalone basis in July and would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, despite the fact that is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections. The push for the bill comes as Trump and his allies continue to sow doubts over election integrity in the run-up to the 2024 elections. In a message that could make the government funding effort even more contentious for Republicans, Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday, “If Republicans in the House, and Senate, don’t get absolute assurances on Election Security, THEY SHOULD, IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, GO FORWARD WITH A CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET.” Johnson emphasized agreement with Trump on government funding in response, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Tuesday, “I think President Trump is saying exactly what I have been saying, and that is we need assurances on election security and to fund the government.” Johnson has been trying to salvage the short-term spending plan amid GOP backlash, but wouldn’t rule out passing a “clean” bill to keep the government open when pressed by CNN’s Manu Raju earlier Tuesday. “I am in this to win this,” the speaker said. “I’m not going to engage in conjecture and, you know, try to game out all the outcomes.” Johnson’s insistence on forging ahead with the plan comes as frustrated members of the right flank of his conference have predicted that the SAVE Act would likely be dropped once the Senate rejects the measure, even if the funding bill managed to pass the House. The speaker has so far has not presented a Plan B. Many House conservatives are also generally opposed to short-term funding bills, arguing instead in favor of spending cuts. The Department of Veterans Affairs is sounding the alarm to Congress in a new letter first obtained by CNN that spells out how the funding plan put forth by House Republicans could imperil the department’s ability to deliver benefits to veterans in the months ahead. Because of increased enrollment after the passage of new legislation known as the PACT Act that expanded accessibility to health care and other benefits for veterans, the department is facing a massive shortfall that it says would be exacerbated by a six-month funding bill into March. “The most significant challenge VA would face under a 6-month CR is in delivering the highest quality health care to veterans,” the letter reads. The administration has asked Congress for an additional $12 billion for the funds for VA health care, but House Republicans did not include that in their version of the six-month funding bill. Without it, the VA warns that the number of patients they could see, the staff they can keep and the wait times they experience could all suffer. The letter warns that VA may have to undertake staff reductions which could affect wait times, reduce the amount of outreach they are doing to veterans to educate and help them understand their benefits they are eligible for, or cut back on improvements to VA infrastructure and facilities. “The impacts of a 6-month CR are widespread and affect all aspects of VA care benefits, support and infrastructure. Amid the largest expansion of Veterans’s Care and benefits in a generation, the reductions in funding resulting from a 6-month CR would greatly impact VA’s ability to serve Veterans,” the letter says. Raising the issue of veterans’ health care could also provide Democrats a potential off-ramp to vote against the six-month funding bill, which includes includes the SAVE Act. While most Democrats are opposed, there were five who voted for the voting legislation when it was a standalone bill earlier this year.

Analysis: What to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyond | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:13 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-07-28T04:00:02.564Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html,"The race to Election Day in November is in high gear. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris squared off in a high-stakes debate in which Harris, arguably, got the upper hand. They and their respective running mates now have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. Some voters are starting to cast ballots, but there will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5. Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode after theshock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Harris as his replacement. Nobody expected an assassination attempt against Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience. So we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect: Early voting gets underway in September. North Carolina was supposed to be the first state to send mail-in ballots, on September 6, but the process was delayed by courts that ruled that ballots must be reprinted to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name. Kennedy suspended his independent presidential bid in August and endorsed Trump. Absentee ballots have started going out in Alabama, and other states begin sending mail-in ballots later in the month. Voters in most of the country have the option of requesting a mail-in ballot, and voters in eight of those states and Washington, DC, will get a mail-in ballot automatically. The other states require an excuse for mail-in ballots. Back in school and back to work, many Americans may start to pay more attention to the election in September. There will also be some touchstone moments in the cultural zeitgeist, such as when “Saturday Night Live” premiers at the end of the month with Maya Rudolph returning as Harris – and we find out who will play vice presidential nominees JD Vance and Tim Walz. Trump was also set to face sentencing in September for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments before the 2016 election, but that has been delayed until after this year’s election. Separately, Trump’s federal trial for 2020 election interference was restarted after special counsel Jack Smith responded to the Supreme Court’s grant of heightened presidential immunity with a pared-back set of charges. But those proceedings could drag on for months. The month begins with a vice presidential debate between Vance and Walz on October 1, hosted by CBS. While Election Day isn’t until November 5, most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process will kick into overdrive in October. Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according to census figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump. It’s important to be sure you’re registered to vote by October, which can usually be done online. Twenty-three states and Washington, DC, allow Election Day voter registration. US law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5. People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day. Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election. Separately, Trump’s sentencing on 34 counts of falsifying business records is now scheduled for November 26. Also this month: Biden turns 82. After questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner. Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race. The new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event of an Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives. In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be the fifth vice president in history to oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat. On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Analysis: The first 2024 ballots are in the mail. Here’s what to know | CNN Politics,"Published 1:02 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T17:02:26.330Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/early-voting-election-what-matters/index.html,"It’s not one election, but 51, that pick the US president. Every state and the District of Columbia has its own rules and deadlines for voting and for counting votes. The first voting officially was already supposed to be underway with mail-in ballots in the key state of North Carolina, but that process was delayed by courts that ruled ballots must be reprinted without the option of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Absentee ballots are now officially available in Alabama, although, somewhat ironically, it is a state that discourages early voting. Others will follow in the weeks to come. Here’s what to know: Most states will not offer mail-in ballots until later in September or October. The next firm date on the calendar is September 19, when ballots are supposed to be available in the key state of Wisconsin. For all states, ballots must begin to be sent to military and overseas voters by September 21. Each state has its own rules and deadlines for how and when to request a mail-in ballot and by when those ballots must be returned. In some states, mail ballots must be in the hands of election officials before polls close, but others will count ballots that arrive after Election Day if they were postmarked earlier. Washington, for instance, is one of the handful of states that conducts nearly all of its voting entirely by mail and will accept a mail-in ballot until results are certified in late November so long as it is postmarked by Election Day. Early voting may also be done in person in most states, but that process does not get underway until later in September. Widespread early voting will begin on September 20 in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia. For specifics on your state, visit CNN’s Voter Handbook, which has the dates for every state. No. Thirty-six states plus Washington, DC, allow all voters to cast ballots by mail. Eight of those states and Washington, DC, send a ballot automatically to all voters. Fourteen states, by contrast, require some kind of excuse for early or mail-in voting. These excuses can range from being required to work to volunteering at a polling place to caring for a sick relative. Far from it. Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump just held a contentious debate on September 10. The candidates for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will take part in a debate on October 1. Both campaigns will also focus events and get-out-the vote efforts on seven states considered to be up for grabs. More and more Americans will be voting all the while. Probably, yes. In a set of CNN polls conducted by SSRS in battleground states, only an average of 15% of voters said they have not yet firmly decided their choice. This is actually a sizable portion and suggests the outcome of the presidential race is far from certain, especially since those battleground state polls showed close matches in each state. In 2020, CNN exit polls showed that nearly three-quarters of voters made up their minds before September. Only 5% of exit poll respondents said they made up their minds in the week before Election Day. In 2020, most people voted early or by mail, but those figures were amplified by the special circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic. A little less than half of voters in 2020 voted by mail, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted after Election Day. About a quarter of voters cast ballots in person before Election Day, and about a quarter of voters cast ballots in person on Election Day, according to that survey. Then-President Trump spoke out against voting by mail in 2020, part of his unfounded claims of voter fraud, and as a result, Republicans were less likely to cast mail-in ballots. The largest portion of Trump voters, 37%, cast ballots in person on Election Day, according to Pew. For comparison, just 17% of Joe Biden voters cast ballots in person on Election Day. Nearly 60% of Biden voters cast absentee or mail-in ballots. Those figures could change this year. Some states will not be as accommodating of early or mail-in voting in 2024. And with the Covid-19 pandemic less of a factor, more voters may decide to vote in person instead of by mail. Trump still makes false claims of voter fraud and still doesn’t like the idea of mail-in voting, although he has routinely voted that way himself. Republicans, despite Trump’s warnings, are encouraging vote-by-mail in many places. Read the directions! Each state is different, but many have very specific directions for how mail-in ballots must be returned. For people voting by mail in North Carolina, for instance, the signature of either two witnesses or a notary is required along with a photocopy of a photo ID. In Pennsylvania, voters must write the date on the outside of their envelope. A Pennsylvania state court recently ruled, however, that ballots without that date cannot be thrown out. Look for more of these questions to be answered in court around the country in the coming weeks. For verification, some states require a photocopy of your ID, while others require a driver’s license number or the last four digits of your Social Security number. In many states, mail-in ballots require a signature that will be compared with the signature on your driver’s license or voter registration card, so make sure you don’t adopt a new signature for the election. Also make sure that you put your ballot in the mail with plenty of time to spare. If it gets closer to Election Day, consider returning your ballot in person to avoid the possibility of mail delays. Frequently, voters can monitor when their ballot is received and its status online. If a ballot is rejected, most states have a ballot curing process – meaning they will notify the voter, and there is a process for fixing, or curing, the problem. You can vote, either by requesting an absentee ballot from your stateside local jurisdiction or through the Federal Voting Assistance Program. Different rules can apply to people voting from oversees, so don’t wait until the last minute. First, check your registration status. Many states offer voter registration when obtaining a driver’s license. If you’re not registered right now, no problem. Voter registration deadlines don’t kick in until October, and they vary by state. Rhode Island is the first state to cut off voter registration at one month before Election Day on October 5. But it is also among the 23 states and the District of Columbia that allow Election Day registration. Alaska and Rhode Island are unique because they only allow Election Day registration in the presidential election. By that time, most Americans may already have voted."
Fact-checking the ABC presidential debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:57 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T02:17:31.121Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/fact-check-debate-trump-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump delivered more than 30 false claims during Tuesday’s presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, CNN’s preliminary count found – as he did during his June debate against President Joe Biden. Trump again delivered a staggering quantity and variety of false claims, some of which were egregious lies about topics including abortion, immigration and the economy. Harris was far more accurate than Trump; CNN’s preliminary count found just one false claim from the vice president, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context. Here is a fact check of some of the remarks made by each candidate. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that former President Donald Trump’s policies would result in a “Trump sales tax” that would raise prices for middle class families by about $4,000 a year. Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House. Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund a liberal think tank. If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP. Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco  Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that there was virtually no inflation during his administration. “I had no inflation, virtually no inflation,” Trump said. Facts First: This is false. Cumulative inflation over the course of Trump’s presidency was about 7.8%. Inflation was low at the end of Trump’s term, having plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The year-over-year inflation rate was about 1.4% in January 2021, the month Trump left office. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby  Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated a claim that migrants are arriving to the US after fleeing prisons and mental institutions. “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump claimed. Trump makes this claim often, and he’s often alleged that jails and mental institutions are being emptied out deliberately to somehow dump people upon the US. Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN last year they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated. And a second article that Cheung cited at the time, about Mexico’s president having freed 2,685 prisoners, was not about migration at all; that article simply explained that the president had freed them “as part of an effort to free those who have not committed serious crimes or were being held unjustly.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer Former President Donald Trump claimed during Tuesday night’s debate that “21 million people” are crossing the border monthly into the United States under President Joe Biden. Facts First: This number is false. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern borders from February 2021 through July 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was roughly 10 million, far less than Trump’s “21 million” figure.  An “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans have said is more than 1.7 million during the Biden-Harris administration, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in an email in June, when Trump made similar claims. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Trump would “essentially be immune from any misconduct” undertaken by him while in the White House. “Let’s talk about extreme and understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again,” she said. Facts First: This needs context. In their decision in July in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought in his federal election subversion case. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office.  “The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority. From CNN’s Devan Cole Former President Donald Trump repeated a false claim at Tuesday’s debate that has been promoted by numerous prominent Republicans in the past week, including Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. Trump claimed that Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield, Ohio, are stealing people’s pet dogs and cats and eating them. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Facts First: This is false. The City of Springfield and the local police have said they have seen no evidence for the claim – which appeared to originate from a Facebook post in which someone purporting to be a local resident passed along what they said was a story about their neighbor’s daughter’s friend. In a statement to CNN on Monday, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” The Springfield News-Sun reported that “the Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten.” Vance acknowledged on social media on Tuesday that it is “possible” that the “rumors” he has heard from local residents “will turn out to be false,” though he also encouraged people to “keep the cat memes flowing.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Michael Williams Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States took in billions of dollars from China as a result of his tariffs. Facts First: Trump’s claim about how tariffs work is false. A US tariff is paid by importing businesses in the United States – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. Here’s how tariffs work: When the United States puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer. Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. It’s true that the US Treasury has collected more than $242 billion from the tariffs Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods – but those duties were paid by US importers, not the country of China. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco During Tuesday night’s debate, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “I made it that very clear in 2020 – I will not ban fracking,” though she had said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” 
 
Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate. Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Tuesday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Ella Nilsen Former President Donald Trump said the US experienced “the highest inflation” ever under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Facts First: Trump’s claim that inflation was at its highest under the Biden-Harris administration is false. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, hit 9.1% in June 2022. That wasn’t the highest ever recorded. Rather, it was the highest inflation rate in nearly forty years. For instance, in 1980, inflation hit nearly 15%, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some of the earliest inflation data the BLS maintains indicates that inflation was even higher in 1917, when it was trending at nearly 18%. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump claimed that when Vice President Kamala Harris previously ran for the presidency, during the 2020 election cycle, she was the very first candidate to drop out of a crowded Democratic primary. “When she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,” Trump claimed, referring to Harris’ 2020 bid, while arguing that Harris didn’t receive any votes this primary cycle because President Joe Biden was still at top of the ticket during the primaries. Facts First: This is false. Harris was far from the first candidate to drop out of that Democratic primary when she exited the race in early December 2019 Harris was preceded by the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate, plus some others. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed at Tuesday’s debate that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Biden administration’s “border czar.” “Remember that she was a border czar,” Trump said. “She doesn’t want to be called the border czar because she’s embarrassed by the border.” Facts First: Trump’s claim about Harris’ border role is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries. (Biden also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.” Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby Former President Donald Trump repeated a version of one of his frequent claims Tuesday night that legal scholars wanted Roe v. Wade overturned so individual states could instead decide how to regulate abortion. “Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that’s what happened,” Trump said. “It’s the vote of the people, now it’s not tied up in the federal government.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Many legal scholars wanted the right to have an abortion preserved in federal law, as several told CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April.  Some legal scholars who support abortion rights had wanted Roe written in a different way, including even the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but that isn’t the same as saying that “every legal scholar” believed Roe should be overturned and sent to the states. “Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April. Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.” You can read more here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. “Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn’t do her job,” he said. Facts First: This claim is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. Pelosi’s office has explicitly said she was not presented with an offer of 10,000 National Guardsmen as Trump has claimed, telling CNN last year that claims to the contrary are “lies.” And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army). You can read a complete fact check on it here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Russia invaded Ukraine and failed to deter him from the invasion. “They sent her to negotiate peace before this war started,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “Three days later, he went in, and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris was not sent to negotiate peace, and she has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference. “Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said in July, according to a state-owned Russian news agency. The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.” CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.” The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump repeated a familiar claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. “We wouldn’t have left $85 billion worth of brand new, beautiful military equipment behind,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure – it’s closer to $83 billion – for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A fraction of this funding was for equipment. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday claimed that former President Donald Trump left office “with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.” Facts First: Harris’ claim is false. In January 2021, when Trump left office, the official unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global economies, including that of the US. That was the highest rate since 1939, according to BLS historical records. Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. But by the time Trump left office, the unemployment rate had gone down. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs created under the Biden-Harris administration from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false and needs additional context. Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported. Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the dynamics at play. Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report. While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration. The preliminary revision was larger than typical, but economists and even a Trump-appointed BLS commissioner have publicly stated that there is nothing nefarious at play. Revisions of this size typically happen at turning points in the economy, when the BLS’ methodology is less reliable, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, the pandemic had a seismic effect on the economy as well as the gold standard methods used to measure it, so this large revision is likely a reflection of that. Specifically, the BLS’ model for capturing business “births and deaths” is likely overstating new firm formation while underestimating deaths, Oxford Economics’ Chief US Economist Ryan Sweet told CNN. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed that President Joe Biden has taken money from China and Ukraine, including $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Facts First: There is no public evidence that Joe Biden received money from any foreign entities while in office or as a private citizen. While investigations by House Republicans have found that Biden family members who have been involved in business, including his son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden (“and their related companies”), have received over $18 million from foreign entities, they have found no proof to date that the president himself received any foreign money. Roughly a year after launching their impeachment inquiry into Biden and more than three years into Biden’s presidency, the closest House Republicans have gotten to connecting the president to money earned by his family members is in finding that the president received personal checks from his brother while he was a private citizen after his vice presidency. Republicans have questioned the legitimacy of these transactions and used them to suggest that Joe Biden did benefit from his brother’s relationships with foreign entities. But banking records provide substantial evidence that Joe Biden had made loans to his brother and then was paid back without interest, as House Democrats have said. Biden said at a presidential debate against Trump in 2020: “I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.” The Washington Post dove into the allegations in 2022 that Hunter Biden received money from the wife of the Moscow mayor. But there’s no evidence that Joe Biden had any involvement regardless. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jeremy Herb Former President Donald Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign – that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state. Facts First: This is false. There is no evidence that Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government.  Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: “The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.” As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney’s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris implied Tuesday that all prospective start-up business owners will be able to take advantage of the $50,000 tax deduction she’s proposing for new small businesses, saying that it will help them “pursue their ambitions.” “I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work,” Harris said. Facts First: Harris’ point about new business owners being able to benefit from the deduction she’s proposed lacks context. “Businesses that fail before they begin to turn a profit won’t be able to utilize the deduction, because to take a deduction you have to have taxable income to deduct against,” Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN. In other words, the tax deduction may not ultimately help businesses owners get off the ground and running initially. However, it may help lower their tax burden over time, but only if they turn a profit. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, “the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs” that “bounced back and it went to their benefit,” but “I was the one that created them.” Facts First: Trump’s claims that the job growth during the Biden-Harris administration presidency has been all “bounce-back” gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct. More than 21 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022. The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022 and through August 2024, the US has added nearly 6.4 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under the Biden-Harris administration, around 16 million jobs have been added. But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions. The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities. Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday past claims that he “rebuilt our entire military.” “We’re going to end up in a third world war, and it will be a war like no other. Because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan,” he said. Facts First: Trump’s claim to have rebuilt the entire military is false. “This claim is not even close to being true. The military has tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, and the vast majority of it predates the Trump administration,” Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told CNN in November. Harrison said in a November email: “Moreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It’s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military’s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F- 15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump complained that the US had given $250 billion to $275 billion in aid to Ukraine while European countries had given just $100 billion to $150 billion even though they are located closer to Ukraine. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. In total, European countries have contributed significantly more aid to Ukraine than the US has during and just before the Russian invasion began in early 2022, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany.  The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, from late January 2022 (just before Russia’s invasion in February 2022) through June 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $207 billion to Ukraine, in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared to about $109 billion (€98.4 billion) committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had actually been “allocated” to Ukraine – defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery – at about $122 billion (€110.21 billion) for Europe compared to about $83 billion (€75.1 billion) for the US. In addition, Europe had committed more total military aid to Ukraine, at about $88 billion (79.57 billion euro) to about $72 billion (64.87 billion euro) for the US. The US narrowly led on military aid that had actually been allocated, at about $56.91 billion for the US (51.58 billion euro) to about $56.84 billion for Europe (51.52 billion euro), but that was nowhere near the lopsided margin Trump suggested. It’s important to note that it’s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. And the Kiel Institute found that Ukraine itself was getting only about half of the money in a 2024 US bill that had widely been described as a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine; the institute said the rest of the funds were mostly going to the Defense Department. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that “crime in this country is through the roof.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that crime rates are up is false. And while it is true that the FBI’s most recent data did not include some large cities, crime counts still show a downward trend as both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. There are limitations to the FBI-published data from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data and the submitted data usually has some errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trump’s last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said in an email to CNN last week: There is ample evidence that crime is falling in 2024 and murder specifically fell at the fastest – or one of the fastest – paces ever recorded in 2023 and again in 2024.” Asher continued: “The evidence comes from a variety of sources including the FBI’s quarterly data, the CDC, the Gun Violence Archive, and our newly launched Real-Time Crime Index. We show a 5 percent decline in violent crime – including a 16 percent decline in murder – and a 9 percent decline in property crime through June 2024 in over 300 cities with available data so far this year. Data from these various sources suggest the US murder rate was down significantly in 2023 relative to 2020/2021 highs but still slightly above 2019’s level.” After Trump claimed in June that “crime is so much up,” Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: “It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Central Park Five pleaded guilty to crimes, and that the five teenagers “badly hurt a person, killed a person” in the 1989 attack. Facts First: These claims are false. The Central Park Five did not plead guilty, they were convicted by a jury at trial (that conviction has since been vacated). Also, the five teenagers were accused of raping a jogger – not of murder.  Five teenagers who were accused of raping a jogger in 1989 were pressured into giving false confessions. They were exonerated in 2002 when DNA evidence linked another person to the crime. The teenagers sued the city, and the case was settled in 2014. A sixth teenager charged in the attack did plead guilty to robbery charges. His conviction was also overturned because there was no physical evidence connecting him to either the rape or the robbery, and because people who blamed the sixth teen later recanted. From CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz Former President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that he “ended” the Nord Stream pipeline. “I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one,” Trump said. “But he ended the XL pipeline – the XL pipeline in our country, he ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany; the biggest pipeline in the world.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He did not “end” Nord Stream. While he did sign a bill that included sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around 90% complete – and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been described as a likely act of sabotage. From CNN’s Daniel Dale  Former President Donald Trump claimed that some states allow people to execute babies, in addition to allowing abortion in the ninth month, and he singled out the governors including Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz for his stance on the issue. On Walz, Trump said, “He also says execution after birth – it’s execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born – is OK. And that’s not OK with me.” “They have abortion in the ninth month. They even have – and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia not the current governor he’s doing an excellent job. But the governor before, he said, ‘The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,’ in other words, ‘We’ll execute the baby,’” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim about infanticide is false. No state allows for the execution of a baby after it is born. That’s called infanticide, which is illegal in every state. “Every state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,” Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said in June. “There is no basis for this claim,” Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, also said at the time. There are some cases in which parents choose palliative care, a kind of care that can provide relief for the symptoms and stress of a deadly illness or condition that gives the baby just minutes, hours or days to live. That is not the same as executing a baby. Trump also misspoke. It was not the governor of West Virginia, it was the former Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam who made a controversial remark in 2019 that many Republicans said sounded like he supported infanticide. Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, said his words were being misinterpreted. In any case, infanticide was not legal when Northam was governor of Virginia nor was it ever legal in West Virginia either. As for abortions in the ninth month, Minnesota is one of a handful of states that allow abortion at any stage of a pregnancy, but it doesn’t mean that doctors perform them. Nationally, just 0.9% of abortions in 2021 – the latest year the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has data – happened at 21 weeks or later. Many abortions at this point in the pregnancy are necessary due to serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies. More than 93 percent of abortions were conducted before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the CDC. In Minnesota, according to state data for 2022, of the 12,175 abortions in the state, only two happened between the 25 and 30th week of pregnancy. None happened after the 30th week of pregnancy that year. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” for years, until he “got them to pay up” by threatening not to follow through on the alliance’s collective defense clause. “For years, we were paying almost all of NATO,” he said. “We were being ripped off by European nations, both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, ‘if you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.’ Otherwise we would have never gotten it.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” needs context. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “almost all.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016. The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP. From CNN’s Daniel Dale In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump once again claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris wants to get rid of private health insurance. “But she won’t improve private insurance for people, private medical insurance,” Trump said. “That’s another thing she doesn’t want to give. People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they wanna have private – she wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is outdated. While Harris did say in her first presidential campaign in 2019 that she wanted to eliminate private health insurance, the plan she rolled out later that year included a role for private insurers, and as vice president, she has supported bolstering the Affordable Care Act. Coverage on the Obamacare exchanges are offered by private insurers. At a CNN town hall in January 2019, Harris, who was then a California senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance proposal promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Harris was a co-sponsor of Sanders’ bill, which called for essentially getting rid of the private insurance market. A furor erupted, and her national press secretary and an adviser quickly walked back her comment, saying she was open to multiple paths to Medicare for All. And private insurers were included in the plan she rolled out in July 2019. “We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.” Since she was named President Joe Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market. Harris’ campaign has confirmed that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system. From CNN’s Tami Luhby Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Tuesday that the economy has added over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs during the Biden-Harris administration. Facts First: Harris was rounding up and was referring to labor market data available through July 2024, which showed the US economy added 765,000 manufacturing jobs from the first full month of the Biden-Harris administration, February 2021. Though it’s worth noting that the growth almost entirely occurred in 2021 and 2022 (with 746,000 manufacturing jobs added starting in February 2021) before a relatively flat 2023 and through the first seven months of 2024. In August, the US economy lost an estimated 24,000 manufacturing jobs, bringing that tally down to 739,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary employment data released Friday. The gain during the Biden-Harris era is, however, over 800,000 using non-seasonally-adjusted figures that are also published by the federal government – in fact, the non-seasonally adjusted gain is 874,000 through August – so there is at least a defensible basis for Harris’ claim. However, seasonally adjusted data smooths out volatility and is traditionally used to observe trends. An estimated 172,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during former President Donald Trump’s administration, however, most of those losses occurred following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. From February 2017, the first full month that Trump was in office, through February 2020, the US economy added 414,000 manufacturing jobs, BLS data shows. Presidential terms don’t start and end in a vacuum, and economic cycles can carry over regardless of party. Additionally, the ups and downs of the labor market and the broader economy are influenced by factors beyond a single president, although specific economic policies can influence economic and job growth. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday night’s debate that he saved Obamacare, his predecessor’s landmark health reform law that Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace. “I had a choice to make: Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim is misleading. The only reason Obamacare wasn’t repealed was because congressional Republicans could not amass enough votes to kill the law in 2017. During Trump’s administration, he and his officials took many steps to weaken the Affordable Care Act, though they did continue to operate the Obamacare exchanges. Within hours of taking the oath of office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rolling back Obamacare – stating that the administration’s official policy was “to seek the prompt repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. Although Congress failed to repeal it, Trump did manage to undermine the law, which led to a decline in enrollment. He cut the open enrollment period in half, to only six weeks. He also slashed funding for advertising and for navigators, who are critical to helping people sign up. At the same time, he increased the visibility of insurance agents who can also sell non-Obamacare plans. Trump signed an executive order in October 2017 making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have lower premiums than Affordable Care Act plans – but in exchange for fewer protections and benefits. And he ended subsidy payments to health insurers to reduce eligible enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs. Plus, his administration refused to defend several central provisions of the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, arguing that key parts of Obamacare should be invalidated. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the challenge and left the law in place. Enrollment declined until the final year of his term, which was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. From CNN’s Tami Luhby Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday, “As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.” Facts First: This claim is misleading. While US service members are not engaged in major wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, US service members have come under fire in the Middle East repeatedly over the last year and increasingly been in harm’s way since Hamas’ attacks on Israel last October. There are currently roughly 2,500 US troops in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7. Also since October, more US troops have deployed to the Middle East, including on Navy ships to the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea. CNN cited two US officials in reporting Tuesday that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was last operating near the Gulf of Oman, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group is expected to leave the region this week after last operating in the same area. Additionally, in the last several months, US service members have taken fire in the Middle East and been injured or killed. Last month, eight US service members were treated for traumatic brain injuries and smoke inhalation after a drone struck Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria. In January, three US soldiers were killed, and dozens more were injured, in an attack on a small outpost in Jordan called Tower 22. The same month, two US Navy SEALs died after going missing one night at sea while trying to seize lethal aid being transported from Iran to Yemen. From CNN’s Haley Britzky Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday’s debate: “Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs.” Facts First: This needs context. It’s true that the US lost 178,000 manufacturing jobs during Trump’s presidency – but the loss overwhelmingly occurred because of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. From the beginning of Trump’s presidency in January 2017 through February 2020, before the pandemic crash, there was a gain of 414,000 manufacturing jobs. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday’s debate: “Let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America.” Facts First: This needs context. It’s true that there were high trade deficits during the Trump administration. The seasonally adjusted 2020 goods trade deficit, about $901.5 billion, was the highest on record at the time. However, Harris did not acknowledge that trade deficits have been even higher during the Biden-Harris administration. The seasonally adjusted goods trade deficit exceeded $1 trillion in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023. From CNN’s Daniel Dale"
