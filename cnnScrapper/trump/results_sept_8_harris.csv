Analysis: Trump warms up for debate by threatening to jail election officials | CNN Politics,"Published 12:01 AM EDT, Mon September 9, 2024",2024-09-09T04:01:19.699Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/politics/trump-debate-prep-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump limbered up for his debate with Kamala Harris by showing the extremism that risks playing into the vice president’s claim that he’s an “unserious man” who is an “extremely serious” threat if he’s returned to the White House. Trump warned he will jail election officials he considers cheats; is complaining Pennsylvania’s voting is a fraud; vowed to pardon January 6 rioters; railed against women who accused him of sexual misconduct; and spent hours in recent days on sometimes incoherent rants that raised questions about his state of mind. But new polling ahead of Tuesday’s showdown in Philadelphia shows the race tied up nationally, suggesting Harris’ momentum after replacing President Joe Biden on the ticket hasn’t resulted in a commanding edge. The tightness of the contest shows both Trump’s enduring appeal to tens of millions of Americans as he seeks a political comeback and the huge task facing Harris as she tries to save an election Democrats seemed doomed to lose before Biden bowed out. That makes Tuesday’s debate — the first since June’s consequential clash on CNN that eventually ended Biden’s campaign — the most critical scheduled event before Election Day. The way each candidate is preparing highlights the different paths Americans can choose in November and the sharp contrast in the style of the presidency that will ensue if Harris or Trump are at the Oval Office desk. Harris is holed up in Pittsburgh with staff to hone her skills for the test of facing Trump in a debate. Her choice of Pennsylvania for prep stresses the critical importance of a state she almost certainly needs to win to take the presidency. A source told CNN that her advisers are working out how she’ll deal with a rule that a candidate’s mic will be muted while their rival speaks. The vice president had pushed to overturn the restriction in the hope she could use her skills as a former prosecutor to dress down Trump in real time. But she told reporters, “I’m ready,” as she went for a stroll in the Steel City on Sunday with her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reflected on Harris’ challenge as she tries to engage Americans who want to know more about her while dealing with a sometimes-unhinged force of nature like Trump. “It will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate,” Buttigieg said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It’s no ordinary proposition, not because Donald Trump is a master of explaining policy ideas and how they’re going to make people better off. It’s because he’s a master of taking any form or format that is on television and turning it into a show that is all about him.” A New York Times/Siena College poll published Sunday showed that 28% of likely voters need to know more about Harris, as opposed to just 9% who say the same of her rival. This presents possible room for growth for the vice president. But she is also facing pressure to explain policy reversals on issues such as immigration and fracking while showing more precision than she did in some testy interviews early in her vice presidency. And her unwillingness to submit to major media interviews — apart from one last month on CNN — means that a candidate who has sometimes struggled to articulate coherent arguments in high-pressure and spontaneous situations is coming into the debate without much recent experience of adversarial political combat. Trump’s Republican supporters have been pleading with him for days to drill down on issues such as the economy, immigration and national security and to avoid petulant behavior that could play into Harris’ argument that it’s time for the country to move on from the bitterness and chaos he represents for many voters. The GOP theory is that Harris, as a key member of an unpopular administration, is ill suited to act as an agent of political change. But Trump’s conduct heading into the debate explains the concern he will botch the clear contrast spelled out by Sen. Tom Cotton to CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” The Arkansas Republican said Sunday: “People remember that, when Donald Trump was in office, prices were low, wages were high, we had peace and stability around the world.” He added: “Kamala Harris, as vice president, has brought us record high inflation. We have a wide-open southern border and we have war everywhere you turn around in the world.” Trump, however, was unwilling to restrain himself in recent days. In the most ominous development, the ex-president on Saturday used his Truth Social network to blast what he called “Cheating and Skullduggery” in 2020 by Democrats, then pivoted to the 2024 election, warning, “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.” He lashed out at “Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials” who he said would be “prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.” There is no evidence that the 2020 election was corrupt. Trump’s multiple legal challenges were thrown out by judges and even his own attorney general, William Barr, said there was no widespread voter fraud. The fact that the ex-president tried to steal the last election makes his warnings that officials who do not echo his view of this one’s fairness an even more serious issue, and it bodes ill for the post-election period in November if Trump loses. Trump’s warnings also show the consequences of his successful legal gambits in forestalling accountability for his election interference — in a federal case and in Georgia — until after the coming election. If he regains power, he will almost certainly use his restored presidential authority and new legal maneuvers to dismiss special counsel Jack Smith’s case in Washington, DC, district court and to try to prevent the Georgia one from coming to trial. In another Truth Social post, Trump picked up on an interview by Tucker Carlson to claim with no evidence that 20% of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are “fraudulent.” This is not the first time that the ex-president has seemed to be preparing a rationale to challenge the 2024 election if he loses. Trump’s debate prep is the most unorthodox of any modern presidential candidate. In other public appearances in recent days, the former president has indulged the wilder sides of his character in streams of consciousness that delight many of his supporters but raise questions about whether he has the discipline and clarity of thinking traditionally associated with the presidency. On Friday, in an extraordinary on-camera appearance in New York, he offered detailed and explicit appraisals of allegations of misconduct against him by women — part of a wider series of claims that he is an innocent victim of the weaponization of justice. His claims seem unlikely to improve his standing among women voters, among whom he trails Harris by 11 points, according to the New York/Times Siena poll. At a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday, Trump often embarked on confusing digressions — for instance about Al Capone and Hannibal Lecter — and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “chess player.” Trump promised he was the one thing standing between Americans and World War III. And he pledged to pardon people convicted and jailed “by the Harris regime” for trying to overturn the election on January 6, 2021 — a step that would short-circuit the justice system and legal accountability for crimes. In a self-indulgent aside, he praised one of his own speeches as delivered more “brilliantly” than anything since Franklin Roosevelt. His appearance was replete with exaggerations and distortions — although his conspiracy theories and falsehoods come at such a clip that they often escape scrutiny because of their sheer volume. At one point, Trump mistakenly referred to SpaceX and Tesla pioneer Elon Musk as “Leon.” When Biden made such slips, Trump and allies frequently argued that the president’s mental acuity was in question. But the 78-year-old Trump’s unrestrained public appearances and apparent belief in fantasies and unproven facts also raise questions about his capacity to serve as commander in chief and the threat he poses to constitutional democracy. His grip on the GOP means, however, that he’s driven anyone likely to raise such concerns out of the party — for instance former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who last week endorsed Harris, as did her father, former vice president Dick Cheney. Trump’s increasingly close relationship with Musk is also offering a preview of a potential second term for the ex-president. His promise to put Musk in charge of an effort to slash government regulations would mean the world’s richest man getting the chance to reshape federal rules and safeguards at a time when his businesses have massive interests that can be influenced by the government. This would create conflict-of-interest controversies that would dwarf those the Republican nominee encountered in his first term. Despite fresh evidence of Trump’s turbulent character and the success Harris has had so far in improving on Biden’s performance in the race, the latest polling shows no clear leader between them. Harris has an average of 49% support, while Trump has 47% in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which includes surveys conducted between August 23 and September 6. The new average is largely unchanged from before the Democratic National Convention, when Harris was averaging 50% to Trump’s 48% among polls conducted between August 1 and 16."
Harris prepares for the showdown she’s long sought with Trump as he takes more informal approach | CNN Politics,"Published 5:45 PM EDT, Sun September 8, 2024",2024-09-08T21:45:27.635Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/index.html,"The most important moment in the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump comes this week, as the vice president prepares for what could be her only opportunity to directly confront a former president whose political dominance she is pledging to end. Their Tuesday night debate is particularly important for Harris, who is battling to define herself in voters’ eyes and keep up the positive momentum she’s enjoyed since becoming the Democratic Party’s new nominee this summer. The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be the first face-to-face encounter between Harris and Trump, who are locked in a tight race. For Harris, it’s a marquee moment to show Americans that she is ready to assume the presidency, a question very much on the minds of voters as the fall campaign intensifies. “Look, it’s time to turn the page on the divisiveness,” she said during a weekend stop in Pittsburgh, taking a break from her debate preparations. “It’s time to bring our country together, chart a new way forward.” Trump, meanwhile, is eager to negatively shape voters’ perceptions of his Democratic rival and halt the gains she has made since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in July. Harris has eliminated what for much of the year had been Trump’s lead over Biden in presidential polling. Both Harris and Trump are offering themselves as change agents of sorts. Harris has pitched herself as a clean break from a bitterly divisive era of politics dominated by Trump. The former president, though, points to Harris’ time in the Biden administration and says she bears the blame for inflation, higher mortgage rates and more. Trump’s campaign and his allies have accused Harris of avoiding policy particulars. But Trump’s incoherent answer last week to a question about how he would make child care more affordable was a vivid reminder that the former president has long brushed aside policy details and questions about the practicality of his proposals. Trump has also lobbed racist and lewd attacks against Harris, including falsely claiming in July that she “happened to turn Black” a few years ago (she’s the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants) and sharing on social media references to her former relationship with onetime San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. Whether Trump makes similar comments — and how Harris responds — could shape voters’ perceptions of their clash Tuesday. The debate, moderated by ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir, is scheduled to last 90 minutes. Like the CNN debate between Trump and Biden in June, candidates’ microphones will be turned on when it’s their turn to speak and muted otherwise. Those rules — agreed to by the Biden and Trump campaigns — have frustrated Harris, who hoped to tap into her skills as a former prosecutor during any onstage engagements with Trump. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the Harris campaign said Wednesday in a letter to ABC News agreeing to the debate. The debate comes just before early voting begins in several key states. Polls have shown a tight race nationally and in key battlegrounds — including the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Both campaigns have paid particular attention to Pennsylvania and Georgia, where recent CNN polling found no clear leader between the candidates. Should Trump hold North Carolina, a state he’s won twice, victories in Pennsylvania and Georgia could push him past the 270 electoral vote threshold even if he does not win any of the other battleground states. Harris got a jolt of good news late last week, when her campaign announced it had pulled in almost triple her Republican rival’s fundraising haul in August — $361 million to Trump’s $130 million — entering September with $404 million in cash reserves for the final two-month sprint to November. That sum far surpasses the $295 million Trump’s political operation says it has in the bank. A Sunday New York Times/Siena College poll, however, underscored the importance of the fight over defining Harris. The survey, which showed the two candidates about evenly matched nationally, suggested that a sizable share of voters still need more information about the vice president: 28% of likely voters said they feel like they need to learn more about Harris, while just 9% said the same about Trump. The poll also offered some potential warnings for Harris. While 61% of likely voters said they thought the next president should represent a “major change” from Biden, just 25% said they thought Harris represented such a change, while 53% said Trump did. The same poll found that 47% of likely voters found Harris too liberal, despite her attempts to moderate in recent weeks, compared with 32% who said Trump is too conservative. The two candidates have taken drastically different approaches to preparing for their Tuesday showdown. No presidential nominee in the modern age has done more televised general election debates than Trump. Harris and her team have been carefully studying all six of them — three with Hillary Clinton in 2016, two with Biden in 2020, and another with Biden in June — as she prepares for her turn onstage. Harris has spent the days leading up to the debate hunkered down with aides at a hotel in Pittsburgh, making only occasional, brief public appearances. But aides said she has been thinking about a debate with Trump since the moment Biden ended his bid for reelection in late July. “I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage,” Harris told reporters last month. “I’m ready. Let’s go.” She’s been reading briefing papers about Trump’s comments, positions and even the insults he’s directed at her, aides said, as well as familiarizing herself with how Trump comported himself with his two previous Democratic opponents, particularly Clinton. Harris has spoken extensively to both Clinton and Biden about debating Trump, hoping to benefit from their experiences. And she began telegraphing her approach to Trump even before her nomination became official, telling a crowd in Atlanta in late July: “If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.” A strategy for Harris, aides said, is not only to stand up to the former president, but to make the case that it’s time for the country to move beyond the Trump era. Any of his taunts on race are expected to be diminished and dismissed as the “same old, tired playbook,” as Harris said during her sit-down interview with CNN last month. While many candidates have outwardly bristled at debate preparations, aides said Harris is digging into the practice sessions with mock debates against a Trump stand-in, longtime Clinton aide Philippe Reines, and preparing like she did during her years as a prosecutor. Karen Dunn, a Washington lawyer who has helped Democratic candidates prepare for debates for more than a decade, is running the practice sessions for Harris. Dunn, who worked with Clinton ahead of her encounters with Trump in 2016, got to know Harris when she prepared her to face Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking,” Harris said at one point during that debate, delivering a line that could be reprised on Tuesday if she is faced with any interruptions. “If you don’t mind letting me finish, we can have a conversation. OK? OK.” In recent days Trump has ribbed Harris over her preparations and claimed that his debate performance won’t get a fair review. “If I destroy her in the debate, they’ll say, ‘Trump suffered a humiliating defeat tonight,’” the former president said at a Saturday campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin. Trump, who argued he doesn’t need formal preparation such as mock debates, has been meeting with senior advisers, policy experts and outside allies to ready himself for Tuesday. The “policy discussions” — the Trump campaign’s version of debate prep — largely mirror those the former president held in the weeks leading up to his June 27 debate with Biden, sources familiar with the meetings told CNN. Trump senior adviser Jason Miller has been handling the meetings, which have included sessions with former Trump administration official Stephen Miller, Trump campaign policy adviser Vincent Haley, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, among others. The sessions have largely focused on helping Trump sharpen his messaging on a range of issues, from the economy to immigration and American democracy at large. The Trump campaign also deliberately scheduled a slate of events in the days leading up to the debate, such last week’s policy speech to the Economic Club of New York and his town hall with Fox News, in an effort to have him hone his messaging in public, his advisers said. People close to Trump argue one of the most crucial aspects of his Tuesday matchup with Harris is ensuring the former president does not appear overly aggressive toward her and strikes the right tone. As with his June 27 debate with Biden, Trump’s advisers and allies have been encouraging him to appear more restrained while onstage. However, many privately acknowledge that will be even more important this time. Not only is Harris a more popular candidate than Biden was then, but she is also a woman, and the optics of particular attacks will resonate differently, they say. Gabbard, who recently endorsed Trump, has been a key player in that effort. The Hawaii Independent was among the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders who challenged Harris on the debate stage. She has been working with Trump to help him better understand Harris’ debate style. Trump’s advisers believe Gabbard’s attacks on the then-California senator — particularly the scrutiny of her record as a prosecutor — helped undermine Harris’ candidacy in 2019. The former president’s team has told him to specifically needle Harris on the issues where she has changed her position. “We want to keep him steered toward hitting her record. On fracking, on her flip flops, and show that she is just as responsible for the Biden administration’s failed policies as Biden is,” one adviser said. Those helping Trump prepare have also directed him to focus his answers on the core policy issues where he polls higher than Harris, such as the economy, immigration and crime, sources familiar with the meetings said. “The most important part is finding pivots, finding ways to be critical of her, deflecting attacks from her,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “It’s not about her interrupting him or how she’ll act. It’s about him being on target on his responses on policy. That’s been the main focus.”"
"Lawmakers return to Washington, DC, with presidential politics looming large | CNN Politics","Published 4:29 PM EDT, Sun September 8, 2024",2024-09-08T20:29:40.799Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/house-investigations-congress-return/index.html,"When the House Judiciary Committee held a field hearing on Friday to highlight the impact border security issues have on local communities, the latest installment of an ongoing series, Vice President Kamala Harris was underlying their line of attack for the first time. Four months ago, when the panel held a similar field hearing in North Dakota, the vice president was not mentioned by name once. The shift, both in branding and messaging from the “Biden Border Crisis” to the “Biden-Harris Border Crisis” underscores how House Republicans are pivoting to specifically target Harris after the summer of Democratic reckoning over President Joe Biden resulted in Harris becoming the Democrats’ presidential nominee with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. As Congress embarks on a three-week sprint before its next recess, both parties return to Washington, DC, for a final messaging push dictated by the dynamics of the presidential race in an entirely new political landscape, while trying to balance the critical September 30 government funding deadline. Republicans have turned their operation – initially designed to target Biden – on its head to now go after Harris, and Democrats are positioning themselves to frame the GOP attacks as a last-ditch effort while planning some offensive moves of their own. Members of the Trump campaign advised the House GOP conference during a private call on Friday about what her biggest perceived weaknesses are and to keep their attack of Harris on the border and the state of the economy, a source on the call told CNN. Calls between Republican lawmakers and Trump campaign officials are expected to be a regular occurrence in the coming weeks, sources told CNN, as backchannel coordination ahead of the November election intensifies. The guidance from the Trump campaign largely mirrors the playbook Republicans had used against Biden, and given Harris is part of Biden’s administration and has been the tie-breaking vote in the Senate in her role as vice president, Republicans plan to keep those issues in the spotlight. With these sustained attacks on the border and immigration, Democrats will continue to point to border crossings being at a four-year low because of new Biden administration policies and emphasize that Republicans tanked a bipartisan border deal for political reasons. But while there is evidence that Republicans are trying to develop a more targeted approach to the Harris-Walz ticket – as old tropes such as “Biden crime family” fall by the wayside – some GOP messaging ploys on Harris have come off disjointed. Republicans have been trying to find their footing when it comes to attacking Harris over the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, to further divide Democrats over the issue. While Harris has stood behind Biden in his handling of the war, and largely shares the same positions as the president, Republicans can’t seem to decide in their messaging if Harris is too close to or too much of an opponent of Israel. A Republican-linked group in Michigan for example purchased digital ads last week touting Harris’ close relationship with Israel, while Trump said this week at an event that if Harris were elected Israel will “no longer exist.” On top of that, some Republicans have deviated from the script and gone after Harris for being a “DEI hire,” unleashing swift blowback that those attacks were racially charged. The Republican-led congressional committees have been spearheading the shift in focus from Biden to Harris. Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, for example, will release a report and hold a news conference Monday on the chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it an “unprecedented oversight of the Biden-Harris administration,” in an apparent messaging shift after previously labeling it the responsibility of the Biden administration. The House Education and Workforce Committee issued a subpoena to Walz on Wednesday for documents related to a $250 million fraud scheme where individuals affiliated with a Minnesota-based nonprofit were charged with stealing from a federal program designed to provide meals for needy children during the pandemic. The House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz last month alleging the Minnesota governor has ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and a committee source told CNN the panel plans to hold hearings targeting the Biden-Harris administration when lawmakers return to session. GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida asked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last month to turn over any documents that use the terms “czar,” “border,” “migration,” or “immigration” in relation to Harris, as Republicans continue to try and frame Harris as the “border czar,” while the White House rejects the label, arguing her focus was on long-term fixes. And GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raising questions about Walz’s representation of his military record. “We don’t have a lot of time,” GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN on Thursday about how Republicans are pivoting to focus on Harris in September. “I certainly believe that (Harris’) role should be under the microscope,” Mace added. The GOP turn in focus to Harris however leaves a huge GOP investigative target in an awkward position. The trio of committees leading the impeachment inquiry into Biden, once a top priority for the GOP investigative agenda, released their report on Biden in the thick of August recess without a clear path forward. Instead of pushing for the House to vote on impeachment, the report leaves it up to lawmakers to decide how to move forward. Summarizing the GOP approach to Biden now that the president is not running for reelection, Mike Davis, a former top aide to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and founder of the Article III Project, told CNN, “Joe Biden who? No one cares about him anymore.” And with only a matter of weeks before Election Day, even Republicans have acknowledged they have more pressing political fish to fry. “I think just looking at the calendar, I think that it’s unlikely that there will be action on impeachment with Joe Biden,” GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia told CNN. “However, I have said for the better part of four years now that Joe Biden should be impeached.” But Democrats see the new push to target Harris and Walz as empty threats, and they point to GOP attacks on Harris’ race as disqualifying. “Republicans can’t win on policy, and that’s why they’re attacking Kamala Harris’ identity and lying about Tim Walz’s military record,” Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California told CNN. “We have plenty to attack them on.” On top of pushing back on the GOP claims, Democrats are using their spots on committees, even though they are in the minority, to go on offense, and are plotting messaging strategies of their own. Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who serves on the Oversight Committee, criticized Republicans for their snap investigations into Harris and Walz. “All of a sudden, the only three weeks we are going to be there, we are opening up all these new things?” Moskowitz said. Framing the Democratic strategy on these committees, Moskowitz added: “We pivot, we go on the offense, we don’t play defense.” Earlier this month, House Oversight Committee Democrats launched an investigation into whether Trump received $10 million from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as part of his 2016 presidential campaign, the latest example of Democrats investigating the potential foreign influence over Trump. The Democratic working group that has spearheaded messaging against Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that has attracted considerable blowback in Trump’s race for the White House, also has a slew of messaging events planned over the next month, multiple sources told CNN. While Trump continues to deny any involvement with Project 2025, Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee are preparing to continue to highlight examples where they see evidence of the right wing blueprint in Republican funding proposals in Congress."
Inside Kamala Harris’ yearslong crash course in foreign diplomacy | CNN Politics,"Published 2:00 PM EDT, Sun September 8, 2024",2024-09-08T18:00:19.622Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/kamala-harris-foreign-diplomacy/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris has met more than 150 world leaders since becoming vice president. But a July sit-down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt different. Coming days after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race and as Democrats were coalescing around her candidacy, perhaps no other sit-down would garner as much attention or carry as much weight. “We have a lot to talk about,” she said, before dismissing reporters — the exact same words Biden used to begin his own meeting. But Harris’ were delivered in a manner that said something entirely different. The moment, which amounted to Harris’s debut on the world stage as the Democratic standard-bearer, captured the complicated dynamics that have colored her foreign policy ambitions, and offered a preview of the type of statesmanship she would pursue as president. By virtue of her position as vice president to a commander in chief whose “first love” was foreign policy, according to his aides, Harris had little room over the past three-and-a-half years to stake out her own distinct doctrine or worldview. Instead, she has hewn closely to the views of her boss, even as she’s become more involved over time in the US response to various roiling global conflicts. In meetings and on trips abroad, she’s acted as a clean-up artist and bearer of bad news on behalf of Biden, traditional roles for a vice president. Republicans, led by Donald Trump, have argued Harris sat alongside Biden as the world went up in flames. They point to her assertion, made during an interview on CNN, that she was the last person in the room as Biden was deciding to go ahead with his planned US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which ended in chaos and deadly violence. Harris said in the interview that she was comfortable with Biden’s decision and praised the president’s “courage” in making it. On the campaign trail, she’s argued that Trump’s “chaotic actions” as president led to “catastrophic consequences” in Afghanistan. Harris herself has shown little daylight between herself and her boss. Asked directly during an August CNN interview – twice – whether she would be doing anything differently than the current president on the Middle East, Harris offered few specifics beyond pointing to a long-negotiated hostage and ceasefire deal. “No,” she told Dana Bash. “I – we have to get a deal done. Dana, we have to get a deal done.” Yet for all the close ties between Biden and Harris on the world stage, there are some signs she would not act entirely as a carbon copy of her former boss’s approach. As vice president, she has been a booster for important allies that Biden did not have time to lavish his full attention upon. And she has been a louder voice for causes that haven’t always received the full spotlight of the presidency — in particular the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Harris’ unusual step of delivering remarks following her July meeting with Netanyahu was a move she would not likely have made were Biden still running for a second term. White House officials made a concerted decision to allow her short statement to stand as the only substantive comment following Netanyahu’s visit. While reiterating her steadfast support for Israel – as she had done every time the issue arose over the previous 10 months – she also struck an urgent tone on the plight of the Palestinians. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering,” Harris said outside her ceremonial office, next door to the White House, “and I will not be silent.” Senior White House officials – even as they insisted that there was no daylight between the president and vice president when it comes to Middle East policy – have more readily acknowledged over the last year that their respective tones when discussing the Israel-Hamas war were, in fact, distinct. “They have different styles, is the reality, when it comes to expressing themselves,” one senior Biden adviser said earlier this year on how the president and Harris tended to publicly discuss the ongoing conflict. As a result, the vice president’s public statements criticizing Israel’s handling of the Gaza conflict and lamenting the plight of Palestinian civilians had, more than once since the onset of the war, raised questions about whether Harris was on a different page from Biden. Harris herself has been sensitive to that scrutiny. As one senior Democrat close to the vice president put it, Harris “understands that there’s a perception that she is left of (Biden) on Israel.” Privately, this Democrat said, the vice president has insisted that she believes it is possible to be both “strongly pro-Israel” and capable of articulating the belief that “this fight is not with the Palestinian people.” Last December, the vice president also traveled to the Middle East to attend a climate summit – and juggled multiple high stakes meetings and calls with Arab leaders amid heightening tensions, marking her foray into wartime diplomacy and forcefully sending a message of restraint. As the Israel-Hamas war has unfolded, Harris has displayed a genuine desire to take the pulse of the Arab American community in the US, sources familiar with her engagements said. Harris has made phone calls to Arab American leaders in the US to understand their perspective and to listen to their criticism of the Biden administration’s policy approach to the conflict, explained two sources. Some have been shocked to receive a call from the vice president, they said. A Harris aide said that as vice president, she has “strongly condemned Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack on October 7, denounced atrocious acts of sexual violence, advocated relentlessly to bring the hostages home, and worked to ensure Israel remains a secure, democratic and Jewish state.” Harris did not enter the job with vast experience on the world stage. Both her advisers and foreign officials she’s interacted with say Harris managed to take what was essentially a supporting role and turn it into a crash course in foreign diplomacy. One former senior adviser described the vice president taking home massive briefing books and often peppering staffers with questions as she was briefed on multiple foreign policy issues. She began, some said, rather scripted and uncertain but emerged within her first year in office a more confident voice. In meetings, she can appear alternatively warm – searching for commonalities over food or family – and steely, as she holds a firm line on US policy. Harris advisers argue nothing could have better prepared her to step onto the global stage, should she to win the election in November, than her time as vice president. They point to her travels abroad, meetings with world leaders and the time that she has spent with Biden navigating a number of major foreign policy crises – including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza – as giving her a certain gravitas that she did not have when she was first seeking the presidency in 2020. Harris has visited 21 countries in her current role, according to an aide, and met with more than 150 world leaders — including China’s President Xi Jinping, with whom Biden has long sought to cultivate more stable ties. “There’s no better preparation to be president of the United States than what the vice president has done over the past three-and-a-half years,” a senior administration official said. Still, Harris has not always been the first phone call for foreign leaders or officials looking to get a line into the White House. Others on Biden’s team, including his secretary of state and national security adviser, have been seen as more central to American decision making, according to diplomats. As she heads toward November’s election on a swell of Democratic momentum, some foreign governments are looking to know her better. In the run-up to this month’s United Nations General Assembly, the yearly marathon of diplomacy that brings a parade of foreign leaders to New York, dozens of countries have been reaching out in hopes of setting up a meeting with Harris, multiple US officials said. Some countries have even offered to accommodate or change their schedules to lock in a meeting with her. Harris currently does not plan to travel up to New York for the assembly, a source familiar with the plans said. As she has done in previous years, it’s possible she will take time to meet with foreign leaders who are visiting the US for the UN gathering in Washington, DC. US diplomats said it would be to her benefit to sit down with world leaders, but they also understand her team is deciding whether she can afford to be off the campaign trail. “Every second she is not in Michigan or Pennsylvania is a loss. It is a cost-benefit analysis,” said one US official. Among those who have worked most closely with Harris on foreign policy matters over the past three-and-a-half years and seen as the vice president’s foreign policy brain trust are Phil Gordon, her national security adviser; Rebecca Lissner, her principal deputy national security adviser; and Dean Lieberman, her deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. One stalwart of the Biden national security brain trust – with whom Harris held periodic lunch meetings to discuss foreign affairs – suggested this week he would not stay on for a potential Harris presidency. “All I’m looking at right now is the balance of this administration, in January,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the conclusion of a news conference in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. “And I can tell you, from having spent some time over the last week on bit of a break with my kids, I will relish having a lot more time with them.” When asked where the vice president’s foreign policy views may ultimately differ from Biden’s, her advisers insist that so long as she is in her current job, they would decline to address what they see as “hypothetical policy questions.” “She remains the vice president of the United States and stands by the Biden-Harris administration policies,” Lieberman said. That is certainly the case, he added, when it comes to the vice president’s views on the Israel-Hamas war. A month after Russia invaded Ukraine, Harris was dispatched to NATO’s eastern flank on a reassurance mission – one that also came with some sensitive diplomatic smoothing-over. Moments before she took off for Poland, a rift had emerged between Warsaw and Washington over the transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine. Aboard Air Force Two, Harris took a phone call from Biden, making sure she was up to speed on the matter. In meetings with leaders, both in Poland and a later stop in Romania, Harris sought both to assert American support for Ukraine and its NATO allies while avoiding any public spat. For a foreign policy novice with aspirations for higher office, the war in Ukraine was a rigorous introduction to wartime diplomacy. Days before the 2022 invasion by Russia, Harris met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference and discussed with him the latest American intelligence about what might be coming. She has met with Zelensky six times in total since the war began. “The Zelensky meeting was a pivotal moment in her journey of leading on foreign policy,” said Nancy McEldowney, who served as national security advisor to Harris from 2021 to early 2022. “In that meeting, we conducted an unprecedented exchange of detailed intelligence,” McEldowney recalled of the hourslong meeting. “We laid out all of the information, and then talked about what it meant and talked about how the Ukrainians could respond.” Speaking at the Munich Security Conference the following year in 2023, Harris said Russia had committed crimes against humanity. Still, while Harris attended the Munich forum as the top Biden administration official twice and met with Zelensky each time, the Ukrainians were frustrated both times when they learned that she was being sent instead of Biden, sources said. In their view, there was no evidence that Harris was – at either time – deeply involved in US policymaking when it came to the war. During Harris’s meeting with the Ukrainians at Munich in 2024, one private message she delivered was that the US urged the Ukrainians to stop hitting Russian energy inside of Russia, sources said. This was not the first time the Ukrainians had heard the message from US officials, but Harris delivered the message empathically and they were not thrilled, sources said. Today, Ukrainian officials don’t know exactly what to expect from a Harris presidency if she wins the election. “They don’t see her as solid as Biden when it comes to supporting Ukraine. Their best bet is that she will uphold that status quo of US support,” said one source close to the Ukrainians. “Vice President Harris has been a strong proponent of enduring US support for Ukraine and has repeatedly expressed an unwavering commitment to support the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal aggression. She has vowed to continue to support Ukraine and impose costs on Russia,” an aide to the vice president said. As the US sought to repair the relationship with France after the rollout of a submarine deal that didn’t include the old European ally, the Biden administration sent a number of high-ranking officials to Paris: Blinken, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and then climate envoy John Kerry. The Biden administration then decided to send Harris as the final visitor, which a European official described as a very successful crescendo. Harris spent four days in the country and developed a “good personal relationship” with French President Emmanuel Macron, the official said. “At the time she was perceived to not have much experience, but she gave off a really good impression,” the official said. “She displayed what is rare in high-level politicians: She took her time.” Indeed, unlike Biden – who rarely departed from his schedule of meetings to take in any culture during his trips abroad – Harris made time for a quintessentially Parisian pursuit: Shopping. Stopping at the E. Dehillerin, the famous cookware shop on Rue Coquilliere near the Louvre, Harris declared she needed some pots for her Thanksgiving meal. Pointing to the racks of copper ware, she inquired – in French – whether they had a smaller model: “Comme ça, mais plus petit?”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff went for a walk in Pittsburgh on Sunday as she remains in the area preparing for Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia. Asked by reporters if she’s ready to debate former President Donald Trump, Harris gave a thumbs-up and said, “I’m ready.” Harris also stepped out for a break Saturday, briefly meeting voters at a local business. When the House Judiciary Committee held a field hearing on Friday to highlight the impact border security issues have on local communities, Vice President Kamala Harris was underlying their line of attack. Four months ago, when the panel held a similar field hearing in North Dakota, the vice president was not mentioned by name once. The shift, both in branding and messaging from the “Biden Border Crisis” to the “Biden-Harris Border Crisis” underscores how House Republicans are pivoting to specifically target Harris now that she is the Democratic nominee. As Congress embarks on a three-week sprint before its next recess, both parties return to Washington, DC, for a final messaging push dictated by the dynamics of the presidential race — while also trying to balance the critical September 30 government funding deadline. Democrats, who dismiss the GOP attacks as a last-ditch effort, are using their spots on committees to go on offense despite being in the minority. Earlier this month, House Oversight Committee Democrats launched an investigation into whether Trump received $10 million from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as part of his 2016 presidential campaign. And the Democratic working group that has spearheaded messaging against Project 2025, the controversial conservative policy blueprint, has a slew of messaging events planned over the next month, multiple sources told CNN. Read more here about the presidential election’s influence on Congress Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be in Philadelphia for the presidential debate on Tuesday as a surrogate for former President Donald Trump, a spokesperson for Kennedy tells CNN. Kennedy will appear in the spin room — where supporters of each candidate put their “spin” on the debate in conversations with media — on behalf of Trump, according to the spokesperson. Kennedy endorsed Trump and suspended his independent White House bid last month, urging his supporters to back the former president. Trump has said Kennedy would play a role in his administration if he is elected. Kennedy’s alliance with Trump came after a long history of attacking the former president. Trump’s running mate: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance will also hit the spin room Tuesday, after attending a Philadelphia debate watch party hosted by the Trump campaign, according to a source familiar with the plans. Earlier on Tuesday, Vance has a fundraiser in Greenville, North Carolina.  CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with Vance’s plans for Tuesday evening. Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said “it’s not helpful” in closing the GOP’s gap with women voters when the party’s vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, comments on childless women. Remember: Vance has been criticized for past comments about women and parenthood, particularly a 2021 comment saying Democratic politicians are “childless cat ladies.” Haley also referenced a more recently resurfaced comment Vance made in 2021 about the head of a powerful teacher’s union, who he suggested “should have some of her own” children if she wants to “brainwash” kids in school. On Trump: Haley said she disagreed greatly with former President Donald Trump’s style but was supporting him on policy — and in contrast to the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. Haley said she disagrees with Trump’s child care tax credits, favoring tax cuts across the board. She also disagreed with mandating insurance companies or the federal government to pay for fertility treatments. Haley said Trump’s team has not asked her to campaign or to advise on debate prep but said “I’m happy to be helpful,” if Trump asked. A July sit-down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became Vice President Kamala Harris’ debut on the world stage. Despite having met with more than 150 world leaders since becoming VP, this meeting felt different. “We have a lot to talk about,” she said, before dismissing reporters ahead of the meeting, a moment that captured the complicated dynamics that have colored her foreign policy ambitions, and offered a preview of the type of statesmanship she would pursue as president. Harris did not enter the job with vast experience on the world stage. Both advisers and foreign officials she’s interacted with say Harris managed to take what was essentially a supporting role and turn it into a crash course in foreign diplomacy. One former senior adviser described the vice president taking home massive briefing books and often peppering staffers with questions as she was briefed on multiple foreign policy issues. She began, some said, rather scripted and uncertain but emerged within her first year in office as a more confident voice. In meetings, she can appear alternatively warm – searching for commonalities over food or family – and steely, as she holds a firm line on US policy. Harris advisers argue nothing could have better prepared her to step onto the global stage, should she win the election in November, than her time as vice president. Read more about how Harris has carved out her foreign policy path here. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock on Sunday said school shootings are not a “fact of life,” but rather a “fact of American life,” after four people were killed at Apalachee High School on Wednesday. The senator’s comments are in response to recent remarks made by Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who lamented school shootings being “a fact of life” and called for greater campus security. Warnock says he’ll continue to push for passing gun control laws, something he says Americans want and has bipartisan support, but said they “can’t even have a debate about that in the Senate.”   Warnock was in Winder, Georgia, on Friday and told CNN that he spoke with the family of 14-year-old victim Christian Angulo. Some background: Children ages 1 to 19 die from guns more than anything else in the US, studies show. American kids face the highest gun violence mortality rate among peer countries by far, according to a public health declaration by the US surgeon general earlier this year. In the US, there were 36.4 deaths per million people ages 1 to 19; in Canada, its 6.2 per million; in Australia, it’s 1.6 per million; and in the UK, it’s 0.5 per million, according to provisional data from 2022. A new CNN Poll of Polls including polls conducted since the Democratic National Convention finds a tight race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris has an average of 49% support in the new Poll of Polls, while Trump has 47% across polls conducted between August 23 and Sept. 6. The new average is largely unchanged from the previous average, which found Harris at 50% to Trump at 48%. The Poll of Polls includes the four most recent national polls measuring the views of registered or likely voters in a 2024 presidential general election. Takeaways from one of the polls: A New York Times and Siena College poll of likely voters conducted from September 3 to 6 showed 48% say they support Trump to 47% for Harris, with no clear leader. Other takeaways from the Times-Siena poll: Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he would go higher than the 28% capital gains tax hike proposed by Vice President Kamala Harris, but broadly defended her policy position changes in an interview Sunday. “I would go higher than that,” Sanders said of the tax hike on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Despite that disagreement, the progressive senator defended Harris’ recent shift to the center on key policies, saying he does not think she is “abandoning her ideals.” “I think she’s trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election,” Sanders said. And while he said the two do not always agree on the approach or the extent of policies, Sanders lauded Harris’ stances on making the child tax credit permanent, building affordable housing and passing the Pro Act to make it easier to join a union. Sanders also praised former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, for endorsing Harris. “Cheney and I agree on nothing, no issues, but what we do believe in is that the United States should retain its democratic foundations. And it’s not just Cheney. I think there is a significant number of Republicans that say, ‘Well, you know, I may not agree with the vice president on this issue or that issue, but I cannot support somebody who is a pathological liar, somebody who fomented a insurrection to overthrow the election returns,’” he said. Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday argued voting for former President Donald Trump or writing in a name in November is a decision to “abandon the Constitution.” Cheney said in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week” that too many elected Republicans have reduced the 2024 race to a “partisan choice” — but “that’s not what we’re facing this time around.” The onetime Republican leader, who said last week that she’ll vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, said she’s been “voting for 40 years. My first vote I ever cast was for Ronald Reagan in 1984. I’ve never voted for a Democrat.” Asked whether she’d be able to endorse Harris if Harris still promoted the same policy positions as in 2019, Cheney said the vice president has “changed in a number of very important ways on issues that matter” since she first ran for president. The former Wyoming congresswoman argued that Trump isn’t a conservative, pointing to his global tariffs proposal. Liz Cheney’s father, former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, has also endorsed Harris due to what he describes as Trump’s “threat to our republic.” Republican critics: Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders later told ABC that Liz Cheney is “significantly in the minority” among members of the GOP. “You don’t get to call yourself a conservative or a Republican when you support the most radical nominee that the Democrats have ever put up,” Sanders said. This post has been updated with comments by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders. CNN’s Sarah Davis contributed to this post. Former Vice President Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and a recent alleged Russian operation to interfere with the US election are not “going to make the difference” in the presidential race, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said Sunday.   “It is a remarkable time in politics — you have Dick Cheney endorsing a Democrat, you have a Kennedy endorsing a Republican,” Cotton said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” representing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “But in the end, endorsements are not going to make the difference in this race.”  The Arkansas senator’s comments come after Cheney said on Friday that he plans to vote for Harris over Donald Trump, warning that the former president “can never be trusted with power again.”  Asked about an alleged Russian government effort to influence the US presidential election — detailed by the Department of Justice last week — Cotton, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he doesn’t see it making a difference.   “People should not knowingly take money from the government of Russia or Iran or China or any other adversarial nation to try to influence the election,” Cotton responded. “But using money to try to promote memes or videos on the internet is not exactly going to make a huge difference,” he later added. Key context: Current and former US officials tell CNN that rather than relying on fake accounts and bogus online personas, Russia’s alleged efforts in 2024 have involved coopting real American influencers to try to push Russian narratives to US audiences, particularly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman says his prediction that replacing President Joe Biden in the 2024 election would help former president Donald Trump did not come to fruition, but maintained in an interview Sunday that Biden still could have won. Fetterman was one of Biden’s biggest defenders following the latter’s disastrous debate performance over the summer. The Pennsylvania senator lauded Democratic nominee Kamala Harris but said the election will come down to the vice president successfully presenting a “stark choice” between herself and Trump. State of the race: A new CNN Poll of Polls finds a tight contest between Trump and Harris, with no clear leader ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg — a one-time presidential candidate who ran for the Democratic nomination against Kamala Harris — says the vice president will need “almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate.” The former president and Harris will meet on the debate stage Tuesday in a showdown broadcast by ABC. Buttigieg called debating Trump an “extremely challenging task in the face of all of the distraction, whatever outrageous things he does and says, because they will require a response, and yet you can’t allow him to change the subject.” He described Harris as “extremely smart about getting to the core of an issue” and someone who focuses on “how is this going to affect somebody at home.” He also took a shot at Trump’s highly scrutinized response to a question on child care policy earlier this week, saying “it wasn’t clear whether he even understood the question.” Asked at an economic forum whether he would address rising child care costs for parents, Trump downplayed the problem and responded by touting his policy on tariffs, without clarifying how the two would be connected. As the election approaches, there’s another focus on Democrats’ minds: keeping control of the Senate. The party needs to hold all their seats — other than West Virginia, which is almost certain to flip to the GOP — in order to simply keep a 50-50 Senate. That means Democrats can’t afford a slip-up in a purple state like Pennsylvania, given they already have to defend seats in red states like Ohio and Montana. But in Pennsylvania, Sen. Bob Casey is bracing for a GOP onslaught. After a summer where he and his GOP opponent, David McCormick, have engaged in a brutal exchange of attacks in the marquee US Senate race in Pennsylvania, leaving the race in a dead heat, Republicans are preparing to drop more than $100 million across the airwaves in the final two months of the campaign. While Casey still predicted he would pull off a November victory and contended that he didn’t “care what they spend,” he said: “I don’t have a personal super PAC funded by Wall Street billionaires. … It’s going to be a really difficult race to win.” Read more about how Democrats are hoping to hold on to the Senate here. Vice President Kamala Harris will return to the campaign trail in North Carolina and Pennsylvania following next week’s debate, looking to harness what she hopes will be a wave of momentum following the televised showdown. The stops are part of a battleground state push by Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and their respective spouses dubbed the New Way Forward tour.  The Harris campaign says the swing will include events “in every media market in every battleground state in just four days.” Here are some of the stops the team will make: “With early voting about to begin and less than 60 days until Election Day, our campaign will take the vice president’s message directly to the voters wherever they are – on the airwaves, on the doors, and online,” Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said. The campaign will also begin airing a new television ad in battlegrounds focused on Harris’ economic proposals to lower costs.  Harris has been hunkered down in Pittsburgh this weekend preparing for the debate, keeping her mostly off the campaign trail. She did make some local stops in the area on Saturday. The start of voting in North Carolina, which was scheduled to begin Friday with the mailing of absentee ballots, has been delayed due to legal proceedings surrounding the removal of former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot. An appeals court ordered the state to remove Kennedy’s name last week, but North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has now appealed that ruling to the state Supreme Court. In its appeal, lawyers for the elections board said the change to the ballot at such a late stage has thrown the “elections process into chaos,” and that while it has already begun recoding ballots without RFK Jr., a quick reversal by the state’s highest court could still “avoid most of the irreparable harm.” Why this matters: Kennedy dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Removing his name from the ballot is part of a strategy to ensure voters don’t still vote for Kennedy despite the independent’s urging to now back his unlikely ally. North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request to remove his name, saying it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting. Kennedy challenged the decision in court, and that’s led to the events now holding up the state’s electoral process. Former President Donald Trump touched on familiar talking points as he spoke during a campaign rally at an airfield in central Wisconsin on Saturday, projecting confidence about Tuesday’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris while shouting out allies Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Here’s some of what Trump said during the rally: Changing the 25th Amendment: Trump called for modifying the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and said if a vice president covers for the “incapacity of the president” they should be removed from office. It was part of an attack on Harris, who he accuses of a “cover-up” of President Joe Biden’s fitness for office before he eventually dropped out of the race. On the debate: Trump said the country is run by “stupid people” and that we “found that out at the debate with Joe (Biden).” “We’re going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?” Trump asked the crowd. The former president predicted that pundits would say he lost the debate, even “if I destroy her.” Praising RFK Jr.: Trump repeatedly praised Kennedy, saying that with his help, “we’ll take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC, World Health Organization and other institutions of public health.” Kennedy, the former independent presidential candidate who has embraced conspiracy theories about vaccines and other issues, has been positioned by the former president to helm a panel investigating chronic health problems in a potential second Trump administration. On Boeing and SpaceX: Trump said the Boeing Starliner crew being stuck in space is “embarrassing,” and that Musk, the SpaceX CEO, is “going to have to save them.” Trump continued his public praise of the tech billionaire amid the tightening alliance between the two men.  “He’s very good at what he does,” Trump said of Musk. “Leon’s going to send up a rocket, he looks forward to it,” he added, apparently misstating his ally’s first name. The praise of Musk comes days after Trump announced he would appoint Musk to head a newly created government efficiency commission if reelected. Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Rep. Liz Cheney, calling the prominent Republicans’ backing a rebuke of the “attempts to kind of divide us as Americans.” “I’m honored to have their endorsement,” she told reporters during a visit to a spice shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “They both as leaders who are well-respected are making an important statement that it’s OK and if not important to put country above party,” she added. Harris says she’s ready for debate: Harris visited Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh as a brief respite from debate preparations, where she greeted supporters and perused merchandise. Harris told reporters the “best part” of debate preparations was getting a chance to visit the store. Harris suggested her main focus in next week’s debate with former President Donald Trump is to communicate with voters that it’s “time to turn the page on divisiveness.” When asked if she’s ready to debate Trump, she replied, “Yes I am. Yes.” During her visit to the store, Harris greeted roughly a dozen customers and took a tour, guided by one of the shop’s employees."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday attacked Ohio Sen. JD Vance for reacting to the Georgia school shooting this week by expressing regret that school shootings are a “fact of life.” At a Washington, DC, event focused on LGBTQ rights, Walz chastised Republicans who seek to restrict books with LGBTQ themes out of fear they will “turn your children gay.” In criticizing the book bans implemented in some states, Walz referenced Vance’s comments to highlight Republicans’ policy priorities.  “This is what these folks are focusing on, spending all their time, like reading about two male penguins who love each other is — is somehow going to turn your children gay, and that’s what you should worry about,” Walz said during his address at the Human Rights Campaign’s national dinner in Washington, DC. Walz went out to tout his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ record of defending LGBTQ rights while frequently attacking Vance and former President Donald Trump for positions that Walz argued infringe on those rights. The Democratic vice presidential nominee also attacked Vance over his and Trump’s positions on protecting access to reproductive health care.  Former President Donald Trump touched on familiar talking points as he spoke during a campaign rally at an airfield in central Wisconsin on Saturday, projecting confidence about Tuesday’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris while shouting out allies Elon Musk and Robert F.

The praise of Musk comes days after Trump announced he would appoint Musk to head a newly created government efficiency commission if reelected. The ballot in Colorado: Trump said people in Colorado should “do a major protest vote” in favor of him because of the failed efforts to remove him from the ballot, which had cited the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist clause in relation to the January 6 Capitol riot. Former President Donald Trump on Saturday called for modifying the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and said if a vice president covers for the “incapacity of the president” they should be removed from office. Since President Joe Biden suspended his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump and his Republican allies have accused Vice President Kamala Harris and others at the White House of engaging in a cover-up to hide the state of the president’s mental fitness. “You know, think of it — if he didn’t go to that debate, he’d still be running,” Trump added, referencing Biden’s poor debate performance in June. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is marking the five-year anniversary of a series of social media posts in which former President Donald Trump said he’d invited Taliban leaders to Camp David to meet with him and the president of Afghanistan, arguing that Trump’s “chaotic actions” led to the “catastrophic consequences” in Afghanistan. In a statement on Saturday, Harris campaign national security spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein cited Trump’s handling of Afghanistan as an example of foreign policy that “put our troops in harm’s way.” The statement comes as Trump and his allies have repeatedly sought to link Harris to the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Remember: In September 2019, Trump said Taliban leaders were set to travel to the US for secret peace talks but that the meeting was canceled and he called off peace talks with the militant group entirely. Trump posted on Twitter, now X, that he scrapped the meeting after the Taliban took credit for an attack in Kabul that killed a dozen people, including an American soldier. More context: Trump promised to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan during his presidency. His administration set the final withdrawal in motion by negotiating and signing a deal with the Taliban in 2020 that stipulated the drawdown of US service members in Afghanistan. After Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he fired his defense secretary at the time, Mark Esper, purged many top officials at the Pentagon and tried to further accelerate US drawdowns, both in Afghanistan and in Europe. Biden reversed the drawdown of service members in Europe but delayed by only a few months Trump’s plans to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan, despite worsening conditions on the ground and rapid gains by the Taliban. Retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser under Trump, said last month that his onetime boss bears some responsibility for what was ultimately a chaotic withdrawal. CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Rep. Liz Cheney, calling the prominent Republicans’ backing a rebuke of the “attempts to kind of divide us as Americans.” “I’m honored to have their endorsement,” she told reporters during a visit to a spice shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “They both as leaders who are well-respected are making an important statement that it’s OK and if not important to put country above party,” she added. Harris says she’s ready for debate: Harris visited Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh as a brief respite from debate preparations, where she greeted supporters and perused merchandise. Harris told reporters the “best part” of debate preparations was getting a chance to visit the store. Harris suggested her main focus in next week’s debate with former President Donald Trump is to communicate with voters that it’s “time to turn the page on divisiveness.” When asked if she’s ready to debate Trump, she replied, “Yes I am. Yes.” During her visit to the store, Harris greeted roughly a dozen customers and took a tour, guided by one of the shop’s employees. One woman was particularly overwhelmed upon meeting the vice president when she arrived at the store. “It’s gonna be good,” Harris replied. “We are all in this together.” Former President Donald Trump was asked how he would bring down the cost of child care — which is a barrier to people having children and a major drain on parents — at a talk with the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. His response could accurately be described as a ramble without an answer, and it’s worth looking closer at an issue that affects so many Americans. Trump got off to a good start, referencing a provision in his tax cut law that doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child for millions of Americans, according to a CNN fact check. Trump’s doubling of the credit is set to expire next year, so this will be a key issue for whoever wins the White House. Then things stopped making much sense. He dismissed the issue as ultimately not a very big problem, and not that expensive to fix compared with the money he will raise with his plan to place taxes, also known as tariffs, on all imports coming into the US: “We’re going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” Trump said. Hear that, parents? The cost of child care is small change compared with all the money the US is going to be bringing in from Trump’s tariffs. CNN’s Tami Luhby looked at the broad strokes of this claim and found it is not at all clear how that would work. Some economists fear higher tariffs could raise prices, hurt the economy and set off an international trade war. And what you didn’t hear from Trump is a concrete proposal for a tax credit or a program to transform those tariff dollars into help for affording child care. Read a breakdown of Trump’s response line-by-line. The race to Election Day in November is on. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have picked their running mates and held nominating conventions to rally their parties. They have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. And they’re now gearing up to meet on the debate stage in just three days. We don’t know specifically what will happen between now and Election Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect: The Democratic National Committee is flying planes over college football games in Midwestern battleground states featuring banners linking former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance to the conservative policy platform Project 2025. The DNC banners flew over home football games at the University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University, and are planning to fly an additional advertisement over University of Wisconsin’s stadium later today. The banners are the latest effort by Democrats to tie Trump to the controversial platform. Over the University of Wisconsin stadium later today, the DNC will fly a banner that references an in-stadium tradition, reading “Jump Around! Beat Trump + Project 2025.” Trump has previously enjoyed warm welcomes at red state college games. More background on Project 2025: The former president has said he has “no idea” who is behind the 900-page playbook for a potential second Trump term published by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation. But a CNN review found at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, including six of his former Cabinet secretaries, four individuals who were nominated as ambassadors, and his first deputy chief of staff. Over the last few decades, a growing number of Christians have left traditional, predominantly White evangelical churches. Some have left Christianity altogether, while others have joined communities that preach inclusivity, are affirming of LGBTQ rights, and take a social justice approach to the major moral issues of the times — from racial equality to the plight of refugees. The post-evangelical movement predates former President Donald Trump’s political rise, but has been accelerated by his alliance with White conservative evangelical leaders. It’s also part of a broader community of Christians who’ve been turned off by mainstream evangelicalism’s embrace of Republican politics — a group Democrats are hoping to make inroads with in November in battleground states. The evangelical label covers a broad swath of Christian denominations and people of all races. But politically, the predominant image of an evangelical Christian has become a White conservative who votes Republican; opposes same-sex marriage and abortion; and, in the last eight years, supports Trump. Trump critics have said his personal conduct — such as his divorces, his alleged affair with an adult film star and a verdict that found him liable for sexual abuse — are in sharp contrast with the evangelical emphasis on traditional family structures. Still, Trump has maintained overwhelming support among White evangelicals since consolidating their support during the 2016 Republican primary. But liberals are also seeking to gain ground with White evangelical voters. The group Evangelicals for Harris has launched a digital ad campaign to explicitly boost turnout for the vice president. The campaign also plans to organize at hundreds of churches. Read more about the acceleration of the post-evangelical movement We are just a few days away from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump meeting on the debate stage, and the 2024 presidential campaigns will be busy this weekend ahead of Tuesday’s closely watched event in Philadelphia. Here’s what we know about the Harris and Trump teams’ plans today: Kamala Harris’ campaign accepted the terms of Tuesday’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. ABC News officially announced the rules on Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Here are the rules of the debate: In a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the letter from the Harris campaign to the network, shared in part with CNN, said. The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. Tune in to CNN’s special coverage of the ABC debate on Tuesday night. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a new series of ads ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate, tying former President Donald Trump to 2022’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the slew of abortion bans that followed. The three ads, which feature archival clips of Trump touting his role in overturning Roe and suggesting “some form of punishment” for women seeking abortions, are part of a $370 million TV and digital ad buy between Labor Day and Election Day. Trump made the statement about punishment in a 2016 interview and subsequently walked it back after widespread condemnation from presidential rivals and even leading anti-abortion groups. These are the first abortion-focused ads since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket. That was intentional, one official tells CNN, as early ads were focused on introducing and defining Harris. The campaign is now expanding to paid media that will draw contrast with Trump — including on the issue of reproductive rights, which they have long believed will be galvanizing to voters, particularly women. Per the campaign, one ad, titled “Told Us,” will air on TV in battleground media markets during primetime fall programming, while ads “Big Family” and “Laurel” — which feature Alabamian Latorya Beasley and Wisconsinite Laurel Marcinkus offering testimonials on how abortion bans in their states prevented them from accessing in vitro fertilization treatment and seeking abortion care — will air as digital spots. Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign increased its already blistering fundraising pace last month, bringing in $361 million in August and easily surpassing the $130 million raised by her Republican rival last month, her campaign said Friday. The total gives the Democrat a whopping $404 million in cash reserves for the final two-month sprint to Election Day. The cash stockpiled across Harris’ affiliated committees tops the $295 million that Trump’s political operation said it had available, and underscores how much Harris’ historic and late-breaking candidacy has energized donors. The $361 million is by far the best monthly haul for either party this cycle. If this rate continues, Harris is poised to collect more than $1 billion in the condensed campaign window between becoming the party’s de facto nominee in late July and Election Day. Former President Donald Trump echoed past falsehoods about the integrity of US elections and asked police officers to “watch for voter fraud” while addressing the nation’s largest law enforcement union on Friday in North Carolina. After receiving the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, Trump encouraged the officers gathered for his address in Charlotte to monitor for voter fraud because “they’re afraid of you people.” The comments are the latest instance of Trump warning of potential widespread voter fraud in the 2024 presidential election. He has repeatedly suggested without evidence that Democrats will commit voter fraud to swing the results of November’s election, tying the claims to his false conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Trump repeated the baseless accusations at another moment during his remarks, suggesting that he would win the election if an “honest” vote tabulator “came down from on high” to determine the results of the presidential election in each state.  Trump on crime: In accepting the endorsement from the police organization, the former president reiterated his support for local police departments to adopt “stop-and-frisk” policies, the controversial law enforcement tactic that has been linked with increased reports of racial profiling when utilized. He also expressed support for “broken windows policing,” a controversial crime reduction policy that strictly penalizes minor crimes. Trump suggested those policies have helped reduce crime rates when implemented in the past. Former President Donald Trump will not be sentenced in his New York criminal case until after the 2024 election, Judge Juan Merchan announced Friday, explaining that his decision to delay the sentencing is in part to avoid any appearance of affecting the outcome of the presidential race. Merchan wrote in a new four-page letter that he would sentence Trump on November 26 – if necessary – in response to a request from Trump’s lawyers to push back the sentencing. Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult-film star alleging an affair with the former president. But Trump’s sentencing has been on hold for months after Trump’s lawyers have pushed to have the conviction tossed because of the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. Merchan noted the upcoming presidential election in his decision to delay sentencing, saying that part of his reason for doing so was to avoid the appearance that the sentencing was intended to influence the November election. In addition to pushing back the sentencing until November 26, Merchan wrote that he would decide on Trump’s motion to vacate the verdict because of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision on November 12, which is also after the election. Merchan wrote in his letter that the Supreme Court “rendered a historic and intervening decision” with its immunity ruling."
Dick Cheney says he’s voting for Harris in November and Trump ‘can never be trusted with power again’ | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:09 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",2024-09-06T19:32:05.562Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/dick-cheney-kamala-harris-president/index.html,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Friday that he will vote for Democrat Kamala Harris over fellow Republican Donald Trump in the November election, warning that the former president “can never be trusted with power again.” “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a statement. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.” “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he concluded. Harris, according to a statement from campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, was proud to receive Cheney’s support and “deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, first revealed earlier in the day that her father would be voting for the Democratic ticket during remarks at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas. The former Republican congresswoman previously announced that she would be voting for Harris, citing “the danger that Donald Trump poses.” In her remarks Friday, Cheney unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Republican presidential ticket, calling Trump “a depraved human being” and labeling him and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, “misogynistic pigs.” “Every Republican, anybody who’s contemplating casting a vote for that ticket, you know, really needs to think about what they are enabling, what they’re embracing and the danger of electing people who will only honor election results if they agree with the outcome, and who are willing to set aside the Constitution,” she said in Austin. “And you know in the case of Donald Trump, promote, provoke, exploit violence in order to seize power.” Trump, in turn, wrote on his Trump Social platform that “Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter,” referring to the Cheneys as “Republican in name only.” The former congresswoman, who previously told CNN she was committed to doing what was necessary to stop Trump from returning to the White House, said Friday that she expected to campaign against the former president in battleground states this fall. And she suggested that her father shared her views about Trump. “If you think about the moment that we’re in and you think about how serious this moment is, you know, my dad believes – and he said publicly – that there’s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,” she said. Dick Cheney’s support for Harris represents a stunning move for the staunch conservative who was vice president to George W. Bush and a longtime congressman from Wyoming who held several leadership roles in the House Republican Caucus. The former vice president was critical of his party and Trump in the wake of the January 6 attack. In campaign ads for his daughter’s 2022 reelection effort, he called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward.” “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” Dick Cheney said of the former president in the ad. His daughter’s outspokenness against Trump and the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election – including her vote to impeach him led to her losing her leadership position as the No. 3 House Republican. The GOP caucus ousted her as conference chair in May 2021 and replaced her with New York’s Elise Stefanik, a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6 attack. Liz Cheney went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot and ultimately lost her seat in Congress to a Trump-backed Republican primary challenger. She argued Friday that Trump and Vance were “doing everything they can to drive Reagan Republicans away” and that the duo “certainly do not reflect the importance of that Reagan philosophy of peace through strength and a strong national defense.” Cheney said she watched parts of the Republican National Convention in July and took away that “it isn’t just that the party is trying to whitewash what Donald Trump did … the party is embracing it.” Speaking about her decision to support Harris, Cheney said while she has “serious policy disagreements on a whole range of issues,” she feels that “those of us who believe in the defense of our democracy, in the defense of our Constitution, and the survival of our republic have a duty in this election cycle to come together to put those things above politics.” In addition to backing Harris, Cheney also endorsed Democratic Rep. Colin Allred’s effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. This headline and story have been updated with additional information."
Dozens of business leaders endorse Kamala Harris for president | CNN Business,"Updated 1:04 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",2024-09-06T17:03:08.966Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/business/ceos-support-kamala-harris/index.html,"Dozens of business leaders are throwing their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she is the stronger candidate for the American economy and the future of democracy. In a three-page letter, a group of 88 business leaders — including high-profile current and former executives from major public companies across tech, media, and finance — emphasized that they believe a Harris administration can better nurture the private sector. “Her election is the best way to support the continued strength, security, and reliability of our democracy and economy,” the open letter, which was first shared with CNBC, reads. The signees include notable executives such as James Murdoch, Mark Cuban and LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman. The endorsements underscore the support Harris has not only in Silicon Valley, a traditional Democratic stronghold, but in some corners on Wall Street and at some consumer-facing companies. The business leaders argued in the letter that as vice president, Harris advanced “actions to spur business investment in the United States and ensure American businesses can compete and win in the global market.” “She will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment, and she will strive to give every American the opportunity to pursue the American dream,” the letter reads. The signees include high-profile executives, including James Murdoch, the former 21st Century Fox CEO and son of Rupert Murdoch; Michael Lynton, the Snap chairman; Jeremy Stoppelman, the Yelp chief executive; Hoffman, the former LinkedIn chief executive; Jeff Lawson, the Twilio co-founder; Laurene Powell Jobs, the Emerson Collective chief executive; Mark Cuban, the entrepreneur and “Shark Tank” host; Peter Chernin, the TCG founder and former Fox chief operating officer; and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Wndr founder and managing partner and former Walt Disney Studios chairman. On the campaign trail, Harris has positioned herself as perhaps friendlier to business than President Joe Biden. She recently outlined her economy policy platform, which includes tax relief for small businesses. Harris also proposed increasing the long-term capital gains tax rate to 28% for wealthy Americans, a departure from Biden’s 2025 budget, which suggested an even higher rate. Trump has gained the support of a number of CEOs, too, including some prominent names in tech – most notably Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump in July. David Sacks, the billionaire tech investor, co-hosted a Trump fundraiser in June at his San Francisco home and spoke at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Other contributors to America PAC include the Winklevoss twins, Doug Leone of Sequoia Capital and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, according to Federal Election Commission filings. And venture capitalist Peter Thiel is a Trump supporter. The letter is a vote of confidence for Harris as she and former President Donald Trump appear neck and neck ahead of the November election. The endorsement also buoys Harris ahead of the September 10 ABC presidential debate."

Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley refused to say if she believed former President Donald Trump was a “good candidate” when pressed in a CBS News interview. The former South Carolina governor, who served under Trump as US ambassador to the United Nations, was a tough critic of her onetime boss during their primary fight but has since endorsed Trump in a show of party unity. Haley also said during the interview that she is “on standby” to campaign for Trump though she has not been officially asked. Haley also said she is not advising Trump at all on his debate preparation, adding, “That’s his choice.” Earlier today, Trump lashed out at E. Jean Carroll and several other women who have accused him of sexual assault following a hearing where the former president’s attorneys tried to convince a federal appeals court that he should get a new trial after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the onetime columnist. Asked if this is the best use of his time and what the message is to female voters, Haley said her focus has always been on policy, but she acknowledged she wouldn’t have run in the primary if she thought President Joe Biden or Trump were “great candidates.” “I’ve always said, look, if I thought Biden or Trump were great candidates, I wouldn’t have run for president. I ran because I thought I could do a better job.” The North Carolina State Board of Elections is asking the state Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court ruling which required the state to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot.  Ballots were supposed to start going out in North Carolina on Friday, but the appeals court order earlier in the day froze that process.  In a brief to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the state board wrote that the decision to remove Kennedy at this late stage “has thrown our State’s elections process into chaos.”  While the board says thatit has begun the process of recoding ballots without Kennedy’s name, its lawyers argue that a quick reversal from the Supreme Court would “avoid most of the irreparable harm” caused by the lower court ruling. Trump’s reaction: Former President Donald Trump has welcomed the decision, saying in remarks to a police union in the state earlier today that Kennedy’s request to be removed was part of their strategy to send Kennedy’s supporters to Trump. “He’s an incredible team player, and he didn’t want anybody to be voting his name, because, as you know, he fully endorsed us,” Trump said. If it wasn’t clear, Kamala Harris’ campaign is very unhappy about the muted mics rule at next week’s presidential debate with Donald Trump. For weeks, the vice president’s team has raised a fuss about one of the proposed debate rules that the candidates’ mics be muted when it is not their respective turns to speak. Her campaign finally and begrudgingly relented and accepted the rules earlier this week, but not without once again complaining that the muted mics rule would hurt Harris.   As the vice president hunkers down in Pittsburgh for the next stretch of days with advisers to prepare to face off against Trump, a source familiar tells CNN that remedying for the muted mics is a significant part of their mission.  Harris allies have pointed to some of her moments in committee hearings as a senator grilling the likes of Brett Kavanaugh or Bill Barr as exemplifying one of the vice president’s biggest political strengths. The campaign had hoped that she could display that in next week’s debate — responding to, interrupting and questioning the former president in real-time in what is expected to be a closely watched and highly anticipated debate. Her team had also hoped that the mics being on would hurt Trump by showing his more unhinged moments. “People forget how crazy and unhinged he is,” the source said, adding that they hope the muted mics would not have the effect of making the former president look more “restrained and disciplined” than he actually is. Former President Donald Trump echoed past falsehoods about the integrity of US elections and asked police officers to “watch for voter fraud” while addressing the nation’s largest law enforcement union on Friday in North Carolina.  After receiving the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, Trump encouraged the officers gathered for his address in Charlotte to monitor for voter fraud because “they’re afraid of you people.” The comments are the latest instance of Trump warning of potential widespread voter fraud in the 2024 presidential election. He has repeatedly suggested without evidence that Democrats will commit voter fraud to swing the results of November’s election, tying the claims to his false conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Trump repeated the baseless accusations at another moment during his remarks, suggesting that he would win the election if an “honest” vote tabulator “came down from on high” to determine the results of the presidential election in each state.  Trump on crime: In accepting the endorsement from the police organization, the former president reiterated his support for local police departments to adopt “stop-and-frisk” policies, the controversial law enforcement tactic that has been linked with increased reports of racial profiling when utilized. He also expressed support for “broken windows policing,” a controversial crime reduction policy that strictly penalizes minor crimes. Trump suggested those policies have helped reduce crime rates when implemented in the past. Tim Walz’s financial disclosure form highlights one of the things that makes him unusual as a modern political candidate: the relative simplicity of his financial life. The Democratic vice presidential candidate’s finances are straightforward and modest relative to the standards of many of those who have made their wealth in the private sector, according to his disclosure, released by the Federal Election Commission on Friday. Many recent political candidates for high office, by contrast, report millions in income and assets from multiple sources. Walz reported a $210,287 income from his job as governor of Minnesota from January of 2023 through August of this y﻿ear, and a bank account with between $15,000 and $50,000 in cash. He no longer owns a home or rental properties, which had been reflected on his tax returns in prior years. And he doesn’t report owning any individual stocks or bonds. But Walz does have a few retirement savings accounts, and he reported pension income that he will earn as a result of his years as a public school teacher. His six terms in Congress and his 24 years in the National Guard may also earn him pension income, although that is not required to be reported on the FEC form. Read more about Walz’s finances here. Former President Donald Trump reacted to the decision by a North Carolina appeals court that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name must be removed from the state’s ballot.  While speaking to the Fraternal Order of Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump welcomed the decision and said Kennedy pushed to withdraw from the ballot as part of their strategy to send Kennedy’s supporters to Trump. Trump expressed confidence that all of Kennedy’s supporters will vote for him in the state. “It means that all of those who love Bobby — and there’s a lot of them — and all that he stands for, especially regarding the health and well-being of us, can vote,” Trump said. “They vote for me now.” The North Carolina appeals court decision further delayed the start of early voting in the state, which was originally slated to begin today. Former Vice President Dick Cheney has released a statement confirming he will vote for Kamala Harris. The statement comes shortly after the former vice president’s daughter, Liz Cheney, said her father would back Harris during a lengthy interview in Texas, in which she called Trump “depraved” and urged Republicans to abandon the party’s nominee for the sake of democracy. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement that Harris is “proud” to receive Dick Cheney’s support, writing that she “deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” “[Cheney] joins hundreds of Republicans who are backing the Vice President and her patriotic vision of America over former President Trump, because, as Vice President Cheney said, the very future of our republic is at stake in this election,” O’Malley Dillon said. Trump’s response: Trump attacked the former vice president on his social media platform Truth Social, writing “Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter.” “He’s the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris,” Trump said of Dick Cheney while again attacking former Rep. Liz Cheney’s work on the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021 insurrection. This post has been updated with comments from Donald Trump and the Harris campaign. Former President Donald Trump was asked how he would bring down the cost of child care — which is a barrier to people having children and a major drain on parents — at a talk with the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. His response could accurately be described as a ramble without an answer, and it’s worth looking closer at an issue that affects so many Americans. Trump got off to a good start, referencing a provision in his tax cut law that doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child for millions of Americans, according to a CNN fact check. Trump’s doubling of the credit is set to expire next year, so this will be a key issue for whoever wins the White House. Then things stopped making much sense. He dismissed the issue as ultimately not a very big problem, and not that expensive to fix compared with the money he will raise with his plan to place taxes, also known as tariffs, on all imports coming into the US: Hear that, parents? The cost of child care is small change compared with all the money the US is going to be bringing in from Trump’s tariffs. CNN’s Tami Luhby looked at the broad strokes of this claim and found it is not at all clear how that would work. Some economists fear higher tariffs could raise prices, hurt the economy and set off an international trade war. And what you didn’t hear from Trump is a concrete proposal for a tax credit or a program to transform those tariff dollars into help for affording child care. Read a breakdown of Trump’s response line-by-line Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Republican presidential ticket — calling former President Donald Trump a “depraved human being” and labeling him and running mate JD Vance “misogynistic pigs.” Cheney, who has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, said she will campaign against Trump in key battleground states, though not as an official surrogate of Harris. The former House Republican called Trump and Vance “misogynistic pigs” and suggested that Vance has a “real women problem” based on his previous comments. She called the idea that Trump would willingly leave office a “fantasy.” Cheney argued that Trump and Vance are driving away Reagan-era Republicans by abandoning the “philosophy of peace through strength and a strong national defense.” She also criticized Vance over saying he would’ve stopped Congress’ certification of the 2020 election, and for still planning to sit down with Tucker Carlson in the wake of the former Fox host platforming a guest who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident. Cheney announced earlier in the festival interview that her father, the former Vice President Dick Cheney, would also vote for Harris — a stunning move for the staunch conservative and one of the most prominent figures in former President George W. Bush’s administration. This post has been updated to reflect Cheney’s plans to campaign against Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic National Committee are seizing on Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance’s comments in the wake of Wednesday’s school shooting in Winder, Georgia.  Vance in Phoenix said Thursday in response to a question from CNN on what policies he supports to end school shootings:  “We’ve got to bolster security so that if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to,” he said.   Harris criticized the remarks in a post on X: “School shootings are not just a fact of life. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can take action to protect our children—and we will.” The DNC also slammed Vance in a statement, writing: “Let’s be clear: no matter what Donald Trump and JD Vance say, tragedies like this do not need to be a ‘fact of life,’ and we don’t just have to ‘get over it’ when Americans, including young children, are violently murdered.” Vance, defending what he said in Phoenix, replied in a post that “Kamala wants to take security out of our schools instead of protecting our children. Instead of addressing her own failures, she lies about what I said. More desperation from the biggest fraud in American politics.” Former President Donald Trump announced that Dr. Ben Carson, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will serve as the national faith chairman for his 2024 presidential campaign. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, served as the 17th US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 2017 to 2021 under Trump’s administration. Both Carson and Trump competed in the 2016 Republican primaries. In October 2023, Carson endorsed Trump’s 2024 presidential bid during a speech in Iowa. Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday said her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in November.  “If you think about the moment that we’re in and you think about how serious this moment is. You know my dad believes and he said publicly that there’s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,” Liz Cheney added. Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Harris is a stunning move for the staunch conservative Republican who was vice president to George W. Bush and a former House member, holding several leadership roles in the GOP caucus. The former vice president was critical of the GOP and Trump in the wake of the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. In campaign ads for his daughter’s 2022 reelection, Cheney called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward.” “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” Dick Cheney said of Trump. Cheney and her father are among the ranks of high-profile Republicans saying they will not back another Trump term. Jimmy McCain — the youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain — told CNN he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Harris in November. This post has been updated with more details of Cheney’s endorsement. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance visited the US-Mexico border wall in San Diego on Friday in a previously unannounced stop, where he railed against Vice President Kamala Harris’ policies and claimed she wants to “give all the benefits of American citizenship to people who shouldn’t even be here” at the expense of US citizens.  Donald Trump’s running mate also defended his opposition to the bipartisan border deal, which Harris said she would sign as president. He said it was “not a real border bill” and “would not have secured the southern border.”  Vance claimed that executive action from Biden and Harris on the border negates their argument that the bipartisan border bill was necessary to do their job. He also dismissed lower reported border crossings, claiming the Biden-Harris administration is redirecting migrants to ports of entry and airports so the numbers look lower than they are.   Other immigration issues: Vance was asked several more questions by reporters, including whether a Trump-Vance administration would reinstate its policy of separating families who cross the southern border illegally and to what degree he supports authorizing the use of deadly force at the border. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during the Republican primary he supported authorizing deadly force against migrants cutting the border wall or bringing drugs across the border.   Standing in front of border officials, Vance urged Harris to visit the border before the November election. He also wouldn’t directly say if a second Trump administration would separate families, but he didn’t rule it out, saying that “if a guy commits gun violence and is taken to prison, that’s family separation, which, of course, is tragic for the children, but you’ve got to prosecute criminals, and you have to enforce the law.” Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. This week, he vowed to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants. President Joe Biden does plan to watch next week’s debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the White House confirmed Friday.  While Jean-Pierre reiterated Friday that Biden is “proud” of Harris and declined to say if any West Wing officials would join Harris, either remotely or in person in Pittsburgh, for debate prep. “From our side of things, not anyone that I know, but it’s a campaign debate,” she said. “But not anyone that I know of.”   Ahead of Biden’s disastrous June debate with Trump, CNN’s MJ Lee reported the president huddled with an array of campaign and administration officials at Camp David, including White House officials Ron Klain, Bruce Reed, Anita Dunn, Steve Richetti, Annie Tomasini, Ben LaBolt, Jake Sullivan, and others.  A Michigan appeals court has ordered state election officials to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot. The court found that officials had improperly denied Kennedy’s request to remove his name after he suspended his presidential campaign last month.  In Michigan, Kennedy was on the ballot as the nominee of the Natural Law Party, and the state had relied on a section of law which prohibits minor party candidates from withdrawing. But the appeals court found that the section applied only to candidates for state office, not to presidential candidates. A spokesperson for the Michigan secretary of state told CNN they will appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. Absentee voting in Michigan is scheduled to start September 26, although ballots for overseas and military voters are required to go out by September 21.  Why this matters: Kennedy has been trying to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states after suspending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump. Kennedy has encouraged his supporters to back Trump “no matter what state you live in.” Other states: The Michigan decision is the second victory for Kennedy on Friday, after an appeals court in North Carolina ordered that state to remove his name from the ballot as well. Ballots were supposed to start going out Friday, but the process is frozen as the state decides whether to appeal that ruling. If the decision holds, counties will need to restart the ballot printing process without Kennedy’s name. Kennedy is also challenging the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s decision to keep him on the ballot there. CNN’s Aaron Pellish and Eva McKend contributed reporting to this post. The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) on Friday announced it was endorsing former president Donald Trump ahead of Trump’s scheduled speech later in the day to the group’s board in Charlotte, North Carolina. The group, which describes itself as the nation’s oldest and largest police labor organization, endorsed Trump in 2016 and 2020. Yoes said the group considered Trump’s responses to a FOP questionnaire and a letter from the Harris campaign “describing some of their positions on criminal justice and police labor issues.” He said a FOP committee member met with Trump but that “no similar meeting was granted by the Harris-Walz campaign.” “During his first term, President Trump made it clear he supported law enforcement and border security. In the summer of 2020, he stood with us when very few would. With his help, we defeated the ‘defund the police’ movement and, finally, we are seeing crime rates decrease. If we want to maintain these lower crime rates, we must re-elect Donald Trump,” Yoes said. Earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign sought to undercut Trump’s remarks the group, touting a letter from more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country backing her campaign while framing Trump as a convicted felon who urged an unruly mob of supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. The nation’s largest machinists’ union formally endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president after her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz virtually addressed the union at its annual convention on Friday.  Walz, who is spending his Friday in Minnesota, spoke virtually to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) gathering in New York City, where he reiterated his commitment to supporting unions, the campaign announced on Friday. After Walz’s remarks, the union voted to formally endorse the Harris-Walz campaign. IAM president Brian Bryant credited Harris for her role in creating “the most union-friendly administration in American history,” and portrayed Trump as hostile to unions, saying he “broke promise after promise to our members.” The machinists’ union endorsement is latest major union to back Harris’ White House bid, and comes after Walz made a direct appeal to another union group. Walz has previously addressed the government employees union at their gathering in Los Angeles and the firefighters’ union convention in Boston before speaking at a labor event in Milwaukee on Labor Day. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Friday he will still appear with Tucker Carlson in Pennsylvania later this month, after the far-right personality hosted a guest this week who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident. Touting how he and former president Donald Trump stand for free speech and “anti-censorship,” Vance argued the best way to ensure a Holocaust isn’t repeated is to “push back against bad ideas” rather than “suppress them.” “The best way to ensure that doesn’t happen is to debate and push back against bad ideas. It’s not to try to censor and suppress them. I really believe that the more you censor ideas instead of fight back against them, the more you give those ideas power,” Vance said.  As CNN’s Brian Stelter reported Thursday, Darryl Cooper, a podcaster whom Carlson said “may be the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” claimed that Nazi Germany’s mass murder of Jews was an unintended consequence – something akin to poor planning instead of the methodical extermination that it actually was – during an two-hour sit down with Carlson. Vance denied that the interview has become a distraction for the campaign this close to an election. Carlson spoke at the Republican National Convention and is a prominent figure in conservative media. Former President Donald Trump will not be sentenced in his New York criminal case until after the 2024 presidential election, following another delay announced by Judge Juan Merchan on Friday. Merchan wrote in a new letter that he would sentence Trump on November 26 — if necessary — in response to a request from Trump’s lawyers to push back the sentencing. Merchan noted the upcoming presidential election in his decision to delay sentencing, saying that part of his reason for doing so was to avoid the appearance that the sentencing was intended to influence the November election. In addition to pushing back the sentencing until November 26, Merchan wrote that he would decide on Trump’s motion to vacate the verdict because of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision on November 12, which is also after the election. The Manhattan DA’s office said it “stands ready for sentencing on the new date.” While they maintain the case should be thrown out, Trump’s legal team is pleased with Merchan’s decision to delay his sentencing, a source familiar with the reaction tells CNN. Trump was with his lawyers when he found out.  Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the decision, saying, “there should be no sentencing in the Manhattan DA’s election interference witch hunt.” Trump later echoed that message in a post on Truth Social, repeating his baseless claim that the case was a “political attack” orchestrated by his rivals and saying the case “should have never been brought.” More on the case: The former president was scheduled to be sentenced on September 18. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from his hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. It is one of four criminal cases Trump is facing while running again for president. This post has been updated with more details from the judge’s decision Friday and reactions from Trump, his team and the Manhattan DA. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. County election officials are in a “holding pattern” right now as they wait to see if the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) appeals an order to remove former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot.  More than 130,000 absentee ballots have already been requested, according to state data, and were set to start going out Friday.  The state board previously denied Kennedy’s and the We The People party’s request to have his name removed, arguing it was not “practical” because ballots had already been printed and a state statute requires them to be sent out 60 days before the election.  A Wake County Superior Court judge also denied his request on Thursday, but issued a 24-hour temporary pause on sending out ballots so Kennedy could appeal.  The NCSBE stated that removing his name and reprinting ballots would come at a high cost to individual counties and create unnecessary delays in the process of getting ballots to voters.  That state board has not indicated if it plans to appeal the order just yet. If the Court of Appeals order stands, counties would need to go through the full process with ballots before any could be sent out.  The start of voting in North Carolina, which was scheduled to begin Friday, will be further delayed to let legal proceedings play out after an appeals court ordered the state to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot. In an email obtained by CNN, North Carolina Board of Elections General Counsel Paul Cox told county boards of elections to hold outgoing ballots.  “Our attorneys are reviewing the order and determining how to move forward,” Cox wrote. “No decision has been made on whether this ruling will be appealed.”  Kennedy dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump, but North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request to remove his name from the ballot, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.  He challenged the decision in court and a judge ruled Thursday that his name should remain on the ballot but ordered the state to delay sending ballots out until noon on Friday to give Kennedy time to appeal, leading to the new order by the appeals court Friday morning. Clarification: This post has been updated to note that the appeals court ordered the state to remove RFK Jr.’s name from the ballot. Kamala Harris’ campaign has accepted the terms of Tuesday’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. However, in a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format. The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. ABC News officially announced the rules later Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Here are the rules of the face off: Trump, according to ABC News, won a virtual coin flip held earlier in the week to determine podium placement and order of closing statements during the debate. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen. You will be able to watch the ABC debate on CNN Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET. Former President Donald Trump railed against the E. Jean Carroll sex abuse case and denied the allegations against him during remarks to reporters Friday following his appearance in a New York courtroom this morning to appeal the verdict. “I feel sad that I have to come up here and explain it. I have all this legal talent, but legal talent cannot overcome rigged judges. They can’t overcome a 4% Republican area. And I’m disappointed in my legal talent, I’ll be honest with you. They’re good, they’re good people, they’re talented people,” Trump said. Carroll’s attorney said “all options are on the table” in response to today’s comments from Trump, implying they could sue him again for defamation. The brief oral arguments Friday focused on evidence admitted at trial, which Trump’s lawyers say was improperly shown to the jury. No decision was issued Friday. A nine-member jury awarded E. Jean Carroll $5 million in damages following a two-week trial last year. Trump did not attend the trial or call any witnesses, but both the former president and Carroll were in court for Friday’s oral arguments. Carroll sued Trump a second time for defamation after he repeated similar comments about Carroll in 2022. That case went to trial earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages after finding Trump defamed her in 2022 when he repeated similar statements about Carroll. Trump has repeatedly made the multiple legal challenges he faces a key part of his campaign. This post has been updated with comments from Carroll’s attorney. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. Donald Trump’s lawyers filed a reply to the Manhattan District Attorney’s opposition brief late Thursday night doubling down on his request to a federal appeals court to intervene and pause a federal district judge’s order rejecting Trump’s attempt to move the state hush money to federal court — a decision that would send the case back to Judge Juan Merchan in state court if Trump’s appeal is rejected.  Trump’s lawyers again say a stay is necessary to stop his September 18 sentencing, so it does not infringe on the upcoming Presidential election.  Trump’s lawyers acknowledge in the filing that Judge Merchan has already signaled he will likely deny Trump’s pending motion in state court to toss his conviction over presidential immunity.   They also say a stay of the order would send a message to Merchan. A three-judge appeals court panel heard arguments Friday from Donald Trump’s lawyer as the former president seeks a new trial in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the one-time columnist. The brief oral arguments Friday, attended by the former president, focused on evidence admitted at trial, which Trump’s lawyers say was improperly shown to the jury. No decision was issued Friday. Trump attorney John Sauer argued that it was a “quintessential he-said-she-said case” that involves a plaintiff with a political motive to bring a story. Carroll is encouraged by Trump’s political enemies, he says. But the judges were skeptical of Sauer’s evidentiary arguments, cutting him off at one point and asking him to focus on the legal arguments on appeal. The arguments were very in the weeds during the roughly 25-minute hearing, getting into the admissibility of the testimony from Jessica Leeds, who said Trump groped her on an airplane in the 1970s. “It was a crime then to grope someone on a plane, it is a crime now to grope someone on a plane,” said Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan. On the Access Hollywood video, Kaplan said it would’ve been better admitted as a confession. She noted that Trump was in court today, but he also had every chance to show up in court during the trial to take the stand in his own defense, which he did not do. She said the Access Hollywood tape and excerpts from Trump’s deposition were appropriately admitted at trial especially in the absence of Trump’s own testimony. More about the case: The sexual abuse and defamation trial in 2023 was the first of several cases against Trump and marked the first time he was found liable for sexually abusing a woman. The jury returned the verdict within three hours of deliberating, finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll but that she had not proven that Trump raped her. Trump does not face jail time in the case. The case is separate from a related defamation trial that was held earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages after finding Trump defamed her in 2022 when he repeated similar statements about Carroll. This post has been updated with more details from today’s hearing. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is seeking to undercut former President Donald Trump’s remarks to the nation’s largest law enforcement union Friday, touting a letter from more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country backing her campaign while framing Trump as a convicted felon who urged an unruly mob of supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. On a call with reporters organized by the Harris campaign ahead of Trump’s Friday remarks to the National Fraternal Order of Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, retired Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn sought to cast Trump as “an existential threat to our democracy.”  Last month Dunn joined fellow Capitol Police officer Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, both of whom have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump’s handling of January 6th, to campaign for Harris in Michigan.   Durham County North Carolina Sheriff Clarence Birkhead also joined the campaign call Thursday—ahead of Trump’s visit to the state, Birkhead issued a stark warning of what a second Trump term would look like, including possibly “weaponizing the FBI and Justice Department to prosecute his political enemies.” The National Fraternal Order of Police has yet to endorse in the 2024 race—but in 2020, it backed Trump over President Joe Biden, writing, “During his first four years, President Trump has made it crystal clear that he has our backs.” The FOP endorsed Trump in 2016 as well. Former President Donald Trump is expected to appear at a New York City court hearing this morning to appeal the verdict in the E. Jean Carroll sex abuse case. Trump will then hold a news conference at Trump Tower at noon ET before traveling to Charlotte, North Carolina, to deliver remarks to the nation’s largest law enforcement union. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to remain in Pennsylvania and does not have any public events scheduled for Friday. CNN previously reported that Harris is expected to stay in Pittsburgh as she prepares for the presidential debate on Tuesday. She has two pre-taped interviews expected to be released, including on “The Rickey Smiley Show” and Uforia’s Amor 106.3 FM. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, is expected to be in California today. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, does not have any public events scheduled for Friday following his campaign swing this week in Pennsylvania. He taped two radio interviews airing today in “The Morning News with Nancy Kman and Jason Barsky” and “The Chad Holmes Show.” Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview with Uforia’s Amor 106.3 FM, a Spanish-language radio station in Arizona, where she continued to make the case for why she is running in the presidential race while emphasizing her vision for moving the country forward. The interview comes as the vice president continues to court a key demographic ahead of the November election. The latest CNN polls across six battlegrounds showed that in Arizona, former President Donald Trump holds a narrow lead overall, which stood out in these polls as the one state where Harris appears not to have restored support among several key Democratic groups — notably Latino voters, younger voters and White voters with college degrees. According to a news release announcing the interview, the vice president also discussed the current state of the economy, her plan to bolster the middle class with new housing initiatives, business incentives and the stakes of a second Trump term. The full interview will air Friday at 1 p.m. ET on Uforia stations nationwide. Lawyers for Donald Trump and E. Jean Carroll will square off Friday in lower Manhattan as the former president tries to convince a federal appeals court that he should get a new trial after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the one-time columnist. A nine-member jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages following a two-week trial last year. Trump did not attend the trial or call any witnesses, but people familiar with his plans say he is expected to attend Friday’s oral arguments in person. Carroll is also expected to appear. The court will not issue a decision on Friday and one is unlikely before November’s presidential election. The court hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. ET, will bring Trump, the Republican nominee for president, back to what had become a familiar stop during the campaign — the corridors of a courthouse. Unlike the New York civil fraud trial and criminal trial related to hush money payments — where Trump spoke to cameras in the hallways claiming he was unfairly prosecuted and using the opportunity to campaign — there are no cameras inside federal court, though media will be outside tracking his motorcade. The sexual abuse and defamation trial in 2023 was the first of several cases against Trump and marked the first time he was found liable for sexually abusing a woman. Carroll testified in vivid detail that Trump raped her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her in 2019 when he denied the attack, said she wasn’t his type and suggested Carroll made up the story to sell copies of a new book. The jury returned the verdict within three hours of deliberating, finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll but that she had not proven that Trump raped her. Trump does not face jail time in the case. The case is separate from a related defamation trial that was held earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages after finding Trump defamed her in 2022 when he repeated similar statements about Carroll. Keep reading here about the case. Candidates are investing an enormous amount of money working to get their message out on television in crucial states like Pennsylvania. Democrats have reserved more than 78 million dollars, while Republicans have reserved more than 72 million. And Pennsylvania voters are taking notice.  “How can anybody be swayed by this BS?” Mercurio’s partner, Tammy Ryan, 63, chimed in, dismissing the ads attacking Vice President Kamala Harris.  Ryan says she’s excited Harris is using Pittsburgh as her home base to prep for next week’s crucial debate. The couple describe the Democratic nominee as more qualified, compassionate and prepared than former President Donald Trump, though Mercurio said he hasn’t always voted solely for Democratic candidates.  Some of the college students walking just off Forbes Avenue on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh were not aware the vice president was in town, but all of them told CNN they were registered to vote.   They cited issues like reproductive rights and the economy as the issues of most concern to them but some didn’t want to disclose who they were voting for in the fall.  Sabina Kadariya, a freshman, said she wasn’t sure if she was informed enough to make a “proper vote,” but said the economy was her number one issue and that she’d consider voting for Trump. Rishi Wadgaonkar, a 23-year-old grad student at Carnegie Mellon studying mechanical engineering, said he’s most worried about LGBTQ rights and women’s rights and that Harris best reflects his values. He recently changed his voter registration from New York to Pennsylvania.  “Pennsylvania is really a state that really could go either way,” he told CNN. On the last Saturday of July, with the presidential race in flux from an unthinkable month of turmoil, Donald Trump looked out at an overflowing St. Cloud, Minnesota, crowd and predicted he could accomplish what no Republican presidential candidate had managed in nearly half a century. But since that bold declaration, Trump hasn’t returned to the Gopher State. His running mate JD Vance, on stage with him that evening, hasn’t either. Nor have Minnesotans seen Trump campaign ads on their televisions recently, and they likely won’t this fall. Trump and his advisers once envisioned an ambitious electoral map that would take the presidential race through blue-tinted states and provide the Republican nominee more paths to the White House. In May, surrounded by donors at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump presented his plans to compete for Minnesota and Virginia. His campaign maintained an office in New Hampshire and even held a rally on the Jersey Shore. The final stretch of the race for the White House, though, is setting up to be fought over much more familiar ground. Trump’s campaign and his allies have reserved about $160 million in airtime this fall with nearly all of it planned for the same states that proved pivotal in the 2020 election: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Read more on Trump’s campaign here. Former President Donald Trump is expected to hold a press conference in New York on Friday around noon ET. The campaign did not announce the topic of the press conference. The former president is expected to appear this morning at a New York City court hearing, where his lawyers will attempt to overturn the civil court verdict ordering him to pay $5 million to E. Jean Carroll.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign increased its already blistering fundraising pace last month, bringing in $361 million in August — easily swamping the $130 million raised by her Republican rival last month and giving the Democrat a whopping $404 million in cash reserves for the final, two-month sprint to Election Day, her campaign aides announced Friday. The cash stockpiled across Harris’ affiliated committees tops the $295 million that Trump’s political operation said it had available in its bank accounts and underscores how much Harris’ historic and late-breaking candidacy has energized donors and transformed the 2024 race. The $361 million is by far the best monthly haul for either party this cycle. If this rate continues, Harris is poised to collect more than $1 billion in the condensed campaign window between becoming the party’s de facto nominee in late July and Election Day. She’s already raised more than $615 million since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21, her campaign noted Friday. Last month’s haul topped the $310 million that Harris and Democrats raised in July and came amid the fanfare of her announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and formally accepting her party’s nomination at last month’s celebrity-studded Chicago convention, which also included appearances from Biden and two of his White House predecessors. Continue reading. The judge overseeing the New York hush money case against former President Donald Trump informed both Trump and the Manhattan district attorney that he will render his decision Friday on whether to delay the Republican presidential nominee’s sentencing date, according to a Thursday court filing. The former president is currently scheduled to be sentenced on September 18, but Trump asked to delay the sentencing until after Election Day, a request Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office did not oppose. An attorney for Bragg’s office reported the timing of Judge Juan Merchan’s decision in a letter filed with a federal court in New York where Trump is fighting to move the state case to federal court. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday that while he isn’t helping former President Donald Trump prepare for next week’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, he and his running mate are “constantly trading ideas.” Vance also added that Harris is hoping for a debate moment where she can tell Trump, “I’m speaking,” as she did at the 2020 vice-presidential debate with then-candidate Mike Pence. “She doesn’t want to be the vice president. She wants to be the vice principal,” Vance said. “She really likes, she really likes to just tell people what to do.”"
Kamala Harris’ political operation raises $361 million in August – nearly tripling Donald Trump’s haul | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:30 AM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",2024-09-06T09:10:17.634Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/kamala-harris-august-fundraising/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign increased its already blistering fundraising pace last month, bringing in $361 million in August – easily swamping the $130 million raised by her Republican rival last month and giving the Democrat a whopping $404 million in cash reserves for the final, two-month sprint to Election Day, her campaign aides announced Friday.

She’s already raised more than $615 million since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21, her campaign noted Friday. “In just a short time, Vice President Harris’ candidacy has galvanized a history-making, broad, and diverse coalition – with the type of enthusiasm, energy, and grit that wins close elections,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. Last month’s haul topped the $310 million that Harris and Democrats raised in July and came amid the fanfare of her announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and formally accepting her party’s nomination at last month’s celebrity-studded Chicago convention, which also included appearances from Biden and two of his White House predecessors. CLICK FOR CNN’S ROAD TO 270 INTERACTIVE ELECTORAL COLLEGE MAP Harris’ campaign also touted August as the best grassroots fundraising month in presidential history, saying it drew record support from first-time contributors. Nearly 3 million donors gave to the Harris political operation in August, with 1.3 million of them making their first donation of the 2024 election cycle, according to her aides. The third strongest grassroots fundraising day of the campaign came on August 6 – the day Harris announced Walz’s selection, campaign officials said. The August haul does not best the monthly fundraising record of $383 million set by the Biden-Harris political operation in September 2020 at the height of that presidential campaign. The August totals announced by Trump’s team show his fundraising pace has slowed – with his election effort bringing in slightly less last month than the $138.7 million it had collected in July. An earlier CNN analysis of donations that exceeded $200 this cycle found that some of Trump’s biggest fundraising days came in May around his felony conviction in New York, exceeding even the amounts the campaign reported collecting in July during his party’s nominating convention. Harris campaign officials said they are plowing their money into reaching voters, citing a “weekend of action” in the coming days that will feature 2,000 events and a $370 million digital and TV ad campaign running through the election. The campaign said it also has established more than 312 offices with the Democratic Party and employs more than 2,000 staffers with the party across battleground states but warned of a close, hard-fought contest in the home stretch. The presidential campaigns will release a full accounting of their August fundraising and spending later this month in filings with federal election regulators."
