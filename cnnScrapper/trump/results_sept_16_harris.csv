She left behind her life in the US to race camels in the UAE. Now she’s hoping to inspire other women to follow in her tracks | CNN,"Published 8:09 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T12:09:35.485Z,https://www.cnn.com/sport/camel-racing-uae-taylor-dees-spc/index.html,"Straining every fiber to stay atop the 1,000 pound camel churning up sand two meters beneath her as it gallops at over 40 kilometers (24 miles) an hour, Taylor Dees is a long way from Texas. It’s around 12,700 kilometers (7,890 miles) from her hometown of Moulton to the Saudi Arabian city of Taif, and it takes just two more for her to clinch victory at the Crown Prince Camel Festival’s first ever all-women race. That was back in August 2023, just one year on from her mounting a camel for the first time. It turns out that Dees — who rode horses frequently as a child — is as fast a learner as she is a rider. “It really starts with an awareness of animals and awareness of your own body,” she told CNN. “Once you get into the rhythm and you understand how the animal is moving and how you can move with the animal, it’s quite easy.” Dees moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2017, after falling in love with the country on vacation. Now living in the capital of Abu Dhabi, the dietician balances her roles as a business owner and mother with that of being a trailblazing figure in her sport. The racing of dromedaries, a single-humped species also known as the Arabian camel, is a centuries-old passion in the region and endures in both popularity and lucrativeness, with prize money reaching multi-million-dollar figures. However, it’s a storied history that has been predominantly written by men — until recently. Dees is one of the many success stories to emerge from the UAE’s Arabian Desert Camel Riding Center (ADCRC), co-founded by German expat Linda Krockenberger. Krockenberger, who moved to the UAE in 2015, tried for years to find a place to ride, but was frequently turned down on account of her gender. In a 2022 interview she told CNN she recalled once being told “It will be good if you can dress like a boy.” Krockenberger opened the school in 2021, and she says it received the first ever license for a camel riding center in the country. The ADCRC launched the UAE’s maiden all-women camel racing team — a development that immediately piqued Dees’ interest. “I think so many times, particularly around animals, women are seen as too fragile or too feminine to be able to be in that environment,” said Dees. “Yes, we can be more fragile and feminine, but we can also be very strong and very brave and be very physically fit in order to ride camels.” Dees, has raced in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia — including in the ancient city of AlUla — but will be taking a season off from competing with the ADCRC. Though there are typically one to two months between events, Dees has a rigorous weekly training regime that focuses heavily on endurance. Trots gradually progress to short and then long runs as a way of building stamina and ensuring both camel and rider arrive on race day at peak fitness. “The outcome of the race is so reliant on the fitness and quality of the camel,” Dees explained. “Yes, your riding style, form, and ability plays a part but even the best rider will not win on a camel that is less fit than the camel next to it.” Upon her return next season, Dees will saddle up against other talents that have emerged from the ADCRC, including Krockenberger, Jordan’s Rawan Salah, and French-native Coralie Viroulaud, victor of last season’s all-women C1 Championship. Yet Dees does not see the trio as rivals. She welcomes the competition, paradoxically because competition is not her primary motivation. “I don’t race to win,” Dees explained. “I do it because, first and foremost, it’s fun. Second, I want people to see that as women, we are strong, we are confident, and we can do things that maybe men perceive we cannot. “Each international race is a bit bigger, which I love because it means that there are more women who are willing to step out of their comfort zone and who are willing to step out of this very male-dominated sport and prove that yes — women can not only do it, but we can do it very well, we can do it very safely and we can be successful in it as well.”"
Live updates: Trump apparent assassination attempt on Florida golf course | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-16T10:54:15.892Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-attempt-election-news-09-16-24/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Monday told followers on X to “join me live from Mar-a-Lago” on X Spaces at 8 p.m. ET.  Trump had been scheduled to launch a new cryptocurrency business called World Liberty Financial at 8 p.m. on X Spaces. Trump’s post suggests the launch is moving forward as planned despite the assassination attempt that took place at Trump International Golf Club the day prior. One of the two federal gun laws Ryan Wesley Routh has been charged with has come under judicial scrutiny in recent years as courts have reexamined the nation’s gun laws in light of a 2022 landmark Supreme Court decision expanding Second Amendment rights. Routh, the suspect of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday, was charged Monday with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and possession of a firearm while a convicted felon.   The constitutionality of the federal law underpinning the second charge has been examined by federal courts around the country in recent years after some people convicted under it or subject to its prohibition have tried to take it off the books.   Courts have been divided on whether it is constitutionally sound. In one case, a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court that had initially said the law was constitutional as applied to a man convicted of welfare fraud said that the federal law violates the Second Amendment. It cited the 2022 Supreme Court decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, that said firearm laws must be rooted in historical tradition. But other federal courts have upheld the prohibition, including in cases concerning people convicted of violent and non-violent felonies.   The Supreme Court was asked this year to settle the question for good, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying in court papers that disagreement among lower courts about the law’s constitutionality “is undermining public safety.”  This June, the Supreme Court said that some types of regulations can withstand the strict test it created two years ago. The Supreme Court has now asked lower courts to look at cases involving the felon disarmament law with that revised structure in mind. When there were rumors of a plot against the life of Abraham Lincoln before his 1861 inauguration, there was no official protection for the president-elect. Southern states were seceding from the Union in protest of Lincoln’s election, and the rumored plot out of Baltimore led Lincoln, at the urging of the private detective Allan Pinkerton, to sneak into Washington, DC, disguised on a late-night train. During his presidency, Lincoln eschewed bodyguards despite threats. The night Lincoln was shot at Ford’s Theatre the following year, his lone guard was at a saloon next door. But incredibly, it was on the day Lincoln was shot that the president had signed legislation creating what is today the US Secret Service. However, the agency was commissioned within the Treasury Department, and the Secret Service was entirely focused on counterfeit money. The Secret Service didn’t start protecting presidents until 1894, and only part time, after agents probing a group of gamblers discovered an assassination plot aimed at then-President Grover Cleveland. Two more presidents — James Garfield in 1881 and William McKinley in 1901 — would be killed before Congress officially tasked the Secret Service with protecting US presidents full time. McKinley’s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was the first president to get round-the-clock protection, but only two agents were assigned full time to the detail. What was once just two full-time agents assigned to protect Roosevelt in 1902 has now grown to a force of thousands under the Department of Homeland Security. The entire Secret Service employs nearly 8,000 people, and it secures thousands of events each year. In fiscal year 2023, it guarded 33 “protectees.” Read more here President Joe Biden decried Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and condemned political violence in remarks from Philadelphia on Monday. Biden, speaking at the National HBCU Week Conference, commended the Secret Service for its “expert handling” of the situation and said the acting head of the agency, Ronald Rowe, is in Florida “determining whether any further adjustments need to be made to ensure the safety of our former president.” The president added that assassination “solves nothing. It just tears the country apart. We must do everything we can to prevent it and never give it any oxygen.” Attorney General Merrick Garland promised in a Monday statement to use “every available resource” in the investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump. Garland said that “the FBI is continuing to investigate what appears to be an assassination attempt of former President Trump” and that “we are grateful that the former President is safe.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, has an extensive criminal history in North Carolina, records show.  In 2002, he was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges, including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon and ID card fraud.  Those are the most serious charges he faced, but the records also show a litany of less serious accusations as well — some of which were dismissed. He has faced multiple charges related to worthless checks in separate cases. While some cases were dismissed, he pleaded guilty to one such charge in 2003.  In 2009, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. The case was dismissed.  In 2010, he was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods and received three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, though a court docket states the case was dismissed.  He has faced various other charges related to traffic issues. For example, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to driving with no registration. Separately, state and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. He faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. The Pennsylvania State Police provided the bipartisan congressional task force investigating the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump with the documents it requested due Monday, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  “They were responsive to our request,” the source added.  The request included a slew of documents and information from the Pennsylvania State Police, including transcripts of interviews, body-camera footage and radio communications.   The task force also requested internal communications and other information related to the July 13 event in Butler, Pennsylvania. Some background: The task force, made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was approved by the House in July in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, but the appointment came at a fraught political time as members work to prove to both parties that they’re thoroughly investigating the attempted assassination. The 13 lawmakers have until mid-December to issue a final report and recommendations in the investigation. Members of the task force promised last month to get to the bottom of the security failures even if it may be a “slow process,” after the group toured the Pennsylvania rally site where the shooting took place. The FBI is investigating what it said is an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Florida golf club Sunday, the second time in two months there has been an apparent attempt on the former president’s life. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. Federal and local law enforcement are expected to provide updates on the investigation at a news briefing later today. Here’s where things stand now: Former President Donald Trump on Monday continued to try to blame Vice President Kamala Harris’ rhetoric for the apparent assassination attempt at his golf club on Sunday. In a new post on social media, the former president pointed to Harris’ statements during the ABC presidential debate, without specifying which ones.  “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Trump has repeatedly claimed the debate last week was “rigged” against him and has bashed the debate moderators and said he will not participate in another debate before the election. He also continues to baselessly claim that the criminal charges he faces and his felony conviction were masterminded by President Joe Biden and Harris because Trump is running for president.  In his first interview after the apparent assassination attempt in West Palm Beach posted earlier on Monday, Trump also sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life and argued in his first interview since the incident that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.”   Authorities recovered an SKS-style rifle with a scope from the area Ryan Wesley Routh fled Sunday after he was spotted by a Secret Service agent, according to newly unsealed court documents.  An affidavit from Mark A. Thomas, an FBI special agent, said Secret Service agents recovered a “loaded SKS-style 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope,” as well as a digital camera and two bags, including a backpack. The affidavit included a black-and-white photo of the items law enforcement found. Routh was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.  He could face years in prison if convicted of the two charges, according to court documents. The felon in possession of a firearm charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, while the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum of five years in prison and three years of supervised release. Officials from the Secret Service, the FBI and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office will hold a public briefing at 4 p.m. ET to provide updates on the investigation into Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The briefing will take place near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump tried to bring people over to fight in Ukraine via non-official means, against the advice of the International Legion in the country, and had “delusions of grandeur,” according to a former recruiter for the military unit. Evelyn Aschenbrenner, an American citizen who served for two years in the International Legion in Ukraine, a military unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces that is composed of foreign volunteers, told CNN they warned Ryan Wesley Routh several times to use official routes to recruit people to fight in Ukraine and bring them across the border — but he just wouldn’t listen. Aschenbrenner, who identifies as gender fluid and uses “they/them” pronouns, worked as an administrator and then in an official recruiting role within the International Legion. “In August 2022, Routh put my phone number and another recruiter’s phone number on a website that he had designed. I got angry. I told him, ‘Take this down. You didn’t get our permission. The legion already has a recruiting website, there’s no need for you to be doing this. There’s already enough disinformation about Ukraine. Don’t start adding to it,’” Aschenbrenner said. Instead, Routh kept trying to bring people over the border into Ukraine, Aschenbrenner said. “In August 2022, for Ukraine’s Independence Day, there was a high security risk, with curfews in place in Kharkiv and other cities. And Routh messaged me asking to get some random person over the border and he sent me this poor woman’s passport,” they said. Aschenbrenner replied to Routh, saying they had no authority to bring people over, and highlighted the strike alert all over the country. “It’s a military. There’s a chain of command,” Aschenbrenner said they told Routh. “You need to be okay with possible delays. It’s an active war zone.” But Aschenbrenner said Routh got mad about that and replied to them in a message, which was seen by CNN: “I’ll tell the world Ukraine does not want help…it is obvious.” Aschenbrenner said they never saw Routh in Ukraine, neither in a combat zone nor in a military base.  “He seemed to have this delusion of grandeur thing, where he was the … I’ve seen this with some other volunteers on smaller scales … they’re the only one really helping Ukraine,” Aschenbrenner said. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office released bodycam video of the apprehension of Ryan Wesley Routh on Sunday on an interstate in Florida. Routh, who is suspected of planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf on Sunday, was stopped on the highway after authorities say a Secret Service agent engaged a suspect near Trump’s golf club after noticing the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. Bradshaw said a witness saw a man run from the bushes. Routh was later detained in Martin County, about an hour drive from Trump’s golf club. See video of the moment: CNN’s Evan Perez, Holmes Lybrand, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed reporting to this post. In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted at Trump’s golf club was “unreadable to the naked eye.”   One of the charges Routh is facing has to do with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number — meaning that when law enforcement recovered the weapon Sunday, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump, made his initial court appearance Monday morning at a federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court sketches show Routh standing before the judge. Ryan Wesley Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, law enforcement got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 am local time Sunday until 1:31 pm local time, when a USSS agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. The court document also details Routh’s past run-ins with the law, including felony convictions in North Carolina. He was convicted in 2002 for “possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction,” and he was convicted in 2010 for “multiple counts of possession of stolen goods.” Federal law prohibits individuals convicted of a felony from possessing firearms. The arrest of the Trump attempted assassination suspect Sunday was a “textbook case of a traffic stop of a known felon,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said Monday at a news conference. At about 1:55 p.m. Sunday, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office got a BOLO – or “be on the lookout” alert – about a suspect in the case heading north on I-95, with a vehicle description and a tag number. Every available unit – about 30 in all, he estimated – went out to search. One patrol deputy saw the suspect vehicle at about Mile Marker 110 and alerted others but did not immediately try to stop the vehicle, Snyder said. Instead, the deputy waited for two large F-250 pickup trucks to get in place on the highway. Those trucks surrounded the vehicle, he continued, and forced it to a stop at about Mile Marker 112. Officers then did a “felony stop,” calling the suspect out of the vehicle. He came back and was handcuffed, the sheriff said. They turned the suspect and his vehicle over to the FBI. Snyder praised his team for following procedures designed to avoid a high-speed chase or a shootout. The sheriff also praised the witness who told authorities he had seen a suspect flee the golf course and get into a Nissan. “That witness deserves a lot of credit,” Snyder said. A criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, was unsealed shortly before noon ET Monday after he made his initial court appearance where federal prosecutors charged him with gun-related charges.  An affidavit in the court file details what unfolded Sunday at Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida where a US Secret Service agent thwarted an apparent assassination attempt. Read the full criminal complaint below: Former President Donald Trump is still planning on attending his previously scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump’s virtual address on cryptocurrency on Monday evening will continue as planned. Trump is expected be in Flint, Michigan, tomorrow, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday and Washington, DC, this week. One of the charges Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, is facing involves possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. That means when law enforcement recovered Routh’s weapon, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. It’s a common charge you see with drug and gang suspects. Most times people don’t manage to obliterate the serial numbers in every place it is imprinted on the gun. They can do the ones readily visible but not others in harder-to-reach places.  In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number was “unreadable to the naked eye.”  So far, Routh has been charged with two firearm counts. Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach, Florida, said Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, will face federal, not state charges.  Aronberg told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. It may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it would be very difficult to argue insanity in this case because Routh fled the scene, showing he was aware his actions were wrong. Aronberg told MSNBC the evidence left behind including the two bags, ceramic tiles, GoPro, AK-14 rifle and scope will be key in making the case against Routh for attempted murder. The 2024 presidential election is less than 50 days away and the campaigns and their allies are continuing to blitz battleground states with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advertising, Pennsylvania looming largest. Since July 22, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out to September 16, the top seven battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada — have seen $688.7 million in combined presidential advertising. During that stretch, Democrats lead Republicans — including campaigns and outside groups — by about $369.3 million to $315.3 million. Here are the latest numbers by broken down by state:  Pennsylvania Michigan Georgia Wisconsin Arizona North Carolina Nevada Pennsylvania remains the premier battleground, accounting for about $185.3 million in total ad spending since Biden dropped out, and Democrats are beginning to open a meaningful edge there after weeks in which the parties have been running close. As of today, Democrats have spent about $100 million on presidential ads in Pennsylvania, compared to about $84.3 million for Republicans. Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to blame President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life at his Florida golf club. During an interview with Fox News Digital the former president said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.”   The former president pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.”   He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” Trump said. Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Donald Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought against Ryan Wesley Routh, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors are seeking to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate what the FBI has said appears to be an attempted assassination. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he has not yet spoken with former President Donald Trump after what appeared to be an attempted assassination on him as he played golf on Sunday, but reiterated that his state was doing its own investigation as “there is a need to make sure that the truth about all of this comes out in a way that is credible.” While taking questions, DeSantis explained his reasoning for why Florida was doing its own, separate investigation to the federal one. DeSantis said more details about the investigation would be announced in the coming days. He first announced the investigation on Sunday on X. DeSantis made the comments at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, where he appeared alongside education leaders in the state. During Monday’s hearing in federal court in Florida, Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect behind the apparent assassination attempt, answered the judge’s questions with nods and “yes judge” responses. The judge found Routh couldn’t afford his own attorney after he said he had “zero funds” in savings. He was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, Routh told the judge, but had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Prosecutor Adam McMichael said they would be asking for pre-trial detention, citing a risk of flight and danger to the community. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf on Sunday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, has been charged with two firearm counts. The counts include possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.   A detention hearing has been set for September 23 and the arraignment is set for September 30. The White House weighed in on the now-deleted post from Elon Musk, calling the comment “irresponsible” and saying violence should be “never encouraged or joked about.” Musk deleted a post Monday morning questioning why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is holding a news conference in Orlando, Florida, a day after an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is speaking at an elementary school, addressed tertiary education across Florida and did not mention the incident involving Trump. Yesterday, the Florida governor announced on X that his state will conduct its own investigation of the incident. The apparent assassination attempt took place at Trump International Golf Club, which is located in West Palm Beach. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed to this report. Kamala Harris’ campaign does not plan to address the weekend’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in a political manner, sources said, and any forthcoming remarks from the vice president on the developments are expected to closely mirror her statement released by the White House Sunday night. Both President Joe Biden and Harris were briefed on the incident in West Palm Beach, and both were quick to condemn all kinds of political violence and express relief that the former president was not harmed. Harris said in a statement — released in her official capacity as vice president via the White House — that she was “deeply disturbed” by the apparent assassination attempt. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said. “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe.” Harris is participating in a meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, this afternoon. She is also spending part of the day preparing for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump,  is in federal court for an initial appearance Monday morning. Routh is wearing dark prison scrubs, and his feet and hands are shackled. He has been escorted to a holding area to await his appearance. Federal prosecutors have not yet announced what charges Routh will face. He was taken into custody Sunday after being stopped on the highway following the shooting incident. Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe is on the bench. Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe plans to remain in Florida “indefinitely” as the investigation into an apparent second assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump plays out, according to USSS spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.  Rowe will also meet with local law enforcement today and then do a walk through of the golf course this afternoon, Guglielmi told CNN on Monday.  He was appointed to the position on July 23, after Kimberly Cheatle resigned after Trump was shot in the ear in an attempted assassination. Trump and Rowe will meet today in Florida this afternoon, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this post. The man detained in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was so calm when he was stopped it was “perplexing,” the sheriff of Martin County, Florida, recalled.  “His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Sheriff William Snyder told CNN on Monday morning. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.” Despite the commotion surrounding his apprehension – the area “crawling with law enforcement … SWAT team (that) had gotten out their rifles, helicopter, I-95 shut down, a bomb dog” – the man never even asked why he got pulled over, Snyder said. The traffic stop unfolded after the sheriff’s office got a BOLO – a “be on the lookout” alert – with a vehicle and tag description, Snyder said. A road patrol deputy spotted the vehicle, followed it for a couple miles and waited for big trucks with heavy bumpers to get there and force the vehicle to a stop, he said. Deputies then conducted a felony stop and safely brought the man out of the vehicle into custody, Snyder said. Ryan Wesley Routh is appearing in federal court Monday morning. Now, Snyder’s main concern is to investigate whether anyone else was involved, he said. “Are we tracking with a conspiracy?” he asked. “That’s the question that I think has to be answered.” As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states this week, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. President Joe Biden wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the second apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, he told reporters Monday.  “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said. Asked by CNN’s Kevin Liptak what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. The Secret Service faced significant scrutiny following the first assassination attempt against Trump when he was struck in the ear during a rally in July. Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. He later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read more about the impact the assassination could have here. Ryan Wesley Routh, the detained man behind Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt, was a small business owner in Hawaii and avid supporter of the Ukrainian war effort. CNN spoke to another Hawaiian business owner and a journalist in Ukraine, both of whom had interacted with Routh in the past. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with the AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” In another instance, Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 upfront to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained Sunday in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, was driving his daughter’s car when he was apprehended, according to a law enforcement source. Routh was detained after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. He then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The person detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt Sunday on former President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course did not fire any shots, the Palm Beach County sheriff said Monday morning. The man is detained at a “federal holding facility,” Bradshaw added. Asked whether he is talking, Bradshaw responded: “No.” Bradshaw also praised the quick action of the Secret Service for keeping the former president safe. “This is not like what happened in Butler,” he said, referring to the assassination attempt against Trump two months ago in Pennsylvania that sparked scrutiny of the Secret Service. A photo of the moment 58-year-old Ryan Routh was detained by police in Florida, after allegedly being caught with a rifle on a golf course where former President Donald Trump was playing has been released. The Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence on Sunday and agents fired at Routh, who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. It is believed he then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office shared the image with CNN on Monday. Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secures the areas before he arrives. Read the full story. Ryan Routh attended a demonstration in support of a Ukrainian National Guard brigade in Kyiv in 2022, according to images verified by CNN. But in an official statement, the 12th National Guard Azov Brigade told CNN: “He has nothing to do with our brigade.” Other Ukrainian military groupings have issued similar statements saying Routh was not involved with them despite him expressing interest in aiding Ukraine.  A representative from Ukraine’s Land Forces Command foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted it several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. The Ukrainian military’s International Legion of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, another foreign legion organization, also said Routh had “never served” and “has no relation to the unit.” Ryan Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and had visited the country. Routh’s time in Ukraine: In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  He used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war, trying to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. “The US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line and this matter is under investigation,” the Secret Service representative said. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. “We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Bradshaw said. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. “In the bushes, where this guy was, is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope; two backpacks, which were hung on the fence and had ceramic tile in them; and a GoPro. … So, those are being processed right now,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said."
The one Harris comment Trump and his allies have spent $38 million for voters to see | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T16:00:19.735Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/kamala-harris-bidenomics-trump-advertisements/index.html,"On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” It was a fateful declaration, one that has dogged Harris since she took over as the Democratic standard-bearer and has attempted to seize the mantle of change candidate in the 2024 presidential race. The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. One of the ads, backed by more than $13 million, simply juxtaposes Harris on the campaign trail in 2024, speaking to voter concerns about rising prices, with the clip from 2023, and includes no other narration. “Everyday prices are too high – food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes,” Harris says in the clip featured in the ad. What Immediately follows is the 2023 clip of her saying, “That is called Bidenomics.” Another one of the ads, also backed by more than $13 million, contrasts news coverage of inflation with the same 2023 clip, taking the same spare approach, also with no other narration. A third ad from the Trump campaign, launched last week and already backed by more than $3 million, opens with the clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working,” before a narrator cuts in with “It’s not” and references more critical news coverage of inflation. “Yet Harris still says, ‘Bidenomics working.’ No, it isn’t,” the ad ends. A fourth ad featuring the soundbite went up Friday. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris – on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing in recent weeks as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. The ads are aimed at leveraging the advantage that polls show voters give Trump on economic issues and magnifying persistent concerns about inflation and a potential recession – even as inflation in the actual economy has slowed and job growth has continued. Harris and her allies, meanwhile, have made a concerted effort to blunt those criticisms, also leaning into economic messaging in their campaign advertising. Last week, Harris’ campaign launched a series of ads on her economic pitch, specifically tailored to key swing states. “Lowering the cost of living will be a defining goal of my presidency. I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone. And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gouging on food. More than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. We will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,” Harris says in the ads. In addition, her campaign has spent more than $10 million airing an ad in which Harris says, “You want lower prices and lower taxes. I believe you want to just not get by, but you want to get ahead,” before delivering her pitch for an “opportunity economy.” And another top Harris ad contrasts her approach with Trump’s. “It’s a very different vision than Donald Trump’s. His plans will raise costs and taxes on the vast majority of Americans. We need to be thinking about the future and how we make it better for families like yours,” Harris says in the ad. Democrats – including Biden and Harris – ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record, including during her first sit-down interview as the nominee last month with CNN. “So you maintain Bidenomics is a success?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris during an exchange about her economic plans. “I maintain that when we do the work,” Harris responded before launching into a litany of the administration’s achievements. “I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work.” The backdrop to the back-and-forth over who is best for voters’ pocketbooks is a US economy that has continued to post solid data, even as prices are higher than four years ago and interest rates are elevated. Inflation has slowed significantly from its peak in 2022, and the US economy added 142,000 jobs in August, marking stronger growth than a worrisome lower number in July. Still, the ads from the Trump campaign also reflect the basic conundrum facing all politicians – they spend hours before the public, staking out positions and making statements, all while political operatives and ad-makers watch for a moment to capitalize. Harris, standing in southeast DC in August 2023, could not have known that exactly one year later, she would face the challenge of pitching an entirely different vision to voters."
Fact check: Trump falsely claims Harris is talking about bringing back the military draft | CNN Politics,"Published 10:18 AM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T14:18:31.567Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/fact-check-trump-harris-military-draft/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump has conjured up an inflammatory false claim about Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy positions — baselessly saying Friday that Harris is talking about forcing Americans to serve in the military. Trump claimed at a rally in Las Vegas that voting for Harris means voting for war with Russia and voting to bring back the draft, a system in which some men are conscripted into involuntary service in the armed forces. Trump continued: “Would anybody like to be drafted, in the audience? Because that’s what they’re doing. She’s already talking about bringing back the draft. She wants to bring back the draft, and draft your child, and put them in a war that should never have happened.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris is not talking about bringing back the draft and has not put forward any proposals to bring back the draft. Trump’s campaign did not respond Saturday to CNN’s requests for any evidence for his claim. A Harris campaign aide said, “We have no idea what he’s talking about.” The US has not had a draft since 1973, the year it completed its military withdrawal from Vietnam. (Trump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War draft, four because he was a college student and a fifth on account of a doctor’s diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.) Since 1973, the country has used an all-volunteer force. Regardless of the wishes of any president, launching a new draft would require Congress to pass legislation. The current situation Almost all male US citizens and non-citizen immigrants ages 18 through to 25 are already required by law to register in a federal database system, the Selective Service System, so that they could potentially be conscripted into the military if another draft eventually happened. It’s entirely unclear what prompted Trump to make his Friday claim, but there has been some media coverage related to the Selective Service System in recent months. Members of Congress have been debating separate proposals to automatically register men for the database when they turn 18 — some men currently have to register manually, though registration is mandatory — and to start requiring women to register. Both proposals face significant congressional opposition and may well fail to become law. Regardless, they are not proposals to revive the draft, and, more to the point here, Harris herself certainly hasn’t called to revive the draft."
Manchin signals he could endorse Harris while Romney stays coy | CNN Politics,"Published 8:50 AM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T12:50:19.636Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/joe-manchin-mitt-romney-intv/index.html,"Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat-turned-independent who had toyed with a presidential run and has long been a thorn in the side of the left, has been mum about the candidate he’s backing in November. But that could soon change. In an interview with CNN, the veteran West Virginia senator signaled he may get off the sidelines. And he plans to speak to Vice President Kamala Harris soon. “Oh I could see that, yes,” Manchin told CNN when asked if he’d endorse a candidate before November. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee who voted twice to convict former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trials, reiterated his disdain for Trump – and objected to the former president’s refusal to say at last week’s debate that he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia. Asked twice if he would endorse Harris, Romney pointedly refused to say. “I’m certainly not going to be voting for former President Trump, and I think that’s been very clear,” Romney said when asked the first time whether he’d back Harris. Asked again about supporting Harris, Romney said: “I don’t have anything on that at this stage.” The comments by Manchin and Romney – two retiring senators who have been on the outs with their respective party’s base – underscore how Trump has turned off some more moderate voters but also how Harris herself has yet to close the deal with right-leaning voters skeptical of the former president. A third Trump detractor, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, doesn’t plan to vote for Harris, even as she said of the former president’s debate performance, “I don’t think it was Donald Trump’s best evening.” Manchin, who refused to say in 2012 if he’d vote for Barack Obama for reelection, seems most likely of the three to endorse Harris. The former Democrat downplayed Harris’ more liberal politics and sounded positive about the direction of her campaign. And he rebutted criticism that she was too far to the left for him. “I think she’s moving in the right direction. Things I’m hearing are sounding very good,” Manchin said, adding that he wants to make sure the two have “a very good conversation. We will do that.” “She comes from California. I expect her to be different than where I came from,” Manchin added. “She seems to be looking at the larger picture now, which is very encouraging.” Manchin said he’s been playing phone tag with Harris and is “looking forward to a conversation” about energy, the national debt and keeping in tact the Senate’s filibuster, the potent stall tactic that requires 60 votes to overcome. “I would like to make sure that she understands the need for us to have a filibuster in the Senate, being a former senator, of how it kind of calms things down, makes us work together,” he said. “If they’re willing to discard all of that, they’re willing to throw caution to the wind, we’re in serious problems.” In the interview in the Capitol last week, Romney heavily criticized the former president’s refusal to say that Ukraine should win the war against Russia and his use of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a character witness of sorts. “The president surely had to say, ‘Of course, I want Ukraine to win. I want Ukraine to be successful,’ and then he can talk about how you define success and winning. But we stand with democracies. We stand with nations that are now being invaded by their neighbors, particularly invaded by Russia,” Romney added. “So, it was a huge gap that I think caused a collective gasp from nations around the world.” Romney contended that Orban’s “authoritarian tendencies” are well known, “and that’s not someone who I would say, ‘This is a badge of honor, you know, he’s the guy who likes me.’”"
Live updates: FBI investigating apparent assassination attempt of Trump in Florida | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-15T12:30:37.321Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-15-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump has moved here. Ryan Routh had repeatedly called for bolstering Taiwan’s defenses against China and hoped to set up a foreign legion akin to that in Ukraine.  The man, who was detained in connection with an apparent attempt to assassinate former president Donald Trump on Sunday, is listed as an “International Volunteer Center Coordinator” on a website named Taiwan Foreign Legion.  The group claims it is “recruiting former military and civilians from around the world” willing to defend Taiwan in the event of a war with China.  CNN reached out to over a dozen people listed as “supporters” on the group’s website. But several said they had not heard of the group or its activities, and some had never heard of Routh.   All claimed they did not know how their names and contact information had been shared on the pro-Taiwan website.  Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan does not have an official foreign legion. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry declined to comment on Routh.  China’s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The US is bound by law to supply the self-governing island with weapons to defend itself, and support for Taiwan is a rare issue of broadly bipartisan consensus in Washington.  Ryan Wesley Routh decried Donald Trump as an “idiot,” a “buffoon” and a “fool” in his self-published book on the war in Ukraine and geopolitics. The 58-year-old, who was detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Trump, wrote last year about his unsuccessful efforts to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia and also weighed in on multiple global crises. Routh wrote that the former US president’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 was a “tremendous blunder” that drove Tehran closer to Moscow, which it has supplied with drones that have caused devastation across Ukraine. Routh also gave his opinions on the political situation in Afghanistan, and urged Afghan refugees to fight for Ukraine. He also wrote about Taiwan, North Korea and Venezuela, drawing comparisons between the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro and the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Appearing to reference his former support for Trump, Routh wrote that he must take part of the blame for electing him as president, writing: “but I am man enough to say that I misjudged and made a terrible mistake.” Leaders around the world are condemning the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump and offering their support. Here’s what they’re saying: The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and visited the country in 2022. Routh traveled to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor more than two years ago, according to video and images geolocated by CNN to Kyiv’s Independence Square, as well as interviews with foreign press. Video shows Routh attended a rally at the square in support of Ukrainian troops on May 1, 2022, and visited the same location about six weeks later, where a photo shows him standing beside a Ukraine flag emblazoned with an appeal for international volunteers to support the war effort In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  Routh then used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   This post has been updated with more information on Routh’s time in Ukraine. A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion confirmed with CNN that Ryan Wesley Routh had contacted them several times but said he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Shaguri said “the best way to describe his messages is — delusional ideas.” Routh expressed support for Ukraine in dozens of X posts in 2022, saying he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.” He also visited Ukraine in 2022, according to video and photos geolocated by CNN as well as media interviews he gave while there.  Routh then used his Facebook account last year to encourage foreigners to fight in the war. He tried to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts, beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea, who met the man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Ukraine on several occasions, told CNN he was surprised by Ryan Routh’s involvement in the incident. Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June of 2022, where Routh was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. At the time, Routh gave Newsweek Romania an interview where he said: When Cernea met Routh again about a year later, he said, Routh was visibly frustrated that more people had not come to Ukraine’s help. “Why aren’t there thousands of people here in Kyiv coming to support and join the foreign legion, why aren’t they here?” Cernea remembers him lamenting. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: This post has been updated with the latest developments. Ryan Wesley Routh, the 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, self-published a book last year detailing his efforts to support Ukraine in the war against Russia. In the 291-page book, Routh described his disillusionment with the war in Ukraine, which he called “unwinnable.” The book also discussed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and the political situation in Taiwan, which has faced growing military threats from China. The book, released on Amazon with no publisher listed, is titled: “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War: The Fatal Flaw of Democracy, World Abandonment and the Global Citizen-Taiwan, Afghanistan, North Korea and the end of Humanity.” CNN has not independently verified his accounts in the book. In it, Routh describes how he had traveled to the Poland-Ukraine border in an effort to enlist in the war — but “at 56 with absolutely no military experience I was reluctantly turned away by the staff” at the border office. Instead, he tried to enlist more fighters for the war effort — traveling to Kyiv and setting up a makeshift volunteer center at Independence Square before it was disassembled by police. He then “lost all arguments and calls to city hall,” he writes, and spent several months camped out in protest at various locations around the city. “I had given every ounce of motivation and energy that I could muster for Ukraine and came up empty handed,” he said, describing his unsuccessful attempts to build drones for the Ukrainian army with a team of international engineers.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was shocked after hearing about the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. “Sara and I were shocked by the second assassination attempt against President Trump and were relieved to hear that it too failed. But we should not rely on luck,” he wrote on X. Federal agents investigating an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday expect a federal court in South Florida will require “a mental health assessment” of Ryan Wesley Routh before any possible criminal proceedings, a law enforcement source told CNN.  Based on numerous “unusual rants” believed to be posted by Routh online regarding international geopolitical events, the source said federal investigators expect his mental health will be examined as part of court proceedings to determine whether he is fit for any trial.  No charges have been filed, but mental health assessments are not uncommon in cases involving threats to federal officials by individuals who may be experiencing mental health issues, the source said. CNN is attempting to determine if Routh has attorney representation.  There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speaks to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read the full analysis. Former President Donald Trump on Sunday thanked the US Secret Service and other law enforcement officials after an apparent assassination attempt while he was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida. The former president was not harmed in the incident. He had been golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when shots were fired, according to a source familiar with the matter. The presence of law enforcement outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach remains heavy, and the road nearest the apparent assassination attempt was still closed nine hours after the incident, CNN Correspondent Randi Kaye reported from the scene. Heavily trafficked roads around the golf club are also still closed and there has been a regular stream of police vans going in and out of the gates. At Summit Boulevard, just in front of the golf club gate, there are a lot of bushes between where the 5th and 6th hole comes together, Kaye said, where perhaps somebody could have poked their way through until they reached the fence. The person detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. Trump International Golf Club abuts three heavily trafficked roads: Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is also nearby. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Florida remained silent when he was apprehended by law enforcement, according to a local state attorney.  Aronberg did not name the suspect but said he had a “rap sheet.”  The person detained is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources.  Aronberg described the apparent assassination attempt as “another too close for comfort incident.” But he also praised the US Secret Service for quickly spotting the alleged shooter and firing shots at him.  Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who serves on the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July, said people in Congress are “bewildered why we’re in this situation for a second time.” He says the protocols and resources committed to the former president “seem to be wholly inadequate,” especially in outdoor environments. Moskowitz said that, although much remains unknown, the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt on Trump on a golf course should not have been able to obtain a firearm in the state of Florida. He said it should not be ruled out that the man may have brought the weapon into the state. Motorist Daniel Rodriguez told CNN that he and his family were driving back to Orlando on the I-95 interstate from a soccer match when they encountered a “wild scene” as sheriff’s deputies stopped a suspect after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Rodriguez said that they initially thought it was an accident. Rodriguez said they were then stuck in traffic for two hours. Former President Donald Trump’s golf game on Sunday was a last-minute addition to his schedule, two sources familiar with the matter said. Trump had no public events on his schedule for Sunday. Vice President Kamala Harris said she is “disturbed” and condemns “political violence” after an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday. “I am deeply disturbed by the possible assassination attempt of former President Trump today. As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said in a statement released by the White House on Sunday night. The FBI’s investigation into an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida has gone global as officials work to flesh out the background of Ryan Wesley Routh, the individual detained, a law enforcement source tells CNN. Authorities are working to obtain search warrants on social media accounts believed to be associated with Routh, the source said. Some of Routh’s suspected online activity also involved using platforms headquartered outside the United States, the source said, which will involve working with international partners to identify everything the FBI possibly can about the detained individual. The FBI is also aware of Routh’s suspected online claims about foreign travel, the source said, which will be part of the bureau’s investigation. While early in the investigation, authorities have not identified any co-conspirators potentially targeting Trump, the source said. Records from North Carolina, dating back a couple decades, show that the man detained in the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday has had previous scrapes with the law.    In 2002, Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after he was pulled over by police and allegedly put his hand on a firearm and then drove and barricaded himself in a business, according to a Greensboro News & Record article that year that cited police. Law enforcement confirmed the arrest to CNN on Sunday.   Public records reveal several court cases involving Routh since the 1990s.   State and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. For example, he faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records.  In 1998, the state alleged he committed an offense related to a “worthless check,” though that case was dismissed.   Separately, judges have ordered him to pay tens of thousands of dollars to plaintiffs in various civil suits.  Routh’s eldest son, Oran, told CNN via text that Routh was “a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man.”   The son wrote, “I don’t know what’s happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I’ve heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent.”  A 58-year-old man detained Sunday in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida is a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who went on social media to weigh in on politics and current events, at times criticizing the former president.   Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf, posted comments on an X account linked to him referencing the assassination attempt on Trump in July.    Routh tagged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, in separate posts, encouraging them to visit those injured at the rally.  “You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them,” he wrote in a post directed at Harris.  In an April post on X tagging Biden’s presidential account, he wrote Biden’s campaign should be: “called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA …make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.”   Ronald Rowe, acting director of the US Secret Service, is traveling to Florida in the wake of the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, a law enforcement source familiar with the matter told CNN. The official declined to comment on Rowe’s itinerary.  Rowe has been in the top job at the Secret Service since Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid scrutiny over security lapses related to the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.  Rowe also visited the site of the Butler shooting, and he has testified on Capitol Hill and briefed members of Congress about the investigation into that shooting. Rowe has been asked to brief lawmakers about the Florida incident as well.   Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced his state will conduct “its own investigation regarding the attempted assassination” of former President Donald Trump, his one-time GOP primary opponent, in West Palm Beach. “The people deserve the truth about the would be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,” DeSantis wrote on X. President Joe Biden commended the work of the Secret Service and law enforcement following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, saying he was “relieved” to hear that Trump was unharmed. He also condemned political violence or “any violence” and said that he has directed his team to ensure that the Secret Service has all the resources necessary to protect the former president. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety,” he added. The son of the person detained following the shooting incident on former President Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida on Sunday told CNN that he hopes everything has “just been blown out of proportion” and that it’s not like his father “to do anything crazy, much less violent.” Oran Routh, son of Ryan Routh, said his father is loving, caring and hardworking. CNN reported earlier that officials detained Ryan Routh following the shooting incident on Sunday, according to three law enforcement sources. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday condemned violence against public officials and candidates. In a post on X, Mayorkas also commended the US Secret Service for “its quick action to preempt this apparent assassination attempt and protect the former President.” “DHS and the Secret Service are closely working with federal, state and local law enforcement partners to learn all of the facts surrounding this incident. The safety and security of Presidential candidates and other protectees is the highest priority for the Secret Service, ” Mayorkas said.  Former President Donald Trump was at his Trump International Golf Club, between the fifth and sixth holes, when the Secret Service fired on a suspect spotted some distance ahead of the former president on the course. Here’s where the incident happened: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday he is “very grateful President Trump is safe after another attempted assassination attempt.”  “There is no place for political violence in our country, and those responsible for it must be held to account. I hope and expect (the Secret Service) and the FBI will conduct a thorough, swift, and transparent investigation,” the Kentucky Republican wrote on X. Former President Donald Trump updated his fundraising website with a defiant message after the security incident. “FEAR NOT! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God! But, there are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us.I will not stop fighting for you. I will Never Surrender,” the website says. “I will always love you for supporting me. Through our UNITY we will Make America Great Again.” House Speaker Mike Johnson met with Donald Trump this afternoon following what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt against the former president in South Florida. Donald Trump’s campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles updated staff after shots were fired near the former president Sunday, telling them in an email that “safety is always our top priority.” CNN previously reported that Trump’s campaign office in West Palm Beach, Florida, went into lockdown after the Sunday incident. LaCivita and Wiles also praised the Secret Service. “President Trump and everyone accompanying him are safe thanks to the great work of the United States Secret Service,” they said. Former President Donald Trump said in a second fundraising email Sunday that his “resolve is only stronger” after shots were fired near him at the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida. “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” the email said. “I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!” The FBI “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump, the agency said Sunday, just two months after an attempt on the former president’s life at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president is safe after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. Here’s what happened: US intelligence officials recently briefed Donald Trump’s campaign about new indications that Iran was planning to escalate attacks on the former president and those around him, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. At this point, there is no indication that the intelligence is related to the apparent second assassination attempt against on Trump on Sunday, the sources said. The intelligence briefing given in recent days related to potential physical and cybersecurity attacks, adding to the overall elevated security threat against Trump. CNN previously reported that authorities had obtained intelligence about a plot by Iran to assassinate Trump in the weeks before the attempted assassination of the former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July. There has been no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who was shot and killed that day, was connected to the plot. Separately, the US government has concluded the Iranian government is behind a hack-and-leak operation targeting Trump’s campaign and also attempted to target the Biden-Harris campaign. The congressional task force investigating the first attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is requesting a briefing with the US Secret Service following the Sunday security incident at Trump’s golf club in Florida. The person in custody in connection with the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is Ryan Wesley Routh, according to three law enforcement sources. What we know so far about the person detained: Not too long ago, Trump was the target of an assassination attempt during a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a staccato of shots rang out in the middle of his speech, killing one attendee and severely injuring two others. According to the FBI, either a bullet or a bullet fragment struck Trump, wounding him on the ear. The incident sparked a broader investigation around lapses in Trump’s security apparatus, increasing scrutiny on the Secret Service. Amid a possible second assassination attempt, lawmakers and officials are still in the process of investigating the first attempt on Trump’s life. A flashback to Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania: Video showed some attendees noticed the gunman on the roof at least one minute and 57 seconds before the shooting began, and several rally attendees tried to call attention to the gunman as Trump was speaking on the stage. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was fatally shot at the scene. Secret Service boosts security: Since the incident, the Secret Service has bolstered Trump’s security detail and surrounds the former president with bulletproof glass at campaign rallies. A senior official told CNN additional security measures would also include increasing the number of agents and certain technological changes, though the official declined to provide more details. The fallout: Then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid criticism for security lapses related to the assassination attempt, and the agency is under continued pressure from lawmakers to hold individuals accountable for those failures. Ronald Rowe, now acting director of the Secret Service, had said several times he would wait until the results of internal investigations into the shooting before making personnel decisions over that day’s failures. Multiple Secret Service personnel from the Pittsburgh Field Office and one member of Trump’s security detail involved in the planning for the July 13 rally were reassigned to administrative duties and ordered to work from home. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he has been briefed by acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. after shots were fired at Trump International Golf Club near former President Donald Trump. “I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety,” Schumer added. “There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz said he and his wife are “glad” that former President Donald Trump is safe following what the FBI is saying is an apparent assassination attempt against him. The statement, which follows closely to what Vice President Kamala Harris wrote earlier, also condemns violence. Golf courses, and in particular Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds while the commander in chief plays, according to people familiar with the matter. A golf course is often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements like trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the president as he plays and secure the areas in the several minutes before he arrives. Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach abuts three heavily trafficked roads: Kirk Road, Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. The Palm Beach International Airport is also nearby. As president, Trump could often be spotted from across from Kirk Road when he was playing golf. But members of the media were not permitted to stand on the sidewalks near the golf course when Trump was playing. After he left office, some of those restrictions were lifted. Members of the public were able to have a clear view of Trump from the sidewalks on Summit Boulevard and Congress Avenue. In a briefing Sunday, the Palm Beach County sheriff acknowledged that with Trump now not a sitting president, the Secret Service was “limited” in its ability to fully surround the golf course. When he was president, Barack Obama’s most frequent golf outing was to the links at Joint Base Andrews, which, by its nature on a military installation, had restricted access — both to the course itself but also its surroundings. President Joe Biden rarely golfs. Former President Donald Trump is back at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida following what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt. The former president and his motorcade left the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach after Secret Service spotted and engaged with a gunman who was positioned on the perimeter of the club. The suspect fled the scene in a car but was later detained by law enforcement. Former President Donald Trump’s South Florida golf course would have been “surrounded” with protection if he were the sitting president, but the US Secret Service was “limited” in the areas it was able to cover ahead of Sunday’s incident, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference. “The golf course is surrounded by shrubbery, so when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they’re pretty much out of sight, all right, and at this level that he is at right now, he’s not the sitting president,” Bradshaw said. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible. So, I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there’ll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter. But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.” Watch here: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he spoke with former President Donald Trump after the security incident in Florida on Sunday “before the news was public.” “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” Vance said in a social media post. “Still much we don’t know, but I’ll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude,” the Ohio senator added. Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. The suspect has not made any statements regarding his involvement in the alleged assassination attempt, said Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Authorities have not named the suspect. Donald Trump’s campaign office in West Palm Beach, Florida, went into lockdown after shots were fired at his golf course Sunday. There were several staffers in the building at the time, a source familiar told CNN. The lockdown has since lifted.  A man taken into custody after gunshots were fired near former President Donald Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, was “relatively calm” when detained, Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said Sunday.  “He was not displaying a lot of emotions. Never asked, ‘What is this about?’” the sheriff said.  Snyder said the unnamed suspect was not armed when law enforcement officials took him out of the car. Snyder said the sheriff’s office would take the vehicle to FBI custody, which will take over the investigation, along with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office and the US Secret Service. Snyder said his agency “flooded” Interstate 95 and closed a large swath of the highway before eventually safely stopping the suspect vehicle.  “I have a clear understanding from investigators that we actually do have the suspect that they’re looking for in Palm Beach County,” Snyder said. An FBI representative asked the public to submit any helpful information regarding the security incident investigation via a tip line, 1-800-CALLFBI, or on the FBI’s website. “What we need right now is for the public to avoid the area around the golf course. We will continue support this investigation with the full resources of the FBI,” said Special Agent Jeffrey Veltri of the Miami field office at Sunday’s news conference. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man. Watch: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. This post has been updated with additional information. The FBI said Sunday it is responding to West Palm Beach, Florida, and “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of former President Donald Trump. A suspect has been detained by local police after shots were fired at Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach.  Florida Republican Rep. Michael Waltz called for the US Secret Service to brief Congress this week after the security incident near former President Donald Trump. “As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing. As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week,” he wrote on X. Waltz is a member of a bipartisan congressional task force made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans established to investigate the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13. Former President Donald Trump was moving between holes five and six at his South Florida golf course when the security incident happened Sunday, a source briefed on the matter told CNN.   The suspect, who the Secret Service engaged with, was a number of holes ahead of the former president, according to two law enforcement sources.   The Secret Service fired at the suspect as a protective measure, that source said. Trump was golfing with donor Steve Witkoff when the incident happened, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Former President Donald Trump is in “good spirits” after the security incident that occurred at his golf course earlier Sunday, according to Trump ally Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. of South Carolina. “Just spoke with President Trump. He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known. He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country,” Graham wrote on social media platform X. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance did not address reporters as he boarded his campaign plane Sunday following a security incident involving former President Donald Trump in South Florida. Vance, Trump’s running mate, was boarding the plane at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to return to Washington, DC. One reporter yelled out to ask whether Vance had talked to Trump or heard anything about the shots fired near the former president while he was playing golf. Former President Donald Trump said in a fundraising email that he is “safe and well” following the security incident at his golf course in South Florida earlier Sunday. A suspect who authorities believe is connected to Sunday’s incident at Trump International Golf Course has been taken into custody, according to a Facebook post from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. The sheriff’s office “has stopped a vehicle and taken a suspect into custody,” the post said. A section of Interstate 95 near State Route 714 in Martin County is shut down, the office said. “We will update this information as it becomes available,” the post continued. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, where Sunday’s incident at Trump International took place. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on the security incident involving former President Donald Trump in Florida Sunday, according to the Department of Justice. DOJ spokesperson Dena Iverson said Garland is monitoring the situation and is receiving regular updates following the security incident at the Trump International Golf Club. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are both “relieved to know” that Donald Trump is safe and have been briefed on the security incident involving the former president while he was golfing earlier Sunday, according to the White House. Biden and Harris, both of whom are in Washington, DC, with no public events today, will be kept updated by their team. “The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing. They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team,” according to a statement from the White House. In her own statement posted on social media Sunday, Harris said, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.”  This post has been updated with additional information. A person has been detained in connection to the incident at Trump International Golf Club on Sunday, according to a law enforcement source. Secret Service fired at the suspect, according to multiple sources. A long gun has been recovered, according to the source. Officials believe an armed individual intended to target former President Donald Trump at his golf club, according to sources briefed on the matter. Officials believe an armed individual intended to target former President Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Club, according to sources briefed on the matter. A car has been stopped in relation to the incident nearby, according to a law enforcement official. The Secret Service said on X that it is working with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to investigate a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump. The Secret Service said the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m. ET. The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office is planning to speak at 3:15 p.m. ET to share more information, spokesperson Teri Barbera told CNN. Former President Donald Trump is safe “following gunshots in his vicinity,” his campaign said Sunday. Trump was playing golf at Trump international Golf Club in West Palm Beach when shots were fired. The course was immediately locked down, according to a source familiar.  As the 2024 campaign enters its final sprint, the candidates are hitting the trail this week, with Vice President Kamala Harris visiting key swing states and former President Donald Trump holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. The city of Springfield, Ohio, is going through “a very difficult time,” the mayor said Sunday, adding that it would be helpful if politicians who amplified false rumors about immigrants eating pets in his city “understood the weight of their words.”  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said city officials, including city commissioners, have received threats for the past three days. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance reiterated the false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of Springfield residents in an interview with Bash earlier Sunday. But he rejected the notion that his rhetoric has led to the bomb threats against city officials, schools, hospitals and universities in Springfield. Rue said he has not heard from Vance directly, “and that’s fine,” but said that he and others propagating the rumors should know that authorities in Springfield are telling the truth. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday criticized GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance for his lack of “partnerships” with local officials, after the Ohio senator continued to spread baseless rumors about migrants eating pets in the state. Moore said Vance emphasizing a handful of constituents and dismissing the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, shows he does not understand the importance local politicians play.  “It just gives a sense about how he views partnership and how he views the intelligence that’s coming from us.” Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday the false claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance, a Republican from Ohio. Rue on Thursday night urged national candidates — a clear reference to Trump and Vance — to “pay attention to what their words are doing to cities like ours.” “We need help, not hate,” Rue said. Kamala Harris’ campaign on Sunday slammed Donald Trump in a statement filled with Taylor Swift song references after the former president expressed hatred for the singer. Trump had posted to his Truth Social platform earlier Sunday, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” The music superstar endorsed Harris after the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday, ending speculation about whether she would share her political views ahead of November’s election. On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris — on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. Democrats — including Biden and Harris — ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record. Read more here Federal Reserve officials won’t say how former President Donald Trump winning a second term could impact the economy, striving to stay apolitical. But transcripts of closed-door Fed meetings from Trump’s first term, now publicly available, give some clues about top economists’ true feelings about the former president’s economic agenda. “So it seems to me that we may be trading a greater likelihood of a sustained expansion over the next year or two for a greater likelihood of a hard landing later,” Dudley added. A hard landing refers to when the Fed is unable to bring inflation down without causing the economy to enter a recession. Dudley, who is now president of Washington and Lee University, did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment. If voted into office in the November presidential election, Trump has promised to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on all foreign imports, up to 60% for some Chinese products, and levies as high as 100% for countries that abandon the dollar as their reserve currency. If enacted, those policies could have wide-reaching effects on the US economy as well as economies across the globe. The Fed declined to comment to CNN. Read more here Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Saturday claimed that he’s under investigation for collecting a whale’s specimen nearly two decades ago. Kennedy likely misspoke about the name of the investigating agency, as the National Marine Fisheries Services is an organization that falls under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CNN has reached out to the agencies for comment. On Saturday, Kennedy claimed he wrote a letter in response, accusing the investigators of killing whales and marine wildlife with “giant offshore wind farms off the East Coast.” A story resurfaced last month that Kennedy once used a chainsaw to cut off the head of a dead whale carcass that washed onshore of his Cape Cod family home and then drove the whale head back to New York. The story was recounted by Kennedy’s daughter Kathleen “Kick” Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country Magazine. An environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, had called for Kennedy to be investigated over the incident, arguing in a letter to NOAA that his actions could have jeopardized scientific research . Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Sunday condemned Republican vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance for refusing to walk back his baseless claims that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.   Shapiro’s comments came after Vance defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets earlier Sunday in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. Officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. Shapiro also told CNN that he anticipates a close race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania but noted that he’s optimistic his state will show up for Harris.  “I think what I’m seeing more and more of is not just the folks who are lining up to vote for her, but those who are enthusiastic about her candidacy in communities that oftentimes are not enthusiastic about Democratic candidates — and encouraging their neighbors to be for them as well,” Shapiro said. “So I’m really hopeful.”  Former President Donald Trump on Sunday continued raising doubts about election integrity and claimed, without evidence, that it was “not possible” for the US Postal Service to properly “run the 2024 Presidential Election.” “The United States Postal Service has admitted that it is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before. With this being the FACT, how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024 Presidential Election? It is not possible for them to do so. HELP!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  While election officials have warned that the US Postal Service may delay mail-in voting, citing systemic issues in the postal service as more Americans prepare to cast their ballots by mail, there is no evidence that its “not possible” for the postal service to handle mail-in ballots. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Sunday flatly denied the false rumor spread by Donald Trump that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio and praised immigrants for their positive influence on the community. “No. Absolutely not,” DeWine said when asked if he’d seen any evidence of the pet-eating rumor, a tale many Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have promoted. “Let me tell you what we do know, though. What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal,” the governor said on ABC’s “This Week.” “They came to Springfield to work.” DeWine acknowledged the city was having some issues adjusting to the influx of mostly Haitian immigrants through a federal immigration program, but he said they were working to deal with the issues. “When you go from a population of 58,000 and add 15,000 people onto that, you’re going to have some challenges and some problems,” the governor said. “And we’re addressing those. We’re working on those every single day.” But the governor said the Haitian immigrants in Springfield are “positive influences” on the community and “any comment about that otherwise, I think is hurtful and is not helpful to the city of Springfield and the people of Springfield.” Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday said he learned his lesson about speaking for Donald Trump after previously stating the former president would veto a national abortion ban.  “I think that I’ve learned my lesson on speaking for the president before he and I have actually talked about an issue. What he has said at the debate, which is quite explicit, is he doesn’t support a national ban. He thinks it’s ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn’t going to come before the president in the first place,” Vance said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” On the debate stage, Trump said that he doesn’t support a national abortion ban, but wouldn’t explicitly say he would veto one, rather that it wouldn’t make it through Congress. “We hadn’t discussed it,” Vance said. “We still haven’t discussed it, by the way, because it’s not realistic.” Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday sought to distance the Trump campaign from far-right agitator Laura Loomer, stating that while he doesn’t agree with her comments about Vice President Kamala Harris, it is not “an issue of national import” or insulting to talk about “dietary preferences.”  Two days before the ABC presidential debate, Loomer said if Harris, whose mother was from India, wins the 2024 election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Pressed on whether he disavows those comments, especially considering his wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants, Vance said, “I just told you I don’t like those comments, and I think that we ought to focus on Kamala Harris’ policy failures.” When Trump landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday before his debate against Vice Kamala Harris, Loomer was among the close allies seen deboarding his private plane. He said Friday that he doesn’t control Loomer, whom he described as a “free spirit” and “supporter.” Former President Donald Trump on Sunday said he hates Taylor Swift, days after the pop megastar endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Swift endorsed Harris after the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday, ending speculation about whether she would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift posted on Instagram. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift continued. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Asked about the endorsement on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Former President Donald Trump has conjured up an inflammatory false claim about Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy positions — baselessly saying Friday that Harris is talking about forcing Americans to serve in the military. Trump claimed at a rally in Las Vegas that voting for Harris means voting for war with Russia and voting to bring back the draft, a system in which some men are conscripted into involuntary service in the armed forces. Trump continued: “Would anybody like to be drafted, in the audience? Because that’s what they’re doing. She’s already talking about bringing back the draft. She wants to bring back the draft, and draft your child, and put them in a war that should never have happened.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris is not talking about bringing back the draft and has not put forward any proposals to bring back the draft. Trump’s campaign did not respond Saturday to CNN’s requests for any evidence for his claim. A Harris campaign aide said, “We have no idea what he’s talking about.” The US has not had a draft since 1973, the year it completed its military withdrawal from Vietnam. (Trump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War draft, four because he was a college student and a fifth on account of a doctor’s diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.) Since 1973, the country has used an all-volunteer force. Regardless of the wishes of any president, launching a new draft would require Congress to pass legislation. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Sunday defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Asked to support his claims, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening, though he didn’t provide the evidence.  Bash replied, “You just said that this is a story that you created.” Vance said, “It comes from firsthand accounts from my constituents. I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it. I didn’t create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield thanks to Kamala Harris’ policies. Her policies did that. But yes, we created the actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering caused by Kamala Harris’ policies.” The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor about immigrants eating pets. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. On Tuesday, Vance said it’s possible the false claim might not be true, but he encouraged his followers to continue posting “cat memes.” As CNN reported, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday that the claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance.  US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday swiped at former President Donald Trump over the baseless claims he’s pushed that immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating pets. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. Buttigieg continued, “They go for something that is so outrageous that you actually can’t ignore it. The media can’t ignore what’s going on, because very real pain has been inflicted on and fear, by the way, on people in this community and other communities around the country.” Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat-turned-independent who had toyed with a presidential run and has long been a thorn in the side of the left, has been mum about the candidate he’s backing in November. But that could soon change, as Manchin signaled he may get off the sidelines and plans to speak to Vice President Kamala Harris soon. Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee who voted twice to convict former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trials, reiterated his disdain for Trump – and objected to the former president’s refusal to say at last week’s debate that he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia. Asked twice if he could endorse Harris, Romney pointedly refused to say. The comments by Manchin and Romney – two retiring senators who have been on the outs with their respective party’s base – underscore how Trump has turned off some more moderate voters but also how Harris herself has yet to close the deal with right-leaning voters turned off by the former president. A third Trump detractor, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, doesn’t plan to vote for Harris, even as she said of the former president’s debate performance, “I don’t think it was Donald Trump’s best evening.” Read more here. Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, is taking “extreme precautions” in response to an email that threatened an on-campus shooting targeting Haitians on Sunday, according to university officials. The threat comes as several prominent Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Local officials at the city and state level have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse by immigrants in the area. The threat to Wittenberg University “targeted Haitian members of our community,” a statement released Saturday said. “Wittenberg Police are cooperating with the Springfield Police Division and the FBI to investigate this threat.”   All activities have been canceled on Sunday, and the Springfield Police Division will increase patrols on campus, the university’s statement said, adding that those who are on or near campus should “prepare for additional instructions or a lockdown if we learn more from the ongoing investigation.” Wittenberg University had 1,288 undergraduate students enrolled in the fall 2023 term, according to its website. CNN has reached out to the Wittenberg Police Department for additional information.  Donald Trump wanted to spend this week attacking one of Democratic rival Kamala Harris’ biggest political vulnerabilities. Instead, he spent most of the week falsely claiming that migrants are eating pets in a small town in Ohio and defending his embrace of a far-right agitator whose presence is causing concern among his allies. Trump’s repeated parroting of unfounded social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets stole headlines during a trip West, including stops in Arizona and Nevada, late this week. The promotion of the claims overshadowed a series of speeches aimed at the economy and blaming Harris for border security failures. Trump, in a news conference in California on Friday, promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio — the town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States.

New polling post-debate from ABC News and Ipsos finds Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump among likely voters, with the margin in the race unchanged from ABC News polling conducted in late August.  Overall, 52% of likely voters back Harris, 46% Trump in the poll, the same margin the pollsters found among likely voters in an August 23 through 27 poll. Among adults, the survey suggests little change in the dynamic between the candidates on the campaign’s central issues. Trump continues to be more widely trusted to handle the economy (46% Trump to 39% Harris) and immigration (47% Trump to 37% Harris), while Harris is broadly more trusted on abortion (48% Harris to 34% Trump) and protecting American democracy (45% Harris to 38% Trump). The ABC News poll was conducted online Sept. 11-13 among a random national sample of 3,276 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 points. For results among the 2,196 likely voters, the error margin is plus or minus 2 points. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Nebraska Democratic officials are keeping a close eye on any last-minute efforts to change the election law that awards the state’s electoral votes by congressional district, rather than statewide winner. Nebraska’s unique law presents an opportunity for Democrats to secure one of the state’s votes by winning the district surrounding Omaha — a critical blue dot in a sea of red. The state’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear Friday that he is willing to call a special legislative session on changing the state to a “winner takes all” model before the November election — but said in a statement that he doesn’t yet have “concrete and public indication” that enough lawmakers would back the move. Nebraska Democratic chairwoman Jane Kleeb said Saturday that Pillen’s statement signals Republicans “do not have the votes to change the fair electoral system we have in Nebraska.” When the matter of changing the law came up for a vote in the state legislature earlier this year, it was 17 votes shy of passing. Kleeb said Saturday that those 17 votes remain “very solid.” Bottom line: If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot vote in Nebraska, she can likely reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. That means a potential change to the law — which would be a shocking development so close to the election — could have serious implications for each presidential campaign. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz made a direct pitch to Muslim and Arab American voters in Michigan, addressing those concerned about the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. The Minnesota governor used an interview Friday to reiterate Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and argued Trump’s record of targeting Muslim Americans is “not in your best interest.” Harris is more cognizant of the suffering of Palestinians than Trump, Walz said in the interview with WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, addressing those from the “Abandon Harris” movement. Illustrating the constant balancing act for the Democratic ticket on the Middle East, Walz also emphasized the importance of Israel’s self-defense. “That’s why she’s the person to move us toward a two-state solution, where Israel can be protected, we get our hostages back, and Gaza can be self-determined,” he added. Walz contrasted Harris’ view with Trump’s previous support of a travel ban that targeted people from Muslim-majority countries, and his calls to send some Muslim members of Congress to their countries of origin. “Donald Trump is offering you nothing,” Walz said, to voters skeptical of Harris over the issue. “That is not in your best interest.”"
"Texts, tough love, campaign advice and strategy dinners – the women Kamala Harris has mentored | CNN Politics","Updated 1:16 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-15T11:30:19.878Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/kamala-harris-mentor-women/index.html,"Backstage, Kamala Harris pulled aside Jahana Hayes. She’d give the congresswoman her local press boost and photo op, but first, the vice president needed to talk about why she was popping into Connecticut of all places during the final month of her 2022 midterm campaigning: Hayes wasn’t raising enough money. Pick it up, Harris told her. National Democrats wouldn’t stick with Hayes if she didn’t help herself. Long before she became the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris had started quietly nurturing a network of next-generation politicians – almost all women of color, many with backgrounds in the law, many who didn’t know who else was in the group. Often, that has been through check-in calls offering encouragement and advice, many of these women told CNN, though sometimes Harris will interrogate them on the specifics of campaign strategy or push them on how they’re dealing with labor or other constituencies. She was on a running text thread with Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley. She counseled longtime friend and former aide Laphonza Butler through the frenetic weekend last fall that ended with Butler’s appointment to the Senate. She hosted a collection of Black congresswomen for a dinner at the Naval Observatory, the vice president’s residence. Tears can flow. Major life-changing decisions get made. Harris always asks about their kids. And along the way, these relationships have become core for Harris herself – as a mission for a politician who takes seriously her mother’s admonition to be the first but not the last. They’re also a comfort for a vice president who remembers well her own loneliness as she worked her way up and serve as a base of support for a politician who until July had seen much of the Democratic establishment turn on her. “She checks in on people that nobody else pays attention to,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a first-term congresswoman from Texas who teared up last month recalling the first time the two met – in a photo line during a reception on Crockett’s first visit to the Naval Observatory. Harris looked at her and said, “What’s wrong?” Crockett said that it wasn’t until that moment that she realized how overwhelmed she felt wondering if she’d made a mistake running for Congress, on top of the stress of battling with Republicans on the House Oversight Committee in defense of President Joe Biden. Harris, Crockett said, “saw right through me,” as she felt only another Black woman who had experienced the same pressures and bruises of politics could. With Harris within reach of the Oval Office, these women feel the pride of now supporting her, but also of what her win would mean to them, the issues they have connected on and their own careers. Many who had never imagined careers in politics boggle at the idea of a president who might look like them and know them by name. Angela Alsobrooks, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Maryland, has started collecting magazines with Harris on the cover, buttons, a T-shirt and other memorabilia. Lateefah Simon, who first met Harris over 20 years ago when the young San Francisco assistant district attorney reached out to Simon as the leader of a group for young girls in trouble, is now all but certain to win an open House seat anchored in Oakland. She broke down sobbing during Maya Harris’ convention speech when thinking of her own memories of the vice president’s mother. Simon likes to joke that whenever an unknown caller comes up, it’s either her student loan company or Harris. When she got one of those calls in March, it was Harris with a congratulations and what Simon says was “the most beautiful pep talk that I’ve ever had from anybody,” hours before the primary polls closed. If Harris will soon be making those calls from the White House, to Simon that would be the ultimate proof of the biggest lesson she has learned from Harris over the years: “That this thing is doable, that we don’t need to have legacy or families that are multimillionaires,” she said. “There is a road to leadership.” Now about a month shy of 60, Harris is not that much older than most of these women, but she is older enough and has been credited enough times for being a “first” in the offices she has won. She came into their lives in different ways, at different points. Alsobrooks read an article about Harris’ restorative justice work as San Francisco district attorney in Essence magazine when she was running to be a county prosecutor in Maryland and started talking about it on the trail. Then, a few days after she won, her phone rang. “’Hi, it’s Kamala Harris,’” Alsobrooks remembers hearing. She was shocked. “Can you imagine like you’re talking about someone you read about in a magazine? I didn’t even know she knew I existed,” Alsobrooks told CNN after a recent campaign stop. “Not only did she call, but she said, ‘Tell me, how I can help you?’” Alsobrooks ended up flying to San Francisco, where Harris set her up with meetings, including with people at Goodwill Industries, who oversaw the workforce development program that had partnered with Harris’ office, and with a judge who helped guide younger offenders toward the restorative justice program. They hit it off, and years later, Harris invited Alsobrooks back across the country to ride her campaign bus for the final stretch of her 2016 Senate campaign. For Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, the first time she saw Harris was when the then-district attorney spoke at her 2009 UCLA law school commencement. She was intrigued, went to fundraisers for Harris in Boston and flew to California for her Senate election victory party. “Joy” was the theme of the Democratic convention in August, but Alsobrooks and Campbell say that Harris has been stressing the word to them for years. To Campbell, it wasn’t just pushing an ephemeral feeling, but encouraging her not to shy away from speaking about the time her father and brothers spent in prison. Harris “always encouraged me, offered love and guidance on how not to be distracted by those who would want to use it against me,” Campbell said. Instead, she used that story to pull people “into the political fold where they may feel as though politics and government isn’t for them.” Harris’s advice hits a few consistent beats: “None of it is personal,” “Don’t internalize it,” “Come early and stay late,” “Stay focused on your why” and, perhaps most consistently, “If it was easy, everyone would do this.” “She wants us to understand the reality of what it means to be a Black woman running for higher office, that there are significant challenges: It’s much harder to fundraise. It can be more challenging to break through, including in the media, to cover your race or to cover your story with the thoughtfulness maybe it deserves,” Campbell said. But sometimes the advice is specific. Malia Cohen, now the California state controller, first met Harris as a volunteer for Gavin Newsom’s mayoral campaign in San Francisco, but then she got interested in the young Black woman who was running for district attorney. Cohen switched over to Harris’ campaign for a few shifts. When Cohen launched her own campaign years later for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, a man she met with to ask for an endorsement invited her to a Bruce Springsteen concert and offered to buy her drinks. Cohen remembered telling Harris on a call what happened. “She said, ‘When you’re talking to these guys, stick to your guns, talk business, and make it very, very clear that this is not a date,’” Cohen recalled. “And I asked her if she ever experienced that and she said, ‘No. All of these men know that when I’m in the room, that I’m about business.’ And that was the end of that.” Daniele Monroe-Moreno, the Nevada Democratic Party chair and the speaker pro tempore of the state Assembly, was at a luncheon in Las Vegas when she met Harris, not long after the Senate win. They started talking about the maternal health legislation Monroe-Moreno was working on. “Kamala said, ‘I’ve been working on that myself. Can I help you?’ And I thought, ‘Sure, OK, you can help me’. But she’s a senator, right? She’s busy,” Monroe-Moreno remembered. “But just a few weeks later, I get a call, and it’s one of her staff, who said, ‘Hey, my boss is Kamala Harris, and she said you’re working on a policy, and we’ve done a lot of research.’” Two weeks of collaborating and wrangling with colleagues later, the bill passed. Monroe-Moreno said she doubts the law would have ended up on the books without that help. Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota, hasn’t had as many encounters with Harris, but the ones she’s had stick with her. In the spring, backstage at an EMILY’s List gala, Flanagan — who is of Native American heritage — was going on about how great it was to see the video the vice president’s office had just put out with the old cast of “A Different World” about the administration’s work on student debt. Before Harris went out onstage, Flanagan said, “She grabbed me by my shoulders and said, ‘I want you to know that I have your back.’” The loyalty runs both ways. Campbell, seven months pregnant at the time, flew to Iowa to campaign for Harris during her unsuccessful bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. And amid the early Democratic implosion around Biden’s candidacy in July, Hayes spoke out in a private meeting of her House colleagues, worried that if the vice president was suddenly asked to take over a doomed campaign, she’d get an undue share of the blame. The afternoon that Biden dropped out and Harris started ticking through dozens of calls, it wasn’t just senior leaders and potential rivals who heard from her. “I don’t know how I made the cut,” Crockett said. “It was a call of gratitude, and just, ‘I want to say thank you.’” Campbell recalled goosebumps and tears that day. Alsobrooks said the pride she feels in seeing Harris’ campaign take off in the weeks since is like that “for a sister.” As much as they’re rooting for and working toward Harris’ win, though, these women still haven’t quite wrapped their heads around the idea that if she does, beyond all the greater meaning politically and culturally, the next president of the United States would be the woman who for so many years has just been Kamala on the other end of the phone. For women who never saw themselves in elected office, that’s an overwhelming thought anyway. But to imagine that the president would be a woman who helped and inspired them get to where they are, it’s much more. “It is not just like, I’d be proud she’s president. I just know what she endured,” Alsobrooks said. “This is a person who, over 30 years, worked hard. So the pride I feel is not that I drank the Kool-Aid. She’d be president, and I would be proud of that. But I am so proud of her.”"
Fact check: Harris campaign social media account has repeatedly deceived with misleading edits and captions | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:57 PM EDT, Sat September 14, 2024",2024-09-14T15:00:19.549Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/14/politics/fact-check-harris-campaign-social-media/index.html,"A social media account run by Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has been repeatedly deceptive. The @KamalaHQ account, which has more than 1.3 million followers on the X social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has made a habit of misleadingly clipping and inaccurately captioning video clips to attack former President Donald Trump. The Harris campaign deploys @KamalaHQ as a kind of irreverent attack dog, using jocular posts to draw attention to controversial, incorrect, or dubious comments by Trump and his allies. But the account, which the Harris campaign calls its “official rapid response page,” has itself made inaccurate comments on multiple occasions. Below are eight examples of false or misleading video posts from the account since mid-August, including three from the latter part of this week. All of them have previously been highlighted by an anonymous rebuttal account called @KamalaHQLies, which itself has more than 268,000 followers. Misleadingly describing a Trump comment about his supporters An August 17 post from @KamalaHQ strongly suggested Trump had gotten confused about what state he was in during an event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The post said, “Trump: Would that be okay, North Carolina? (He is in Pennsylvania).” It included a six-second video clip in which Trump said, while pointing to his left, “Would that be okay, North Carolina? I don’t think so, right.” The Harris campaign was explicit about its intentions in the version of the post it made on the Instagram @KamalaHQ account, saying, “Donald Trump is lost and confused.” But Trump was not lost or confused. The full video of the rally shows that earlier in the speech, Trump had pointed to the same spot on his left to acknowledge and then speak to a group of ardent supporters from North Carolina, eventually saying, “Thank you very much. North Carolina!” Later, in the moment shown by @KamalaHQ, he pointed to these supporters again and referred to them as “North Carolina.” He had not forgotten he was speaking in Pennsylvania. The Harris campaign declined to comment on this @KamalaHQ post. Deceptively clipping and misleadingly describing a Trump comment about immigration On Thursday, the @KamalaHQ account made a new attempt to suggest that Trump was confused about his location. Its post said, “Trump: ‘Pennsylvania, remember this when you have to go to vote’ (He is in Arizona).” It included an eight-second clip of Trump saying in a Tucson speech, “So Pennsylvania, remember this when you have to go to vote, okay, just remember this: 2,000% increase. This is a small —…” The Instagram post of this remark, too, was more explicit than the X post; on Instagram, the Harris campaign added text over top the video that read, “Trump forgets which state he is in (again).” But Trump, again, had not forgotten which state he was in. The extended footage shows that the Harris campaign clipped out critical context: Trump was talking about immigration, a key topic in Arizona, and had just read a part of his prepared text about how a small Pennsylvania town has “experienced a 2,000% increase in the population of Haitian migrants under Kamala Harris.” He then added, “So Pennsylvania, remember this when you have to go to vote, okay, just remember this: 2,000% increase, this is a small town; of all a sudden they got thousands of people.” One could try to argue it’s odd for Trump to make a direct appeal to Pennsylvanians while speaking in Arizona. But Trump’s remarks anywhere in the country are broadcast to voters everywhere in the country, and, regardless, @KamalaHQ eliminated the context that would allow people to develop an informed opinion on this remark. The Harris campaign declined to comment on this @KamalaHQ post. Deceptively clipping and misleadingly describing a Trump comment about his 2017 Charlottesville remark A Friday post from @KamalaHQ said, “Trump says ‘nothing was done wrong’ in Charlottesville in 2017 when neo-Nazis chanted ‘Jews will not replace us’ and killed an innocent woman.” The post included a 10-second clip of Trump telling reporters at a Friday event in California, “…like on Project 2025, I have no idea about — had nothing to do with me, he didn’t correct her, he knew that. Charlottesville — nothing was done wrong.” But the full video of Trump’s California comments shows that the Harris campaign deceptively cut the clip right before Trump made clear he was not claiming that neo-Nazis in Charlottesville did nothing wrong or that the murder of innocent Charlottesville counterprotester Heather Heyer was not wrong. Rather, the full video shows, he was arguing that he did nothing wrong with his “very fine people, on both sides” comment in 2017 about the events in Charlottesville, which he has repeatedly insisted was not about white nationalists. Specifically, Trump was complaining that a moderator of the presidential debate on Tuesday, David Muir of ABC News, did not challenge how Harris described Trump’s 2017 comments. We say Harris’ debate description of the 2017 comments was fair, but regardless, Trump was not defending murder on Friday. Here is Trump’s full Friday remark, in which he invoked various Fox News hosts: “I think he (Muir) corrected me 11 times. Of the 11 times, I don’t think he had the right to correct me at all. Didn’t correct her once. Like on Project 2025, I have no idea about — had nothing to do with me, he didn’t correct her, he knew that. Charlottesville — nothing was done wrong. All you had to do is read my statement one more sentence and you would’ve seen that. Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Jesse (Watters), all of them, they — Greg Gutfeld — they all took that and they corrected it many times. But they keep coming with the same lies.” Defending the @KamalaHQ post, the Harris campaign said in an email: “He’s saying he did ‘nothing wrong’ in relation to him saying ‘very fine people’ who did what is described in the tweet.” There are two problems with this. The post itself did not acknowledge that Trump’s “nothing wrong” comment was about his own previous remark. And while there’s a solid case that this 2017 “very fine people” comment was about some white nationalists, there’s no basis for claiming it was about Heyer’s murderer in particular — much less that Trump’s “nothing wrong” comment on Friday was about this murderer. Deceptively clipping and inaccurately quoting a JD Vance quote about veterans’ health care On Thursday, the @KamalaHQ account posted a nine-second video clip of Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, speaking in an interview. The account wrote: “Q: Would you consider privatizing veterans health care? Vance: I think I’d consider it.” But Vance did not actually say “I think I’d consider it.” A close listen to the clip reveals Vance actually said “I think I’d consider — and…” And because @KamalaHQ clipped out the critical comments he made after the “and,” the Harris campaign didn’t allow people to immediately learn just what Vance said he would consider. The extended Vance quote shows he said he would consider giving veterans greater flexibility to use private health care but that he does not want to eliminate federal health care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A public-private combination for veterans’ care was the general approach taken by President Barack Obama and then by Trump; it’s certainly not without critics, but it’s much less contentious than the idea of a total privatization. Here’s the full Vance quote: “I think I’d consider — and Donald Trump was really good at this, doesn’t get enough credit for this particular innovation — giving veterans more choice. Right? So let’s say you’re in a rural hospital. Your closest VA is 120 miles away. Why force a veteran to drive two-and-a-half hours to that VA facility when he can get cheaper and good care right in his backyard? Right? So I do think that we ought to open up choice and optionality for veterans. You know, I think that there is areas where the VA actually works very well, so I wouldn’t say get rid of the whole thing. I would say give people more choice, I think you’ll save money in the process, you’ll also give veterans a lot more optionality.” The Harris campaign defended the @KamalaHQ post. It argued in its email, “Vance is suggesting he would consider privatizing VA functions. This is not misleading. Our caption does not say ‘the whole VA health system.’” But the Harris campaign did not address the caption’s “consider it” misquote or explain why it cut the clip before people could hear Vance explain what he would “consider.” And if the Harris campaign wanted to claim Vance was talking about possibly privatizing certain VA “functions,” as it said in the email, it could have said that in the post rather than at very least leaving open the impression he was talking about privatizing the whole VA. Vance spokesperson William Martin said the Harris campaign is “lying” about what Vance said. Martin said Vance “personally relied on the VA for years after leaving the Marine Corps,” that Vance does not even want to privatize VA “functions,” and that giving veterans more options to voluntarily choose private care cannot be fairly described as privatizing even parts of the VA. Martin said: “In the full exchange, Senator Vance clearly says he would not privatize the Department of Veterans Affairs.” Deceptively clipping and falsely describing a Trump quote about penalties for damaging monuments The @KamalaHQ account frequently invokes Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation think tank’s right-wing policy proposals for the next Republican administration. Project 2025 is not Trump’s initiative, and he has said he disagrees with some of its proposals, but he has extensive ties to the initiative; you can read more here. An August 30 post from @KamalaHQ said, “Trump says he plans to bring back laws from 100+ years ago, echoing Project 2025: ‘We don’t pass laws like that. They are tough.’” The post included a seven-second clip of Trump speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania. But the full video of the rally shows Trump was not even talking about Project 2025 or his future plans. Rather, Trump was telling his usual tale about how he supposedly “signed” a century-old law to give automatic 10-year prison sentences to people who were damaging monuments. Trump’s story is false — he didn’t actually sign any law on monument-damage penalties or impose automatic 10-year sentences — but it’s also false that he was “echoing Project 2025” or announcing some plan for a next Trump administration. The Harris campaign defended this @KamalaHQ post by arguing that “Trump’s entire platform is about embracing ‘tough’ policy of the past” on various subjects. That’s another thin defense. The post made a specific claim about what Trump was supposedly saying in a specific video included in the post, and Trump wasn’t actually saying that. Deceptively clipping and misleadingly describing a Trump comment about taxes A September 5 post from @KamalaHQ said, “Trump tells his wealthy donors he is going to make his tax handouts for the ultra-wealthy ‘permanent’ and cut their taxes ‘even more.’” It included a 13-second clip of Trump saying, “The fifth pillar of my plan is to make the Trump tax cuts permanent — they are massive tax cuts, biggest ever, permanent — and to cut taxes even more.” But the full video of the speech shows the @KamalaHQ post cut the video clip right before Trump elaborated on what he meant by cutting taxes “even more.” The first two policies he mentioned were eliminating taxes on tips and eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits — policies that, whatever their merits or flaws, would certainly benefit people who are not wealthy. (So did his 2017 tax cuts, which produced gains on average for people of all income levels although the wealthy gained most.) Also, this was not a speech to wealthy Trump donors alone. It was a speech to the nonpartisan Economic Club of New York, whose members include a broad array of business executives from the area; some attendees were wealthy Trump donors, but others were not. The very next day, the Harris campaign used the @KamalaHQ account to tout her own popularity among chief executives. The Harris campaign defended the post in question in part by noting that wealthy Trump donors were in attendance and in part by saying that one of the biggest policy announcements Trump made in speech was that he plans to try to lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% (a reduction Trump said would be “solely for companies that make their product in America”). The Harris campaign said that “no tax on tips and Social Security were not new.” New or not, though, the @KamalaHQ clip clipped out those important words — making Trump’s comments on tax cuts sound more focused on the wealthy than they were. Cutting out critical words from a Vance comment about unions An August 29 post from @KamalaHQ said, “Vance: Democrats want to attack Republicans as being anti-union and sometimes the shoe fits.” It included a five-second clip of Vance saying those words. But the full video of Vance’s speech to the International Association of Fire Fighters union shows that the Harris account clipped out the critical remark Vance made next, arguably in the very same sentence. His full comment: “A lot of Democrats want to attack Republicans as being anti-union and sometimes the shoe fits — but not me, and not Donald Trump.” He went on to outline actions he had taken to support firefighters. The Harris campaign said that this @KamalaHQ post was a “direct quote of JD Vance”; the campaign said the post is “clearly meant to convey that Vance acknowledges Republicans have a history of being anti-union.” But even “direct” quotes can be made misleading if they exclude the contextualizing words that came before or after the quote. If, for example, movie critic Sally Smith wrote, “This director has a long history of making great films, but this one is awful,” it would be a “direct” quote if an ad for the new movie said, “Smith: ‘This director has a long history of making great films.’” But that would also be deceptive. Falsely describing a comment from a Trump ally An August 28 post from @KamalaHQ said: “Trump operative on Project 2025: If you have principles without power, it’s meaningless. We must wield power. We must seize power.” The post included a 12-second clip of far-right activist and Trump ally Jack Posobiec saying in an interview, “Now if you have all power and no principle you’re a tyrant. But if you have principles without power, it’s meaningless, it’s completely meaningless. You must wield power. You must seize power.” But as Posobiec accurately noted in response to the @KamalaHQ post, he never even mentioned Project 2025 in these comments. The words Project 2025 do not appear at all in a transcript of the full interview. The Harris campaign defended the @KamalaHQ post with a confusing stretch — claiming Posobiec’s comment is “part of” a “larger” Trump-Project 2025 agenda to fire civil servants who are not seen as Trump loyalists. Posobiec wasn’t talking here about firing civil servants, and, regardless, the post made a specific claim that Posobiec was talking about Project 2025, which he was not."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris warned Saturday that a second term for former President Donald Trump poses a “profound threat” to the vision of the nation. While delivering remarks at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Awards Dinner, Harris claimed Trump and his allies “intend to take our nation backward.”   Harris railed against the former president’s policies, criticizing his inability to outline his plans for health care during Tuesday night’s debate. She touted her plans to build intergenerational wealth, her economic agenda, and her determination to fight for reproductive freedoms, telling the CBC, “When you pass a bill to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.” Harris also emphasized the stakes of the election, telling attendees, “The baton is in our hands.” ##Harris## President Joe Biden on Saturday slammed former President Donald Trump for his divisive rhetoric and conspiracy theories while praising Vice President Kamala Harris and telling Black Americans to “keep the faith.” Speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Awards, where he received a lifetime achievement award, Biden touted his legacy and looked ahead to the election. Biden specifically responded to the false rumor spread by the Trump campaign that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are stealing and eating people’s pets. “He says immigrants, Black and brown immigrants, poison the blood of our country. Right now, his running mate is attacking Haitian Americans in Ohio. It’s wrong,” Biden said. The president touted his accomplishments in lowering health care costs, his efforts to forgive student debt, his climate actions and his appointment of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Biden stressed that “we have work to do” in the limited time before the election. “So, my challenge to you is to keep the faith. Do the work, because we know faith without works is dead,” he said. While introducing Harris, Biden called his vice president “the best decision I’ve made.” Former President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would make up the lost tax revenue from his tax proposals with increased funds from drilling and by imposing tariffs on foreign nations. Trump has proposed eliminating taxes on tips, ending taxes on overtime pay and cutting income taxes on Social Security benefits. When asked in an interview with Las Vegas TV station KNTV how he plans to replace decreased revenue from the federal budget, Trump said, “Drill, baby drill.” Trump defended his tariffs plan when asked whether he believes the levies would cause prices to increase and wipe out any advantage from his tax proposals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz questioned why working-class voters might support former President Donald Trump during a rally in Superior, Wisconsin, on Saturday, while relating to fellow Democrats in exasperation over “friends, neighbors, family” who support Trump’s policy proposals. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, whose brother and distant cousins have expressed support for Trump, laid out conversations he’s had with voters about why they support the Republican nominee. Walz’s comments come as the Harris campaign is aggressively courting independent and Republican-leaning voters in rural areas, including places like northwest Wisconsin, where the governor spoke Saturday. Walz also repeatedly stressed in his remarks the importance of bringing Vice President Kamala Harris’ message to Republican voters. His trip to Superior marks the end of his first solo swing through Michigan and Wisconsin as the Democratic vice presidential candidate. The town sits in a county President Joe Biden won by 9 points in 2020, but borders rural counties where the campaign is hoping to cut into Trump’s margins. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance criticized the federal immigration parole program that allows Haitian immigrants to be in Springfield, Ohio, legally, arguing that “only people who actually enrich” the country should be here. Vance’s response was to a question about the potential backlash immigrants are facing after his recent false claims about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield. Local officials have repeatedly said there are no credible claims about such animal abuse, and following the evacuation of two schools and a bomb threat on the city hall, the city’s mayor urged former President Donald Trump and Vance “to pay attention” to the impact of their rhetoric. Vance on Saturday also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies, which include the immigration parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the US, according to the city of Springfield’s website. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who all condemned far-right agitator Laura Loomer’s racist comments and expressed concern about her ties to former President Donald Trump, issued a joint statement Saturday saying they are glad “Trump has made clear he disavows Laura Loomer’s offensive comments.” But at a Friday news conference, Trump didn’t make it exactly clear he condemns Loomer’s comments. In response to questions about Loomer’s racist and conspiratorial statements, Trump said that he had just heard about them and that Loomer was a person with “strong opinions.” “I do know that she may have said something based on what you’re telling me, but I don’t know what she said, but I’ll go take a look and I’ll put out a statement later on,” Trump said.  When asked by CNN’s Kristen Holmes about his allies expressing concerns, Trump said, “Laura’s been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign. … I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit.” Later on Truth Social, Trump said he disagreed “with the statements” Loomer made but didn’t specify which statements.  Vice President Kamala Harris told donors at a fundraiser in Washington, DC, on Saturday that the contrast with former President Donald Trump was “very clear” on the debate stage this week. In the days following the debate, Harris has repeatedly blasted the former president for his performance. She criticized him Saturday for having “no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people” before hitting him on policy issues including his promise to replace the Affordable Care Act without offering a plan to do so. “So he’s saying that again, that he wants to replace it. And then remember what he said about how he’s going to do it? You guys watched the debate. Concepts of a plan. That’s right. Concepts of a plan. No actual plan,” she said. Harris reminded donors of the stakes of the election, telling them the “clock is ticking” with only 52 days until Election Day and urging them to volunteer and mobilize their friends to vote.  Donald Trump said Saturday that Springfield, Ohio, has “been taken over by illegal migrants,” and that he doesn’t know about the bomb threats the town has been receiving since he and other Republicans spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets there. Some context: The claim went viral a few weeks ago and has been promoted by prominent national-level Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials have repeatedly tried to end the rumor, and the city has said there are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” As CNN reported, Springfield City Hall was forced to close due to a bomb threat on Thursday. Two elementary schools were also evacuated Friday “based on information received from the Springfield Police Division,” the city’s school district said. Trump said Friday that the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” rather than the bomb threats in Springfield.  The city notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the US. Trump’s remarks Saturday were the latest in a string of inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants this week. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance stopped by Sup Dog, a bar in downtown Greenville, North Carolina, ahead of the East Carolina v. Appalachian State football game, which Vance is attending. With music blasting on the outdoor patio, the Ohio senator walked up with a drink in his hand and sat down at a picnic table with three young men. Vance, who was joined by his wife, Usha, made his way to different tables, greeting people, chatting and taking photos.  “Remember to vote November, right,” Vance told a group of people. “Y’all going to the game or are you just here to drink?” One of the men asked, “Any chance you want to get drinks at the bar?” Vance laughed and said he already had one. “If I take shots all of these reporters will cover it negatively, so I can’t do it,” Vance joked. Pigskin politics: Last week, the Democratic National Committee flew planes over college football games in Midwestern battleground states featuring banners linking Vance and his running mate, former President Donald Trump, to the controversial conservative policy platform Project 2025. Trump has previously enjoyed warm welcomes at red state college games. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Nebraska Democratic officials are keeping a close eye on any last-minute efforts to change the election law that awards the state’s electoral votes by congressional district, rather than statewide winner. Nebraska’s unique law presents an opportunity for Democrats to secure one of the state’s votes by winning the district surrounding Omaha — a critical blue dot in a sea of red. The state’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen made it clear Friday that he is willing to call a special legislative session on changing the state to a “winner takes all” model before the November election — but said in a statement that he doesn’t yet have “concrete and public indication” that enough lawmakers would back the move. Nebraska Democratic chairwoman Jane Kleeb said Saturday that Pillen’s statement signals Republicans “do not have the votes to change the fair electoral system we have in Nebraska.” When the matter of changing the law came up for a vote in the state legislature earlier this year, it was 17 votes shy of passing. Kleeb said Saturday that those 17 votes remain “very solid.” Why this is so important: If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot vote in Nebraska, she can likely reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. Prominent GOP backer: Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who has led a rallying cry in favor of changing the election law, is returning to the state Saturday to appear at a GOP tailgate party before a Nebraska football game. Kleeb dismissed Kirk’s involvement in the state as “bullying and bluster.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz made a direct pitch to Muslim and Arab American voters in Michigan, addressing those concerned about the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. The Minnesota governor used an interview Friday to reiterate Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for a ceasefire-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, and argued Trump’s record of targeting Muslim Americans is “not in your best interest.” Harris is more cognizant of the suffering of Palestinians than Trump, Walz said in the interview with WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan, addressing those from the “Abandon Harris” movement. Illustrating the constant balancing act for the Democratic ticket on the Middle East, Walz also emphasized the importance of Israel’s self-defense. “That’s why she’s the person to move us toward a two-state solution, where Israel can be protected, we get our hostages back, and Gaza can be self-determined,” he added. Walz contrasted Harris’ view with Trump’s previous support of a travel ban that targeted people from Muslim-majority countries, and his calls to send some Muslim members of Congress to their countries of origin. “Donald Trump is offering you nothing,” Walz said, to voters skeptical of Harris over the issue. “That is not in your best interest.” A social media account run by Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has been repeatedly deceptive. The campaign deploys the @KamalaHQ account as a kind of irreverent attack dog, using jocular posts to draw attention to controversial, incorrect or dubious comments by Trump and his allies. But the account, which the Harris campaign calls its “official rapid response page,” has itself made inaccurate comments on multiple occasions. In one example, an August 17 post from @KamalaHQ strongly suggested Trump had gotten confused about what state he was in during an event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The post said, “Trump: Would that be okay, North Carolina? (He is in Pennsylvania).” It included a six-second video clip in which Trump said, while pointing to his left, “Would that be OK, North Carolina? I don’t think so, right.” The Harris campaign was explicit about its intentions in the version of the post it made on the Instagram @KamalaHQ account, saying, “Donald Trump is lost and confused.” But Trump was not lost or confused. The full video of the rally shows that earlier in the speech he had pointed to the same part of the crowd to acknowledge a group of ardent supporters from North Carolina. Later, in the moment shown by @KamalaHQ, he pointed to these supporters again and referred to them as “North Carolina.” On Thursday, the @KamalaHQ account made a new attempt to suggest that Trump was confused about his location, but again left out key context. Read about that post and six more examples in the full fact check. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will make campaign stops in Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign announced Saturday.  The Democratic vice presidential nominee will speak at an event in Macon, Georgia, in the morning before making stops in Atlanta later in the day, the campaign said. In the evening he’ll fly to Asheville, North Carolina, where he’ll speak at a campaign rally.  The trip marks Walz’s first solo visit to Georgia and his second solo trip to North Carolina since becoming Harris’ running mate. Both states are among the key battlegrounds expected to determine the 2024 presidential election. Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick on Saturday condemned former President Donald Trump’s false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and warned that his rhetoric could spark violence against immigrants.  “My first reaction was just pure disgust and disdain,” the Florida congresswoman and House Haiti Caucus co-chair said Saturday on CNN’s “First of All with Victor Blackwell.” “For him to say that they’re actually committing crimes and stealing pets is a big lie.”  Cherfilus-McCormick is the only Haitian American currently serving in Congress and says she’s “absolutely” concerned that immigrants will get hurt if Trump continues with this inflammatory message. “We’re feeling the combativeness, we’re feeling the death threats,” the lawmaker said, adding that she’s “hearing that from people all across the country.” Remember: Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, continue to promote false claims that Haitian immigrants are killing and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. The rumor appears to have started on a local Facebook group for the community, which has seen an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants under the Immigration Parole Program, and has been amplified by right-wing voices as part of their broader anti-immigrant messaging. At a rally Friday, Trump ramped up his rhetoric about immigrants, also doubling down on false claims that Venezuelan gangs were “taking over” Aurora, Colorado.  CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a wave of new efforts targeting Latino voters during Hispanic Heritage Month to mobilize the key demographic in battleground states. Part of its outreach includes a $3 million investment into Spanish-language radio for September, which the campaign said is among the largest investments into Hispanic media ever. The investment consists of engagements with influential radio personalities, sports-themed creative and advertising during local baseball, football, and soccer team coverage.  The campaign also released a new ad on Friday titled, “My Voice,” featuring Victor Martinez, an Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Lehigh Valley host of La Mega Radio who highlighted Harris’ efforts to lower costs for Latino working families. Throughout the month, surrogates will be deployed to events, including Saturday night’s fight between world champion boxer Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga, Mexican Independence Day celebrations, and the Detroit Tigers Hispanic Heritage Tailgate. Additionally, organizers will focus on an aggressive push of bilingual phone banking, in-person organizing events and training to help reach the constituency.  Harris is also set to deliver remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual conference on Wednesday. Republicans haven’t given up on turning Nebraska’s blue dot red. Republican Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement Friday that he’s prepared to call a special session of the Nebraska legislature before the November election to change the state law that awards electoral votes by congressional district, rather than awarding all of them to the statewide winner. But, Pillen said, he would only do so if there was sufficient support from state lawmakers. Pillen’s statement underscores his willingness to change state law — an extraordinary move, given the election is less than two months away — but only if Republicans could persuade 33 senators to change their mind and support the bill. So far, support for a switch to the “winner takes all” format has been a few votes short. Key context: Omaha’s blue dot refers to Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and its single electoral vote, which is considered competitive for Democrats in the otherwise red state, thanks to the current system of awarding electoral votes proportionally. If Vice President Kamala Harris can win the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot, she can reach 270 electoral votes without winning a single other contested battleground state. Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that award electoral votes by congressional district, rather than by statewide winner. Barack Obama in 2008 and Joe Biden in 2020 are the Democratic Party’s only two candidates to reap a single electoral vote reward. The effort to change the law now signals concern by Republicans that Trump is struggling to win the district. The Harris campaign is spending millions to win there. Signs with a blue dot have been appearing on yards across Omaha in recent weeks. Here’s a look at what the 2024 presidential campaigns are up to on Saturday: Harris: Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to make remarks this afternoon at a fundraiser in Washington, DC, that will not be open the media. Harris is then expected to attend the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix Award Gala dinner in DC on Saturday evening, where she and President Joe Biden will deliver remarks. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is also expected to attend. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will speak this afternoon at a campaign rally in Superior, Wisconsin.   Trump: Former President Donald Trump remains in Nevada for an event today in Las Vegas. His running mate Sen. JD Vance is expected to attend the Appalachian State vs. East Carolina college football game in Greenville, North Carolina, which kicks off at 4 p.m. ET. Former President Donald Trump said at a rally Friday that if he’s reelected, he will deploy federal law enforcement officials to “liberate parts of our country,” as he continued to claim without evidence that Venezuelan gangs were taking over parts of Colorado. Trump’s comments were part of a series of remarks this week ramping up his rhetoric and stoking fears about both undocumented immigrants and migrants who have entered the country legally. Trump said he would launch a special task force to address organized crime and foreign gangs, which he said are “conquering” the country. Some context: Trump was referencing rumors that Venezuelan gangs are “taking over” buildings in Aurora, Colorado, which have been amplified by Republicans as another flashpoint in the debate over immigration. Police in the Colorado community say Venezuelan gangs are present there, but their influence is “isolated” and has been “overstated.” Here’s a closer look at what’s going on in Aurora. More from Trump: The former president also claimed without evidence that armed undocumented immigrants are “taking over our country from within.” Trump also used the rally to further amplify debunked social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets. Former President Donald Trump on Friday promoted a baseless claim circulating on right-wing social media that Kamala Harris wore an earpiece at Tuesday’s ABC presidential debate and again baselessly suggested that the vice president received the debate questions in advance.  The conspiracy theory about the earpiece has been promoted by far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has traveled with Trump in recent days. “Interesting choice of earrings tonight, @KamalaHarris…” Loomer posted Wednesday on social media, including a screenshot of an article about “audio earrings.” As CNN previously reported, several people close to Trump say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories the former president has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the ABC debate was “rigged,” and he has previously baselessly suggested that Harris was provided the questions in advance. The former president said this week that he won’t participate in another debate, while Harris has called for another face-off. Trump suggested Friday, though, that he may change his mind about another debate. President Joe Biden criticized former President Donald Trump’s recent disparagement of Haitian migrants during a Black Excellence brunch hosted at the White House on Friday.  Biden condemned the false claim promoted by Trump at this week’s presidential debate that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating other people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. Other high-level Republicans, including vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, have propagated the lie. Trump’s debunked claims: Trump has pledged “large deportations” from Springfield, which has become a political flashpoint as Republicans spread the false claims about migrants in the Ohio community. Springfield has had an influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian immigrants, who are in the US legally under the Immigration Parole Program. The unsubstantiated claims about animals being harmed in the community appear to be the result of an unwieldy game of telephone that began as a rumor in a local Facebook group before spiraling to reach the highest echelons of conservative media and the Republican Party. City officials have said there are no credible or specific claims of pets being harmed by immigrants in the community. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday continued to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump as she seized on post-debate momentum in Pennsylvania.  Harris again slammed his debate performance, calling it a “tired playbook,” while claiming he failed to address the needs of Americans. “Well, folks, it’s time to turn the page. Let’s turn the page… And we are not going back, because America is ready for a new way forward,” she said. The vice president stressed the importance of small businesses and she repeatedly hit her opponent on his economic agenda, including attacking Trump for suggesting he only has “concepts of a plan” to end the Affordable Care Act, but not laying out how he would replace it. While touting her economic own plan, Harris also focused part of her message on job opportunities that don’t require 4-year degrees. Harris’ visited Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre on Friday, both in counties that Trump won in 2016 and 2020."
How a false rumor about pets in Ohio and Laura Loomer’s presence helped derail Trump’s planned attacks on Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:17 PM EDT, Sat September 14, 2024",2024-09-14T09:00:19.572Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/14/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-laura-loomer/index.html,"Donald Trump wanted to spend this week attacking one of Democratic rival Kamala Harris’ biggest political vulnerabilities. Instead, he spent most of the week falsely claiming that migrants are eating pets in a small town in Ohio and defending his embrace of a far-right agitator whose presence is causing concern among his allies. Trump’s repeated parroting of unfounded social media rumors about Haitian migrants in Ohio eating pets stole headlines during a trip West, including stops in Arizona and Nevada, late this week. The promotion of the claims overshadowed a series of speeches aimed at the economy and blaming Harris for border security failures. Trump, in a news conference in California on Friday, promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio — the town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. The city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County, and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Trump also pointed to a Venezuelan gang in Aurora, Colorado. Continuing to use dehumanizing language to describe undocumented immigrants, Trump said “nests of bad people” are being emptied into the United States. “It’s like an invasion from within, and we’re going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country. And we’re going to start with Springfield and Aurora.” “The people of Ohio are scared,” he said. “It’s going to get worse. It’s going to get so bad. You know what we’re experiencing now is they’re just getting settled in.” Trump reiterated the same themes later Friday at a rally in Las Vegas. “We are under invasion just like it was an army, except in many ways it’s more difficult because they don’t wear a uniform, you don’t know who the hell to go after,” he said. Again bringing up both Springfield and Aurora, Trump continued, “I am your border president. From now on I want to be your border president.” Republicans broadly believe that immigration and border security are a top political issue for the party — and one they can use to hammer Harris, who they have labeled President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” That label stems from Biden asking the vice president in 2021 to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. However, during Tuesday’s debate, Trump’s attacks on Harris over immigration veered into the outrageous, as he falsely claimed that migrants are eating dogs and cats in Springfield. Trump’s remarks were met with a sharp condemnation from Biden. “It’s simply wrong. And there’s no place in America. This has to stop — what he’s doing — has to stop,” Biden said during a Black Excellence Brunch hosted at the White House on Friday. The city hall in Springfield was forced to close due to a bomb threat on Thursday. Two elementary schools were evacuated Friday “based on information received from the Springfield Police Division,” the Springfield City School District announced Friday. Two local hospitals — Kettering Health and Mercy Health Springfield Regional Medical Center — were also forced into lockdown due to bomb threats Saturday, according to statements sent to CNN. Springfield police said they received two calls Saturday about a Proud Boys presence in the city. A video circulating on social media shows a group of approximately 15 to 20 individuals, some of whom are carrying flags and wearing clothing with logos associated with the far-right Proud Boys, marching in the city. Police told CNN that when officers went to the area, the group was no longer there. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Thursday night urged national candidates — a clear reference to Trump and Vance — to “pay attention to what their words are doing to cities like ours.” “We need help, not hate,” Rue said. Trump dismissed those concerns on Friday, and again on Saturday when asked whether he denounced the threats in Springfield. “I don’t know what happened with the, uh, bomb threats,” Trump said during a visit to the Las Vegas Police Protective Association on Saturday. “I know that (Springfield has) been taken over by illegal migrants, and that’s a terrible thing that happened.” Even Pope Francis on Friday sharply criticized Trump over his position on immigration, while also lambasting Harris for her support for abortion rights. “To send migrants away, to leave them wherever you want, to leave them … it’s something terrible, there is evil there. To send away a child from the womb of the mother is an assassination, because there is life. We must speak about these things clearly,” the pope said. Vance, Trump’s running mate, argued that Trump’s comments ignited conversation about immigration — even as he acknowledged on X the flimsiness of the rumors that ignited the story. On Tuesday, Vance posted, “It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.” But the veracity of the claims did not seem to be his top concern. “Don’t let biased media shame you into not discussing this slow moving humanitarian crisis in a small Ohio town. We should talk about it every single day. Kamala Harris did this. And she’ll keep doing it unless we stop her,” he posted on X on Friday. The claim of pets being eaten in Ohio was not the only eyebrow raising moment from this week that has put the focus on the former president’s campaign. Trump has been spending time with far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack and shared racist comments on social media attacking Harris. Several people close to the former president say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories Trump has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket, a change that has left the GOP nominee increasingly unsettled by the political landscape he now faces. Trump on Friday described Loomer as a “free spirit” and “supporter.” “She’s a strong person. She’s got strong opinions, and I don’t know what she said, but that’s not up to me. She’s a supporter,” Trump said. Democratic National Committee rapid response director Alex Floyd on Friday highlighted Trump’s relationship with Loomer and other controversial allies. He said those surrounding Trump are “as professional as you’d expect for a convicted fraudster.” Trump and Harris were back on the campaign trail late this week after a Tuesday night debate that 63% of viewers said Harris won over Trump’s 37%, according to a CNN poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS.  The former president’s trip West came as Harris campaigned in Pennsylvania — the largest battleground of the 2024 election, with 19 Electoral College votes up for grabs. Combined, the commonwealth has already seen $175 million spent on television ads — more than $93 million by Democrats and more than $81 million by Republicans, according to AdImpact data. Another $136 million, including nearly $77 million by Democrats and $59 million by Republicans, has been booked between Saturday and Election Day. That’s more than has been spent, or reserved, in any other state. Harris needs strong turnout in Democratic strongholds such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but also to minimize Trump’s margins as much as possible in red parts of the state. Her visit Friday focused on two counties Trump won during both of his White House bids — Cambria and Luzerne. “Ultimately, I feel very strongly that we have to earn every vote and that means spending time with folks in the community where they live. That’s why I’m here. We’re going to be spending a lot more time in Pennsylvania,” Harris told reporters at a bookstore in Johnstown on Friday.

"Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones won’t be charged in Trump election subversion case, prosecutor says | CNN Politics","Published 5:29 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T21:29:24.704Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/burt-jones-georgia-2020-election/index.html,"The special prosecutor appointed to investigate Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones’ role as a fake elector after the 2020 election announced he will not move forward with criminal charges against the former state senator. Jones is one of 16 Republican fake Trump electors who signed on to the “unofficial electorate certificate” at Georgia’s state capital in December 2020 in a plan to subvert the Electoral College after that year’s presidential election. Jones had been a target of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in her investigation that led to a sprawling racketeering election subversion case against former President Donald Trump and several of his allies. “My review of the evidence finds this matter does not warrant further consideration,” Pete Skandalakis, executive director of a bipartisan group that oversees all prosecutors in Georgia, said in a written statement on Friday. “The evidence reveals Senator Jones acted in a manner consistent with his position representing the concerns of his constituents and in reliance upon the advice of attorneys when he served as an alternate elector,” Skandalakis wrote. “The evidence also indicates Senator Jones did not act with criminal intent, which is an essential element of committing any crime.” A Georgia judge blocked Willis from investigating Jones in July 2022. Jones was then a Republican state senator, and Willis was reprimanded by the judge for hosting a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate who was running against Jones to be Georgia’s next lieutenant governor. In his four-page written statement on Friday, Skandalakis said that Jones “fully cooperated” with the lengthy investigation over the course of four interviews. The prosecutor said he examined the evidence and Jones’ motives, noting Jones called for a special session in Georgia’s General Assembly after the 2020 election to investigate complaints made by constituents. Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, declined to hold a special session to overturn the results. In his statement, Skandalakis said Jones “understands he is subject to a witness subpoena and may be called to testify at any pending federal or state trial.” “I have always wanted to tell my story in front of a fair and unbiased prosecutor, “Lt. Gov Burt Jones told CNN in a written statement. “I look forward to being able to focus on the work I was elected to do.” Willis’ office told CNN that it can’t comment on the decision."
"Pope Francis criticizes Trump and Harris, says voters must choose between ‘lesser of two evils’ | CNN Politics","Updated 4:17 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T17:53:55.179Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/pope-francis-trump-harris-abortion/index.html,"Pope Francis on Friday described the choice US voters must make in the presidential election as one between the “lesser of two evils,” deeming former President Donald Trump’s anti-migrant policies and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights as both being “against life.” “One must choose the lesser of two evils. Who is the lesser of two evils? That lady or that gentleman? I don’t know,” Francis said during a press conference on the papal plane, referring to Harris and Trump. “Everyone with a conscience should think on this and do it.” Francis has been more vocal about politics than his predecessors and has moved to make the Catholic Church more open. While he has consistently and strongly defended the Catholic Church’s teaching that abortion is the deliberate destruction of a human life, Francis has also insisted it cannot be isolated from other issues concerning human life, including immigration. “To send migrants away, to leave them wherever you want, to leave them … it’s something terrible, there is evil there. To send away a child from the womb of the mother is an assassination, because there is life. We must speak about these things clearly,” he said. Francis has previously weighed in on political issues, signaling more progressive stances by allowing priests to forgive abortions, authorizing blessings for same-sex couples and repeatedly warning about climate change. He has challenged Catholic bishops in the US who have insisted that abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, arguing that the plight of migrants is also about the defense of life. In 2016, Francis described then-presidential candidate Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop migrants from crossing the US-Mexico border as “not Christian.” And when bishops were debating in 2021 whether to deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights, including President Joe Biden, Francis urged them to make their decisions from a “pastoral” viewpoint and not a political one. The pope has said he has never denied communion to anyone. Francis has criticized couples who choose to have pets rather than children, aligning with views expressed by Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, a converted Catholic who has derided women without kids as “childless cat ladies” and described those in the country’s “leadership class” who don’t have children as “more sociopathic.” US Catholics also have a range of views. According to Pew Research, 52% of Catholic registered voters describe themselves as being or leaning Republican, while 44% say they are or lean Democrat. Catholic voters were split in 2020, with 50% voting for Biden and 49% supporting Trump, according to Pew. But a majority of Catholics – 61% – believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

GOP-aligned group airs antisemitic ads in Michigan featuring Doug Emhoff and highlighting Harris’ Jewish ties | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:27 PM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T14:01:20.704Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/super-pac-michigan-kamala-harris-doug-emhoff/index.html,"A super PAC with Republican ties is running digital ads in Michigan promoting the Jewish faith of Kamala Harris’s husband and touting the vice president’s support for Israel in an apparent play to undercut Harris with the battleground state’s large Arab American population amid ongoing political fallout over the war in Gaza. Future Coalition PAC has spent nearly $60,000 running several YouTube ads targeting Michigan, according to Google’s Ads Transparency Center. Each of the ads emphatically states Harris’ support for Israel, and many pointedly highlight her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. The ads are replete with images of the Israeli flag, and multiple spots refer to Emhoff as Harris’ “top adviser,” playing into antisemitic tropes that American Jews have dual loyalties to the US and Israel. The ads appear aimed at stoking divisions within the Democratic coalition that have been exacerbated in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza. Anger among the Democratic Party’s pro-Palestinian factions over the Biden administration’s continued support for Israel’s military operation in Gaza has led to demonstrations around the country calling for an immediate ceasefire. And the issue is especially relevant in battleground Michigan, where Arab and Muslim Americans, many sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, make up a substantial voting bloc. In 2020, nearly 146,000 Muslim Americans voted in the general election in Michigan, according to an analysis by Emgage, a group working to grow Muslim Americans’ political power. Joe Biden won the state by 150,000 votes four years ago. Polls have shown a close contest this year between Harris and former President Donald Trump. One of the Future Coalition ads homes in on Emhoff, including depicting images of the second gentleman wearing a yarmulke and of him visiting the Auschwitz concentration camp. “Kamala Harris is a strong leader for these difficult times. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top adviser, Doug Emhoff. Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff: making history, standing up for what’s right, supporting Israel.” Another one of the ads opens, “Vice President Harris has chosen a side, the right side. Harris has made herself clear: She stands with Israel and the Jewish people. She has, again and again. She understands the unbreakable bond between the US and Israel.” The ad continues, “So when (Israeli leader Benjamin) Netanyahu came to DC, Harris hosted the prime minister at the White House. And when supporters of a free Palestine stood up for Gaza, Harris put them in their place. And supporters of free Palestine? They hate her. Because Kamala Harris gets it. We can trust she’ll always support Israel.” Other ads from the group contain similar themes. “This November, let’s make history. Together, we will put a real pro-Israel president in the White House. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top advisor, Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Only in America: Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff.” Formed earlier this month, Future Coalition PAC has not yet filed a report detailing its donors or fundraising with the Federal Election Commission. Other filings by the group, however, suggest its GOP links: The group lists as its assistant treasurer Cabell Hobbs, who served as the treasurer for a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential bid. CNN has reached out to the PAC for comment. This story and headline have been updated."

Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump on Friday promoted a baseless claim circulating on right-wing social media that Kamala Harris wore an earpiece at Tuesday’s ABC presidential debate and again baselessly suggested that the vice president received the debate questions in advance.  The conspiracy theory about the earpiece has been promoted by far-right agitator Laura Loomer, who has traveled with Trump in recent days. “Interesting choice of earrings tonight, @KamalaHarris…” Loomer posted Wednesday on social media, including a screenshot of an article about “audio earrings.” As CNN previously reported, several people close to Trump say Loomer has contributed to some of the unseemly conspiracy theories the former president has elevated since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the ABC debate was “rigged,” and he has previously baselessly suggested that Harris was provided the questions in advance. The former president said this week that he won’t participate in another debate, while Harris has called for another face-off. Trump suggested Friday, though, that he may change his mind about another debate. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said Friday that former President Donald Trump should debate Kamala Harris for a second time and consider changing his approach in order to reach swing voters. “Look, anytime you can spend more time in front of the voters when you’re in a close race, it’s a positive,” the Republican governor told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” Sununu, who has been critical of Trump in the past and is retiring at the end of his fourth two-year term next year, added that the former president “knows what he wants to say” but he should adapt his style to debating Harris. “So there’s an opportunity there, but they have to use the opportunity the right way and really re-establish a connection with those voters that they had in 2016,” he said. Take a look at the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country that has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began last October. Harris: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Joe Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.” The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris said that as president, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and “ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.”  Trump: The former president also met with Netanyahu in July, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Trump, who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history, once touted his close, personal relationship with Netanyahu. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict. In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.” Many Israelis presume that Trump would give Netanyahu a longer leash to use greater force in Gaza. Trump has said that Israel must “finish what they started,” “get it over with fast,” and that the US must “let Israel finish the job.” Read more about the candidates and where they stand on key issues. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday continued to draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump as she seized on post-debate momentum in Pennsylvania.  Harris again slammed his debate performance, calling it a “tired playbook,” while claiming he failed to address the needs of Americans. “Well, folks, it’s time to turn the page. Let’s turn the page… And we are not going back, because America is ready for a new way forward,” she said. The vice president stressed the importance of small businesses and she repeatedly hit her opponent on his economic agenda, including attacking Trump for suggesting he only has “concepts of a plan” to end the Affordable Care Act, but not laying out how he would replace it. While touting her economic own plan, Harris also focused part of her message on job opportunities that don’t require 4-year degrees. Harris’ visited Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre on Friday, both in counties that Trump won in 2016 and 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris told a local Pennsylvania station Friday she thinks she can win over voters who may align with former President Donald Trump’s values but are tired of divisiveness. Pressed on how she differs from President Joe Biden, who recently campaigned with Harris in Pennsylvania, Harris responded, “I’m obviously not Joe Biden, and you know, I offer a new generation of leadership,” saying she recognizes in her economic approach “some of the stuff we could take for granted years ago, we can’t take for granted anymore.”  She said people are “exhausted” by Trump’s approach and want a leader who has “common sense and tries to find common ground,” pointing to her recent endorsements by Republicans including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former congresswoman Liz Cheney. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to increase her travel to more rural counties that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 in the coming weeks, as the campaign tries to pick up voters and drive down support for her Republican rival, according to two sources familiar.   The vice president’s stops in Pennsylvania today are the latest reflection of the campaign’s hopes to make inroads with voters who may not be die-hard Democrats but are uninterested in former President Donald Trump.  On Friday, Harris returned to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Trump won by double digits in 2020.  That also includes building out infrastructure and field offices in those counties. The Harris campaign recently opened its 50th campaign office in Pennsylvania.  Late last month, Harris similarly did a swing through south Georgia, a region that typically leans Republican, in another attempt to curtail Trump’s advantage in rural areas. The strategy is also a play to reach Nikki Haley voters, sources say, including in areas like Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Gov. Tim Walz campaigned in Lancaster County last week.  CNN previously reported that many conversations at Harris campaign headquarters focus on the 5-6% of voters who are still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record during her campaign and outlined her policies. Trump’s attacks stem from President Joe Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. Here’s a look at what both candidates have proposed on the issue: Trump Harris Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s stances on key issues. The Nevada Green Party on Friday asked the US Supreme Court to weigh into an election dispute with potentially significant implications in the presidential battleground, asking the high court to pause a state court ruling that would keep candidate Jill Stein off the ballot. Green Party candidates were “ripped from the ballot,” according to the emergency appeal and “Nevadans who would vote for them in this election are robbed of the opportunity to do so.” The Green Party is being represented by Jay Sekulow, one of former President Donald Trump’s personal attorneys. The emergency appeal follows a decision from Nevada’s high court last week that found the Green Party used an incorrect form when collecting signatures to get their candidates’ names on the ballot. The original lawsuit against the Green Party was filed by the state Democratic Party. The wrangling underscores the significance of third-party candidates on the ballot in a state where polling indicates a thin margin between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Nevada’s State Democratic Party sued the state’s Green Party to keep Stein off the ballot, arguing that the Green Party had used the wrong form to collect and submit the signatures needed to get this candidate on the ballot. Read more details here about the dispute in Nevada Just hours after Donald Trump claimed Friday he wasn’t aware of Laura Loomer’s controversial past statements, the former president wrote on Truth Social that he disagreed with her.  Trump did not specify in the post which past statements by Loomer he disagrees with. Loomer, a far-right provocateur, has for years pushed baseless conspiracy theories, including a post last year that claimed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US were an “inside job.” She has a long track record of racist and Islamophobic social media posts that have at times resulted in her losing access to her social media accounts.  Just hours before joining Trump on a flight to the Philadelphia debate on Tuesday, Loomer posted a racist comment about Vice President Kamala Harris’ Indian heritage. She also previously pushed a baseless attack accusing Harris of hiding her Black identity, which Trump later echoed in remarks he made at an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to use her remarks in Pennsylvania tonight to speak directly to voters who might gravitate to former President Donald Trump, focusing her message on job opportunities that don’t require four-year degrees, according to a campaign adviser.  On Friday, Harris returned to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Trump won by double digits in 2020.  Earlier Friday, she told reporters she felt good about Pennsylvania, a crucial state for her campaign. With Friday’s visits to Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Harris will have spent all or part of seven of the past eight days in Pennsylvania.   Right-wing media outlets are ignoring Donald Trump’s embrace of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, shielding their audience from the uproar amid condemnation from top Republicans. In recent days, Donald Trump has mingled with Loomer, the radical conspiracy theorist who has a well-documented history of pushing racist, sexist, Islamophobic and homophobic hate. Loomer has been banned from most social media platforms for her vile rhetoric, though her account was restored in 2022 on X after Elon Musk, himself an avid Trump supporter, purchased the platform. Loomer’s presence with Trump at this week’s presidential debate and 9/11 memorial ceremonies has drawn widespread attention from mainstream news outlets, with major publications and television outlets spotlighting her appearance with the former president. The move has also ignited public condemnation and disgust even among those in his own party. But right-wing media outlets have largely ignored her close proximity to Trump and the ensuing controversy. On Fox News, the network has mentioned Loomer’s presence just once since she was first seen deboarding Trump’s private plane on Tuesday at the Philadelphia debate, according to TVEyes database searches. A check of the right-wing network’s website also showed zero mentions of Loomer this week. That was also the case in other right-wing outlets, including the websites of Breitbart, Newsmax, The Daily Wire, One America News, and The Gateway Pundit. Read more here about the right-wing media’s coverage The North Carolina State Board of Elections announced a revised schedule for sending out mail-in ballots after a legal battle with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy delayed the process.   Ballots will begin going out in two separate batches on September 20 and September 24, according to the NCSBE. The original deadline to get ballots out was September 6, as state law requires absentee ballots to begin shipping 60 days before the general election. All 100 county boards must send ballots to military and overseas voters who requested them on September 20, allowing the state to avoid missing the September 21 federal deadline to begin sending these ballots.  Absentee by mail ballots for all other North Carolina voters who have requested them will start going out on September 24, more than two weeks after state law requires.  North Carolina was supposed to kick off voting in the 2024 general election last Friday, but a ruling from the state Court of Appeals on a motion from Kennedy to have his name removed from the ballot put that on hold.  This week, the state Supreme Court ordered that new ballots must be reprinted without Kennedy and his We The People party on them.  Each county is responsible for covering the costs to recode, reprocess and reprint the ballots. The NCSBE said that, through Thursday, “more than 166,000 voters – including more than 13,600 military and overseas voters – have requested ballots in North Carolina.” Due to the federal deadline, preparing and sending military and overseas ballots was made a priority and the board determined the only way to do this was to have two different dates for sending them. Abortion and reproductive rights are a key issue in the 2024 campaign. Here’s a look at where each candidate stands on the topic. Kamala Harris’ stance: Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the Biden administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic. On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. The issue was a key part of the programming at the Democratic National Convention this summer and Harris’ campaign announced the launch of a 50-stop bus tour last month — starting in Trump’s backyard of Palm Beach, Florida — focused on reproductive health care. Donald Trump’s stance: Trump last month said he will not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida just 24 hours after suggesting he might. The rush to clarify his stance followed intense blowback from anti-abortion advocates online, leading to concerns among Republicans that Trump’s continued waffling on abortion might lose him some deeply religious voters in a tightening race. Trump, whose ever-evolving views on reproductive health have traversed every side of the debate, has long expressed concerns about the political fallout from the 2022 Supreme Court decision to end the constitutional right to an abortion. Though he has sought credit for installing the three conservative justices that tipped the court to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump earlier this year said future questions about access should be left to the states. Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that abortion laws should be decided by states. He’s also said that he supports exceptions in cases of rape and incest and when the life of the mother is under threat. Trump said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions. In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for. Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Former President Donald Trump suggested Friday that his mind might change about a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.  On Thursday, Trump shut down the idea of a second debate with Harris, announcing on Truth Social that “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!” Reporters asked Trump what he would need or want in order to participate in another debate. “I wouldn’t need anything. I could do it tomorrow, but I’ve done two debates,” Trump said, referring to his first debate with President Joe Biden in June.   Earlier in his remarks, Trump dismissed a reporter’s question about Republicans who’ve said that he missed the mark in the debate with Harris.  “Most of my Republican allies had said I was great in the debate,” Trump said. Senate GOP Whip John Thune on Friday said Republicans would consider campaign trail proposals made by former President Donald Trump when working to advance tax policy if they regain the Senate majority, and made clear that renewing Trump’s 2017 tax cuts were the top priority. Asked on a press call with Wisconsin Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde how the GOP could advance Trump’s most recent proposal to eliminate taxes on overtime pay, Thune said it would be helpful “obviously, if we can get a majority, and Eric is certainly key to that,” touting the entrepreneur’s experience with managing payroll and workers. Trump said in Arizona on Thursday that he would back legislation to get rid of taxes on overtime if he’s reelected. He previously has said he would also work to eliminate taxes on tips, another policy aimed at appealing to working Americans.  “There have been a lot of proposals that have been made throughout the course of the campaign,” Thune acknowledged, adding that extending the 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025 is an issue the Senate will have to deal with immediately. Vice President Kamala Harris said she’s feeling “very good” about the state of the race in battleground Pennsylvania during a campaign stop here on Friday. Harris vowed to spend significant time in the state ahead of the election, focusing on mobilizing voters. Harris stopped by the store, called Classic Elements, alongside the state’s Democratic Sen. John Fetterman. She spoke to the owners of the shop before addressing a small crowd. The vice president said small businesses are a way to “lift people up,” and credited the owners for creating a safe community gathering place at a time when there are forces “trying to kind of make people feel alone or divide us.” More on the Pennsylvania swing: Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre — where Harris will hold a rally later today — are in two counties that former President Donald Trump won in 2016 and 2020. Harris has spent seven of the last eight days in the Keystone State, punctuating her campaign’s emphasis on the battleground. Former President Donald Trump promised “large deportations” from Springfield, Ohio, a town that has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including his running mate Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets.  According to the city of Springfield’s website, the total immigrant population is estimated at about 12,000 to 15,000 in Clark County, though it does not designate from which countries. The frequently asked questions section on its website notes that Haitian immigrants are there legally under the Immigration Parole Program. Trump claimed “nests of bad people” are being emptied into the United States, calling it “an invasion from within.”  Throughout his campaign, Trump has vowed to have the biggest mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.  “It’s going to get worse at a level like nobody’s ever seen before,” Trump said, speaking more generally about immigration and the border. Former President Donald Trump on Friday escalated his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2021 Kabul airport attack during the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Trump said during a news conference in Los Angeles that the 13 US military service members were killed “as though Kamala shot them with a pistol in her hand, or his hand; they were killed by (President Joe) Biden and Kamala.” Trump made the comments as he spoke about his recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery, in which he participated in a wreath-laying ceremony with family members of those who were killed during the Kabul attack and visited a location where some of the US service members are buried. The former president was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity, and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.” For context: Trump frequently criticizes Harris and Biden for the Afghanistan withdrawal on the campaign trail. It was a central line of attack on Biden when he was running for reelection, and now that Harris is the Democratic nominee, Trump has shifted to seeking to place blame directly on her for the chaotic withdrawal and the attack. Former President Donald Trump said he doesn’t control far-right agitator Laura Loomer, whom he described as a supporter and a “free spirit.” Trump was responding to a question from CNN about his allies expressing concern about his close relationship with the provocateur in recent days. Loomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump and appears often at events where he is speaking, and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack. Pressed about his allies’ concern, Trump said, “Look, I can’t tell Laura what to do.”   In response to questions about her racist and conspiratorial comments, Trump said he’d just heard about it for the first time. Two days before the debate, Loomer said that if Vice President Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins the election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Trump ally and conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene condemned the remark, calling it “appalling and extremely racist.” Former President Donald Trump on Friday said the “real threat is what’s happening at our border” when asked about bomb threats in Springfield, Ohio, and schools being evacuated as Trump and his Republican allies spread a debunked conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants in the area eating pets.  A reporter at a news conference in Los Angeles started asking Trump about the false claims, and the former president said, “No, no. The real threat is what’s happening at our border.” Trump said earlier in the news conference that “maybe” he would hold a campaign event in Springfield.  “We could, and maybe we’ll do that,” Trump said. Trump repeated the debunked conspiracy theory during the presidential debate earlier this week and at his campaign event in Arizona on Thursday. Pope Francis on Friday described the choice US voters must make in the presidential election as one between the “lesser of two evils,” deeming former President Donald Trump’s anti-migrant policies and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights as both being “against life.” The pontiff was asked what his advice to Catholic voters would be when choosing between the candidates.  The head of the Roman Catholic church said that deporting migrants is “evil” and that not giving migrants work and not helping them is “a sin against life.” Meanwhile, Francis described abortion as an “assassination.”  “Whether you like the word or not, it is killing,” he added. President Joe Biden celebrated the contributions of Black Americans and offered criticism of former President Donald Trump’s disparagement of Haitian migrants during a Black Excellence brunch hosted at the White House Friday.  Biden condemned the false claim promoted by Trump at this week’s presidential debate that Haitian migrants are stealing and eating other people’s pets. Other high-level Republicans, including vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, have propagated the lie.  Biden touted his efforts to place racial equity “at the center of everything we do,” and made a joke about Black jobs, a jab at Trump.  “We created over 2 million new Black jobs for Black Americans,” he said to laughter, adding, “By the way, the next Black job to be filled is as president of the United States.” Vice President Kamala Harris, who was originally set to attend the brunch, was not present, with her office citing “scheduling conflicts.” Biden said she “wanted to be here.” Biden offered praise of the leadership of Black Americans at the conclusion of Congressional Black Caucus Week, highlighting the community’s support for his political career as it reaches its close: “The Black community has always had my back and I’ve always had yours.” The crowd chanted, “Thank you, Joe” in response.   “This nation would not exist – this is literal – without the blood, sweat, and tears, without the determinations, dreams, and contributions of Black Americans,” Biden said in front of the White House, a building built by enslaved people.  Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump, and their respective allies are unleashing a flood of new campaign ads heading into the weekend as the candidates fan out to battleground states and they press their message on the airwaves. Harris ads: On Friday, Harris’ campaign went up with a series of TV ads focused on the economy and tailored to the critical battlegrounds, containing the same narration and messaging, but with images of different cities and local landmarks. The ad features Harris making her economic pitch. Her appearance in it reflects a concerted effort by the campaign to put the candidate in front of the camera, often narrating. The ads began airing in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia — and one is even tailored to Nebraska, where Democrats are hoping to secure one of the states’ up-for-grabs electoral votes. The ads come as Harris is set to hold several campaign events in Pennsylvania today. The Harris campaign is also up with its first ad featuring clips from Tuesday’s debate, highlighting the moment that Trump was pressed on his abortion policy. Trump ads: Countering those efforts, the Trump campaign and its allies have also launched a series of new ads heading into the weekend, leaning into an anti-Harris messaging campaign that has been increasingly focused on the economy. On Friday, the Trump campaign launched its latest ad slamming Harris and the Biden administration for inflation. It follows a new ad in Pennsylvania that the Trump campaign launched on Thursday about fracking. The pair of new ads from the Trump campaign, both focused on key economic issues, reflect an evolving messaging approach. While Trump and his allies have consistently criticized all aspects of the Biden-Harris administration record, the emphasis lately has been on the economy as opposed to immigration and crime.  At Kamala Harris’ campaign headquarters, aides are already working toward more appearances like the vice president’s online conversation next week with Oprah Winfrey, instead of any big speeches or more policy rollouts like her economic plans, unless the campaign sees ways to leverage those into grabbing more attention. Yet Harris advisers are running into limits of the calendar: Unless they succeed in goading Trump into accepting a second debate, the only big event left before Election Day is the Tim Walz-JD Vance vice presidential debate on October 1. David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager, is leading the push among Harris advisers for breakthrough moments and innovative appearances. Harris and many around her tend to be dismissive of the value of traditional media, and believe they get more of a boost from putting her in situations like hugging voters during a brief Sunday stop at a spice store in Pittsburgh than she ever would from any interview. Plouffe’s role is in part affected by the simmering tension between different factions —carryover Biden aides, new staff who came with Harris, a clutch of Obama alumni who parachuted in together, and the core group of advisers who tend to spend the most time with the candidate on the road and at the Naval Observatory — although the infighting looks nothing like the dysfunction of Harris’ 2019 bid. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon’s leadership retreat last week, for example, was part therapy for aides coming off their rollercoaster summer. But it was also part information sharing — amid the massive divergence in political conditions, ballot propositions and candidates that Harris aides believe could upend the trend of recent elections where states move in regional blocs. Translating the summer enthusiasm into fall work without the enthusiasm draining won’t be easy, said Dan Kildee, a retiring Democratic congressman from the critical battleground of Michigan. He said he’s heartened that 35,000 new volunteers signed up in his state since Harris became the nominee, but he said that won’t matter unless they’re managed and deployed correctly. Obama is expected to be central in that effort, with aides working to add to his usual slate of late fall battleground campaign rallies — in person or with online influencers, whom he’s been pushing to use their platforms to get followers to vote.

In CNN polling released earlier this month of six swing states, economic issues remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters in their choice for president. Below is a snapshot of what the candidates have proposed so far: Highlights of Kamala Harris’ economic promises Highlights of Donald Trump’s economic promises Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s campaign promises on key issues. Americans are feeling a greater sense of optimism about the US economy this month, thanks to slower inflation. And voters also see a greater likelihood that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming November election, according to the latest consumer survey from the University of Michigan. The survey, released Friday, showed that Americans’ attitudes toward the economy rose 2% from August. Sentiment is now 40% higher than the record low reached in June 2022, when inflation was running red hot, but it still remains below pre-pandemic levels. The survey also noted that “a growing share of both Republicans and Democrats now anticipate a Harris win,” a few days after Tuesday’s presidential debate. US consumers also felt more upbeat about inflation’s future: Expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead reached the lowest reading since December 2020. Rose Goute Creole restaurant does a bustling business in Springfield, Ohio, with clientele drawn to its pots of perfumed rice, fried pork and fish, and golden plantains. Rosena Jean Louis runs the front, offering free coffee and patiently managing a jostling lunch crowd. She and her coworkers are proud of the food they serve, feeding a Haitian expatriate community that has grown quickly in Springfield over the past few years. When asked about a lie that has taken hold in some corners of the internet that their countrymen are stealing and eating people’s pets, she rolls her eyes in exasperation. When CNN visited on Wednesday, the restaurant’s manager, Romane Pierre, recalled his incredulity at the claim that has been promoted by prominent national-level Republicans, including Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials have repeatedly tried to stop the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that there are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” The state’s highest Republican official, Gov. Mike DeWine, also dismissed the rumor, noting there was “no evidence of that at all.” And Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said Thursday the false claims are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community,” adding it’s “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Vance, a Republican from Ohio. Read the full story. The great showman just turned his back on tens of millions of viewers. Donald Trump’s refusal to take part in another presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris marks a significant moment in the 2024 campaign — and hints at vulnerability for a political career built on the foundation of his television fame and mastery of stagecraft. The ex-president said he doesn’t need a rematch because he won the debate, despite overwhelming reviews saying he bombed against a vice president who outdid a former reality star. But there’s an alternative possible explanation: that Trump — who usually can’t resist a chance to dominate the small screen — doesn’t relish a repeat of a showdown in which he was unprepared and unfocused and squandered his best chance to take down his opponent in a cliffhanger election. He might be right to mitigate the risk: polls show he’s in a dead heat with Harris in a race where the fundamentals on top voter priorities like the economy and immigration may favor him. Harris said she and her opponent owed it to voters to debate again. Trump’s move opened the way for her team to boast that he is scared to debate her and to boost a performance in which she mocked and rebuked an ill-tempered ex-president with a swagger and a smile. The Republican nominee often changes his mind. But his announcement that there wouldn’t be another debate seemed more adamant than many of his previous statements. Read the full analysis. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris could have a significant impact on key battleground states, new numbers from the nonprofit, nonpartisan voting organization Vote.org shared with CNN suggests.  Since Swift’s post encouraging her supporters to get registered, 52,222 Americans have registered to vote via Vote.org, and 144,243 people have verified their registration status.  That has included thousands of registrations in swing states where both the Harris and Trump campaigns are expecting razor-thin margins.  From 11:00 pm ET on Tuesday to 1:00 pm ET Thursday:  The Democratic Party is also seeking to harness Swift’s political potency, launching Swift-inspired digital billboards featuring images of Harris. One of the billboards is 22-stories atop the iconic red steps in New York’s Times Square. The other is in Las Vegas. This comes as the Harris campaign sold out of Swift-inspired friendship bracelets, and former President Donald Trump’s campaign has also sought to get in on the action, selling Eras Tour-inspired t-shirts with Trump’s likeness. A super PAC with Republican ties is running digital ads in Michigan promoting the Jewish faith of Kamala Harris’ husband and touting Harris’ support for Israel — an apparently cynical play to undercut Harris with the battleground state’s large Arab American population amid ongoing political fallout over the war in Gaza. The super PAC, Future Coalition PAC, has spent nearly $60,000 running several YouTube ads targeting exclusively Michigan, according to Google’s Ads Transparency Center. Each of the ads emphatically states Harris’ support for Israel, and many pointedly highlight her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. The New York Times first reported on the ads. One of the ads from the group hones in on the role of Harris’ husband Emhoff, including images of Emhoff wearing a yamaka, and of the second gentleman visiting the Auschwitz concentration camp. “Kamala Harris is a strong leader for these difficult times. And joining Kamala will be her husband and top adviser, Doug Emhoff. Doug Emhoff, who would be the first Jewish presidential spouse ever. Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff: making history, standing up for what’s right, supporting Israel.” Another one of the ads opens, “Vice President Harris has chosen a side, the right side. Harris has made herself clear: she stands with Israel and the Jewish people. She has, again and again. She understands the unbreakable bond between the US and Israel.” The ads — which are framed positively and accompanied by stirring music — would appear to be in support of Harris’ presidential bid – but the group behind them and their precise targeting in battleground Michigan suggest a more cynical motive. Formed earlier this month, Future Coalition PAC has not yet filed a report detailing its donors or fundraising with the Federal Election Commission. Other filings from the group, however, include GOP links; the group lists as its assistant treasurer Cabell Hobbs, who served as the treasurer for a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential bid. In addition, the ads are exclusively running in Michigan, one of seven top battleground states that are poised to decide the 2024 election, and which is home to a large Arab American population. The ads appear aimed at stoking divisions spilling from the ongoing war in Gaza, and undercutting Harris’ efforts to patch up the fraying Democratic coalition that includes those voters there. If anyone was in doubt about Kamala Harris’s electoral strategy, a glimpse of her calendar gives you a clue. With Friday’s visits to Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Harris will have spent all or part of 7 of the past 8 days in Pennsylvania. Yesterday, when she traveled to North Carolina, was the only day in the past week she hasn’t set foot in the Keystone State. After traveling to Pittsburgh for a five-day debate camp, she went to Philadelphia for the debate itself and returned a day later to Shanksville for a 9/11 commemoration. She’ll return Friday to two counties — Cambria and Luzerne — that Donald Trump won in 2020, hoping to convert voters as she enters a grind-it-out phase of her campaign. It’s all an indication that even as Harris looks to open up multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes, Pennsylvania remains a linchpin of her strategy.  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said that the false claims being promoted by Donald Trump’s campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets are “hurting our citizens and hurting our community.” Asked what he would say to the former president, Rue said: “we need help, not hate.”  Rue also stated that it is “frustrating” that some of the rhetoric is coming from Trump’s running mate JD Vance, who is a Republican senator in the state. City Hall in Springfield was forced to close on Thursday due to a bomb threat issued to multiple facilities. Rue told CNN that there are currently no leads into who was behind the threat that was sent via email.  Rue also revealed that city officials, including himself, have received hateful phone calls and emails.  At a leadership retreat for top aides last week, Jen O’Malley Dillon – the campaign chair hired by Joe Biden and retained by Kamala Harris – ticked through the battleground states and warned them: the vice president still did not have any one sure path to 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania looks rough, though very possible, by their internal numbers before the debate. North Carolina, disappointing Democrats every election for the last 15 years, is feeling better to them this time than Arizona, which Biden narrowly won four years ago. Nevada and Georgia seem possible, though depending on the poll, can take a lot of squinting. Michigan and Wisconsin are looking like the best of the bunch for Harris, according to the campaign’s internal numbers. That makes for a lot of potential paths to victory based on the current and projected internal data, O’Malley Dillon told them, but multiple top aides on the Harris campaign told CNN they fear that if the election were held next Tuesday instead of eight Tuesdays from now, Trump still would be in a good position to win. Leading Democrats are stressing out that Harris could be in danger of losing the excitement and good vibes they need to overpower what they expect to be high and devoted turnout for Trump. But that is not the feeling in Harris’ campaign headquarters, where many conversations focus on the 5-6% of voters still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump, and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Read the full story. Most likely voters in six key battleground states express at least some confidence in their state’s election process, according to recent CNN polling conducted by SSRS. But far fewer of them have high confidence in the process, with that mistrust driven largely by voters who support former President Donald Trump. Overall, two-thirds or more of likely voters in each of the six states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be cast and counted accurately, ranging from 68% in Arizona to 79% in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is the only state where a majority – 52% – say they’re very confident about the accuracy of their state’s voting process, with 46% in Michigan and only about 4 in 10 in the remaining states expressing similarly high confidence. But the results in each state also show a wide and continuing political gulf on faith in the electoral system, echoing Trump’s repeated efforts to undermine confidence in it. At Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump again refused to acknowledge his election loss in 2020 – a stance that follows social media posts made last week in which he threatened to prosecute election officials if he retakes the presidency and raised baseless attacks on the validity of mail-in voting in Pennsylvania. While 71% of Harris supporters in the six states are, on average, very confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted, an average of just 15% of Trump supporters across these states feel the same way. And sizable shares of Trump voters lack even modest confidence in the system. Read more about this polling. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to travel to Pennsylvania as she seeks to capitalize on post-debate momentum in key battleground states, according to her campaign. Harris will visit Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre — located in two counties that former President Donald Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. The campaign believes the vice president must take her message directly to swing voters in counties where she seeks to grow her support. In Johnstown, Harris is expected to visit a local small business alongside Sen. John Fetterman as she highlights her “opportunity economy” agenda, which includes a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new businesses.  She will then travel to Wilkes-Barre and deliver remarks at a campaign rally. The vice president will be introduced by Mary-Grace Vadalla, a local Republican nurse who lost her mom to COVID-19 and is married to a public school teacher. Additional speakers include Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Bob Casey. Harris’ team has developed a plan for the coming days and weeks to place her in front of battleground state voters, which began Thursday with two stops in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. In both the Keystone and Tar Heel states, early voting is already about to get underway, and a campaign official tells CNN it’s no coincidence that this is where Harris is hitting the trail this week. The campaign will deploy some of its top surrogates today. Gov. Walz will make tour stops in Grand Rapids, Lansing, Michigan and Wausau, Wisconsin. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will stop in The Villages, Florida, and Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz will be in Bangor and Portland, Maine. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today as they make their pitch to voters with less than two months until Election Day. Harris will be making campaign stops in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Trump is will holding a press availability in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and holding a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, tonight; Harris’ running mate Tim Walz will participate in political events in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and in Wausau, Wisconsin. Donald Trump said he would not participate in another presidential debate with Kamala Harris. At a rally in Charlotte, Harris said: “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” Here are other headlines you should know: After the debate: The Taylor Swift effect: New ads launched: Trump campaign proposals: Trump legal woes: Former Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton praised Vice President Kamala Harris in the epilogue for her upcoming book, “Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty,” calling Harris’ historic run “exciting” and “exhilarating.” Clinton said Democrats “will miss Joe Biden’s steady leadership, deep empathy and fighting spirit. He is a wise and decent man who served our country well, yet we have gained much too—a new champion, an invigorated campaign and a renewed sense of purpose.”  In the audio recording of the epilogue, Clinton details her first reactions after she got off the phone with Harris, saying she looked at former President Bill Clinton “with a huge smile and said, this is exciting.” Clinton, who ran against Trump but lost in 2016, said she imagined Harris taking the oath of office as the first woman president, saying “it will prove that our best days are still ahead and that we are making progress on our long journey toward a more perfect union.”  MSNBC first reported on the audio of Clinton’s reaction to Harris becoming the nominee. As Donald Trump posed for pictures with firefighters in New York City to observe the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attack, a small entourage of the former president’s inner circle looked on. The group included the two most powerful individuals in Trump’s orbit, his co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Standing near them was another figure whose sway with the Republican nominee also cannot be discounted: the far-right provocateur Laura Loomer. Last year, Loomer posted a video on social media claiming that the attack on the World Trade Center towers was an “inside job,” an illogical but pervasive conspiracy theory. Asked why Loomer joined Trump for his Patriot Day travels in New York and then Pennsylvania, a campaign official declined to address her presence directly. Loomer, in a phone interview with CNN, said: The former president has long embraced conspiracy theories and has regularly aligned himself with those who peddle them, especially if they support him.  Read the full story. Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants.” Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. Election Day is less than two months away, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule of campaign events today following their presidential debate. Trump said he would not participate in a third debate, while the vice president’s campaign called for another one following Tuesday night’s event on ABC. Here’s more on the campaign:"
How Harris aims to keep drawing eyeballs as the hard campaigning begins | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2024",2024-09-13T09:00:19.681Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-momentum/index.html,"At a leadership retreat for top aides in Wilmington last week, Jen O’Malley Dillon – the campaign chair hired by Joe Biden and retained by Kamala Harris – ticked through the battleground states and warned them: the vice president still did not have any one sure path to 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania looks rough, though very possible, by their internal numbers before the debate. North Carolina, disappointing Democrats every election for the last 15 years, is feeling better to them this time around than Arizona, which Biden narrowly won four years ago. Nevada and Georgia both seem possible, though depending on the poll, can take a lot of squinting. Michigan and Wisconsin are looking like the best of the bunch for Harris, according to the campaign’s internal numbers. As pumped as Harris aides are about her debate performance earlier this week, they don’t think it changed any of that. That makes for a lot of potential paths to victory based on the current and projected internal data, O’Malley Dillon told them last week, but multiple top aides on the Harris campaign told CNN they fear that if the election were held next Tuesday instead of eight Tuesdays from now, Trump still would be in a good position to win. After two and a half slower weeks since she closed out her convention in Chicago, a number of leading Democrats are stressing out that Harris could be in danger of losing the excitement and good vibes they need to overpower what they expect to be high and devoted turnout for Trump. But that is not the feeling in Harris campaign headquarters, where many conversations focus on the 5-6% of voters still showing up undecided in battleground states, the set opinions those voters have of Trump and the continuing interest they tend to say they have in learning more about Harris. Top aides tend to talk these days about “eyeballs” and “moments,” and however many different plays they can come up with. They will keep having Harris at big rallies, but slip smaller events in between, building out the affinity groups and leaning into targeted appeals like playing up the endorsement from former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney. Harris’ appearance with the National Association of Black Journalists next week, for example, scheduled for Philadelphia on National Voter Registration Day, was a very orchestrated choice. “There’s a quiet confidence and security in what we’re doing and the mission, but no one thinks we have this in the bag,” said a Harris campaign aide. “It’s going to be a grind until Election Day, and after.” Harris advisers are spending their days cutting campaign ads from the debate and poring through data that they believe may show she got an important sliver of a bump. An internal summary of the campaign’s “dial groups” measuring immediate reactions, which was described to CNN, says that Harris’ best rated moment was when she spoke about abortion and Trump’s worst rated moment was when he cited a fake story about immigrants eating pets. But a dozen leading Democratic operatives and officials told CNN they worry what will happen if the campaign reverts, as it has done this week after the debate, to the standard rhythm of bus tours and stump speeches and teases of an unconventional interview or two. Some Democratic officials have been wishfully scrolling through Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour schedule – which features three shows each in Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis in the lead up to the election — and have begun reach out to try to get Swift to translate her endorsement into campaign concerts. The dream scenario in the minds of several of the people talking about this: either joint or parallel Swift appearances with Beyoncé. Harris has “become a cultural political icon — politics is too small to hold it. You’ve got to do something that transcends it,” said one top Democratic official trying to make the shows happen. “An unconventional campaign means you have to do unconventional things.” At campaign headquarters, aides are already working toward more appearances like Harris’ online conversation next week with Oprah Winfrey instead of any big speeches or more policy rollouts like her economic plans, unless the campaign sees ways to leverage those into grabbing more attention. Yet Harris advisers are running into limits of the calendar: unless they succeed in goading Trump into accepting a second debate, the only big event left before Election Day is the Tim Walz-JD Vance vice presidential debate on October 1. David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager, is leading the push among Harris advisers for breakthrough moments and innovative appearances. Harris and many around her tend to be dismissive of the value of traditional media, and believe they get more of a boost from putting her in situations like hugging voters during a brief Sunday stop at a spice store in Pittsburgh than she ever would from any interview. Plouffe’s role is in part affected by the simmering tension between different factions —carryover Biden aides, new staff who came with Harris, a clutch of Obama alumni who parachuted in together and the core group of advisers who tend to spend the most time with the candidate on the road and at the Naval Observatory — although the infighting looks nothing like the dysfunction of Harris’ 2019 bid. O’Malley Dillon’s leadership retreat last week, for example, was part therapy for aides coming off their rollercoaster summer. But it was also part information sharing — amid the massive divergence in political conditions, ballot propositions and candidates that Harris aides believe could upend the trend of recent elections where states move in regional blocs. This year, what Plouffe is running up against is Democratic trauma from the last two presidential elections that they’ll miss basics or take advantages for granted. Plouffe himself famously predicted in June 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win over 350 electoral votes, and that was before she was widely seen to have won all three of her debates. And four years ago, Biden’s polling lead this far out from November was clearer than any that Harris has. Translating the summer enthusiasm into fall work without the enthusiasm draining won’t be easy, said Dan Kildee, a retiring Democratic congressman from the critical battleground of Michigan. He said he’s heartened that 35,000 new volunteers signed up in his state since Harris became the nominee, but he said that won’t matter unless they’re managed and deployed correctly. “The heft of the campaign is greater, but the work is phone calls, it’s door knocks. It’s the kind of boring stuff done with enough volume and enough repetition that we increase it,” Kildee said. “Then there’s the special sauce: can we get some of that magic?” Obama is expected to be central in that effort, with aides working to add to his usual slate of late fall battleground campaign rallies – in person or with online influencers, whom he’s been pushing to use their platforms to get followers to vote. The first taste of that will come next Tuesday, for National Voter Registration Day: Obama already recorded videos and other content in Chicago and at home in Washington that his office estimates will be hitting 30 million users across social media, aimed at younger voters. “Our boss always wants to push the envelope, and the teams are aligned there. We’ll definitely be having some fun,” an Obama aide told CNN. The former president will kick off his work at a fundraiser he’s hosting for Harris next week in Los Angeles. Former first lady Michelle Obama, who delivered a rallying cry speech in Chicago, is not expected to campaign, instead sticking with her officially non-partisan voter registration efforts. When it comes to volunteers and on-the-ground organizers, Democrats believe they will have an edge over Trump. They think that’s particularly true after his handpicked new chairs shut down many of the in-state offices the Republican National Committee had opened, outsourcing much of his outreach and turnout operations to outside groups. But much like when many were working on Biden’s campaign — although to a lesser degree — Harris aides and other Democratic operatives say they know they’re still running up against voters who aren’t and won’t ever really tune in or pay attention to any of the traditional ways of getting in touch. “The big thing we know about those voters is that they weren’t responding before and they’re voters that don’t respond to traditional media,” said Ben Wikler, the Democratic chairman in Wisconsin, where a range of in-person and texting voter-to-voter community outreach has been underway since the spring. “But also we need everyone who does pay attention to traditional media—so we have to do both.” Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who moved from being a Biden campaign co-chair to a Harris campaign co-chair, told CNN on Thursday that he’s realistic about the difference between the first 50 days of Harris’ campaign, when she was energizing Democrats whom Biden had sent panicking, and the 53 days left, when she has to try to close the deal. “She’s still trending in the right direction. And every day she’s won. And every day we’ve actually gone up a little bit,” Landrieu said. “At some point in time, you have to stop expecting it to keep going up because there’s not that many fish left in the sea.”"
"In purple North Carolina, Democrats hope to defeat a MAGA candidate for governor even as the presidential race remains close | CNN Politics","Updated 1:16 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T11:00:20.036Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/north-carolina-governor-election-robinson-stein/index.html,"Four years ago, North Carolina voters handed Democrats one of the party’s toughest losses and one of its most consequential wins. Despite years of Democrats hoping that changing demographics in the fast-growing state would tip the presidential race, Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden here by 1 point, his narrowest winning margin in the country. But further down the ballot, voters reelected Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who has spent much of the next four years serving as a check on the Republican-controlled legislature and advancing priorities such as Medicaid expansion. With 54 days until the November election, voters in the Tar Heel State seem equally split this year. At the presidential level, Trump and Kamala Harris have increased their campaigning in the state, where both have made multiple visits and ramped up ad spending. On Thursday, Harris will return, rallying supporters in Charlotte and Greensboro. The race to succeed the term-limited Cooper, however, seems to be leaning toward the Democratic nominee, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. Stein and his Democratic allies have covered the airways with millions of dollars worth of devastating TV ads highlighting Republican opponent Mark Robinson’s past remarks on abortion and a troubled day care center he and his wife ran in the early 2000s – spending the GOP hasn’t yet matched. Prominent state Republicans, including Sen. Thom Tillis and former Gov. Pat McCrory, have declined to endorse Robinson, the incumbent lieutenant governor. Democrats have a new presidential nominee who has energized the base, and recent polls have shown Stein edging toward a double-digit lead. But North Carolina is still a purple state with a history of elections decided by razor-thin margins. Democrats are hoping that Stein’s record as attorney general and his centrist, economy-focused campaign will win over voters, regardless of what happens at the presidential level. Republicans argue that Robinson’s focus on parental rights in schools will boost him and that conservatives will choose even a controversial Republican over a Democrat come November. Both parties acknowledge that early polling leads don’t preclude close races as past cycles have shown. “We obviously feel good about what we’re seeing in the polling, but this is North Carolina,” said a source familiar with the Stein campaign’s thinking. “This is going to be a tight race.” Jonathan Felts, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Council of State committee, said Democrats had failed to finish off Robinson before Labor Day and predicted that Republicans’ core support would stabilize in October. “We are a cantankerous lot who find fault with everything,” Felts said of his party. “And then, when it’s time to actually make a binary decision – Democrat vs. Republican – our base comes home.” Historically, North Carolina voters have favored ticket-splitting. In the 12 presidential elections of the past half century, the state has backed the Democratic nominee just twice – Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008. But the state has only elected three Republican governors in the past 100 years – the most recent being McCrory in 2012. McCrory’s 10,000-vote loss in 2016 has been attributed in part to legislation he signed that forced transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender matching their birth certificate in state government buildings. The law, HB2, led to massive boycotts from companies and missed revenue opportunities, before being repealed in 2017. That same year, however, Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 4 points. “There’s no connection between the gubernatorial ticket and presidential ticket,” said North Carolina Republican strategist Paul Shumaker. “There’s still a good 25% of voters who don’t even know who the gubernatorial candidates are right now. The presidential candidates are much more better defined.” A Quinnipiac poll of likely voters released this week had Stein leading Robinson 51% to 41% overall, with the attorney general holding a 38- point advantage among women. A Fox News poll from last month found the attorney general up 54% to 43% among registered voters, with a 21-point advantage among women. Both polls showed Stein winning the support of virtually all the Democrats surveyed, leading with independents and capturing the support of about a tenth of Republican voters. Both polls also showed the presidential race with no clear leader. Democrats have swamped Republicans on the airwaves, according to AdImpact data through September 11.  America Works USA, a political action committee allied with the Democratic Governors Association, has spent $18.3 million on TV ads, while Stein has spent more than $29 million in ads touting his work to clear a backlog of rape kits in the state and criticizing Robinson over the day care center he operated with his wife. The most damaging ads have featured Robinson’s past remarks criticizing abortion. Robinson has said he supports the state’s 12-week abortion limit, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, despite his past support for bans with no exceptions. He’s attributed his opposition to the procedure to his and his wife’s decision to seek an abortion 30 years ago. “Everything Josh Stein and his campaign say about Mark Robinson is either an outright lie or twisted so far out of context it might as well be,” Robinson campaign spokesman Mike Lonergan said in a statement. Robinson’s campaign has spent more than $8.9 million on the airwaves through September 11, and the Republican Governors Association has spent $9.9 million attacking Stein’s law enforcement record. One Robinson ad, in particular, criticized Stein’s handling of racial justice protests in 2020. “As Attorney General, Josh Stein has been intent on keeping North Carolina communities safe – whether it be urging Congress to spend $300 million to detect fentanyl at the border, clearing the rape kit backlog, or putting drug traffickers, murderers, rapists and child sex abusers behind bars,” Stein campaign spokeswoman Morgan Hopkins said in a statement. Robinson also has the support of Trump, who called him “Martin Luther King on steroids” as he endorsed the lieutenant governor in March ahead of the state’s Republican primary. Robinson has embraced the former president’s backing and campaigned with him in Asheville last month. There, the lieutenant governor made an argument that many of his own supporters have made for him: It’s not about the personality or how “brash” Trump may seem, but his policies. “We’re suffering because of bad policy,” Robinson said. “We need to get the good times back. And how do we get the good times back? We reelect President Donald Trump to fix this economy.” The governor’s race may come down to how much Robinson has turned off moderate and independent voters after years of comments in interviews and Facebook posts that have been criticized as anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic and misogynistic. Stein has sought to capitalize on that history by arguing that Robinson is unfit for the office and framing his inflammatory comments as distractions. “We have to focus on the fundamentals: great schools, solid infrastructure, affordable and accessible health care, safe communities,” the attorney general told voters at a campaign event with business leaders this summer. “And we must leave to the side these job-killing culture wars.” Robinson has also made an economic pitch, focused on his experiences growing up in poverty, being laid off and watching his jobs get sent overseas. Susan Myers, an entrepreneur from Pink Hill, North Carolina, said those experiences showed that Robinson has “lived a real life.” Myers said she was a longtime supporter of the lieutenant governor and had held a fundraiser for him at her home during his 2020 race. “I was amazed at the turnout in a very rural area,” she told CNN. “He’s a rock star. He draws people across racial and sexual and income and education barriers, and that’s what we need.” She was willing to look past his history of contentious remarks. “There are a lot of lies, a lot of taking a little bit here, a little bit there,” Myers said of the criticisms of Robinson. “Mark’s not a lifelong politician, so he said things off the cuff that maybe he shouldn’t have said.” Democrats say Stein’s record – and his lack of viral moments – is part of his appeal. “He is a public servant,” state party chair Anderson Clayton said. “He’s not a showboat. Stein grew up in Chapel Hill, where his father – civil rights attorney Adam Stein – helped found the state’s first racially integrated law firm. The attorney general received a bachelors degree from Dartmouth and law and public policy degrees from Harvard University. He’s also highlighted his work clearing the state’s massive backlog of untested rape kits. During his first term in office, Stein worked with the Republican-controlled legislature to conduct an audit that revealed there were more than 16,000 untested rape kits in the state and to pass legislation to clear the backlog and reform the testing system. Stein’s office announced in April that the backlog had been cleared. Republicans have argued that despite his inflammatory comments, Robinson appeals to working-class North Carolina residents in a way that the Ivy League-educated, two-term attorney general may not. Robinson grew up in Greensboro, the ninth of 10 children, and speaks often of how his mother kept the family afloat after his father died. After serving in the Army Reserves and briefly attending college, Robinson spent years working in furniture manufacturing. In 2022, he received a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. In 2018, he rose to prominence after his remarks at a Greensboro City Council meeting defending gun owners’ rights after the Parkland , Florida, school shooting. (Months earlier, Robinson took to Facebook to label survivors of the shooting calling for gun control “spoiled, angry, know it all CHILDREN” and “media prosti-tots.”) Two years later, he won his first political campaign, for lieutenant governor, in the same cycle that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Stein won second terms. Both candidates have centered their pitch on the economy and education. Earlier this summer, the two shared a stage for the first time at a town hall style event hosted by the Wilmington Business Journal. Stein spoke first, touting his record as attorney general and repeating his warning of “job-killing culture wars” and the memory of the state’s bathroom law. Then he blasted what he called Robinson’s “division and hate,” and ran through a list of his opponent’s past comments, including describing homosexuality as “filth,” calling public school teachers “wicked people,” suggesting that Pearl Harbor and 9/11 might have been inside jobs, and referencing women who “can’t keep their skirts down” to explain his support for banning abortion. “Friends, being governor is not performative outrage,” Stein told the crowd. “It is a real job. It’s an important job. It is a hard job.” When he took the stage minutes later, Robinson said he would be focused on the economy and education. “There are a lot of folks are going to say that Mark Robinson is some culture warrior, is going to be focused on the culture wars. That is not true,” he told the crowd. “That is not the message that we have been presenting, and that is not what we will be doing as governor.” A few minutes later, however, the topic turned to those battles when Robinson was asked to elaborate on his pledge to remove what he believes to be inappropriate materials from classrooms. He pointed to the book “Gender Queer,” a memoir about coming out as nonbinary and frequent target of bans. Deloris Rhodes, a former high school principal who moved to Wilmington after she retired, said she’s been following Robinson since he was elected lieutenant governor in 2020. She bristled at his efforts to overhaul public school education in the state. In his 2022 memoir, Robinson called for eliminating science and social studies classes for elementary school students, a proposal he later backed away from, and shuttering the State Board of Education. “Anyone that has common sense knows that they’re going to vote for Josh Stein,” Rhodes said. Heather Horak, a 48-year-old Wilmington resident who attended the event, said she appreciates Robinson’s approach to education policy. Horak is an unaffiliated voter whose politics defy easy categorization. She supported Democratic presidents – including Obama twice – until 2016, when she backed Trump. Her support for Trump this year was only solidified after independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr dropped out and endorsed the former president. At the same time, Horak also supports abortion rights. Horak said she wasn’t focused on negative ads about Robinson’s conduct because it didn’t affect the issues that matter to her. She wanted people to vote on policy, not emotions, she said. “If – whoever your candidate is – is just triggering your emotions and you say, ‘I don’t like that person because I think they’re a bully, I don’t like that person because he’s got a harsh tone,’ let’s be realistic and look at the facts,” she said. “That’s my biggest concern.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that the ad that criticized Josh Stein’s handling of racial justice protests in 2020 was from Mark Robinson’s campaign."
Harris campaign guarding against overconfidence after her debate performance sent Democrats’ spirits soaring | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:05 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:15:58.677Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-overconfidence/index.html,"Kamala Harris just roasted her opponent on national television. After months of anticipation, the world’s biggest pop star finally endorsed her. She is swimming in a veritable ocean of cash. So why is Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell still feeling anxious about November’s election? “I was ecstatic like every other Democrat as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin,” Dingell said Thursday on “CNN This Morning,” before recounting the reality check she’d been delivered in an early morning phone call from an official in her state. “Six-fifty yesterday morning, one of my township supervisors called me and wanted to know what I thought,” Dingell said. “That discussion brought me right back down to Earth.” Burned before by overconfidence, Democrats this cycle are running against two opponents. Yes, Donald Trump is the name opposite of Harris’s on the ballot. But it is complacency in their own ranks that many of Harris’s allies are working just as hard to protect against in the final sprint toward Election Day. Polls provide one reason why. Surveys in battleground states indicate an extraordinarily close contest, perhaps the closest in recent memory, which many Harris allies fear is being obscured by the swell of momentum on Harris’ side. Trump’s stranglehold on his own supporters is another. Harris’s aides view his base of support as highly motivated, and note his favorability is higher than when he lost the 2020 election. Yet perhaps the biggest motivator — embossed on the minds of so many operatives who now are working to elect Harris — is the memory of 2016, when Hillary Clinton’s campaign believed it was coasting to victory only to see support in the so-called “blue wall” crumble. Democrats are hardly in despair. Last month’s convention in Chicago was practically euphoric in its celebration of a new nominee that, unlike President Joe Biden, does not seem predestined to lose. And Harris herself has embraced the new sense of joy among the party, casting it as the alternative to Trump’s divisiveness. Yet in practically every conversation, public or private, Harris aides and the candidate herself have interjected with a reality check. They have tempered expectations, tamped down on confidence and announced themselves as the underdog, despite their ostensible success in orchestrating an unprecedented candidate swap 100 days before the election and consolidating new Democratic enthusiasm. Huddled at their campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after the debate, Harris’s campaign aides determined the event would likely do little to change the overall trajectory of the race. Their earlier projections that the results in November will amount to a razor-thin margin — likely to be as close or closer than the results in 2020 — remain the same. Instead, they have developed a plan for the coming days and weeks that will place Harris directly in front of battleground state voters, beginning Thursday in North Carolina and continuing Friday in Pennsylvania. Those stops for the “New Way Forward” tour aren’t just to any battleground state. They’re the states where voting is already about to get underway. And a campaign official tells CNN that’s no coincidence. North Carolina, a purple state where Harris and running mate Tim Walz will make two stops Thursday, is racing to reprint and send out mail-in ballots after the state’s Supreme Court ruled Monday to exclude Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has exited the race. About 161,000 people have already requested mail-in ballots, according to the NC Board of Elections. Trump won the state in 2020 by less than half that number of votes. Next week, Harris will participate in a roundtable with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, which has been withholding an endorsement for the first time in decades. She will also participate in a Q&A session with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, with whom Trump appeared in late July and remarked that Harris “turned Black.” The campaign is expecting to rake in millions in new funds, with a Harris-helmed fundraiser in Washington on Saturday, an Oprah-headlined virtual event next week and several other high-dollar events in the works, according to people familiar with them. That cash, the campaign has said, must be quickly tabulated and quickly deployed in states where voters are beginning to head to the ballot box. In addition to rallies, Harris also plans more local media interviews in the swing states and appearances that bring her into direct contact with voters. Campaign officials spent part of Wednesday looking through debate footage to identify moments that would make effective television ads. The first spot features Harris framing the race as a choice between “two very different visions for the country, one that is focused on the future, one that is focused on the past.” Even as they applauded Harris’s success on the debate stage, however, aides and allies remained cautious about declaring victory too early. “We haven’t won anything yet!” Doug Emhoff, Harris’ husband, declared to supporters at a debate watch party in Philadelphia moments after she stepped off stage. “We have a lot of work to do,” Harris followed up. The next morning, it was more caution. “Debates don’t win elections,” Harris’s team emailed supporters. That type of message is hardly new for a campaign that is looking to maintain its fundraising, motivate its volunteers and convince its pledged voters that they still, in fact, need to cast a ballot. Al Gore even wore an “underdog” costume for Halloween in 1999 as he was seeking the Democratic nomination. Yet the messaging this time appears to go deeper than simply a galvanizing tactic. In battleground states like Dingell’s, where a small slice of undecided voters is likely to determine the next president, Harris and Trump remain in a neck-and-neck contest. While some surveys in Michigan indicate Harris with a small edge, Dingell suggested the numbers could be an illusion. “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” she said. “There’s just a lot of people in the middle … it’s just closer than people realize.” Not every Democrat on Harris’s side seems gripped with caution. “This is the easiest election in my lifetime. I love where we are,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on “CBS Mornings” on Tuesday ahead of the debate, rejecting the “underdog” label for Harris: “She’s not. I don’t like hearing about that.”"
Harris campaign seizes on abortion exchange in Tuesday’s debate in new ad | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T16:00:19.725Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/harris-campaign-seizes-abortion-ad-debate/index.html,"The Harris campaign is launching a new abortion-focused ad Thursday, capitalizing on what officials believe was one of the most pivotal exchanges between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during Tuesday’s presidential debate. Harris’ team prepared the vice president to confront Trump on nationwide abortion restrictions. Her aides argue the preparation paid off, crediting her needling him on reproductive rights for throwing him off balance the rest of the debate. And now, they’re turning that moment into an ad that will run in battleground states, including in Arizona and Nevada where Trump heads this week. The newly released ad includes both candidates’ responses on abortion on the debate stage. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said, referring to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Harris, in response, ran through personal stories of women struggling to get health care while navigating abortion restrictions. “I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government,” she said. Campaign officials cited the vice president’s response as one of the strongest moments of the debate, based on internal data suggesting that the stories of miscarriages and victims of rape and incest resonated the most with undecided voters. In a statement announcing the ad, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said abortion is “one of the top issues in this election, and the difference between the candidates could not be clearer.” It comes as Harris arrives in North Carolina – a crucial state that President Joe Biden narrowly lost in 2020 but one where campaign officials say they’re trying to make inroads with voters who may be put off by Trump and controversial GOP gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson. North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny Tuesday he believes Harris will move the needle in his battleground state after her strong showing in Philadelphia. The vice president’s focus on protecting abortion rights and health care, Cooper said, could be key to bolstering Democratic efforts to deliver the state in a presidential race for the first time since 2008. Harris campaign officials spent Wednesday poring over footage of the debate to identify key moments to put into new campaign TV and digital ads, according to the campaign, seeking to amplify what they perceive to be the strongest debate exchange. The latest ads are part of $370 million set aside for digital and television between Labor Day and Election Day."
Trump allies do damage control as Harris rides fresh momentum post-debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:19 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T04:00:19.736Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/trump-harris-debate-fallout-analysis/index.html,"Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation. It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day. Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case. The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase. But history suggests that a first debate between two candidates is not historically a reliable predictor of who wins the election. Despite Harris’ strong performance, it’s not yet clear how much progress she made in building the path to 270 electoral votes. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who consistently warns Democrats not to take her swing state for granted, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday that Trump’s base is energized and that the race could not be closer. “I was ecstatic, like every other Democrat, as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin. He reminded much of America about who he was and what he was. She showed people she could be the commander in chief,” Dingell said. But, she added: “At 6:50 yesterday morning, one of my township supervisors called me and wanted to know what I thought. And I said, ‘Well, what did you think?’ And that discussion brought me right back down to Earth.” “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” she said. Meanwhile, Harris’ allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.” “He was all over the place but to some extent structured,” Reines said, referring to Trump when he took on former Secretary of State Clinton. “Now, he’s all over the board.” He added: “I think he’s losing (his) train of thought and he’s just blurting out the next thing in his mind.” Hours after the debate, the political bile briefly eased as Harris and Trump, along with Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, gathered at Ground Zero in New York to honor the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The general election rivals only met for the first time at the debate, but they shared their second handshake in 12 hours in a gesture of national unity orchestrated by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. In a more light-hearted scene Wednesday, a grinning Biden took the extraordinary step of donning a Trump 2024 baseball cap. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the president gave a hat to a Trump supporter during a visit to a fire station in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, near where the fourth hijacked jet crashed short of its target on 9/11 after a passenger revolt. The Trump supporter had said that “in the same spirit POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it,” Bates said. But it was only a temporary respite to the bitter fallout from the debate. The former president did what he always does when presented with unfavorable political facts — deny them. He declared on Fox News on Wednesday that he had “one of my better debates,” despite sweeping negative reviews of his showing. Trump also launched an attack on ABC News, claiming the debate was “rigged” and faulting moderators who fact checked him for setting up a “three-to-one” tag team against him. But one of his newest associates, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may have inadvertently highlighted Trump’s deficiencies in the debate even as he tried to praise the ex-president whom he recently endorsed. Kennedy said on Fox News that while Trump won the debate on “substance,” Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.” “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.” Still, Trump’s complaints were more eagerly picked up among his longtime boosters in conservative media, underscoring the way that the Republican Party always falls in line behind its leader. However, Trump’s narrative that he was thwarted by two TV anchors sat uneasily with his claim on stage that he’s such an intimidating figure that US enemies were simply scared of him. Trump was correct in arguing that he was fact-checked more thoroughly than Harris on Tuesday night by moderators who missed several chances to correct the vice president or to hold her to account for dodging questions. But Harris said nothing that compared to the gusher of untruths from the former president, which included a claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were slaying and eating residents’ dogs and cats. (That racist claim was debunked Wednesday by Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who said there was “no credible evidence.”) Adopting a more sinister tone in his interview with Fox, the former president accused ABC of putting on a “rigged deal” and warned officials “ought to take away their license.” His comments were ominous considering he’s vowed to wage a presidency of “retribution” if he is elected to a second term in November that would include the use of presidential power to punish his enemies. The former president also Wednesday publicly toyed with the idea of a second debate, after the Harris campaign challenged him to another round. But the former president, smarting from his treatment at the hands of the vice president on Tuesday, doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to renew the performance. One the one hand, he may have little incentive to show up again given that he was widely seen to have suffered a drubbing on Tuesday. But if the polls show him trailing in the run-up to the election, there might be a rationale for a do-over. The Harris campaign has a similar conundrum. There’s a case for the vice president folding her tent given that she might not be able to repeat Tuesday’s performance. Trump, however, is trying to change perceptions of the debate after the fact. “In the World of Boxing or UFC, when a Fighter gets beaten or knocked out, they get up and scream, ‘I DEMAND A REMATCH, I DEMAND A REMATCH!’ Well, it’s no different with a Debate. She was beaten badly last nigh. Every Poll has us WINNING,” he wrote on Truth Social, “so why would I do a Rematch?” As is often the case, the ex-president’s reading of polls was exaggerated. A flash CNN poll performed by SSRS after the debate found that watchers thought Harris put in a stronger performance by 63% to 37%. History suggests that it takes at least a week for the full impact of a debate to filter down into the electorate. And the fundamentals of the neck-and-neck race with Harris still seem to favor the former president, whose campaign ads are targeting the vice president over the current administration’s record on the economy, including high prices, inflation and immigration, with an intensity and level of focus that Trump as a candidate has come nowhere near matching. Trump’s running mate has also been more effective at delivering a sharp political message than his boss. He weaved a dismissal of the Swift endorsement for Harris into a wider attack on the vice president on Fox News. “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift,” Vance said. “When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country.” The challenging political backdrop explains why things are still tense at Harris headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. A senior campaign aide told CNN’s MJ Lee that the assumption was that the election remained a 50-50 proposition. “It’ll be incredibly close. We cannot take our foot off the gas, even when the moment feels really good,” the aide said. Harris also faces choices beyond whether she’ll agree to another debate. While her performance was stylistically strong on Tuesday, she still dodged key questions — for instance, the very first one on whether she believes Americans are better off now or when Trump was in office. The Trump campaign is sure to keep up its drumbeat of complaints that she’s avoiding deeper media scrutiny. And there are many signs that voters want more substance from the Democratic nominee. Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, told CNN’s John King that Harris did well in the debate but several also cautioned she was not sufficiently specific in explaining her policies. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs and voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the primary. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. Such doubts are evident in recent national polls too. But they also reflect the fresh complications Trump has caused for himself with his underwhelming debate performance: He may have squandered his best and last chance to expose Harris over those vulnerabilities in front of tens of millions of voters."
WNBA star Caitlin Clark explains why she liked Taylor Swift’s post endorsing Kamala Harris | CNN,"Published 7:52 AM EDT, Thu September 12, 2024",2024-09-12T11:52:17.754Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/sport/caitlin-clark-taylor-swift-kamala-harris-spt-intl/index.html,"WNBA star Caitlin Clark hinted at her political beliefs ahead of this year’s US election by liking a social media post from Taylor Swift endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, but she stopped short of endorsing a candidate when asked by reporters on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Swift ended speculation about whether she would endorse a particular candidate ahead of November’s election by telling her Instagram followers that she would be voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Clark was one of more than 10 million people to like the post but stopped short of formally endorsing Harris herself. “I have this amazing platform, so I think the biggest thing would be to just encourage people to register to vote,” Clark told reporters on Wednesday, when asked about her decision to like the post. “That’s the biggest thing I can do with the platform that I have and that’s the same thing Taylor (Swift) did. “Continue to educate yourself on the candidates that we have, the policies that they’re supporting – I think that’s the biggest thing you can do. And that’s what I would recommend to every single person that has the opportunity in our country.” Since bursting into the WNBA following her remarkable college career, Clark has had to navigate the challenges that come with being such an influential figure. Earlier this year, the 22-year-old said it was “disappointing” to see people using her name to push their own agendas, especially when it comes to racism and misogyny. This, though, appears to be the first indication of Clark’s political leanings ahead of the presidential election. The WNBA and its players have regularly engaged with societal and political issues. At this year’s Olympic Games in Paris, Team USA’s women’s basketball team emphasized their endorsement of Harris’ presidential bid before going on to win gold in a dramatic final against France. Women’s basketball players have also had influential voices in key elections before. In 2020, the Atlanta Dream protested against the team’s then co-owner – then Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was running for reelection against Rev. Raphael Warnock – over her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement. That race ended up going to a run-off and Warnock defeated Loeffler. He’s now serving as a senator from Georgia."

Pete Buttigieg on Thursday slammed former President Donald Trump’s recent false claims that migrants are eating pets, saying it’s a strategy to distract from the Republican presidential nominee’s record. In recent days, Trump and his allies, including running mate JD Vance, have promoted false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Trump repeated the conspiracy theory during the ABC presidential debate Tuesday night, although the City of Springfield and the local police have said they’ve seen no evidence for the claim. Buttigieg, who spoke in his personal capacity but serves as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said that while he thinks it is a distraction technique, “it contributes to this bigger picture of demonizing immigrants.” Buttigieg praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance but stressed that groundwork and organizing is more important to win the race. John Legend took to Instagram to respond to Donald Trump’s baseless claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in the singer’s hometown of Springfield, Ohio. Here’s what he said: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance, while warning Michigan voters that the fight to win battleground states is not over. The Democratic vice presidential candidate said Harris “commanded the room” on Tuesday at the ABC News presidential debate. “Let’s be very clear, none of us were surprised at what happened there,” and saying “no pun intended” that Harris had the “upper hand” from the start, referencing the vice president initiating a handshake with her GOP rival. As former President Donald Trump says there will not be another presidential debate, Walz said he thinks “hell, every day we should do another one,” though, he added, “it’s not going to happen.” He asked the room if they had “eating cats” on their debate bingo cards. The crowd responded by chanting “we’re not eating cats” in the same cadence as the campaign’s now-signature “we’re not going back” chant.  His comments were in reference to a false rumor about Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating their neighbors’ cats that Trump promoted at the debate. Former President Donald Trump announced Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump reiterated this during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, after making the announcement on social media. Harris’ campaign previously called for another debate. She doubled down on that call during a rally in Charlotte on Thursday, saying “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important.” Here are other headlines you should know: After the debate: The Taylor Swift effect: New ads launched: Lawsuits: Trump campaign proposals: More headlines to know: A noticeable contingent of students from Bennett College were among the supporters at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Greensboro rally Friday evening.   There are nearly a dozen historically Black Colleges and Universities across North Carolina and the campaign is engaged in direct outreach with them.  Harris, a Howard University alum, recently issued a call to action to these students in an open letter.  Bennett is one of only two all-women historically Black colleges in the country. Spelman College in Georgia is the other. Self-described “proud Bennett Belle” Jasmine Rawls introduced Harris and described her excitement as a first-time voter.  “When I go to that voting booth, I will remember that Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz are the only candidates on that ballot that are fighting for a new way forward,” said Rawls. Kamiyah McDowell, 19, — who is studying elementary education — said the debate was “nerve wrecking” to watch both as a college student and as Black woman.   McDowell says she’s most fearful about “how the public is going to react to the winner.”  Former President Donald Trump on Thursday continued attacking the moderators at ABC’s presidential debate and repeated debunked conspiracy theories about migrants taking people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio.  Trump again claimed migrants in Springfield were stealing people’s pets, which is a debunked conspiracy theory that he also promoted during the presidential debate.  “They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park. In the lake. And even walking off with their pets. ‘My dog’s been taken, my dog’s been stolen,’ this can only happen, these people are the worst,” Trump said.  The GOP standard-bearer also attacked Vice President Kamala Harris over her debate performance and said, “She claimed I want to monitor women’s pregnancies. I don’t want to, I don’t want to do that. “It’s a total lie. I don’t want to do that. Women, I won’t be following you to the hospital monitoring.” For more context, here’s our fact check on the ABC presidential debate Former President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that, if reelected, he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.  Trump said “that gives people more of an incentive to work. It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”  The former president previously announced he would push to end taxes on tips and proposed that seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security.  GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized far-right activist Laura Loomer on Thursday, saying that her “rhetoric and hateful tone” is concerning and a problem and “doesn’t represent MAGA as a whole.” The comments from Greene, a Georgia Republican who has her own high-profile history of incendiary and inflammatory remarks, come after the congresswoman called on Loomer to take down an X post, in which Loomer said if Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if she would encourage Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump not to keep close contact with Loomer, Greene said, “This is such an important election. I don’t think she has the experience or the right mentality to advise a very important presidential election.” It’s the latest sign of infighting on the far-right as the presidential election nears, highlighting tension and divisions among Trump supporters over how the Republican Party and its presidential nominee should position itself to voters. Appearing dazed and flustered by an unfamiliar and fast-changing political landscape upended by Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Trump has unleashed a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even close allies and donors have acknowledged as unproductive in recent days. Loomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump, appears often at events where he is speaking and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump’s next line of attack.

The donations came from around 600,000 donors, the official said, and was “overwhelmingly” fueled by grassroots supporters. The official did not specify how the campaign is defining grassroots supporters. Jen O’Malley Dillon, campaign chair, said in a statement that the haul“reflects a strong and growing coalition of Americans united behind Vice President Harris’ candidacy that knows the stakes this November, and are doing their part to defeat Donald Trump this November.” However, O’Malley Dillon added that “this momentum cannot be taken for granted.”  The statement comes as CNN has previously reported that even after a strong debate performance against Trump, the Harris campaign is insisting that they believe the election will be tough and very close, and that one night would not have changed the trajectory of the race. Vice President Kamala Harris highlighted the contrasts with former President Donald Trump, criticizing him for his answers on several policy issues during his debate performance on Tuesday night while reiterating he was unfit for the presidency. During Tuesday night’s debate, Trump said he has “concepts of a plan” to replace the Affordable Care Act, something he previously promised to do. Harris responded that Trump tried dozens of times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and touted the Biden administration’s work to work to lower prescription drug costs and cap the cost of insulin. She also said she would strengthen the ACA if she were elected president.  The vice president also noted what she said was at stake in the election, specifically women’s reproductive freedom, and reminded a crowd of supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, that Trump would not commit to vetoing an abortion ban when asked on the debate stage. Harris also slammed the former president as somebody who was “not fit to be president of the United States, and should never again occupy our nation’s highest office.” Some context: Since Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, North Carolina is again seen as competitive, and she and Trump have both campaigned there. Barack Obama won the state in 2008, the only time a Democratic candidate for the White House had carried the Tar Heel state in nearly five decades. A federal appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump’s effort to delay his sentencing in the criminal hush money case because the state judge overseeing the matter already postponed the date. Trump asked the New York-based appeals court to get involved after a federal judge denied his request to move the state case to federal court. While the case was on appeal, New York state Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the state case, agreed to move Trump’s sentencing, then set for September 18, until after the November presidential election, in part to avoid the appearance of aiding one political party or another. The former president’s lawyers argued that even with the state adjournment, they wanted the appeals court to step in and put the case on hold until they can fully litigate their challenge to Trump’s conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records following the US Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity this summer. Rose Goute Creole restaurant does a bustling business in Springfield, Ohio, with clientele drawn to its heaping displays of patties and doughnuts, and pots of perfumed rice, fried pork and fish, and golden plantains. Rosena Jean Louis runs the front, offering free cups of a powerful black coffee and patiently managing a jostling lunch crowd. She and her coworkers are proud of the food they serve, feeding a Haitian expatriate community that has grown quickly in Springfield over the past few years. “I’m always working at the restaurant,” she told CNN. “Everyone likes the food I cook.” But when asked about a lie that has taken hold in some corners of the internet that their countrymen are stealing and eating people’s pets, she rolls her eyes in exasperation. Local officials have repeatedly tried to end the rumor. Springfield officials have told press and city commission meetings that are no credible reports of animal abuse “by individuals within the immigrant community.” The state’s highest Republican official, Gov. Mike DeWine, also dismissed the rumor firmly on Wednesday, noting there was “no evidence of that at all.” “The internet can be quite crazy sometimes,” DeWine told CBS in an interview. “Mayor Rue of Springfield says, no, there’s no truth in that. They have no evidence of that, at all. So, I think we go with what the mayor says. He knows his city.” Read more about the debate in Springfield Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would not participate in another presidential debate.   Trump debated President Joe Biden in June and Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this week. Harris’ campaign had called for another debate after she and Trump faced off on ABC on Tuesday.  For now, the Harris campaign says it does not take Donald Trump’s comment at face value.  “He changes his position every day,” a senior adviser said. “I predict there will be another.” This post has been updated with comment from a senior Harris adviser. Asked explicitly if he would consider privatizingthe Veterans Affairs health system, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he’s in favor of giving veterans “more optionality.” “I think I’d consider — and Donald Trump was really good at this, doesn’t get enough credit for this particular innovation — but giving veterans more choice, right?” Vance said on “The Shawn Ryan Show” podcast. Vance described a situation where the nearest VA hospital might be over 100 miles away in a rural area.  Vance also spoke about gutting the federal workforce in Washington, DC, including at the VA.  “Probably 90, 95% of the people who work at the VA are fantastic human beings. But then you’ve got, like, a small slice of the VA that’s bad apples that make it really hard for everybody else to do their job,” Vance said. A judge on Thursday threw out three charges in the sweeping Georgia election subversion case, including two charges that former President Donald Trump is facing. The decision hasn’t yet been formally applied to Trump because his case has been paused pending appeals. In a separate ruling, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee also upheld the marquee racketeering charge in the case, which Trump is also facing. These rulings only narrowly went into effect for former Trump lawyer John Eastman and Georgia state Sen. Shawn Still, who were involved in the 2020 fake electors plot. Their cases are not currently paused. Trump was only named in two of the three charges that McAfee threw out Thursday. Read more about the case. President Joe Biden donned a Trump cap while visiting a firehouse in Pennsylvania on Wednesday as a gesture of “bipartisan unity” while he commemorated the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, according to press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Pictures and videos showed Biden, who was speaking to a crowd at a firehouse near Shanksville Pennsylvania – where United Flight 93 crashed after passengers tried thwarting a hijacking – momentarily putting a Trump hat on at the urging of others in the crowd. Many in the crowd were wearing Trump-branded gear. Biden’s message, Jean-Pierre said, was “that we needed to go back to that bipartisan unity as a country. And so he made those remarks, impromptu remarks, to some of the folks who were there on that day, and he offered a presidential hat to a man who was wearing a Trump cap. And in return, the man said that, in the same spirit, the president should put on his Trump cap. And so the President did very briefly, and that’s what happened.” She added: “It was, it was truly a back and forth about unity, and the president remembering a moment in time after a horrific incident on that day and how the country did come together. It didn’t matter what political party you were part of. It didn’t matter. We came together as a country because we lost so many souls, thousands of souls, more than 2,000 that day.” The White House on Thursday said recent social media comments from Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has been spending time with former President Donald Trump, are “repugnant.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “no leader should ever associate” with someone who spreads “racist poison.” Jean-Pierre was asked about a tweet Loomer posted on Sunday denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris. Loomer traveled to Tuesday’s presidential debate on Trump’s plane and accompanied the former president on Wednesday as he commemorated the 23rd anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. “No leader should ever associate with someone who spreads this kind of ugliness — this kind of racist poison. That’s what this is — and who continues to fan these types of dangerous and insulting conspiracy theories, like the false notion that the tragic 9/11 attacks were an inside job,” she added, a reference to a video Loomer posted last year that suggested a government conspiracy was responsible for the attacks. Read more about Loomer’s possible influence on Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris called for another presidential debate on Thursday, minutes after former President Donald Trump said on social media that he would not participate in a third debate. She slammed Trump for delivering the same “tired playbook” during the debate on Tuesday, reiterating it’s time for the country to move forward. House Republicans are flirting with the idea of forcing a government shutdown over the issue of noncitizens voting in US elections. Government funding authority runs out on September 30, and House Speaker Mike Johnson — at the all-caps urging of former President Donald Trump in social media posts – wants to pair a temporary spending bill to keep the government running along with a bill that would require proof of citizenship for every American in order to register to vote. With that in mind, here’s a look at the evidence in the specific states Johnson mentions about the infinitesimal number of undocumented people registering to vote or actually voting in US elections. Georgia In 2022, Georgia, which has more than 7 million registered voters, announced the results of the first-ever citizenship review of its voter rolls. It found a grand total of 1,634 people “who had attempted to register to vote were not able to be verified,” according to a statement that year from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican. They were placed into “pending citizenship” status. Pennsylvania In a state with more than 8.6 million registered voters, an admitted glitch in Pennsylvania’s voter registration process enabled noncitizens legally in the US to unwittingly register to vote for a time. Between 2006 and 2017, when the glitch was discovered, at least 168 unauthorized people are thought to have been registered to vote in Philadelphia, a city of more than 1.5 million people. Read about the situation in other states here Kamala Harris just roasted her opponent on national television. After months of anticipation, the world’s biggest pop star finally endorsed her. She is swimming in a veritable ocean of cash. So why is Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell still feeling anxious about November’s election? Burned before by overconfidence, Democrats this cycle are running against two opponents. Yes, Donald Trump is the name opposite of Harris’ on the ballot. But it is complacency in their own ranks that many of Harris’ allies are working just as hard to protect against in the final sprint toward Election Day. Polls provide one reason why. Surveys in battleground states indicate an extraordinarily close contest, perhaps the closest in recent memory, which many Harris allies fear is being obscured by the swell of momentum on Harris’ side. Trump’s stranglehold on his own supporters is another. Harris’ aides view his base of support as highly motivated and note his favorability is higher than when he lost the 2020 election. Yet perhaps the biggest motivator — embossed on the minds of so many operatives who now are working to elect Harris — is the memory of 2016, when Hillary Clinton’s campaign believed it was coasting to victory only to see support in the so-called “blue wall” crumble. Democrats are hardly in despair. Last month’s convention in Chicago was practically euphoric in its celebration of a new nominee that, unlike President Joe Biden, does not seem predestined to lose. And Harris herself has embraced the new sense of joy among the party, casting it as the alternative to Trump’s divisiveness. Yet in practically every conversation, public or private, Harris aides and the candidate herself have interjected with a reality check. They have tempered expectations, tamped down on confidence and announced themselves as the underdog, despite their ostensible success in orchestrating an unprecedented candidate swap 100 days before the election and consolidating new Democratic enthusiasm. Keep reading here about where things stand in the Harris campaign. Huddled at their campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after the debate, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign aides determined the event would likely do little to change the overall trajectory of the race. Their earlier projections that the results in November will amount to a razor-thin margin — likely to be as close or closer than the results in 2020 — remain the same. Instead, they have developed a plan for the coming days and weeks that will place Harris directly in front of battleground state voters, beginning Thursday in North Carolina and continuing Friday in Pennsylvania. Those stops for the “New Way Forward” tour aren’t just to any battleground state. They’re the states where voting is already about to get underway. And a campaign official tells CNN that’s no coincidence. North Carolina, a purple state where Harris and running mate Tim Walz will make two stops Thursday, is racing to reprint and send out mail-in ballots after the state’s Supreme Court ruled Monday to exclude Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has exited the race. About 161,000 people have already requested mail-in ballots, according to the NC Board of Elections. Trump won the state in 2020 by less than half that number of votes. Next week, Harris will participate in a roundtable with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, which has been withholding an endorsement for the first time in decades. She will also participate in a Q&A session with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, with whom Trump appeared in late July and remarked that Harris “turned Black.” The campaign is expecting to rake in millions in new funds, with a Harris-helmed fundraiser in Washington on Saturday, an Oprah-headlined virtual event next week and several other high-dollar events in the works, according to people familiar with them. That cash, the campaign has said, must be quickly tabulated and quickly deployed in states where voters are beginning to head to the ballot box. In addition to rallies, Harris also plans more local media interviews in swing states and appearances that bring her into direct contact with voters. Keep reading here about Harris’ campaign plans. Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris brought an immediate, tangible boost for two key websites promoting voter registration, the latest signal of the superstar singer’s political potency.  The link that Swift shared in her Instagram story late Tuesday routed fans to Vote.gov, which is the federal government’s voting registration site.  That marked a significant spike to the site’s average traffic. For instance, from September 3 to 9, the site received about 30,000 visitors per day. Vote.gov received “a total of 726,523 visitors between September 10-11, 2024,” the spokesperson noted.  The nonprofit, nonpartisan organization Vote.org also saw a significant spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement.  On Wednesday, there were over 27,000 new registrations and over 80,000 people who verified their registration status on Vote.org, a spokesperson said.  Swift encouraged her supporters to register to vote and research early voting information.  “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. With margins expected to be tight in battleground states this November, Swift’s capacity to shake up the presidential race could make a difference.  Swift also urged fans to register to vote while accepting an award at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday. Vote.org doesn’t have post-VMA data at this point. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer continued on Thursday to tie former President Donald Trump to the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, a conservative policy roadmap for a Republican presidential administration. Trump has said that he is unfamiliar with the project, which Schumer called, “an American nightmare. The most conservative, unhinged and extreme agenda we’ve seen in modern times.” He added, “Trump’s first term in office wouldn’t hold a candle to the ideas in Project 2025.” Schumer and several of his Senate Democratic colleagues pointed to parts of the proposal that are “laying the groundwork for a national abortion ban,” and note that it includes a plan to abolish the Department of Education. They also argued that the mortgage policies would “make it harder for Americans to own a home.”  “This is sinister stuff,” said Schumer. “The vast majority of Americans oppose them, yet it is precisely what the hard right is promising the American people if Donald Trump returns to office.” Pressed on Republicans’ insistence that Trump would not sign a national abortion ban —although Trump did not explicitly rule it out at Tuesday night’s presidential debate – the majority leader said, “look at everything he’s said over the years…No one believes him. Everybody knows what he’s going to do.” More about Project 2025: The 920-page document was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.”   Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. A Harris campaign official previously said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.”  Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he believes former President Donald Trump’s across-the-board tariff proposals are part of a negotiation tactic and claimed that tariffs are “not always” inflationary.  “When people say these tariffs are going to have an effect, Donald Trump already imposed specific tariffs on specific industries. You didn’t see the negative consequences come to light. In fact, what you saw was rising wages and rising take home pay. So, when people say you can’t do this in a narrow way, you can’t do it in a broad-based way, I just think that doesn’t actually fit with reality,” Vance said.  Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports and 10% across-the-board tariff on imports from other nations. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar. What experts say: Maury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that such high levies would raise prices on consumers, especially if they were applied widely — although he cautioned that it’s unclear under what conditions Trump would impose 100% tariffs. Christine McDaniel, a former senior trade official in the George W. Bush administration, called the idea “crazy” and “silly season campaign rhetoric.” Alex Durante, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, told CNN that 100% tariffs would threaten the economy. Attorney General Merrick Garland slammed efforts to turn the Justice Department into a “political weapon” during a fiery speech Thursday to department staff and US attorneys from across the country. Garland decried the “escalation of attacks” against career staff in years through “conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence.” The attorney general’s comments come as former President Donald Trump has claimed that the Justice Department has been weaponized against him amid his criminal prosecutions and suggested that he would politicize the department should he return to the Oval Office. Neither Trump nor his allies were mentioned by name. But Trump and his associates have publicly discussed plans to dismantle the department and its law enforcement components like the FBI, or to prosecute his political enemies. “Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,” Garland added to applause. Garland also thanked the prosecutors and Justice Department staff for refusing to “bend to politics” and “break under pressure.” Read more about Garland’s remarks. The Harris campaign is launching a new abortion-focused ad Thursday, capitalizing on what officials believe was one of the most pivotal exchanges between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during Tuesday’s presidential debate. Harris’ team prepared the vice president to confront Trump on nationwide abortion restrictions. Her aides argue the preparation paid off, crediting her needling him on reproductive rights for throwing him off balance the rest of the debate. And now, they’re turning that moment into an ad that will run in battleground states, including in Arizona and Nevada where Trump heads this week. The newly released ad includes both candidates’ responses on abortion on the debate stage. “I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said, referring to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Harris, in response, ran through personal stories of women struggling to get health care while navigating abortion restrictions. “I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government,” she said. Continue reading about Harris’ new ad. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance defended former President Donald Trump’s debate performance, and he didn’t explicitly say if he believes there should be a second one.  It wasn’t clear which poll Vance was referencing. In a CNN flash poll, 63% of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate say Vice President Kamala Harris outperformed Trump. Among the group, 31% described themselves as Democrats, 39% as Republicans and 30% as independents or members of another party.  Vance was asked if he had any frustration on what Trump was focusing on in the debate versus what he could have said about Harris.  Vance said he disagrees with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who said that Trump lost the debate.   “When you see how the undecided voters react, that’s what actually matters the most. But it’s telling that immediately after the debate, Kamala Harris came out and said, yes, I’d like to do another debate,” Vance said.  Vance has two fundraisers in New York City today, according to a source familiar. Springfield, Ohio’s City Hall was forced to close Thursday “due to a bomb threat that was issued to multiple facilities throughout Springfield today.” It’s unclear what the nature of the threat was; officials were alerted to the threat via email at 8:24 a.m, ET, according to the city. Springfield has been the center of false claim pushed by former President Donald Trump and others that Haitian migrants in the community are stealing and eating pets. City officials have told CNN they have seen no evidence of that happening. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced on Thursday a grant program that would support new farmers in Minnesota to buy equipment or improve infrastructure on their farm.  The new grant funding comes as Walz seeks to appeal to agriculture workers, farmers and rural voters while campaigning around the country as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.  Under the new program, beginner farmers would be allowed to apply for up to $20,000 grants to purchase farm equipment or improve infrastructure like irrigation systems or livestock buildings. The program expects to award $800,000 in total.  Harris’ running mate has often highlighted his rural upbringing in Nebraska and his connection to rural voters through his time representing rural Minnesotans in Congress and as governor. In an interview with WCMU, a public radio station in Michigan, Walz touted his connection to people in “ag districts” and spoke on how he hopes to win their support.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal warned his fellow Democrats not to get complacent after Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate performance — citing Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016.  “I’m deeply concerned that this race is going to be neck and neck right to the finish, and the euphoria that a lot of people are feeling right now, while justified, perhaps, after her tremendous performance in the debate, may lead to complacency or overconfidence,” he told CNN. Asked how Harris can protect herself against that trend, the Connecticut Democrat continued, “You avoid that trap by sounding the alarm and raising awareness about past complacency — we have only to look at Hillary Clinton to see how complacency and overconfidence can lead to disaster, especially after a good debate.”  Conservative activist Leonard Leo is threatening to withhold some of his $1 billion in funds from dozens of groups he supports unless they can demonstrate plans to “weaponize the conservative vision.” In a letter obtained by CNN, Leo makes it clear he wants groups that are supported by his 85 Fund to take concrete action to “crush liberal dominance” if they want to continue to receive funding.  The letter outlines how Leo believes left-wing activist groups have used their funds to “weaponize” their philosophy — and he would like to see groups that are supported by his 85 Fund do the same. Leo believes that conservative philanthropy needs to move “less in the direction of research, policy, and general education,” and instead use funding to “operationalize or weaponize the conservative vision.”  In his letter, Leo says the Left has taken this “enormous” step in operationalizing their ideas. Leo is known as one of the architects of Trump’s conservative Supreme Court. He helped Trump select Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Since taking the bench, the Trump’s appointees have been a part of several federal laws — including the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The letter cites groups like Students for Justice in Palestine, Voter Registration Project and World Professional Association for Transgender Health as a few organizations that have benefited from left-wing funding and are using the funds to mobilize their ideology.  The letter does not specifically name any groups that Leo is threatening to withhold funding from. He added that the review of his funds was provoked by, in his opinion, the amount of his funds being put towards “ideation.” This letter was first reported by Axios.  It’s easy to dismiss many presidential candidates’ campaign promises as empty, because Congress would need to approve them. Tariffs are different. Presidents have vast powers to lob tariffs on friends and foes, as former President Donald Trump demonstrated when he waged a trade war starting in 2018. That’s why some experts are alarmed and baffled by Trump’s latest threat to use his favorite economic weapon. During a rally in battleground Wisconsin last weekend, Trump vowed to impose staggering tariffs on countries that snub the US dollar. The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency – essentially a super currency that helps international trade flow and the global economy to function. But Trump’s threat appears to be in response to China, Russia and other countries that have made noise about finding an alternative to the greenback. Taking a hardline on protecting the almighty dollar might sound good on the campaign trail, but experts warn that such a massive tariff would likely backfire on the American people. Read the full story. Taylor Swift’s call to encourage people to register to vote may be having an impact, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that provides government services. It was not immediately clear how many of those visitors registered to vote.  Vote.gov, which is the link Swift shared in her endorsement, is the federal government’s voting registration site run by the GSA. The website directs voters to their individual states and territories to register to vote and provides answers to frequently asked questions. Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. Vote.org also saw a huge spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement. A spokesperson for Vote.org told CNN there was a 585% jump in voters on the website between 9 p.m. through midnight ET, during the debate and shortly after Swift’s post endorsing the Harris-Walz campaign.  While voter engagement across the country likely increased also due to the debate, the CEO of Vote.org attributed the spike, in part, to the Taylor effect.  “Taylor Swift’s impact on voter engagement is undeniable,” Andrea Hailey, Vote.org CEO, said in a statement to CNN. New York’s highest court rejected two separate attempts to hear Donald Trump’s appeals on the gag order in his hush money case, according to a decision list posted Thursday. The gag order, issued by Judge Juan Merchan in the criminal case against Trump, remains in effect, although Merchan lifted portions of it in June. Trump’s attorneys had challenged both the initial gag order and the modified gag order. The judges wrote that they declined to hear the case about the modified gag order because “no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.” Trump’s legal team had no immediate comment. Trump was found guilty earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sentencing in the case has been delayed until late November. This is one of four criminal cases Trump faces while running again for president. A nearly four-year-old legal effort by Black voters to convince a court to prevent former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party from potentially intimidating voters and poll workers is quietly coming back to life as the 2024 election approaches. First brought in the days following the 2020 election, the lawsuit has moved slowly through the federal courts in Washington, DC, as Trump’s claims of presidential immunity from civil lawsuits were being litigated. It coincidently has landed before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge handling the federal election subversion charges against Trump. But now, the case is beginning to show signs of movement. The case could have enormous implications for this election and future ones: The voters are asking a federal judge to put Trump, his campaign and the Republican National Committee under court supervision that would require them to seek pre-approval before “engaging in any activities related to recounts, certifications, or similar post-election activities,” and to bar the defendants from intimidating voters, poll workers and other election officials. If the plaintiffs ultimately prevail, their victory could provide them with a significant deterrence against potential intimidation and harassment of election workers and voters from Republicans as Trump and his allies signal that they will again try to undermine the results of the election. Read the full story. The Trump campaign is up with a new ad in Pennsylvania warning voters that Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking, despite Kamala Harris’ recent statements to the contrary, seizing on a key issue in the battleground state. “Harris will ban all fracking,” the ad opens, over images of Harris’ high-profile interview with CNN earlier this month, her first sit-down as the new Democratic nominee. The ad proceeds to play a clip of Harris at a CNN Town Hall in 2019, taking a question from a voter. “That will immediately put tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians out of work and send utility bills skyrocketing,” the ad’s narrator says. “Trump will protect clean energy fracking and protect the jobs it creates.”  Harris was asked directly about her position on fracking at Tuesday’s debate, and she answered, “I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.” The new ad from the Trump campaign reflects the salience of the issue. Fracking is a major industry in Pennsylvania, the top battleground state this election cycle, drawing more campaign dollars than any other. And the debate over the industry’s economic and environmental impacts is one of several shaping the fierce contest in the commonwealth. This comes as the Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Trump. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served under Republican George W. Bush, told CNN News Central that he’s backing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris because he believes she is “most likely to be dedicated to trying to unite America. I don’t see that, that discipline, that willingness in Donald Trump.” Gonzales said he felt the need to come out publicly against Trump “because of his lack of, as we see it, his lack of support, lack of willingness to abide by the rule of law,” adding that he believes Harris has “demonstrated fidelity to the rule of law.” “I thought her performance during the convention was good. I thought her performance during the debate was outstanding, quite frankly,” he said. Gonzalez first announced his support for Harris earlier this morning in a Politico op-ed. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell – who warned about Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 – said she was “ecstatic” about Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump until she had a conversation with a local official back home.   “I was ecstatic like every other Democrat as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin,” she told Kasie Hunt of Harris on CNN This Morning.  The Michigan Democrat warned that polls showing Harris leading Trump in her home state, a key battleground, may not be accurate. “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” Dingell explained.  Election Day is less than two months away, and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule of campaign events today following their presidential debate. CNN poll of debate watchers found that registered voters who watched the presidential debate broadly agreed Harris outperformed Trump. Despite many saying that Harris won the showdown, the vice president still faces a tight race. Read fact checks and key takeaways from the night. Trump said he is still weighing whether to debate Harris again, while the Harris campaign said it is entering a more aggressive phase as it seeks to build on momentum following the presidential debate and mobilize voters in key battleground states.  Here’s more on the campaign: The Harris campaign on Wednesday released its first digital ad following the presidential debate featuring clips from her performance as it seeks to highlight the contrast with Donald Trump. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward,” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a news release from the campaign. The 30-second slot shows Trump on the debate stage in what the Harris campaign referred to as “thrashing” the country. “We’re a failing nation. A nation that is dying. We’re a nation that’s in serious decline,” Trump said. “What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do. We all have so much more in common than what separates us. And we can chart a new way forward,” Harris said.  The ad will air across digital platforms and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation. It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day. Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case. The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase. And her allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.” Read Collinson’s full analysis. The Harris campaign says it is entering a more aggressive phase as it seeks to build on momentum following the presidential debate and mobilize voters in key battleground states.  Today, Vice President Kamala Harris will kick off her “New Way Forward” tour through swing states, beginning with two rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. On Friday, Harris will hold events in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a state she has reiterated she needs to win in November. The campaign is expected to launch new TV and digital ads featuring key moments from the debate. The day after Harris’ performance, staffers spent hours poring through debate footage to identify key moments to highlight key issues among voters while offering a stark contrast between Trump. The campaign released its first digital ad yesterday featuring clips from her performance. The ad, titled “Leadership,” aims to emphasize Harris’ message to “chart a new way forward” and spotlights her commitment to bring “a sense of optimism about what we can do,” according to a press release from the campaign. More media dates: The vice president is expected to hold more media engagements in the coming days, including in local markets through swing states. It comes as she has faced mounting criticism for not holding more interviews. Next week, she will also participate in a discussion with journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris was unable to attend NABJ’s annual convention due to a prior obligation and opted to reschedule her speaking engagement. Top Harris surrogates will also have a robust schedule on the trail, with less than two months until Election Day. Today and tomorrow, Gov. Tim Walz will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, while Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff attends events in Arizona and Nevada. Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz will travel to Manchester, New Hampshire, and Maine to campaign, including headlining an Educators for Harris-Walz event and visiting a phone bank. The “New Way Forward” tour is also set to include surrogate events to target key voter groups today. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are back on the campaign trail today as they make their pitch to voters with less than two months until Election Day. Harris is heading to North Carolina and will attend two campaign rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro as she kicks off her “New Way Forward” tour through swing states. Trump is heading to Arizona, where he will deliver remarks in Tucson. The former president is also scheduled to attend a fundraising event in Los Angeles, California. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will travel to Michigan to hold a campaign event in Grand Rapids. As soon as Donald Trump exited the debate stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night, he immediately began quizzing those waiting in his viewing room about how the last 90 minutes had gone. While several praised him to his face, telling him he did a “great job,” that’s not what many of them are saying privately.  Instead, those around Trump have described what happened on stage as a draw at best and a loss at worst. Several of them told CNN they were stunned that the former president failed to do a better job executing on the talking points he had prepared against Vice President Harris, her record and her policy reversals.  Trump had done more debate prep ahead of his first meeting with Harris than he did for his debate with President Joe Biden earlier this summer, two people told CNN. Yet Trump didn’t make one of his central arguments against Harris — about why she hasn’t carried out the promises she’s making now in the last 3.5 years in office — until his closing argument, surprising many of them who have heard him make the argument in private and on the campaign trail.  Instead, one person conceded, Trump took the bait every single time Harris offered it. While multiple Trump allies described what happened Tuesday night as a “missed opportunity,” they have since started downplaying the debate’s overall significance, arguing it won’t shift his numbers with voters in states like Pennsylvania.  Trump himself was noncommittal about a second debate Wednesday morning, though almost every ally of his who CNN spoke with said they believe he will ultimately agree to one.  Voters and lawmakers are reacting to the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the countdown to Election Day continues in a very tight race. The two candidates came face-to-face for a second time this week at an event commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks yesterday. Here are the latest developments in the race: The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks, according to Nielsen data. Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia, hosted by ABC News, was aired across 17 television networks and easily surpassed the 51 million who tuned in to the June debate hosted by CNN between Trump and President Joe Biden.  While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year, it represents a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million and Fox News with more than 9 million. Former President Donald Trump said his team is still weighing whether he would engage in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, after her team immediately called for a second debate in October.  “I would do NBC. I would do FOX too, but right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do,” Trump said, after visiting the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department in Pennsylvania. “When you don’t win, it’s like a fighter — when a fighter has a bad fight gets knocked out or loses the fight, the first thing he says is we want a rematch. So, we won the debate according to every single poll, every single poll. Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” Trump said. “But we’ll think about it.” CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. As CNN reported this morning, a top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance. Trump said it was “very polite” between him and Harris Wednesday morning, who shook hands at the 9/11 commemoration ceremony. “Just, uh, very polite, very polite,” Trump said, when asked what he said to Harris."

Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played the role of former President Donald Trump in Kamala Harris’ debate preparations, celebrated the vice president’s performance at Tuesday’s debate while reflecting on how Trump has changed since his first presidential run eight years ago. Reines told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday that Harris was successful in carving out the space to remind viewers of Trump’s record while sharing her own plans for the next four years. Reines, who also played Trump in Hillary Clinton’s debate preparations in 2016, argued that that Trump’s messaging is now “all over the board” and described him as a “malfunctioning appliance.” Reines also gave insight that Harris initiating a handshake with Trump was “not a matter of rehearsal.” Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine weighed in on the false claims promoted by the Trump campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating family pets. Asked about the false claims during an interview with CBS on Wednesday DeWine said: “This is something that came up on the internet, and the internet can be quite crazy sometimes.” Former President Donald Trump repeated the false claim during Tuesday’s debate that had been amplified this week by right-wing media figures and echoed by Republican leaders.   “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump said. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country and it’s a shame.”  In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said: “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” As soon as Donald Trump exited the debate stage in Philadelphia Tuesday night, he immediately began quizzing those waiting in his viewing room about how the last 90 minutes had gone. While several praised him to his face, telling him he did a “great job,” that’s not what many of them are saying privately.

Trump himself was noncommittal about a second debate Wednesday morning, though almost every ally of his who CNN spoke with said they believe he will ultimately agree to one.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged in a Fox News interview Wednesday that while he believed former President Donald Trump won the debate, Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.”  Kennedy predicted the debate may cost Trump support in upcoming polls.  “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.” Kennedy, who dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed Trump, highlighted the exchange on economic policy as “an extraordinary lost opportunity” by the Republican nominee, arguing Trump should have emphasized more strongly the consequences of rising inflation but instead became “distracted.”  Kennedy predicted Trump will see a dip in support in post-debate polling, particularly among independent voters. He also undercut Trump’s claim that rapid reaction polls on the debate universally show he won the debate.  “Polling over the next week is going to show, you know, probably a slight drop in his support, particularly among independents,” he continued.  When asked if he had any reservations about endorsing Trump, Kennedy said he still believes Trump is the better candidate on policy.  “I was listening to the substance, and on the substance, President Trump wins,” he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday she was “proud” of Kamala Harris’ debate performance and hit back at Donald Trump, who name-checked her during Tuesday night’s debate over the January 6, 2021, insurrection. “I was so proud of her,” Pelosi said of Harris, adding that Trump “looked foolish last night. I thought [Harris] looked presidential.” Trump, during the debate, incorrectly claimed that then-Speaker Pelosi was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that she rejected his call to send in the National Guard. Pelosi pointed out Wednesday that the speaker of the House has no authority over the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president. She added that she pleaded with then-President Trump to send in the National Guard “and he never did, until finally he did hours later.” “We’re dependent on the president who has incited the insurrection and refused to send the National Guard,” she said, adding, “You know what? We don’t agonize, we organize. We just us have to win, we have to win big.” Voters and lawmakers are reacting to the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the countdown to Election Day continues in a very tight race. The two candidates came face-to-face for a second time this week at an event commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks Wednesday morning. Here are the key headlines to know: Several House Republicans defended former President Donald Trump’s performance in last night’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting that he was able to communicate his views on the economy, despite moving away from the issues at times. Conservative Rep. Ralph Norman accused the debate of being biased and told CNN’s Manu Raju that Harris did not have to meet high expectations. Norman also baselessly suggested that Harris possibly knew the questions that the moderators would ask ahead of time, but was unable to offer any evidence to back this up. “I think she knew the questions. I think she had her lines rehearsed, but the American people, whatever she says, they’re feeling it at the pump. They’re feeling it, you know, with crime, the policies haven’t worked, she’s been a part of it,” he said. Rep. Anthony D’Esposito a vulnerable New York Republican, praised Trump’s performance and said the former president “did a good job of talking about the issues that matter most to the American people, while Kamala Harris continued to pivot back and forth and spin what it is that she’s trying to portray now.” On the issue of abortion, Rep. John Duarte of California, another vulnerable Republican, argued that Trump “was clear that he wants abortion to be kept in the states,” and didn’t need to explicitly say he is against a national ban. Duarte also said that Trump, “did a great job communicating the economy, communicating inflation being so low under his presidency” and dismissed concerns that Trump focused too much on his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. “I don’t think that’s what voters are voting on. Voters are voting on inflation and opportunity right now, and right now, the American people are seeing out-of-control inflation and their opportunities are falling apart in the job market,” Duarte said. The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks, according to Nielsen data. Tuesday debate in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News and aired across 17 television networks easily surpassed the 51 million who tuned in to the June debate hosted by CNN between Trump and President Joe Biden.  While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year, it represents a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks.

ABC drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million and Fox News with more than 9 million. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to attend his first campaign event as a Trump surrogate since endorsing the former president last month, according to a news release from the Donald Trump-JD Vance campaign. Kennedy will appear with former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in a moderated discussion at a “Team Trump Reclaim America Tour” event in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. The White House is offering an explanation of a photo circulating that shows President Joe Biden wearing a Trump hat at the firehouse in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, earlier Wednesday. Inside the fire station, Biden briefly donned a Trump hat as an apparent gesture of bipartisan unity. A White House spokesperson said the president was talking about how the country was united in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks and said it needed to return to that. He handed a hat to a man wearing a Trump cap as a gesture, and that man gave Biden his hat to briefly wear, the spokesperson said. Pictures show Biden smiling widely while wearing the hat. Joan London knew when Tuesday’s debate began she would not vote for Donald Trump. But when it ended, she was in a most unfamiliar place: ready to cast her first vote for a Democrat for president. In battleground Pennsylvania, by the way. “Harris clearly won,” said London, an attorney who lives in conservative Berks County. “And I’m now voting for her even though I have many serious policy differences.” London became a Republican when she turned 18, a fan of Ronald Reagan’s brand of conservatism. Earlier this year, she cast a primary vote for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, then switched her registration to independent because she sees Trump as an angry populist. Until this week’s debate in Philadelphia, though, she planned to honor her conservative principles and write in some other Republican. But everything changed when the former president repeatedly refused to say he believed it was critical that the United States stand with Ukraine. Trump said he wanted to end the war, and suggested he could negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine. Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, gave Harris more positive reviews for her debate performance. Several though, significantly, said she was not specific enough in explaining her policy proposals. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, a Haley primary voter who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues. Cynthia Sabatini, a Reagan Republican and “never Trump” voter, plans to write in a conservative or vote third party unless Harris wins her over. The vice president did not do so Tuesday night. “She is a good debater,” Sabatini said. “But in my opinion, she needs to answer questions on point.” Specifically, Sabatini said Harris failed out of the gate when asked whether she believed Americans are better off than they were four years ago and again on questions about the border. Read more about what voters had to say about the debate. Taylor Swift’s call to encourage people to register to vote may be having an impact, according to the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency that provides government services. It was not immediately clear how many of those visitors registered to vote.  Vote.gov, which is the link Swift shared in her endorsement, is the federal government’s voting registration site run by the GSA. The website directs voters to their individual states and territories to register to vote and provides answers to frequently asked questions. Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post on Tuesday night, Vote.org also saw a huge spike in engagement around the debate and Swift’s endorsement. A spokesperson for Vote.org told CNN there was a 585% jump in voters on the website between 9 p.m. through midnight ET, during the debate and shortly after Swift’s post endorsing the Harris-Walz campaign.  While voter engagement across the country likely increased also due to the debate, the CEO of Vote.org attributed the spike, in part, to the Taylor effect.  “Taylor Swift’s impact on voter engagement is undeniable,” Andrea Hailey, Vote.org CEO, said in a statement to CNN. The post was updated with more details on the reaction from Vote.org Democratic Sen. Chris Coons praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance in last night’s debate, noting that she was up against a “uniquely difficult” opponent in former President Donald Trump. Asked whether the debate moved the needle at all for voters, Coons argued that it did by mobilizing Harris’ supporters and possibly swaying some undecided voters. “I also think it will move what is a very small number of unpersuaded voters, or voters who’ve gone back and forth,” he said. The senator from Delaware also criticized Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets. “That was a misleading story that had, I would argue, ill intent, that had already been debunked, and was deployed almost on cue by Donald Trump to make what was a fairly vicious anti-migrant slur,” Coons said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a cognitive test to be given to Donald Trump, saying his debate performance Tuesday night left him doubting the former president’s mental acuity. Jeffries pointed to Trump’s echoing of false claims that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating residents’ pet dogs and cats. “It was hard to follow some elements of the debate when the Republican nominee is making up stories about people eating cats and dogs. You can’t make this stuff up,” Jeffries said. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance dismissed the impact of Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Vice President Harris, arguing she is a billionaire and is “fundamentally disconnected” from the interests and problems of most Americans.   “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift. When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country,” Vance told Fox News.  Swift signed her endorsement as “Childless Cat Lady,” in obvious reference to Vance’s controversial past comments. Vance said his pitch to women voters is that former president Trump will return public safety and an affordable cost of living. “Donald Trump delivered policies that lower the prices of groceries, lower the prices of housing, and most importantly, Donald Trump delivered public safety in our country,” Vance said.  As the vice presidential debate approaches in October, Vance said he is aiming to be “as well-versed in the policy” as possible. “The way that I think about this is it’s an opportunity,” Vance said. “I get 90 minutes to talk to the American people about how Donald Trump can make their lives better.”  “We’re going to talk about a lot of policy. I’m trying to read and just understand as much as possible, you know, what Tim Walz has done, what policies he supported, and how it’s so different from the prosperity and peace that Donald Trump delivered,” Vance said.  A new ad launched by the Trump campaign on Wednesday features clips of Kamala Harris’ high-profile interview with CNN earlier this month, while slamming the vice president and the Biden administration over inflation. The ad opens with a clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working” — a soundbite frequently referenced in pro-Trump ads — and proceeds to clips of news coverage about inflation, including one from Harris’ CNN interview, in which she is pressed on the cost of living. “When it comes to the economy, groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president,” CNN’s Dana Bash says in the interview clip. The ad’s narrator picks up, “Yet, Harris still says Bidenomics is working. No, it isn’t.” The economy and inflation have been a major point of attack for Trump and his Republican allies, in addition to their emphasis on immigration and crime. Several of the most recent ads from the Trump campaign have focused on prices, including one saying that “Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote that created America’s inflation,” a reference to the party-line vote on the Inflation Reduction Act. The new ad began airing this afternoon in Georgia, and the Trump campaign’s quick deployment of soundbites from Harris’ first major interview since becoming the Democratic nominee underscores the Harris campaign’s cautious approach to press availability, another point of criticism from Republicans.  Former President Donald Trump said his team is still weighing whether he would engage in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, after her team immediately called for a second debate in October.  “I would do NBC. I would do FOX too, but right now, we have to determine whether or not we even want to do,” Trump said, after visiting the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department in Pennsylvania. “When you don’t win, it’s like a fighter—when a fighter has a bad fight gets knocked out or loses the fight, the first thing he says is we want a rematch. So, we won the debate according to every single poll, every single poll. Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” Trump said. “But we’ll think about it.” CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. As CNN reported this morning, a top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance. Trump said it was “very polite” between him and Harris this morning, who shook hands at the 9/11 commemoration ceremony. “Just, uh, very polite, very polite,” Trump said, when asked what he said to Harris. Several senior Senate Republicans gave former President Donald Trump poor marks for his debate performance last night. Here’s what they said: Others were more critical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz participated in a day of service commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in St. Paul on Wednesday, where he spoke pridefully about Minnesotans coming together in the wake of the tragedy, greeted volunteers and packed donation boxes.   Appearing in his official capacity as Minnesota governor, Kamala Harris’ running mate recalled learning about the attacks on the morning of September 11 in a classroom at Mankato West High School, where Walz taught before entering politics. He said he remembers experiencing “that moment of disbelief” and watching “young faces try and comprehend the horror that was in front of them.” He also reflected positively on the state responding to the tragedy by coming together as a community.  Walz’s remarks were followed by brief remarks from Cindy McGinty, whose husband died in the World Trade Center on September 11 and helped organize a national day of service commemorating the day. Walz then sealed packages of oatmeal and helped put them in boxes to be donated as part of the day of service. Harris, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance are also commemorating the anniversary of the attacks today. All four leaders were in New York on Wednesday for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan. Kamala Harris campaign aides huddled at their Wilmington headquarters Wednesday in the immediate aftermath of the first Harris-Donald Trump debate Tuesday night, strategizing over how best to capitalize on the momentum they felt after the primetime face-off.  But despite the vice president’s team feeling pleased with how the debate went last night – both in terms of what they saw as a strong performance from Harris as well as Trump losing his composure at multiple points – the Harris campaign is emphatic that the debate did not change the trajectory of the race.  Multiple aides tell CNN that post-debate discussions in Wilmington continue to center around the core assumption that Election Day will be extremely close, and that the hardest work remains ahead of them in the weeks to come.   Another aide said from here on out until November, the campaign will continue to operate as though the Harris-Trump race is a 50-50 race.  As for Tuesday night’s debate, the campaign is plotting ways to amplify Trump’s answers that they believed were most substantively problematic. Those answers, aides said, include the former president’s refusal to take a position on a national abortion ban as well as his comments on the January 6 riot. After receiving Taylor Swift’s endorsement Tuesday night, the Kamala Harris campaign quickly began selling “Harris-Walz friendship bracelets” in tribute to the mega star.  Those bracelets have quickly sold out, aides tell CNN. The campaign store page for the “pack of two adjustable, waterproof bracelets with clay beads” — going for $20 each — currently displays a message that the bracelets have in fact sold out.  The campaign says it is taking pre-orders with the next expected release date of September 24. More on Swift’s endorsement: Shortly after Trump’s debate with Harris, Swift wrote on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” she said. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Trump reaction: The Trump campaign responded to Swift’s endorsement of Harris, saying that it is “more evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite.” “President Trump will fight for the American worker, the struggling family who can’t afford groceries and gas, and the angel families who have lost loved ones due to Kamala’s open border policy. Taylor Swift may not understand those problems but President Trump does,” campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. This post has been updated with reactions from the Trump campaign. The top election officials from six states testified Wednesday on Capitol Hill about efforts torun a clean and fair election, as some of the first ballots for the 2024 presidential election are being mailed out.  The six officials – three Republicans and three Democrats – stressed that the election season is already in full swing, with tens of millions of voters expected to cast early ballots before Election Day in November.  But sharp partisan divides were also on full display. Some Republicans raised fears about widespread voting by non-citizens, even though that doesn’t happen in US elections. And Democrats blamed former President Donald Trump for threatening the safety of election workers by peddling the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, acknowledged that it’s “rare” for non-citizens to cast ballots — a break from Trump and other right-wing influencers like Elon Musk, who claim this phenomenon is swamping the country, and have used this lie to question the legitimacy of the 2024 results before any ballots have even been cast.  LaRose said his office caught about 600 instances last year of non-citizens registering to vote, in a state where nearly 6 million people voted in the 2020 presidential race.   Prodded by GOP lawmakers, the Democratic election officials agreed that non-citizens and undocumented immigrants shouldn’t vote in federal elections. They pointed out that this is already illegal, it happens rarely, and it is easily caught because of the extensive paper trail in voter registration.  Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, accused Republicans of spreading “paranoia around a fake problem.” He said that in his time as an election official, he has seen how these attempts to stop non-citizens from voting actually end up disenfranchising thousands of eligible voters.  “I take no pride in the idea that we have denied eligible citizens the right to vote, in far greater numbers than we would have prevented the vanishingly rare non-citizen voting is alleged to be happening across the United States of America,” Fontes said.  It’s not one election, but 51, that pick the US president. Every state and the District of Columbia has its own rules and deadlines for voting and for counting votes. The first voting officially was already supposed to be underway with mail-in ballots in the key state of North Carolina, but that process was delayed by courts that ruled ballots must be reprinted without the option of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Absentee ballots are now officially available in Alabama, although, somewhat ironically, it is a state that discourages early voting. Others will follow in the weeks to come. When do voting by mail and early voting start? Most states will not offer mail-in ballots until later in September or October. The next firm date on the calendar is September 19, when ballots are supposed to be available in the key state of Wisconsin. For all states, ballots must begin to be sent to military and overseas voters by September 21. Each state has its own rules and deadlines for how and when to request a mail-in ballot and by when those ballots must be returned. In some states, mail ballots must be in the hands of election officials before polls close, but others will count ballots that arrive after Election Day if they were postmarked earlier. Washington, for instance, is one of the handful of states that conducts nearly all of its voting entirely by mail and will accept a mail-in ballot until results are certified in late November so long as it is postmarked by Election Day. Early voting may also be done in person in most states, but that process does not get underway until later in September. Widespread early voting will begin on September 20 in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia. For specifics on your state, visit CNN’s Voter Handbook, which has the dates for every state.

Several Senate Democrats expressed concern about the tightness of the presidential race, despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ performance in Tuesday night’s debate. He added, “The electoral college/popular mismatch is getting more significant, rather than less significant,” noting that the swing states are “all very, very close,” and said that they have to win by a large enough margin that they can easily dismiss claims by former president Donald Trump that the election is rigged. “You want to win big to overcome the electoral college effect. You want to win big so that every reasonable person knows you won, and his lonely complaints about, that he should have won are really just lonely,” said Kaine. Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, also said that he is concerned about the closeness of the race. “This race is going to come down to, you know, just a few 1,000 votes probably,” he said. “Everybody is all hands-on deck. Everybody is. We have a campaign that’s not taking any vote for granted,” he added. What the latest polling shows: Harris averages 49% support across recent polls while Trump stands at 48%, according to the latest CNN Poll of Polls. That average suggests no clear leader in the race just eight weeks until Election Day. The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the six most recent non-partisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards and ask about a 2024 presidential general election between Harris and Trump. Meanwhile, CNN polls across six battlegrounds found Georgia and Pennsylvania are key toss-ups. Senate Republican Whip John Thune said on Wednesday it would be “prudent” for Donald Trump to talk about the future and not continue to say that the 2020 election was stolen, a baseless fraud claim that the former president repeated in the presidential debate Tuesday.  Asked if Trump took Harris’s bait during the debate, such as when she challenged the size of Trump’s rallies, Thune downplayed the impact the debate will have on voters.   “I just think the debate isn’t going to change much and she still has to answer for her record,” he said. Thune said he and most Senate Republicans support Ukraine in in its war with Russia when he was asked about Trump’s refusal to say if Ukraine should win. “My position is that we want Ukraine to win the war. For sure. I will let him speak for his position but we had 32 out of 49 Republicans who voted to support Ukraine in their efforts to defeat the Russians,” he said. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, a former GOP presidential nominee himself, said he’s concerned that former President Donald Trump refused to say that Ukraine should win the war against Russia during Tuesday night’s presidential debate. Romney also said that he doesn’t think the debate will move the needle. “There are a few exceptions to that, but in last night’s debate I thought President Trump prosecuted his case as he wanted to. I think the Vice President was able to demonstrate that people’s questions about could she answer questions from the media or not, those were answered well. She spoke well and clearly, and I think she prosecuted her case as well,” he told CNN. Romney, a frequent critic of Trump, called the debate a “classic President Trump performance,” and added that Harris was able to introduce herself to the American people. “Most people didn’t know her terribly well, other than a few clips that that were not flattering that you might see on the internet,” said Romney. “And people saw, ‘Oh, actually, she’s an intelligent, capable person who has a point of view on issues,’ and she demonstrated that time and again.” The Utah Republican said it was “no surprise” that the baseless claims about Haitian migrants eating pets came from Trump, adding that the former president should “just stick to the issues.” Several Republicans refused to discuss the debate, including Sen. Todd Young, who has refused to back Trump. “I’ll talk to you after the election,” he said. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance visited firefighters at Engine Company 4 Ladder Company 15 in New York City, where they stayed for about 45 minutes. They came to the station after the 9/11 commemoration ceremony held at Ground Zero.  Trump and Vance moved their way through the station, shaking hands, taking pictures and visiting with people. They all took a group photo with Trump and Vance standing in the middle with a large FDNY sign behind them. Trump waved to reporters across the street. He raised his fist and gave a thumbs up.  Five Danish firefighters were at the fire station “to show some respect for the firefighters,” Kasper Hinge said. “The first thing he said was who are these good-looking guys or good-looking gentlemen,” Hinge, one of the firefighters told CNN about their interaction with Trump. “Then we told him that we were firefighters from Denmark and he looked me in the eyes and said, ‘oh, your country has other problems,’” he said. “Then he left, and I’m not sure what he meant about it.” Hinge said he was a little starstruck by Trump’s visit but “we’re not that much into American politicians.” Asked if they believe foreign leaders are laughing at Trump, as Vice President Harris said during the debate on Tuesday night, another firefighter said, “Some might.” Specifically in Denmark, another said, “I don’t think so, because you know it’s one of the most powerful people in the world.” Vance departed about 10 minutes before Trump, who stayed and talked with more people.  Right-wing activist Laura Loomer stood outside on the side of the fire station with Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. She was seen getting off the Trump plane in Philadelphia Tuesday before the debate. This post has been updated with details from the Danish firefighters. Voting for the 2024 general election officially begins today as absentee ballots start going out in Alabama.  Eligible voters can also now request and cast an absentee ballot in person.  In Alabama, voters must have a valid excuse to vote absentee (either by mail or in person) so a relatively small number of ballots are cast that way.  The voting season was supposed to start last Friday with mail ballots going out in North Carolina, but that process is delayed as the state reprints ballots after the state supreme court ruled officials must remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name. Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in a virtual coin toss before their presidential debate – but that’s about all he won. From the opening moments Tuesday night, when the vice president strode over to Trump’s podium and all but forced him to shake her hand, she dictated the terms of their critical clash exactly eight weeks before Election Day. From Harris’ point of view, the night could hardly have gone better. She came across as fresh and energetic and brimmed with a positive future vision. Trump glowered and ranted and blasted America as a failing nation and seemed off his game. The vice president, who has sometimes struggled in spontaneous situations, delivered the most imposing performance of her political career. Trump, who had gone into the debate predicting he’d prove boxing champ Mike Tyson’s maxim that “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,” was himself stunned by multiple jabs and landed few in return. At a time when nearly a third of voters suggested in one recent poll that they wanted to know more about Harris, the vice president’s performance seemed more likely to expand her coalition. Trump, meanwhile, didn’t make much effort to change perceptions about his dystopian intentions among the key swing state voters who will decide the election. While it’s too early to say whether Harris’ performance will translate into new momentum, her campaign will be optimistic that she’s improved her chances among, perhaps, 200,000 movable voters who will decide the next election in a handful of states. Read the full analysis. Oil prices are near three-year lows. Gas prices are sinking below $3 in many parts of America. So why were Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump talking so much about expanding oil production during Tuesday night’s debate? Harris, criticized for her previous stance against fracking, noted that she represented the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to open new fracking leases in 2022. Though Harris also repeatedly touted her support for clean energy solutions, she correctly acknowledged that under the Biden administration, the United States has been producing more oil than any country has in history. Meanwhile, Trump, who supports a rapid expansion of oil production, attacked Harris for policy proposals that he said would decimate America’s fossil fuel business: “If she won the election, the day after that election, they’ll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead. Fossil fuel will be dead,” Trump said. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN in a phone interview on Wednesday that he’s “not at all concerned” about the fossil fuel industry getting destroyed because Americans still rely on oil for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. For all the candidates’ talk of promoting fossil fuel production, it’s not clear that America needs drastically more oil. (And climate scientists say that’s the exact opposite of what the planet needs). US crude prices settled below $66 a barrel Tuesday, their lowest level since December 2021, before bouncing back a bit Wednesday. Gas prices are at a six-month low, according to AAA. Meanwhile, OPEC+, a group of major oil-producing nations, is so worried about excessive supply and weak demand in China that it delayed plans to ramp up production. US oil production has already spiked to a record of 13.4 million barrels per day, according to weekly federal data. Lipow said it would be “difficult” to get US output dramatically above 14 million barrels per day because all of the most efficient and cheapest places have already been drilled. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, is also skeptical that US output can spike. “As a rule, the president doesn’t have the power to quickly ramp up US oil production. The industry operates all out,” said McNally, who served as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush. After closing statements, former President Donald Trump spoke for about 42 minutes and 52 seconds, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for about 37 minutes and 36 seconds. While the debate was designed to offer both candidates an equal chance to respond to questions, they could choose not to use the maximum allotted time. The moderators also allowed more time for responses after some exchanges. Here’s how long each candidate used: Watch CNN’s Daniel Dale fact-check claims made by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during an ABC News presidential debate. Winning a debate hardly guarantees winning an election, but North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he believes Kamala Harris will move the needle in his battleground state after her strong showing in Philadelphia. The vice president’s answers on protecting abortion rights and health care, Cooper said, could be key to bolstering Democratic efforts to deliver the state in a presidential race for the first time since 2008.  “She was really strong on health care,” Cooper told CNN after the debate. “Donald Trump would take it all away, don’t let him fool you.” Cooper, who has known Harris for nearly two decades, said he was surprised Trump took the bait on the size of his crowds and more. “For sure,” Cooper said. “I think she knew that this was a vulnerability of his, but to just become completely unraveled, unhinged and incoherent shows why he should not be president of the United States.” Former President Donald Trump laid into ABC News on Wednesday morning after his rocky debate performance, stating the network should have its broadcast license revoked. ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump throughout Tuesday night’s presidential debate, quickly correcting the record for millions watching at home after the Republican pushed falsehoods on abortion, migrants and the 2020 election. “It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be because when you looked the fact they were correcting everything and not correcting with her,” Trump said Wednesday. The former president also suggested, without evidence, that Vice President Kamala Harris was provided the debate questions in advance. Trump ultimately delivered more than 30 false claims during the debate, CNN’s preliminary count found, while Harris shared just one false claim, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt called last night’s debate “a big success for President Trump.” Leavitt deferred to Trump when asked about the potential for more debates, telling CNN News Central host John Berman, “all of the debates that we have announced on this campaign — and there have been many of them — have come from President Trump directly, so I will let him make an announcement on this front.” “I haven’t talked to the president since he made those remarks,” she said. Leavitt rejected a suggestion from Berman that Vice President Kamala Harris got under Trump’s skin during the debate, saying, “I don’t think that happened at all.” She criticized the ABC News debate moderators, as the former president and other campaign surrogates have done since last night. When asked about Trump’s assertion that he will produce a health care plan “in the not too distant future,” Leavitt said, “I don’t have a date for you this morning, but I’ll definitely get back to you with one as soon as I can.” She later added that Trump’s plan is based on the “free market” in contrast to “Kamala Harris’ radical healthcare plan,” which she called “socialism.” Philippe Reines, the former Hillary Clinton aide who portrayed former President Donald Trump during debate prep with Kamala Harris, shared a photo of his costume and make-up from the run throughs. In the picture, he wears a long red tie and a full face of bronzer, keeping with his method-acting style of debate prep.  In a tweet, he wrote that it was time for a “facial,” a “haircut” and a “spiritual cleanse.” Can I vote early? What deadlines should I know about? Do I need to show an ID? Voters will soon start casting ballots for the 2024 presidential election as in-person, early voting is set to begin in several states later this month.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off on facts, dueled on policy and traded barbs during the presidential debate hosted by ABC News on Tuesday, in which Trump also veered off on a tangent about immigrants eating pets. Here are 27 quotes to understand what happened during their showdown in Philadelphia: This comes from the middle of the debate, but it is perhaps the most important line because this debate was, in every possible way, different than the one between Trump and President Joe Biden in June. That debate eventually ended Biden’s reelection campaign. This one gave Harris an opportunity to laugh at Trump, tell him he was weak and get under his skin in multiple ways. He’s talking here about Harris’ “opportunity economy” plan, but it is a line, replete with insult, that expresses Trump’s theme for the night – which was to tie Harris to Biden and also make her appear to be too willing to change her policy proposals. Read 25 more quotes from the debate here. Vice President Kamala Harris has condemned the killing of American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was killed at a protest last week in the occupied West Bank, and offered sharp rhetoric aimed at the Israel Defense Forces. Harris called Eygi’s death a “horrific tragedy that never should have happened.” Harris also called for “full accountability.” CNN has asked Harris’ office if she plans to reach out to her family. Earlier on Wednesday, President Joe Biden also said he was “outraged” by Eygi’s death and said Israel must “do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.” Harris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe offered a roadmap of some of the key moments from former President Donald Trump at Tuesday’s debate that the Harris team plans to harness in the days ahead.  Those moments include Trump’s comments on healthcare: On abortion: Trump recently said he would not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida, where abortion is now illegal in most cases after six weeks. The ballot measure that Florida voters will take up this fall would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy. And on Ukraine: Plouffe told CNN’s John Berman that those are “three key moments we’ll see a lot about in the coming days and weeks.” Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris shook hands after arriving for the 9/11 memorial ceremony on Wednesday morning. The handshake comes in the wake of the two presidential candidates meeting face-to-face for the first time last night at ABC News’ historic presidential debate, where they traded barbs over inflation, abortion, immigration and foreign policy. The two shook hands last night at the debate, too. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have arrived at Ground Zero, according to pool reporters. Biden and Harris will honor the solemn 9/11 terror attacks anniversary at each of the 9/11 memorial sites today and are not expected to deliver formal remarks, but will interact with families of the fallen. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance arrived at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, where they are attending the 9/11 commemoration ceremony at Ground Zero.  Trump will also travel to Shanksville later today, according to a source familiar with his plans. Wall Street sure is acting like Donald Trump lost the debate Tuesday night. Investors swiftly penalized Trump’s social media business following the former president’s widely panned debate performance. Other so-called Trump trades, including bitcoin and Coinbase, went into reverse Wednesday, while bonds and Asian currencies rallied. And some funds that own solar and other clean energy stocks rose sharply. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plunged 10% in premarket trading Wednesday, leaving them on pace to open at the lowest level since the Truth Social owner went public in late March. The sharp selloff represents an immediate reaction to the ABC presidential debate, where Vice President Kamala Harris successfully threw Trump off his game. It’s the exact opposite of the reaction in Trump Media’s share price on June 28 after President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance in the CNN debate. Trump Media initially spiked 10% that day, before fizzling and ending in the red. ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Donald Trump during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, quickly correcting the record for millions watching at home after the Republican pushed falsehoods on abortion, migrants and the 2020 election. The decision to live fact-check the candidates during the high-stakes telecast marked a departure from recent debates and stood in contrast to the first presidential matchup of the 2024 season, hosted by CNN and moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. During the June debate, the moderators did not correct false claims made by Trump and President Joe Biden. Instead, the network provided a fact check online and on television following the telecast.  Ahead of Tuesday night’s debate in Philadelphia, ABC News did not commit to live fact-checking, but as the event got underway both anchors stepped in to debunk false claims made by Trump on at least three occasions.  Roughly 20 minutes into the debate, the former president claimed Democrats have advocated for abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy or were in favor of “executing” babies “after birth,” pushing a notorious and often-repeated false claim. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, has said “execution after birth is OK,” Trump falsely claimed. Moderator Linsey Davis immediately corrected the record on the abortion issue. “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,” she said. Later in the debate, Trump falsely claimed migrants in Ohio were killing pets and eating them, repeating a debunked claim that had been amplified this week by right-wing media figures and echoed by Republican leaders.  “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” Trump said. “The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country and it’s a shame.” Muir quickly corrected Trump on the claim. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he didn’t know if he wanted to debate Vice President Kamala Harris again as he claimed he “won the debate.” Trump said if Fox News were to moderate a debate, he “wouldn’t want” Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier as moderators because he didn’t think “were good last night,” as he apparently referenced their on-air reactions to his and Harris’ debate.  Trump had previously agreed to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News with MacCallum and Baier moderating. Harris had not accepted that invitation from Fox.  “I wouldn’t want to have Martha and Bret. I’d love to have somebody else other than Martha and Bret. I’d love to have, frankly, Sean [Hannity] or Jesse [Watters] or Laura [Ingraham], you know, somebody else. Let’s give other people a shot,” he said. Trump baselessly suggested Harris was provided the questions in advance of the ABC presidential debate as he claimed the debate was “rigged.” “They had a rigged show with somebody that maybe even had the answers, I mean, I’ll be honest, I watched her talk, and I said, you know, she seems awfully familiar with the questions,” Trump said.  Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday cast Taylor Swift as a “very liberal person” who “seems to always endorse a Democrat” after the music superstar said she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Shortly after Trump’s debate with Harris Tuesday evening, Swift wrote on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” she said. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller repeatedly stressed that Donald Trump has already committed to additional presidential debates but refused to definitively say whether the Republican nominee would participate with NBC News on September 25 – instead arguing that the “onus” is on Kamala Harris to “quit playing games” and “she won’t show up.” “I thought this was a bit perplexing because President Trump has already said that he is going to do three debates,” Miller told Kasie Hunt on CNN This Morning. “We had the September 4 debate, which was going to be on Fox, and Kamala Harris was a no show. We had last night. And President Trump already said that on September 25, we would do a debate on NBC.” He continued, “But now Kamala Harris seems to have memory holed that and rather than just saying, we’ll see you on September 25 on NBC, is now throwing out some fictional day in October.” “So very clearly, we’re going to have to go back to the drawing board,” Miller added. The Trump campaign senior adviser argued that the Harris campaign is calling for another debate because the Democratic nominee did not effectively break from President Joe Biden or explain why she hasn’t achieved her legislative goals over the past three and a half years she has been in office. Pressed on Trump’s decision to stand by a baseless conspiracy about Haitian migrants eating pets at last night’s debate, Miller pointed viewers to “Federalist.com” for proof and argued that it was “three-on-one” – Harris and the ABC News debate moderators versus Trump. Under the rules of Tuesday’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the candidates’ microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak. The pool reporter in the debate hall in Philadelphia was able to hear some of what was said when their mics were muted. When Trump claimed that Democrats want abortion access in the ninth month, Harris said, “That’s not true.” When Trump said he was a leader on in vitro fertilization, Harris said, “You have not.” When Trump made the debunked claim about migrants in Ohio eating pets, Harris responded: “What? That is unbelievable.” When Harris said Trump “doesn’t have a plan for you,” the former president responded: “That’s just a soundbite. They gave her that to say.” A top Harris campaign official declined to say whether Vice President Kamala Harris would agree to a second September 25 presidential debate on NBC following Tuesday’s performance.  Pressed by Hunt on whether she was willing to debate in October but not September, Fulks said that the “two campaigns are going to have to agree on a date,” declining to commit.  He said that a second debate would “absolutely” allow Harris to continue to introduce herself to voters, but suggested that she is doing that in battleground states as she kicks off another tour.  Harris, he added, is “going to be out and about doing interviews.” “We know that that is a part, and we want to make sure that we are speaking to the press. But look – we have 50-something days here. Our priority has to be the American voters… And over the next several weeks, we have to campaign,” he said.  Moments after Tuesday night’s debate ended, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon issued a statement calling for “a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?” Fulks said the campaign is “honored” to have Taylor Swift’s endorsement.  “We’re honored that somebody who has a platform like that would use their voice to speak out on that,” he said. Registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate are closely divided over which candidate better understands the problems facing people like them, according to a CNN poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, with 44% saying Harris does and 40% picking Trump.  That marks a shift in Harris’ favor from prior to the debate, when 43% said Trump had a better understanding of their problems while 39% said Harris did.  But voters who tuned in give Trump a 20-point advantage over Harris after the debate on handling the economy, 55% to 35% – a margin that’s slightly wider than before they took the stage in Philadelphia. The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 6 points likelier to be Republican-aligned than Democratic-aligned, making for an audience that’s about 4 percentage points more GOP-leaning than all registered voters nationally. An 82% majority of registered voters who watched Tuesday’s debate say it didn’t affect their choice for president. Another 14% said it made them reconsider but didn’t change their minds, with 4% saying it changed their minds about whom to vote for. Debate watchers who supported Trump prior to Tuesday night were modestly more likely than those who supported Harris to say the debate had left them reconsidering. Methodology: The CNN poll was conducted by text message with 605 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Tuesday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the debate and were selected via a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of debate watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points. Taylor Swift has said she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Read the full story. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks today with visits to each of the three sites that were hit. Harris will join Biden for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan this morning. The duo will then travel to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Flight 93 memorial. Later in the afternoon, they will travel to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, for another wreath-laying ceremony. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, are scheduled to appear at Ground Zero, too. Trump will also travel to Shanksville today, according to a source familiar with his plans. It’s unclear whether the two parties will cross paths. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president, will also attend an event to commemorate the anniversary. His office did not say where the event will take place. Most voters in a CNN focus group in Erie, Pennsylvania, say they thought Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential debate on Tuesday. The group of 13 voters had not yet decided on who to vote for before the debate. When CNN’s Phil Mattingly asked the group who won the debate, eight voters said Harris won the showdown. Mattingly noted that Erie is “the swingiest county” in the battleground state. One voter said Harris was “more optimistic” and “more respectful” and could describe her plans more effectively. But another voter, who said she felt Donald Trump won the debate, said she thought the former president is the candidate that could improve things like inflation and the economy. One critical moment of the debate the voters reacted to was when Trump and Harris debated about abortion rights. One voter responded positively to Harris’ answer because the vice president’s “impassioned response” resonated with her. She said she still had a favorable reaction to the moment even though she said she doesn’t agree with all of the vice president’s positions on the issue. Another voter said that although she also doesn’t agree with Harris’ stance on abortion, she thought it was “nice to see the passion and believability that she stands behind and then have something to gauge more of what she says on since she hasn’t spoken a lot, solidly about a lot of issues.” On Trump’s strongest moment, one voter, who is a veteran, said he felt like the former president’s remarks about the Afghanistan withdrawal were strong. Kamala Harris on Tuesday night baited Donald Trump for nearly all of the 1 hour and 45 minutes of their first and potentially only debate — and the former president took every bit of it. The vice president had prepared extensively for their debate, and peppered nearly every answer with a comment designed to enrage the former president. Trump was often out of control. He loudly and repeatedly insisted that a whole host of falsehoods were true. The former president repeated lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. He parroted a conspiracy theory about immigrants eating pets, and lied about Democrats supporting abortions after babies are born – which is murder, and illegal everywhere. Here are some takeaways from the debate: A turning point when Harris jabs Trump over the size of his rally crowds: Harris came onstage with a clear plan: Throw Trump off his game. It was, by any measure, a dramatic success. When the vice president mentioned Trump’s criminal conviction and outstanding legal issues, he bit. When she called him out for sinking a bipartisan immigration bill, he bit harder. And when Harris suggested Trump’s rallies were boring, he nearly choked on the bait. Rather than engage on the issues raised by the moderators, including a few that Trump considers some of his political strengths, the former president went on at length about the entertainment value of his rallies, claims the Biden administration was legally targeting him and, in a long, bizarre spell, insisted – against all available evidence, that migrants were eating Americans’ pets. Trump indulges in conspiracy theories: Despite signals from even his running mate, Trump did not refrain from repeating the conspiracy theory du jour during the debate. The former president brought up the unfounded conspiracy theory that migrants from Haiti living in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people’s cats and dogs. He said at one point that “in Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of people who live there.” When ABC moderator David Muir pointed out that city officials have denied any evidence that migrants in Springfield were eating pets, Trump doubled down, saying that “the people on television” were saying it. When pressed, Trump just said, “We’ll find out.” When the debate moved to crime, Trump claimed that crime was up in the United States contrary to the rest of the world. There too Muir pointed out that, according to FBI data, crime had declined in the past few years. Fierce argument over abortion, a key issue for both candidates: The vice president, who has long been one the administration’s strongest surrogates on reproductive rights, was able to respond to the former president’s defense of his abortion policy in a way Joe Biden was not. The former president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court judges who voted to overturn federal abortion protections, has sought to moderate his stance on the issue by criticizing six-week abortion bans and reiterating his support for exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But he has also defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Read more takeaways from Harris and Trump’s first debate."
"67 million watched first Harris-Trump debate, blowing past Biden matchup | CNN Business","Updated 9:54 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T23:15:07.922Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/media/debate-ratings-abc-trump-harris-2024-election/index.html,"The first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump drew an estimated 67.1 million viewers across 17 television networks — blowing well past the 51 million who watched the Republican nominee take on President Joe Biden in June. Tuesday night’s 90-minute matchup in Philadelphia hosted by ABC marked the first time Harris and Trump had met face-to-face, resulting in a high-stakes clash over abortion, immigration and the 2020 election results. Interest in the new Democratic candidate and how she would fare against the former president helped boost interest in the telecast. The viewership easily surpassed the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden hosted by CNN, a face-off that ultimately led to Biden’s withdrawal from the race and Harris’ ascendancy. While Tuesday’s debate drew the largest television audience of the year for a non-sports event, it represented a drop in total audience from 2020, when more than 73 million people watched the first debate between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016, a record 84 million tuned in to the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump. Viewership habits have changed dramatically since 2016, and Nielsen does not account for the myriad streaming and social media platforms that many also used to watch Tuesday’s debate. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. ABC, which hosted the debate, drew the most viewers with more than 19 million people tuning in, followed by NBC with more than 10 million, and Fox News with more than 9 million. The debate was the most-watched on any network in at least 16 years with more than 7 million tuning in on the various Disney-owned streaming platforms, ABC said. While the presidential debates have for decades been held by the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, the candidates bucked tradition this year, agreeing to debates held directly by television news outlets. During Tuesday night’s debate, moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump in real-time, correcting the record at least three times as millions watched at home, drawing fierce backlash from Trump and his allies. Following the broadcast, Trump assailed the network over the fact-checks, calling ABC “the most dishonest news organization, and that’s saying a lot.” The former president, who made at least 33 false claims during the debate, repeatedly insisted the event “was three on one” and suggested Disney’s FCC broadcast licenses should be revoked due to the moderators’ conduct. In the days leading up to the faceoff, Disney pulled its ABC-owned stations from DirecTV, the nation’s third largest pay TV provider, in a bitter and protracted carriage dispute that’s forced ESPN, FX and other networks go dark on the satellite carrier’s lineup. Hours before the telecast, ABC offered to provide DirecTV a free feed of the broadcast for a three-hour period. But the carrier rejected the offer, saying it would only sow confusion and its subscribers could watch the debate on other networks."
How Taylor Swift’s endorsement of Harris matters | CNN Politics,"Published 8:28 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-12T00:28:53.389Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html,"It was the Instagram endorsement read ‘round the world: Pop superstar Taylor Swift backs Kamala Harris for president. Swift’s post also directed her followers to register to vote. Swift’s support for Harris and voter registration will likely have some impact, but not as much as some would hope. That said, Harris and the Democratic Party are struggling with young voters and voter registration, so they’ll take any help they can get. Let’s start out with what we know about Swift’s post. More than 330,000 people were redirected to Vote.gov from Swift’s Instagram, as of 2 p.m. Wednesday, according to the General Services Administration, which runs the website. An examination of Google trends revealed a spike in searches for voter registration after Swift’s post, a Washington Post analysis found. We know there was an increase in registrations when Swift made a similar post imploring people to register to vote in 2023. Voter registrations went up by 23% that day compared with the same time the year before. That equated to 35,252 voter registrations in total nationally. These really aren’t large numbers. Let’s assume that all of the people who clicked on Swift’s Vote.gov link have registered to vote. That would amount to about 0.2% of the 2020 turnout. Of course, only a portion of those who clicked on the link will actually register and then actually turn out. And the potential Swift bump comes as registered Republicans have been closing the gap with registered Democrats in several key states over the past few years. Take a look at the most recent data on voter registration reported by government officials in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania – all battlegrounds that allow voters to register by party. Republicans have widened the margin in Arizona and closed the gap with Democrats significantly in other states since September 2020 – picking up anywhere from from more than 60,000 active voters in Nevada to nearly 400,000 active voters in Pennsylvania. The voter registration spikes we have seen historically from Swift endorsement drives would not be enough to make up these GOP gains. Now Swift could help Harris among those already planning to vote. She sported a 52% favorable rating among likely voters in a Grinnell College/Selzer poll published earlier this year. Her unfavorable rating was just 32%. That makes for a net favorability rating of +20 points. A Fox News poll from last year showed the same thing. While she may not be universally popular, she’s far more popular than most politicians. Harris and former President Donald Trump have net favorability ratings of closer to 0 points and -10 points, respectively. Younger “Swifties” could also be helpful to Harris. The vice president is currently struggling, relatively speaking, with younger voters. A recent average of national polls finds her winning voters under the age of 30 by 15 points. That’s better than President Joe Biden was doing when he dropped out of the race in July, but not overly so. Biden was up by 7 points. Both Harris and Biden have done worse among young voters this year compared with where Biden was in September 2020. Back then, Biden held a 25-point lead among young voters. That edge would grow to 29 points by the final 2020 pre-election surveys. Swift, on her own, won’t be able to eliminate that entire gap. Remember: She couldn’t translate her first big political endorsement (Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate in 2018) into success at the ballot box. Bredesen lost by double digits. But there is no doubt that Swift is an asset to Harris and Democrats, even if it is just on the margins. We’re talking about an election that is currently neck-in-neck in the national and battleground state polls. Getting a few voters over to the Democrats and Harris could just be enough."
"Following Swift endorsement, Harris makes provocative choice to play ‘The Man’ when leaving post-debate party | CNN","Updated 7:53 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T17:19:12.599Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/entertainment/taylor-swift-the-man-kamala-harris/index.html,"If song selections were a subtweet, Vice President Kamala Harris said a lot with “The Man” on Tuesday. Following her presidential debate with former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia, Harris made an appearance at a post-debate party to address supporters. It happened not long after Taylor Swift formally endorsed Harris’s bid for the presidency. “Hard work is good work, and we will win,” she told the crowd. “See you later,” Harris added before she exited the stage with Swift’s 2019 song “The Man” playing. “I’m so sick of running as fast as I can / Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man,” Swift could be heard singing as Harris high-fived and greeted supporters. CNN has reached out to representatives for Swift and the Harris campaign for comment on the song selection. “The Man” and its accompanying music video sparked headlines in 2020. Swift, who wrote the song and directed the music video, used makeup and special effects to appear as “Tyler Swift” in the project, which references stark cultural double standards between men and women. “They’d say I hustled/Put in the work/They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve,” Swift sings on the hit. “What I was wearing, if I was rude/Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves.” Swift said she had done her “research” before endorsing the Harris-Walz ticket. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” Swift wrote. “I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.” Swift signed her post, “Childless Cat Lady,” referencing 2021 remarks by Trump’s running mate Sen. JD Vance. In a post-debate interview with MSNBC, Walz said he was “grateful” for Swift’s support. “I am incredibly grateful, first of all, to Taylor Swift. I say that also as a cat owner — a fellow cat owner,” Walz said. “That was eloquent and it was clear,” he continued. “And that’s the type of courage we need in America, to stand up.” Trump dismissed Swift’s Democratic endorsement. “She will probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,” Trump told Fox News. While several high-profile artists have objected to the Trump campaign using their music, Harris has not – at least publicly – faced similar challenges. In July, Beyoncé gave Harris permission to use her song “Freedom” for her presidential campaign. The song has since become an anthem for Harris, who has used it for both ads and at her campaign rallies."
Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes won’t endorse Trump or Harris | CNN,"Published 6:15 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T22:15:26.462Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/sport/patrick-mahomes-trump-harris-spt-intl/index.html,"Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes will not endorse former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. After spending Sunday at the US Open with his wife Brittany, teammate Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift, who backed Harris for president on social media Tuesday night, Mahomes was asked about the former president associating himself with the three-time Super Bowl winner and Brittany. “I don’t want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate or do whatever, either way,” the two-time league MVP said at his regularly scheduled media availability on Wednesday. “I think my place is to inform people to get registered to vote. It is to inform people to do their own research and then make their best decision for them and their family. “Every time I’m on this stage and I get asked these questions, I’m going to refer back to that because I think that’s what makes America so great,” Mahomes said. On Wednesday, Trump appeared on Fox News and was asked about Swift’s Harris endorsement. “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better if you want to know the truth. She is a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan,” Trump said. Mahomes was asked if he had given any thought to Trump, specifically mentioning his wife’s name. “No. I think at the end of the day, it’s about me and my family and how we treat other people,” Mahomes replied. “I think you see that Brittany does a lot in the community. I do a lot in the community to help bring people up and give people other opportunities to use their voice. “So, in the political times, people are gonna use stuff here and there, but I can’t let that affect how I go about my business every single day and live my life - and try to live it to the best of my ability,” he said. Mahomes was asked several times about his name being mentioned in the political space in an election year. “I’ve grown up with people from every aspect of life and every background. I think the best thing about a football locker room, and kind of how I’ve grown up in baseball locker rooms is people can come together and achieve something and achieve a common goal. “I think if we can do that as a nation, I think we can get the best out of each other. “I think that’s something that I do every single day. Whenever I’m hanging out with whoever I’m not thinking about their political views or anything like that. I’m thinking about the people and how they treat other people, and I was with a lot of great people this weekend.” Mahomes and the Chiefs face the Cincinnati Bengals at home on Sunday."
Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president | CNN,"Updated 5:03 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T03:11:08.968Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/entertainment/taylor-swift-endorsement-kamala-harris/index.html,"Taylor Swift said Tuesday she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for president, ending speculation about whether the superstar singer would share her political views ahead of November’s election. “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” Swift wrote on Instagram, shortly after the conclusion of Harris’ debate with former President Donald Trump, her Republican rival, on ABC News. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.” Harris became the Democratic Party’s nominee in early August following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race. Later that month, Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Swift mentioned Harris’ choice of Walz in her endorsement. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades,” Swift wrote. “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.” Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, to criticize Democrats. Asked about the endorsement on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, added in a statement to CNN on Wednesday: “More evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite. President Trump will fight for the American worker, the struggling family who can’t afford groceries and gas, and the angel families who have lost loved ones due to Kamala’s open border policy. Taylor Swift may not understand those problems but President Trump does.” In 2020, Swift announced her support for Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House. Swift has spent most of her nearly two-decade career staying mum on politics until the 2018 midterms, when she endorsed two Democratic candidates out of Tennessee. She has since been vocally supportive of Democratic policies and candidates, often encouraging her supporters to vote and advocating for women’s rights, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights. In her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” Swift expressed regret for not speaking up about political causes sooner, telling her father Scott Swift in an emotionally charged scene that she felt the need “to be on the right side of history.” In another scene, she was critical of Trump. A faction of Swift’s supporters –- known as Swifties -– have mobilized in the 2024 election cycle, forming a Swifties for Kamala community online shortly following Biden’s exit from the race and his subsequent endorsement of Harris. The group, which Swift is not affiliated with and has thousands of followers on X, raised more than $122K during its two-hour kickoff call in August. Speakers included Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and singer Carole King. “We believe Harris-Walz will fight for our rights and the rights of our loved ones, and help make this country safer for everyone,” Irene Kim, communications director of Swifties for Kamala, previously told CNN."
Harris and Trump shake hands at New York 9/11 remembrance ceremony on 23rd anniversary of attacks | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:56 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T09:00:19.681Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/heres-how-biden-harris-trump-and-vance-will-commemorate-9-11/index.html,"President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance are commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, appearing to put political hostilities on the back burner for a moment as the nation remembers the tragedy. All four were in New York on Wednesday for a commemoration event at Ground Zero in Manhattan. Trump and Harris, just hours past their first in-person meeting at the presidential debate Tuesday night, shook hands ahead of solemn commemorative ceremonies after Harris turned toward Trump and both extended a hand. Vance and Harris did not appear to interact. Harris and Biden then traveled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Flight 93 memorial. At that ceremony, Biden placed his hand on the wreath as the small group he was with bowed their heads. The president and vice president also stopped by a local Shanksville volunteer fire station that served as a key gathering point for families in 2001. Biden and Harris observed a display of a cross made of the plane’s scraps. Biden made the sign of the cross before walking in to meet some of the families affected by that day. Inside the fire station, Biden briefly donned a Trump hat as an apparent gesture of bipartisan unity. A White House spokesperson said the president was talking about how the country was united in the aftermath of the attacks and said it needed to return to that. He handed a hat to a man wearing a Trump cap as a gesture, and that man gave Biden his hat to briefly wear, the spokesperson said. Pictures show Biden smiling widely while wearing the hat. While candidates in active campaigning in past years have traditionally avoided politics on the anniversary of the attacks, this campaign cycle is notable for its toxicity, making those fleeting, ordinary gestures of bipartisanship – shaking hands and wearing a hat – significant. Biden and Harris later traveled to the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, for another wreath laying ceremony. Trump will also travel separately to Shanksville later on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with his plans. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president, will also attend an event to commemorate the anniversary. His office did not say where the event will take place. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when Islamist terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners on September 11, 2001. Two planes were crashed into each of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Another plane was crashed into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed in a field in rural Pennsylvania after passengers tried to thwart the hijacking. Last year, Biden marked the 22nd anniversary with a ceremony involving American service members in Alaska. During that ceremony, the president falsely claimed he visited Ground Zero “the next day” after the attacks. He actually went nine days later. The president visited the Pentagon during the anniversary in 2022. In 2021, he and first lady Jill Biden also traveled to each of the three sites of the terror attack. They were joined by former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama at the New York remembrance. Wednesday’s events mark the sixth election cycle in which presidential candidates have navigated the somber anniversary amid a heated campaign season. Over the years, the day has provided both an opportunity for unity and a window into deep divisions. For three cycles in a row, Trump – himself a native New Yorker who has repeated false claims about the terror attack in the past – has been the Republican nominee. Four years ago, then-candidate Biden and then-President Trump managed to avoid each other while both attending memorial events at Ground Zero. Later, they traveled to Shanksville, but also managed to avoid crossing paths. Instead, Biden greeted then-Vice President Mike Pence, giving him a Covid-era elbow bump. In 2016, both Trump and Hillary Clinton attended memorial events marking the 15th anniversary of 9/11 at Ground Zero. Clinton departed the event suddenly after falling ill and appearing unsteady, providing an opening for Trump to later question her health. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Then-President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney did not cross paths in 2012. Instead, Obama attended events at the sites of the terror attacks while Romney campaigned in Nevada. Still, Romney held off criticizing his opponent: “There is a time and a place for that, but this day is not it,” he said. All of it is a distant cry from 2008, when Obama and Sen. John McCain joined together to lay a wreath at Ground Zero, putting aside their bitter campaign for at least a few hours to commemorate the somber anniversary. This is a developing story and will be updated."
"Trump suggests he won’t debate Harris again, attacks ABC over moderators’ fact-checking | CNN Business","Updated 4:53 PM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T14:01:46.562Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/media/will-trump-and-harris-debate-again-abc-moderators/index.html,"The day after Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s first presidential debate, it is far from clear if Trump will agree to a rematch. Multiple TV networks are eager to host a presidential debate in October. The Harris campaign, exuding confidence after Harris baited Trump on a Philadelphia stage Tuesday night, immediately said she would agree to a second debate with the ex-president. But Trump is not committing. “Are we going to do a rematch? I just don’t know,” he told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’ll think about it.” His comments suggest he is not altogether serious about a sequel. In a morning phone call to the co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” he said, “when you win the debate, I don’t, I don’t know that I want to do another debate.” Then he insulted Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, the two anchors that Fox News has pitched as potential debate moderators in October. “I wouldn’t want to have Bret and Martha,” he said, before proposing Sean Hannity, Jesse Watters or Laura Ingraham instead. It is self-evident that Fox’s prime time stars, who exist more in the realm of entertainment than news, are never going to moderate a general election debate. So if that’s the starting point for negotiations, don’t expect another debate. But Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said on “CNN This Morning” that Trump “has already said that he is going to do three debates.” Miller blamed Harris for dodging Trump’s talk of a September 25 debate hosted by NBC. The Harris campaign, however, wants the vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance to happen next. CBS is hosting that face-off on October 1. That’s why Harris spokesman Brian Fallon said last night, “That was fun. Let’s do it again in October.” NBC and other networks stand ready to host a followup debate. Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he would theoretically show up for a debate hosted by either NBC or Fox, but first “we have to determine whether or not we even want to do it.” Trump claimed that overnight polls showed he had defeated Harris soundly in the debate, as if to suggest that a second face-off wasn’t necessary, but he was referring to highly partisan and unscientific surveys on social media. CNN’s flash poll after the debate found that registered voters who watched it broadly agreed that Harris outperformed Trump. Regarding a potential Trump-Harris rematch, Trump’s VP nominee JD Vance said it’s ultimately up to the top of the ticket. “Obviously, he likes these debates and he’s good at them, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants to step back in the ring, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t. It’s his choice,” Vance told Fox News. Trump on Wednesday also assailed ABC after the debate moderators fact-checked the former president in real-time during the prime time telecast. “CNN was much more honorable” during its June debate, Trump told “Fox & Friends,” calling Disney-owned ABC “the most dishonest news organization, and that’s saying a lot.” Trump repeatedly claimed the debate “was three on one” and suggested Disney’s FCC broadcast licenses should be revoked due to the moderators’ conduct. “They are a news organization – they have to be licensed to do it – they ought to take away their license for the way they did that,” he said."
Fact-checking the ABC presidential debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:57 AM EDT, Wed September 11, 2024",2024-09-11T02:17:31.121Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/fact-check-debate-trump-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump delivered more than 30 false claims during Tuesday’s presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, CNN’s preliminary count found – as he did during his June debate against President Joe Biden. Trump again delivered a staggering quantity and variety of false claims, some of which were egregious lies about topics including abortion, immigration and the economy. Harris was far more accurate than Trump; CNN’s preliminary count found just one false claim from the vice president, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context. Here is a fact check of some of the remarks made by each candidate. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that former President Donald Trump’s policies would result in a “Trump sales tax” that would raise prices for middle class families by about $4,000 a year. Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House. Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund a liberal think tank. If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP. Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco  Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that there was virtually no inflation during his administration. “I had no inflation, virtually no inflation,” Trump said. Facts First: This is false. Cumulative inflation over the course of Trump’s presidency was about 7.8%. Inflation was low at the end of Trump’s term, having plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The year-over-year inflation rate was about 1.4% in January 2021, the month Trump left office. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby  Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated a claim that migrants are arriving to the US after fleeing prisons and mental institutions. “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump claimed. Trump makes this claim often, and he’s often alleged that jails and mental institutions are being emptied out deliberately to somehow dump people upon the US. Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN last year they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated. And a second article that Cheung cited at the time, about Mexico’s president having freed 2,685 prisoners, was not about migration at all; that article simply explained that the president had freed them “as part of an effort to free those who have not committed serious crimes or were being held unjustly.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer Former President Donald Trump claimed during Tuesday night’s debate that “21 million people” are crossing the border monthly into the United States under President Joe Biden. Facts First: This number is false. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern borders from February 2021 through July 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was roughly 10 million, far less than Trump’s “21 million” figure.  An “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans have said is more than 1.7 million during the Biden-Harris administration, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in an email in June, when Trump made similar claims. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Trump would “essentially be immune from any misconduct” undertaken by him while in the White House. “Let’s talk about extreme and understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again,” she said. Facts First: This needs context. In their decision in July in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought in his federal election subversion case. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office.  “The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority. From CNN’s Devan Cole Former President Donald Trump repeated a false claim at Tuesday’s debate that has been promoted by numerous prominent Republicans in the past week, including Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. Trump claimed that Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield, Ohio, are stealing people’s pet dogs and cats and eating them. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Facts First: This is false. The City of Springfield and the local police have said they have seen no evidence for the claim – which appeared to originate from a Facebook post in which someone purporting to be a local resident passed along what they said was a story about their neighbor’s daughter’s friend. In a statement to CNN on Monday, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” The Springfield News-Sun reported that “the Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten.” Vance acknowledged on social media on Tuesday that it is “possible” that the “rumors” he has heard from local residents “will turn out to be false,” though he also encouraged people to “keep the cat memes flowing.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Michael Williams Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States took in billions of dollars from China as a result of his tariffs. Facts First: Trump’s claim about how tariffs work is false. A US tariff is paid by importing businesses in the United States – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. Here’s how tariffs work: When the United States puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer. Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. It’s true that the US Treasury has collected more than $242 billion from the tariffs Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods – but those duties were paid by US importers, not the country of China. From CNN’s Katie Lobosco During Tuesday night’s debate, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “I made it that very clear in 2020 – I will not ban fracking,” though she had said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” 
 
Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate. Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Tuesday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Ella Nilsen Former President Donald Trump said the US experienced “the highest inflation” ever under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Facts First: Trump’s claim that inflation was at its highest under the Biden-Harris administration is false. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, hit 9.1% in June 2022. That wasn’t the highest ever recorded. Rather, it was the highest inflation rate in nearly forty years. For instance, in 1980, inflation hit nearly 15%, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some of the earliest inflation data the BLS maintains indicates that inflation was even higher in 1917, when it was trending at nearly 18%. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump claimed that when Vice President Kamala Harris previously ran for the presidency, during the 2020 election cycle, she was the very first candidate to drop out of a crowded Democratic primary. “When she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,” Trump claimed, referring to Harris’ 2020 bid, while arguing that Harris didn’t receive any votes this primary cycle because President Joe Biden was still at top of the ticket during the primaries. Facts First: This is false. Harris was far from the first candidate to drop out of that Democratic primary when she exited the race in early December 2019 Harris was preceded by the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate, plus some others. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed at Tuesday’s debate that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Biden administration’s “border czar.” “Remember that she was a border czar,” Trump said. “She doesn’t want to be called the border czar because she’s embarrassed by the border.” Facts First: Trump’s claim about Harris’ border role is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries. (Biden also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.” Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby Former President Donald Trump repeated a version of one of his frequent claims Tuesday night that legal scholars wanted Roe v. Wade overturned so individual states could instead decide how to regulate abortion. “Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that’s what happened,” Trump said. “It’s the vote of the people, now it’s not tied up in the federal government.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Many legal scholars wanted the right to have an abortion preserved in federal law, as several told CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April.  Some legal scholars who support abortion rights had wanted Roe written in a different way, including even the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but that isn’t the same as saying that “every legal scholar” believed Roe should be overturned and sent to the states. “Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. “Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April. Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.” You can read more here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. “Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn’t do her job,” he said. Facts First: This claim is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. Pelosi’s office has explicitly said she was not presented with an offer of 10,000 National Guardsmen as Trump has claimed, telling CNN last year that claims to the contrary are “lies.” And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army). You can read a complete fact check on it here. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Russia invaded Ukraine and failed to deter him from the invasion. “They sent her to negotiate peace before this war started,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “Three days later, he went in, and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris was not sent to negotiate peace, and she has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference. “Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said in July, according to a state-owned Russian news agency. The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.” CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.” The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump repeated a familiar claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. “We wouldn’t have left $85 billion worth of brand new, beautiful military equipment behind,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure – it’s closer to $83 billion – for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A fraction of this funding was for equipment. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday claimed that former President Donald Trump left office “with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.” Facts First: Harris’ claim is false. In January 2021, when Trump left office, the official unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global economies, including that of the US. That was the highest rate since 1939, according to BLS historical records. Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. But by the time Trump left office, the unemployment rate had gone down. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs created under the Biden-Harris administration from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false and needs additional context. Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported. Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the dynamics at play. Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report. While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration. The preliminary revision was larger than typical, but economists and even a Trump-appointed BLS commissioner have publicly stated that there is nothing nefarious at play. Revisions of this size typically happen at turning points in the economy, when the BLS’ methodology is less reliable, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, the pandemic had a seismic effect on the economy as well as the gold standard methods used to measure it, so this large revision is likely a reflection of that. Specifically, the BLS’ model for capturing business “births and deaths” is likely overstating new firm formation while underestimating deaths, Oxford Economics’ Chief US Economist Ryan Sweet told CNN. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed that President Joe Biden has taken money from China and Ukraine, including $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Facts First: There is no public evidence that Joe Biden received money from any foreign entities while in office or as a private citizen. While investigations by House Republicans have found that Biden family members who have been involved in business, including his son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden (“and their related companies”), have received over $18 million from foreign entities, they have found no proof to date that the president himself received any foreign money. Roughly a year after launching their impeachment inquiry into Biden and more than three years into Biden’s presidency, the closest House Republicans have gotten to connecting the president to money earned by his family members is in finding that the president received personal checks from his brother while he was a private citizen after his vice presidency. Republicans have questioned the legitimacy of these transactions and used them to suggest that Joe Biden did benefit from his brother’s relationships with foreign entities. But banking records provide substantial evidence that Joe Biden had made loans to his brother and then was paid back without interest, as House Democrats have said. Biden said at a presidential debate against Trump in 2020: “I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.” The Washington Post dove into the allegations in 2022 that Hunter Biden received money from the wife of the Moscow mayor. But there’s no evidence that Joe Biden had any involvement regardless. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jeremy Herb Former President Donald Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign – that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state. Facts First: This is false. There is no evidence that Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government.  Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: “The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.” As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney’s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris implied Tuesday that all prospective start-up business owners will be able to take advantage of the $50,000 tax deduction she’s proposing for new small businesses, saying that it will help them “pursue their ambitions.” “I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work,” Harris said. Facts First: Harris’ point about new business owners being able to benefit from the deduction she’s proposed lacks context. “Businesses that fail before they begin to turn a profit won’t be able to utilize the deduction, because to take a deduction you have to have taxable income to deduct against,” Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN. In other words, the tax deduction may not ultimately help businesses owners get off the ground and running initially. However, it may help lower their tax burden over time, but only if they turn a profit. From CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald Former President Donald Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, “the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs” that “bounced back and it went to their benefit,” but “I was the one that created them.” Facts First: Trump’s claims that the job growth during the Biden-Harris administration presidency has been all “bounce-back” gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct. More than 21 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022. The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022 and through August 2024, the US has added nearly 6.4 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under the Biden-Harris administration, around 16 million jobs have been added. But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions. The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities. Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. From CNN’s Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday past claims that he “rebuilt our entire military.” “We’re going to end up in a third world war, and it will be a war like no other. Because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan,” he said. Facts First: Trump’s claim to have rebuilt the entire military is false. “This claim is not even close to being true. The military has tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, and the vast majority of it predates the Trump administration,” Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told CNN in November. Harrison said in a November email: “Moreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It’s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military’s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F- 15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump complained that the US had given $250 billion to $275 billion in aid to Ukraine while European countries had given just $100 billion to $150 billion even though they are located closer to Ukraine. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. In total, European countries have contributed significantly more aid to Ukraine than the US has during and just before the Russian invasion began in early 2022, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany.  The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, from late January 2022 (just before Russia’s invasion in February 2022) through June 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $207 billion to Ukraine, in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared to about $109 billion (€98.4 billion) committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had actually been “allocated” to Ukraine – defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery – at about $122 billion (€110.21 billion) for Europe compared to about $83 billion (€75.1 billion) for the US. In addition, Europe had committed more total military aid to Ukraine, at about $88 billion (79.57 billion euro) to about $72 billion (64.87 billion euro) for the US. The US narrowly led on military aid that had actually been allocated, at about $56.91 billion for the US (51.58 billion euro) to about $56.84 billion for Europe (51.52 billion euro), but that was nowhere near the lopsided margin Trump suggested. It’s important to note that it’s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. And the Kiel Institute found that Ukraine itself was getting only about half of the money in a 2024 US bill that had widely been described as a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine; the institute said the rest of the funds were mostly going to the Defense Department. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that “crime in this country is through the roof.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that crime rates are up is false. And while it is true that the FBI’s most recent data did not include some large cities, crime counts still show a downward trend as both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. There are limitations to the FBI-published data from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data and the submitted data usually has some errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trump’s last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said in an email to CNN last week: There is ample evidence that crime is falling in 2024 and murder specifically fell at the fastest – or one of the fastest – paces ever recorded in 2023 and again in 2024.” Asher continued: “The evidence comes from a variety of sources including the FBI’s quarterly data, the CDC, the Gun Violence Archive, and our newly launched Real-Time Crime Index. We show a 5 percent decline in violent crime – including a 16 percent decline in murder – and a 9 percent decline in property crime through June 2024 in over 300 cities with available data so far this year. Data from these various sources suggest the US murder rate was down significantly in 2023 relative to 2020/2021 highs but still slightly above 2019’s level.” After Trump claimed in June that “crime is so much up,” Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: “It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.” From CNN’s Daniel Dale Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Central Park Five pleaded guilty to crimes, and that the five teenagers “badly hurt a person, killed a person” in the 1989 attack. Facts First: These claims are false. The Central Park Five did not plead guilty, they were convicted by a jury at trial (that conviction has since been vacated). Also, the five teenagers were accused of raping a jogger – not of murder.  Five teenagers who were accused of raping a jogger in 1989 were pressured into giving false confessions. They were exonerated in 2002 when DNA evidence linked another person to the crime. The teenagers sued the city, and the case was settled in 2014. A sixth teenager charged in the attack did plead guilty to robbery charges. His conviction was also overturned because there was no physical evidence connecting him to either the rape or the robbery, and because people who blamed the sixth teen later recanted. From CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz Former President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that he “ended” the Nord Stream pipeline. “I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one,” Trump said. “But he ended the XL pipeline – the XL pipeline in our country, he ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany; the biggest pipeline in the world.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He did not “end” Nord Stream. While he did sign a bill that included sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around 90% complete – and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been described as a likely act of sabotage. From CNN’s Daniel Dale  Former President Donald Trump claimed that some states allow people to execute babies, in addition to allowing abortion in the ninth month, and he singled out the governors including Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz for his stance on the issue. On Walz, Trump said, “He also says execution after birth – it’s execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born – is OK. And that’s not OK with me.” “They have abortion in the ninth month. They even have – and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia not the current governor he’s doing an excellent job. But the governor before, he said, ‘The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,’ in other words, ‘We’ll execute the baby,’” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim about infanticide is false. No state allows for the execution of a baby after it is born. That’s called infanticide, which is illegal in every state. “Every state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,” Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said in June. “There is no basis for this claim,” Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, also said at the time. There are some cases in which parents choose palliative care, a kind of care that can provide relief for the symptoms and stress of a deadly illness or condition that gives the baby just minutes, hours or days to live. That is not the same as executing a baby. Trump also misspoke. It was not the governor of West Virginia, it was the former Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam who made a controversial remark in 2019 that many Republicans said sounded like he supported infanticide. Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, said his words were being misinterpreted. In any case, infanticide was not legal when Northam was governor of Virginia nor was it ever legal in West Virginia either. As for abortions in the ninth month, Minnesota is one of a handful of states that allow abortion at any stage of a pregnancy, but it doesn’t mean that doctors perform them. Nationally, just 0.9% of abortions in 2021 – the latest year the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has data – happened at 21 weeks or later. Many abortions at this point in the pregnancy are necessary due to serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies. More than 93 percent of abortions were conducted before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the CDC. In Minnesota, according to state data for 2022, of the 12,175 abortions in the state, only two happened between the 25 and 30th week of pregnancy. None happened after the 30th week of pregnancy that year. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” for years, until he “got them to pay up” by threatening not to follow through on the alliance’s collective defense clause. “For years, we were paying almost all of NATO,” he said. “We were being ripped off by European nations, both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, ‘if you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.’ Otherwise we would have never gotten it.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” needs context. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “almost all.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016. The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP. From CNN’s Daniel Dale In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump once again claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris wants to get rid of private health insurance. “But she won’t improve private insurance for people, private medical insurance,” Trump said. “That’s another thing she doesn’t want to give. People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they wanna have private – she wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is outdated. While Harris did say in her first presidential campaign in 2019 that she wanted to eliminate private health insurance, the plan she rolled out later that year included a role for private insurers, and as vice president, she has supported bolstering the Affordable Care Act. Coverage on the Obamacare exchanges are offered by private insurers. At a CNN town hall in January 2019, Harris, who was then a California senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance proposal promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Harris was a co-sponsor of Sanders’ bill, which called for essentially getting rid of the private insurance market. A furor erupted, and her national press secretary and an adviser quickly walked back her comment, saying she was open to multiple paths to Medicare for All. And private insurers were included in the plan she rolled out in July 2019. “We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.” Since she was named President Joe Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market. Harris’ campaign has confirmed that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system. From CNN’s Tami Luhby Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Tuesday that the economy has added over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs during the Biden-Harris administration. Facts First: Harris was rounding up and was referring to labor market data available through July 2024, which showed the US economy added 765,000 manufacturing jobs from the first full month of the Biden-Harris administration, February 2021. Though it’s worth noting that the growth almost entirely occurred in 2021 and 2022 (with 746,000 manufacturing jobs added starting in February 2021) before a relatively flat 2023 and through the first seven months of 2024. In August, the US economy lost an estimated 24,000 manufacturing jobs, bringing that tally down to 739,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary employment data released Friday. The gain during the Biden-Harris era is, however, over 800,000 using non-seasonally-adjusted figures that are also published by the federal government – in fact, the non-seasonally adjusted gain is 874,000 through August – so there is at least a defensible basis for Harris’ claim. However, seasonally adjusted data smooths out volatility and is traditionally used to observe trends. An estimated 172,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during former President Donald Trump’s administration, however, most of those losses occurred following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. From February 2017, the first full month that Trump was in office, through February 2020, the US economy added 414,000 manufacturing jobs, BLS data shows. Presidential terms don’t start and end in a vacuum, and economic cycles can carry over regardless of party. Additionally, the ups and downs of the labor market and the broader economy are influenced by factors beyond a single president, although specific economic policies can influence economic and job growth. From CNN’s Daniel Dale and Alicia Wallace Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday night’s debate that he saved Obamacare, his predecessor’s landmark health reform law that Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace. “I had a choice to make: Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim is misleading. The only reason Obamacare wasn’t repealed was because congressional Republicans could not amass enough votes to kill the law in 2017. During Trump’s administration, he and his officials took many steps to weaken the Affordable Care Act, though they did continue to operate the Obamacare exchanges. Within hours of taking the oath of office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rolling back Obamacare – stating that the administration’s official policy was “to seek the prompt repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. Although Congress failed to repeal it, Trump did manage to undermine the law, which led to a decline in enrollment. He cut the open enrollment period in half, to only six weeks. He also slashed funding for advertising and for navigators, who are critical to helping people sign up. At the same time, he increased the visibility of insurance agents who can also sell non-Obamacare plans. Trump signed an executive order in October 2017 making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have lower premiums than Affordable Care Act plans – but in exchange for fewer protections and benefits. And he ended subsidy payments to health insurers to reduce eligible enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs. Plus, his administration refused to defend several central provisions of the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, arguing that key parts of Obamacare should be invalidated. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the challenge and left the law in place. Enrollment declined until the final year of his term, which was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. From CNN’s Tami Luhby Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday, “As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.” Facts First: This claim is misleading. While US service members are not engaged in major wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, US service members have come under fire in the Middle East repeatedly over the last year and increasingly been in harm’s way since Hamas’ attacks on Israel last October. There are currently roughly 2,500 US troops in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7. Also since October, more US troops have deployed to the Middle East, including on Navy ships to the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea. CNN cited two US officials in reporting Tuesday that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was last operating near the Gulf of Oman, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group is expected to leave the region this week after last operating in the same area. Additionally, in the last several months, US service members have taken fire in the Middle East and been injured or killed. Last month, eight US service members were treated for traumatic brain injuries and smoke inhalation after a drone struck Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria. In January, three US soldiers were killed, and dozens more were injured, in an attack on a small outpost in Jordan called Tower 22. The same month, two US Navy SEALs died after going missing one night at sea while trying to seize lethal aid being transported from Iran to Yemen. From CNN’s Haley Britzky Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday’s debate: “Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs.” Facts First: This needs context. It’s true that the US lost 178,000 manufacturing jobs during Trump’s presidency – but the loss overwhelmingly occurred because of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. From the beginning of Trump’s presidency in January 2017 through February 2020, before the pandemic crash, there was a gain of 414,000 manufacturing jobs. From CNN’s Daniel Dale Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday’s debate: “Let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America.” Facts First: This needs context. It’s true that there were high trade deficits during the Trump administration. The seasonally adjusted 2020 goods trade deficit, about $901.5 billion, was the highest on record at the time. However, Harris did not acknowledge that trade deficits have been even higher during the Biden-Harris administration. The seasonally adjusted goods trade deficit exceeded $1 trillion in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023. From CNN’s Daniel Dale"
