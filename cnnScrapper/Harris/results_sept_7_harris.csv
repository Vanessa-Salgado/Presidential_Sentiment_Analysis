JD Vance for reacting to the Georgia school shooting this week by expressing regret that school shootings are a “fact of life.” At a Washington, DC, event focused on LGBTQ rights, Walz chastised Republicans who seek to restrict books with LGBTQ themes out of fear they will “turn your children gay.” In criticizing the book bans implemented in some states, Walz referenced Vance’s comments to highlight Republicans’ policy priorities.  “This is what these folks are focusing on, spending all their time, like reading about two male penguins who love each other is — is somehow going to turn your children gay, and that’s what you should worry about,” Walz said during his address at the Human Rights Campaign’s national dinner in Washington, DC. Walz went out to tout his and Vice President Kamala Harris’ record of defending LGBTQ rights while frequently attacking Vance and former President Donald Trump for positions that Walz argued infringe on those rights. The Democratic vice presidential nominee also attacked Vance over his and Trump’s positions on protecting access to reproductive health care.  Former President Donald Trump touched on familiar talking points as he spoke during a campaign rally at an airfield in central Wisconsin on Saturday, projecting confidence about Tuesday’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris while shouting out allies Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Here’s some of what Trump said during the rally: On the debate: Trump said the country is run by “stupid people” and that we “found that out at the debate with Joe (Biden).” “We’re going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?” Trump asked the crowd. The former president predicted that pundits would say he lost the debate, even “if I destroy her.” Praising RFK Jr.: Trump repeatedly praised Kennedy, saying that with his help, “we’ll take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC, World Health Organization and other institutions of public health.” Kennedy, the former independent presidential candidate who has embraced conspiracy theories about vaccines and other issues, has been positioned by the former president to helm a panel investigating chronic health problems in a potential second Trump administration. On Boeing and SpaceX: Trump said the Boeing Starliner crew being stuck in space is “embarrassing,” and that Musk, the SpaceX CEO, is “going to have to save them.” Trump continued his public praise of the tech billionaire amid the tightening alliance between the two men.  “He’s very good at what he does,” Trump said of Musk. “Leon’s going to send up a rocket, he looks forward to it,” he added, apparently misstating his ally’s first name. The praise of Musk comes days after Trump announced he would appoint Musk to head a newly created government efficiency commission if reelected. The ballot in Colorado: Trump said people in Colorado should “do a major protest vote” in favor of him because of the failed efforts to remove him from the ballot, which had cited the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist clause in relation to the January 6 Capitol riot. Former President Donald Trump on Saturday called for modifying the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and said if a vice president covers for the “incapacity of the president” they should be removed from office. Since President Joe Biden suspended his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump and his Republican allies have accused Vice President Kamala Harris and others at the White House of engaging in a cover-up to hide the state of the president’s mental fitness. “You know, think of it — if he didn’t go to that debate, he’d still be running,” Trump added, referencing Biden’s poor debate performance in June. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is marking the five-year anniversary of a series of social media posts in which former President Donald Trump said he’d invited Taliban leaders to Camp David to meet with him and the president of Afghanistan, arguing that Trump’s “chaotic actions” led to the “catastrophic consequences” in Afghanistan. In a statement on Saturday, Harris campaign national security spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein cited Trump’s handling of Afghanistan as an example of foreign policy that “put our troops in harm’s way.” The statement comes as Trump and his allies have repeatedly sought to link Harris to the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Remember: In September 2019, Trump said Taliban leaders were set to travel to the US for secret peace talks but that the meeting was canceled and he called off peace talks with the militant group entirely. Trump posted on Twitter, now X, that he scrapped the meeting after the Taliban took credit for an attack in Kabul that killed a dozen people, including an American soldier. More context: Trump promised to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan during his presidency. His administration set the final withdrawal in motion by negotiating and signing a deal with the Taliban in 2020 that stipulated the drawdown of US service members in Afghanistan. After Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he fired his defense secretary at the time, Mark Esper, purged many top officials at the Pentagon and tried to further accelerate US drawdowns, both in Afghanistan and in Europe. Biden reversed the drawdown of service members in Europe but delayed by only a few months Trump’s plans to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan, despite worsening conditions on the ground and rapid gains by the Taliban. Retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser under Trump, said last month that his onetime boss bears some responsibility for what was ultimately a chaotic withdrawal. CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Rep. Liz Cheney, calling the prominent Republicans’ backing a rebuke of the “attempts to kind of divide us as Americans.” “I’m honored to have their endorsement,” she told reporters during a visit to a spice shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “They both as leaders who are well-respected are making an important statement that it’s OK and if not important to put country above party,” she added. Harris says she’s ready for debate: Harris visited Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh as a brief respite from debate preparations, where she greeted supporters and perused merchandise. Harris told reporters the “best part” of debate preparations was getting a chance to visit the store. Harris suggested her main focus in next week’s debate with former President Donald Trump is to communicate with voters that it’s “time to turn the page on divisiveness.” When asked if she’s ready to debate Trump, she replied, “Yes I am. Yes.” During her visit to the store, Harris greeted roughly a dozen customers and took a tour, guided by one of the shop’s employees. One woman was particularly overwhelmed upon meeting the vice president when she arrived at the store. “It’s gonna be good,” Harris replied. “We are all in this together.” Former President Donald Trump was asked how he would bring down the cost of child care — which is a barrier to people having children and a major drain on parents — at a talk with the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. His response could accurately be described as a ramble without an answer, and it’s worth looking closer at an issue that affects so many Americans. Trump got off to a good start, referencing a provision in his tax cut law that doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child for millions of Americans, according to a CNN fact check. Trump’s doubling of the credit is set to expire next year, so this will be a key issue for whoever wins the White House. Then things stopped making much sense. He dismissed the issue as ultimately not a very big problem, and not that expensive to fix compared with the money he will raise with his plan to place taxes, also known as tariffs, on all imports coming into the US: “We’re going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” Trump said. Hear that, parents? The cost of child care is small change compared with all the money the US is going to be bringing in from Trump’s tariffs. CNN’s Tami Luhby looked at the broad strokes of this claim and found it is not at all clear how that would work. Some economists fear higher tariffs could raise prices, hurt the economy and set off an international trade war. And what you didn’t hear from Trump is a concrete proposal for a tax credit or a program to transform those tariff dollars into help for affording child care. Read a breakdown of Trump’s response line-by-line. The race to Election Day in November is on. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have picked their running mates and held nominating conventions to rally their parties. They have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. And they’re now gearing up to meet on the debate stage in just three days. We don’t know specifically what will happen between now and Election Day, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect: The Democratic National Committee is flying planes over college football games in Midwestern battleground states featuring banners linking former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance to the conservative policy platform Project 2025. The DNC banners flew over home football games at the University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University, and are planning to fly an additional advertisement over University of Wisconsin’s stadium later today. The banners are the latest effort by Democrats to tie Trump to the controversial platform. Over the University of Wisconsin stadium later today, the DNC will fly a banner that references an in-stadium tradition, reading “Jump Around! Beat Trump + Project 2025.” Trump has previously enjoyed warm welcomes at red state college games. More background on Project 2025: The former president has said he has “no idea” who is behind the 900-page playbook for a potential second Trump term published by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation. But a CNN review found at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, including six of his former Cabinet secretaries, four individuals who were nominated as ambassadors, and his first deputy chief of staff. Over the last few decades, a growing number of Christians have left traditional, predominantly White evangelical churches. Some have left Christianity altogether, while others have joined communities that preach inclusivity, are affirming of LGBTQ rights, and take a social justice approach to the major moral issues of the times — from racial equality to the plight of refugees. The post-evangelical movement predates former President Donald Trump’s political rise, but has been accelerated by his alliance with White conservative evangelical leaders. It’s also part of a broader community of Christians who’ve been turned off by mainstream evangelicalism’s embrace of Republican politics — a group Democrats are hoping to make inroads with in November in battleground states. The evangelical label covers a broad swath of Christian denominations and people of all races. But politically, the predominant image of an evangelical Christian has become a White conservative who votes Republican; opposes same-sex marriage and abortion; and, in the last eight years, supports Trump. Trump critics have said his personal conduct — such as his divorces, his alleged affair with an adult film star and a verdict that found him liable for sexual abuse — are in sharp contrast with the evangelical emphasis on traditional family structures. Still, Trump has maintained overwhelming support among White evangelicals since consolidating their support during the 2016 Republican primary. But liberals are also seeking to gain ground with White evangelical voters. The group Evangelicals for Harris has launched a digital ad campaign to explicitly boost turnout for the vice president. The campaign also plans to organize at hundreds of churches. Read more about the acceleration of the post-evangelical movement We are just a few days away from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump meeting on the debate stage, and the 2024 presidential campaigns will be busy this weekend ahead of Tuesday’s closely watched event in Philadelphia. Here’s what we know about the Harris and Trump teams’ plans today: Kamala Harris’ campaign accepted the terms of Tuesday’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. ABC News officially announced the rules on Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Here are the rules of the debate: In a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the letter from the Harris campaign to the network, shared in part with CNN, said. The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. Tune in to CNN’s special coverage of the ABC debate on Tuesday night. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a new series of ads ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate, tying former President Donald Trump to 2022’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the slew of abortion bans that followed. The three ads, which feature archival clips of Trump touting his role in overturning Roe and suggesting “some form of punishment” for women seeking abortions, are part of a $370 million TV and digital ad buy between Labor Day and Election Day. Trump made the statement about punishment in a 2016 interview and subsequently walked it back after widespread condemnation from presidential rivals and even leading anti-abortion groups. These are the first abortion-focused ads since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket. That was intentional, one official tells CNN, as early ads were focused on introducing and defining Harris. The campaign is now expanding to paid media that will draw contrast with Trump — including on the issue of reproductive rights, which they have long believed will be galvanizing to voters, particularly women. Per the campaign, one ad, titled “Told Us,” will air on TV in battleground media markets during primetime fall programming, while ads “Big Family” and “Laurel” — which feature Alabamian Latorya Beasley and Wisconsinite Laurel Marcinkus offering testimonials on how abortion bans in their states prevented them from accessing in vitro fertilization treatment and seeking abortion care — will air as digital spots. Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign increased its already blistering fundraising pace last month, bringing in $361 million in August and easily surpassing the $130 million raised by her Republican rival last month, her campaign said Friday. The total gives the Democrat a whopping $404 million in cash reserves for the final two-month sprint to Election Day. The cash stockpiled across Harris’ affiliated committees tops the $295 million that Trump’s political operation said it had available, and underscores how much Harris’ historic and late-breaking candidacy has energized donors. The $361 million is by far the best monthly haul for either party this cycle. If this rate continues, Harris is poised to collect more than $1 billion in the condensed campaign window between becoming the party’s de facto nominee in late July and Election Day. Former President Donald Trump echoed past falsehoods about the integrity of US elections and asked police officers to “watch for voter fraud” while addressing the nation’s largest law enforcement union on Friday in North Carolina. After receiving the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, Trump encouraged the officers gathered for his address in Charlotte to monitor for voter fraud because “they’re afraid of you people.” The comments are the latest instance of Trump warning of potential widespread voter fraud in the 2024 presidential election. He has repeatedly suggested without evidence that Democrats will commit voter fraud to swing the results of November’s election, tying the claims to his false conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Trump repeated the baseless accusations at another moment during his remarks, suggesting that he would win the election if an “honest” vote tabulator “came down from on high” to determine the results of the presidential election in each state.  Trump on crime: In accepting the endorsement from the police organization, the former president reiterated his support for local police departments to adopt “stop-and-frisk” policies, the controversial law enforcement tactic that has been linked with increased reports of racial profiling when utilized. He also expressed support for “broken windows policing,” a controversial crime reduction policy that strictly penalizes minor crimes. Trump suggested those policies have helped reduce crime rates when implemented in the past. Former President Donald Trump will not be sentenced in his New York criminal case until after the 2024 election, Judge Juan Merchan announced Friday, explaining that his decision to delay the sentencing is in part to avoid any appearance of affecting the outcome of the presidential race. Merchan wrote in a new four-page letter that he would sentence Trump on November 26 – if necessary – in response to a request from Trump’s lawyers to push back the sentencing. Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult-film star alleging an affair with the former president. But Trump’s sentencing has been on hold for months after Trump’s lawyers have pushed to have the conviction tossed because of the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. Merchan noted the upcoming presidential election in his decision to delay sentencing, saying that part of his reason for doing so was to avoid the appearance that the sentencing was intended to influence the November election. In addition to pushing back the sentencing until November 26, Merchan wrote that he would decide on Trump’s motion to vacate the verdict because of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision on November 12, which is also after the election. Merchan wrote in his letter that the Supreme Court “rendered a historic and intervening decision” with its immunity ruling."
Dick Cheney says he’s voting for Harris in November and Trump ‘can never be trusted with power again’ | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:09 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",2024-09-06T19:32:05.562Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/dick-cheney-kamala-harris-president/index.html,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Friday that he will vote for Democrat Kamala Harris over fellow Republican Donald Trump in the November election, warning that the former president “can never be trusted with power again.” “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a statement. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.” “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he concluded. Harris, according to a statement from campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, was proud to receive Cheney’s support and “deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, first revealed earlier in the day that her father would be voting for the Democratic ticket during remarks at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas. The former Republican congresswoman previously announced that she would be voting for Harris, citing “the danger that Donald Trump poses.” In her remarks Friday, Cheney unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Republican presidential ticket, calling Trump “a depraved human being” and labeling him and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, “misogynistic pigs.” “Every Republican, anybody who’s contemplating casting a vote for that ticket, you know, really needs to think about what they are enabling, what they’re embracing and the danger of electing people who will only honor election results if they agree with the outcome, and who are willing to set aside the Constitution,” she said in Austin. “And you know in the case of Donald Trump, promote, provoke, exploit violence in order to seize power.” Trump, in turn, wrote on his Trump Social platform that “Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter,” referring to the Cheneys as “Republican in name only.” The former congresswoman, who previously told CNN she was committed to doing what was necessary to stop Trump from returning to the White House, said Friday that she expected to campaign against the former president in battleground states this fall. And she suggested that her father shared her views about Trump. “If you think about the moment that we’re in and you think about how serious this moment is, you know, my dad believes – and he said publicly – that there’s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,” she said. Dick Cheney’s support for Harris represents a stunning move for the staunch conservative who was vice president to George W. Bush and a longtime congressman from Wyoming who held several leadership roles in the House Republican Caucus. The former vice president was critical of his party and Trump in the wake of the January 6 attack. In campaign ads for his daughter’s 2022 reelection effort, he called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward.” “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” Dick Cheney said of the former president in the ad. His daughter’s outspokenness against Trump and the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election – including her vote to impeach him led to her losing her leadership position as the No. 3 House Republican. The GOP caucus ousted her as conference chair in May 2021 and replaced her with New York’s Elise Stefanik, a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6 attack. Liz Cheney went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot and ultimately lost her seat in Congress to a Trump-backed Republican primary challenger. She argued Friday that Trump and Vance were “doing everything they can to drive Reagan Republicans away” and that the duo “certainly do not reflect the importance of that Reagan philosophy of peace through strength and a strong national defense.” Cheney said she watched parts of the Republican National Convention in July and took away that “it isn’t just that the party is trying to whitewash what Donald Trump did … the party is embracing it.” Speaking about her decision to support Harris, Cheney said while she has “serious policy disagreements on a whole range of issues,” she feels that “those of us who believe in the defense of our democracy, in the defense of our Constitution, and the survival of our republic have a duty in this election cycle to come together to put those things above politics.” In addition to backing Harris, Cheney also endorsed Democratic Rep. Colin Allred’s effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. This headline and story have been updated with additional information."
Dozens of business leaders endorse Kamala Harris for president | CNN Business,"Updated 1:04 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",2024-09-06T17:03:08.966Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/business/ceos-support-kamala-harris/index.html,"Dozens of business leaders are throwing their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she is the stronger candidate for the American economy and the future of democracy. In a three-page letter, a group of 88 business leaders — including high-profile current and former executives from major public companies across tech, media, and finance — emphasized that they believe a Harris administration can better nurture the private sector. “Her election is the best way to support the continued strength, security, and reliability of our democracy and economy,” the open letter, which was first shared with CNBC, reads. The signees include notable executives such as James Murdoch, Mark Cuban and LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman. The endorsements underscore the support Harris has not only in Silicon Valley, a traditional Democratic stronghold, but in some corners on Wall Street and at some consumer-facing companies. The business leaders argued in the letter that as vice president, Harris advanced “actions to spur business investment in the United States and ensure American businesses can compete and win in the global market.” “She will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment, and she will strive to give every American the opportunity to pursue the American dream,” the letter reads. The signees include high-profile executives, including James Murdoch, the former 21st Century Fox CEO and son of Rupert Murdoch; Michael Lynton, the Snap chairman; Jeremy Stoppelman, the Yelp chief executive; Hoffman, the former LinkedIn chief executive; Jeff Lawson, the Twilio co-founder; Laurene Powell Jobs, the Emerson Collective chief executive; Mark Cuban, the entrepreneur and “Shark Tank” host; Peter Chernin, the TCG founder and former Fox chief operating officer; and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Wndr founder and managing partner and former Walt Disney Studios chairman. On the campaign trail, Harris has positioned herself as perhaps friendlier to business than President Joe Biden. She recently outlined her economy policy platform, which includes tax relief for small businesses. Harris also proposed increasing the long-term capital gains tax rate to 28% for wealthy Americans, a departure from Biden’s 2025 budget, which suggested an even higher rate. Trump has gained the support of a number of CEOs, too, including some prominent names in tech – most notably Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump in July. David Sacks, the billionaire tech investor, co-hosted a Trump fundraiser in June at his San Francisco home and spoke at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Other contributors to America PAC include the Winklevoss twins, Doug Leone of Sequoia Capital and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, according to Federal Election Commission filings. And venture capitalist Peter Thiel is a Trump supporter. The letter is a vote of confidence for Harris as she and former President Donald Trump appear neck and neck ahead of the November election. The endorsement also buoys Harris ahead of the September 10 ABC presidential debate."

Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley refused to say if she believed former President Donald Trump was a “good candidate” when pressed in a CBS News interview. The former South Carolina governor, who served under Trump as US ambassador to the United Nations, was a tough critic of her onetime boss during their primary fight but has since endorsed Trump in a show of party unity. Haley also said during the interview that she is “on standby” to campaign for Trump though she has not been officially asked. Haley also said she is not advising Trump at all on his debate preparation, adding, “That’s his choice.” Earlier today, Trump lashed out at E. Jean Carroll and several other women who have accused him of sexual assault following a hearing where the former president’s attorneys tried to convince a federal appeals court that he should get a new trial after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the onetime columnist. Asked if this is the best use of his time and what the message is to female voters, Haley said her focus has always been on policy, but she acknowledged she wouldn’t have run in the primary if she thought President Joe Biden or Trump were “great candidates.” “I’ve always said, look, if I thought Biden or Trump were great candidates, I wouldn’t have run for president. I ran because I thought I could do a better job.” The North Carolina State Board of Elections is asking the state Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court ruling which required the state to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot.  Ballots were supposed to start going out in North Carolina on Friday, but the appeals court order earlier in the day froze that process.  In a brief to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the state board wrote that the decision to remove Kennedy at this late stage “has thrown our State’s elections process into chaos.”  While the board says thatit has begun the process of recoding ballots without Kennedy’s name, its lawyers argue that a quick reversal from the Supreme Court would “avoid most of the irreparable harm” caused by the lower court ruling. Trump’s reaction: Former President Donald Trump has welcomed the decision, saying in remarks to a police union in the state earlier today that Kennedy’s request to be removed was part of their strategy to send Kennedy’s supporters to Trump. “He’s an incredible team player, and he didn’t want anybody to be voting his name, because, as you know, he fully endorsed us,” Trump said. If it wasn’t clear, Kamala Harris’ campaign is very unhappy about the muted mics rule at next week’s presidential debate with Donald Trump. For weeks, the vice president’s team has raised a fuss about one of the proposed debate rules that the candidates’ mics be muted when it is not their respective turns to speak. Her campaign finally and begrudgingly relented and accepted the rules earlier this week, but not without once again complaining that the muted mics rule would hurt Harris.   As the vice president hunkers down in Pittsburgh for the next stretch of days with advisers to prepare to face off against Trump, a source familiar tells CNN that remedying for the muted mics is a significant part of their mission.  Harris allies have pointed to some of her moments in committee hearings as a senator grilling the likes of Brett Kavanaugh or Bill Barr as exemplifying one of the vice president’s biggest political strengths. The campaign had hoped that she could display that in next week’s debate — responding to, interrupting and questioning the former president in real-time in what is expected to be a closely watched and highly anticipated debate. Her team had also hoped that the mics being on would hurt Trump by showing his more unhinged moments. “People forget how crazy and unhinged he is,” the source said, adding that they hope the muted mics would not have the effect of making the former president look more “restrained and disciplined” than he actually is. Former President Donald Trump echoed past falsehoods about the integrity of US elections and asked police officers to “watch for voter fraud” while addressing the nation’s largest law enforcement union on Friday in North Carolina.  After receiving the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, Trump encouraged the officers gathered for his address in Charlotte to monitor for voter fraud because “they’re afraid of you people.” The comments are the latest instance of Trump warning of potential widespread voter fraud in the 2024 presidential election. He has repeatedly suggested without evidence that Democrats will commit voter fraud to swing the results of November’s election, tying the claims to his false conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Trump repeated the baseless accusations at another moment during his remarks, suggesting that he would win the election if an “honest” vote tabulator “came down from on high” to determine the results of the presidential election in each state.  Trump on crime: In accepting the endorsement from the police organization, the former president reiterated his support for local police departments to adopt “stop-and-frisk” policies, the controversial law enforcement tactic that has been linked with increased reports of racial profiling when utilized. He also expressed support for “broken windows policing,” a controversial crime reduction policy that strictly penalizes minor crimes. Trump suggested those policies have helped reduce crime rates when implemented in the past. Tim Walz’s financial disclosure form highlights one of the things that makes him unusual as a modern political candidate: the relative simplicity of his financial life. The Democratic vice presidential candidate’s finances are straightforward and modest relative to the standards of many of those who have made their wealth in the private sector, according to his disclosure, released by the Federal Election Commission on Friday. Many recent political candidates for high office, by contrast, report millions in income and assets from multiple sources. Walz reported a $210,287 income from his job as governor of Minnesota from January of 2023 through August of this y﻿ear, and a bank account with between $15,000 and $50,000 in cash. He no longer owns a home or rental properties, which had been reflected on his tax returns in prior years. And he doesn’t report owning any individual stocks or bonds. But Walz does have a few retirement savings accounts, and he reported pension income that he will earn as a result of his years as a public school teacher. His six terms in Congress and his 24 years in the National Guard may also earn him pension income, although that is not required to be reported on the FEC form. Read more about Walz’s finances here. Former President Donald Trump reacted to the decision by a North Carolina appeals court that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name must be removed from the state’s ballot.  While speaking to the Fraternal Order of Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump welcomed the decision and said Kennedy pushed to withdraw from the ballot as part of their strategy to send Kennedy’s supporters to Trump. Trump expressed confidence that all of Kennedy’s supporters will vote for him in the state. “It means that all of those who love Bobby — and there’s a lot of them — and all that he stands for, especially regarding the health and well-being of us, can vote,” Trump said. “They vote for me now.” The North Carolina appeals court decision further delayed the start of early voting in the state, which was originally slated to begin today. Former Vice President Dick Cheney has released a statement confirming he will vote for Kamala Harris. The statement comes shortly after the former vice president’s daughter, Liz Cheney, said her father would back Harris during a lengthy interview in Texas, in which she called Trump “depraved” and urged Republicans to abandon the party’s nominee for the sake of democracy. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement that Harris is “proud” to receive Dick Cheney’s support, writing that she “deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” “[Cheney] joins hundreds of Republicans who are backing the Vice President and her patriotic vision of America over former President Trump, because, as Vice President Cheney said, the very future of our republic is at stake in this election,” O’Malley Dillon said. Trump’s response: Trump attacked the former vice president on his social media platform Truth Social, writing “Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter.” “He’s the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris,” Trump said of Dick Cheney while again attacking former Rep. Liz Cheney’s work on the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021 insurrection. This post has been updated with comments from Donald Trump and the Harris campaign. Former President Donald Trump was asked how he would bring down the cost of child care — which is a barrier to people having children and a major drain on parents — at a talk with the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. His response could accurately be described as a ramble without an answer, and it’s worth looking closer at an issue that affects so many Americans. Trump got off to a good start, referencing a provision in his tax cut law that doubled the child tax credit to $2,000 per child for millions of Americans, according to a CNN fact check. Trump’s doubling of the credit is set to expire next year, so this will be a key issue for whoever wins the White House. Then things stopped making much sense. He dismissed the issue as ultimately not a very big problem, and not that expensive to fix compared with the money he will raise with his plan to place taxes, also known as tariffs, on all imports coming into the US: Hear that, parents? The cost of child care is small change compared with all the money the US is going to be bringing in from Trump’s tariffs. CNN’s Tami Luhby looked at the broad strokes of this claim and found it is not at all clear how that would work. Some economists fear higher tariffs could raise prices, hurt the economy and set off an international trade war. And what you didn’t hear from Trump is a concrete proposal for a tax credit or a program to transform those tariff dollars into help for affording child care. Read a breakdown of Trump’s response line-by-line Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Republican presidential ticket — calling former President Donald Trump a “depraved human being” and labeling him and running mate JD Vance “misogynistic pigs.” Cheney, who has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, said she will campaign against Trump in key battleground states, though not as an official surrogate of Harris. The former House Republican called Trump and Vance “misogynistic pigs” and suggested that Vance has a “real women problem” based on his previous comments. She called the idea that Trump would willingly leave office a “fantasy.” Cheney argued that Trump and Vance are driving away Reagan-era Republicans by abandoning the “philosophy of peace through strength and a strong national defense.” She also criticized Vance over saying he would’ve stopped Congress’ certification of the 2020 election, and for still planning to sit down with Tucker Carlson in the wake of the former Fox host platforming a guest who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident. Cheney announced earlier in the festival interview that her father, the former Vice President Dick Cheney, would also vote for Harris — a stunning move for the staunch conservative and one of the most prominent figures in former President George W. Bush’s administration. This post has been updated to reflect Cheney’s plans to campaign against Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic National Committee are seizing on Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance’s comments in the wake of Wednesday’s school shooting in Winder, Georgia.  Vance in Phoenix said Thursday in response to a question from CNN on what policies he supports to end school shootings:  “We’ve got to bolster security so that if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to,” he said.   Harris criticized the remarks in a post on X: “School shootings are not just a fact of life. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can take action to protect our children—and we will.” The DNC also slammed Vance in a statement, writing: “Let’s be clear: no matter what Donald Trump and JD Vance say, tragedies like this do not need to be a ‘fact of life,’ and we don’t just have to ‘get over it’ when Americans, including young children, are violently murdered.” Vance, defending what he said in Phoenix, replied in a post that “Kamala wants to take security out of our schools instead of protecting our children. Instead of addressing her own failures, she lies about what I said. More desperation from the biggest fraud in American politics.” Former President Donald Trump announced that Dr. Ben Carson, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will serve as the national faith chairman for his 2024 presidential campaign. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, served as the 17th US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 2017 to 2021 under Trump’s administration. Both Carson and Trump competed in the 2016 Republican primaries. In October 2023, Carson endorsed Trump’s 2024 presidential bid during a speech in Iowa. Former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Friday said her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in November.  “If you think about the moment that we’re in and you think about how serious this moment is. You know my dad believes and he said publicly that there’s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,” Liz Cheney added. Dick Cheney’s endorsement of Harris is a stunning move for the staunch conservative Republican who was vice president to George W. Bush and a former House member, holding several leadership roles in the GOP caucus. The former vice president was critical of the GOP and Trump in the wake of the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. In campaign ads for his daughter’s 2022 reelection, Cheney called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward.” “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” Dick Cheney said of Trump. Cheney and her father are among the ranks of high-profile Republicans saying they will not back another Trump term. Jimmy McCain — the youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain — told CNN he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Harris in November. This post has been updated with more details of Cheney’s endorsement. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance visited the US-Mexico border wall in San Diego on Friday in a previously unannounced stop, where he railed against Vice President Kamala Harris’ policies and claimed she wants to “give all the benefits of American citizenship to people who shouldn’t even be here” at the expense of US citizens.  Donald Trump’s running mate also defended his opposition to the bipartisan border deal, which Harris said she would sign as president. He said it was “not a real border bill” and “would not have secured the southern border.”  Vance claimed that executive action from Biden and Harris on the border negates their argument that the bipartisan border bill was necessary to do their job. He also dismissed lower reported border crossings, claiming the Biden-Harris administration is redirecting migrants to ports of entry and airports so the numbers look lower than they are.   Other immigration issues: Vance was asked several more questions by reporters, including whether a Trump-Vance administration would reinstate its policy of separating families who cross the southern border illegally and to what degree he supports authorizing the use of deadly force at the border. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during the Republican primary he supported authorizing deadly force against migrants cutting the border wall or bringing drugs across the border.   Standing in front of border officials, Vance urged Harris to visit the border before the November election. He also wouldn’t directly say if a second Trump administration would separate families, but he didn’t rule it out, saying that “if a guy commits gun violence and is taken to prison, that’s family separation, which, of course, is tragic for the children, but you’ve got to prosecute criminals, and you have to enforce the law.” Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year. This week, he vowed to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants. President Joe Biden does plan to watch next week’s debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the White House confirmed Friday.  While Jean-Pierre reiterated Friday that Biden is “proud” of Harris and declined to say if any West Wing officials would join Harris, either remotely or in person in Pittsburgh, for debate prep. “From our side of things, not anyone that I know, but it’s a campaign debate,” she said. “But not anyone that I know of.”   Ahead of Biden’s disastrous June debate with Trump, CNN’s MJ Lee reported the president huddled with an array of campaign and administration officials at Camp David, including White House officials Ron Klain, Bruce Reed, Anita Dunn, Steve Richetti, Annie Tomasini, Ben LaBolt, Jake Sullivan, and others.  A Michigan appeals court has ordered state election officials to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot. The court found that officials had improperly denied Kennedy’s request to remove his name after he suspended his presidential campaign last month.  In Michigan, Kennedy was on the ballot as the nominee of the Natural Law Party, and the state had relied on a section of law which prohibits minor party candidates from withdrawing. But the appeals court found that the section applied only to candidates for state office, not to presidential candidates. A spokesperson for the Michigan secretary of state told CNN they will appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. Absentee voting in Michigan is scheduled to start September 26, although ballots for overseas and military voters are required to go out by September 21.  Why this matters: Kennedy has been trying to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states after suspending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump. Kennedy has encouraged his supporters to back Trump “no matter what state you live in.” Other states: The Michigan decision is the second victory for Kennedy on Friday, after an appeals court in North Carolina ordered that state to remove his name from the ballot as well. Ballots were supposed to start going out Friday, but the process is frozen as the state decides whether to appeal that ruling. If the decision holds, counties will need to restart the ballot printing process without Kennedy’s name. Kennedy is also challenging the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s decision to keep him on the ballot there. CNN’s Aaron Pellish and Eva McKend contributed reporting to this post. The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) on Friday announced it was endorsing former president Donald Trump ahead of Trump’s scheduled speech later in the day to the group’s board in Charlotte, North Carolina. The group, which describes itself as the nation’s oldest and largest police labor organization, endorsed Trump in 2016 and 2020. Yoes said the group considered Trump’s responses to a FOP questionnaire and a letter from the Harris campaign “describing some of their positions on criminal justice and police labor issues.” He said a FOP committee member met with Trump but that “no similar meeting was granted by the Harris-Walz campaign.” “During his first term, President Trump made it clear he supported law enforcement and border security. In the summer of 2020, he stood with us when very few would. With his help, we defeated the ‘defund the police’ movement and, finally, we are seeing crime rates decrease. If we want to maintain these lower crime rates, we must re-elect Donald Trump,” Yoes said. Earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign sought to undercut Trump’s remarks the group, touting a letter from more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country backing her campaign while framing Trump as a convicted felon who urged an unruly mob of supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. The nation’s largest machinists’ union formally endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president after her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz virtually addressed the union at its annual convention on Friday.  Walz, who is spending his Friday in Minnesota, spoke virtually to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) gathering in New York City, where he reiterated his commitment to supporting unions, the campaign announced on Friday. After Walz’s remarks, the union voted to formally endorse the Harris-Walz campaign. IAM president Brian Bryant credited Harris for her role in creating “the most union-friendly administration in American history,” and portrayed Trump as hostile to unions, saying he “broke promise after promise to our members.” The machinists’ union endorsement is latest major union to back Harris’ White House bid, and comes after Walz made a direct appeal to another union group. Walz has previously addressed the government employees union at their gathering in Los Angeles and the firefighters’ union convention in Boston before speaking at a labor event in Milwaukee on Labor Day. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Friday he will still appear with Tucker Carlson in Pennsylvania later this month, after the far-right personality hosted a guest this week who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident. Touting how he and former president Donald Trump stand for free speech and “anti-censorship,” Vance argued the best way to ensure a Holocaust isn’t repeated is to “push back against bad ideas” rather than “suppress them.” “The best way to ensure that doesn’t happen is to debate and push back against bad ideas. It’s not to try to censor and suppress them. I really believe that the more you censor ideas instead of fight back against them, the more you give those ideas power,” Vance said.  As CNN’s Brian Stelter reported Thursday, Darryl Cooper, a podcaster whom Carlson said “may be the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” claimed that Nazi Germany’s mass murder of Jews was an unintended consequence – something akin to poor planning instead of the methodical extermination that it actually was – during an two-hour sit down with Carlson. Vance denied that the interview has become a distraction for the campaign this close to an election. Carlson spoke at the Republican National Convention and is a prominent figure in conservative media. Former President Donald Trump will not be sentenced in his New York criminal case until after the 2024 presidential election, following another delay announced by Judge Juan Merchan on Friday. Merchan wrote in a new letter that he would sentence Trump on November 26 — if necessary — in response to a request from Trump’s lawyers to push back the sentencing. Merchan noted the upcoming presidential election in his decision to delay sentencing, saying that part of his reason for doing so was to avoid the appearance that the sentencing was intended to influence the November election. In addition to pushing back the sentencing until November 26, Merchan wrote that he would decide on Trump’s motion to vacate the verdict because of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision on November 12, which is also after the election. The Manhattan DA’s office said it “stands ready for sentencing on the new date.” While they maintain the case should be thrown out, Trump’s legal team is pleased with Merchan’s decision to delay his sentencing, a source familiar with the reaction tells CNN. Trump was with his lawyers when he found out.  Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to the decision, saying, “there should be no sentencing in the Manhattan DA’s election interference witch hunt.” Trump later echoed that message in a post on Truth Social, repeating his baseless claim that the case was a “political attack” orchestrated by his rivals and saying the case “should have never been brought.” More on the case: The former president was scheduled to be sentenced on September 18. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from his hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. It is one of four criminal cases Trump is facing while running again for president. This post has been updated with more details from the judge’s decision Friday and reactions from Trump, his team and the Manhattan DA. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. County election officials are in a “holding pattern” right now as they wait to see if the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE) appeals an order to remove former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot.  More than 130,000 absentee ballots have already been requested, according to state data, and were set to start going out Friday.  The state board previously denied Kennedy’s and the We The People party’s request to have his name removed, arguing it was not “practical” because ballots had already been printed and a state statute requires them to be sent out 60 days before the election.  A Wake County Superior Court judge also denied his request on Thursday, but issued a 24-hour temporary pause on sending out ballots so Kennedy could appeal.  The NCSBE stated that removing his name and reprinting ballots would come at a high cost to individual counties and create unnecessary delays in the process of getting ballots to voters.  That state board has not indicated if it plans to appeal the order just yet. If the Court of Appeals order stands, counties would need to go through the full process with ballots before any could be sent out.  The start of voting in North Carolina, which was scheduled to begin Friday, will be further delayed to let legal proceedings play out after an appeals court ordered the state to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name from the ballot. In an email obtained by CNN, North Carolina Board of Elections General Counsel Paul Cox told county boards of elections to hold outgoing ballots.  “Our attorneys are reviewing the order and determining how to move forward,” Cox wrote. “No decision has been made on whether this ruling will be appealed.”  Kennedy dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump, but North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request to remove his name from the ballot, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.  He challenged the decision in court and a judge ruled Thursday that his name should remain on the ballot but ordered the state to delay sending ballots out until noon on Friday to give Kennedy time to appeal, leading to the new order by the appeals court Friday morning. Clarification: This post has been updated to note that the appeals court ordered the state to remove RFK Jr.’s name from the ballot. Kamala Harris’ campaign has accepted the terms of Tuesday’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. However, in a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format. The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. ABC News officially announced the rules later Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden. Here are the rules of the face off: Trump, according to ABC News, won a virtual coin flip held earlier in the week to determine podium placement and order of closing statements during the debate. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen. You will be able to watch the ABC debate on CNN Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET. Former President Donald Trump railed against the E. Jean Carroll sex abuse case and denied the allegations against him during remarks to reporters Friday following his appearance in a New York courtroom this morning to appeal the verdict. “I feel sad that I have to come up here and explain it. I have all this legal talent, but legal talent cannot overcome rigged judges. They can’t overcome a 4% Republican area. And I’m disappointed in my legal talent, I’ll be honest with you. They’re good, they’re good people, they’re talented people,” Trump said. Carroll’s attorney said “all options are on the table” in response to today’s comments from Trump, implying they could sue him again for defamation. The brief oral arguments Friday focused on evidence admitted at trial, which Trump’s lawyers say was improperly shown to the jury. No decision was issued Friday. A nine-member jury awarded E. Jean Carroll $5 million in damages following a two-week trial last year. Trump did not attend the trial or call any witnesses, but both the former president and Carroll were in court for Friday’s oral arguments. Carroll sued Trump a second time for defamation after he repeated similar comments about Carroll in 2022. That case went to trial earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages after finding Trump defamed her in 2022 when he repeated similar statements about Carroll. Trump has repeatedly made the multiple legal challenges he faces a key part of his campaign. This post has been updated with comments from Carroll’s attorney. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. Donald Trump’s lawyers filed a reply to the Manhattan District Attorney’s opposition brief late Thursday night doubling down on his request to a federal appeals court to intervene and pause a federal district judge’s order rejecting Trump’s attempt to move the state hush money to federal court — a decision that would send the case back to Judge Juan Merchan in state court if Trump’s appeal is rejected.  Trump’s lawyers again say a stay is necessary to stop his September 18 sentencing, so it does not infringe on the upcoming Presidential election.  Trump’s lawyers acknowledge in the filing that Judge Merchan has already signaled he will likely deny Trump’s pending motion in state court to toss his conviction over presidential immunity.   They also say a stay of the order would send a message to Merchan. A three-judge appeals court panel heard arguments Friday from Donald Trump’s lawyer as the former president seeks a new trial in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the one-time columnist. The brief oral arguments Friday, attended by the former president, focused on evidence admitted at trial, which Trump’s lawyers say was improperly shown to the jury. No decision was issued Friday. Trump attorney John Sauer argued that it was a “quintessential he-said-she-said case” that involves a plaintiff with a political motive to bring a story. Carroll is encouraged by Trump’s political enemies, he says. But the judges were skeptical of Sauer’s evidentiary arguments, cutting him off at one point and asking him to focus on the legal arguments on appeal. The arguments were very in the weeds during the roughly 25-minute hearing, getting into the admissibility of the testimony from Jessica Leeds, who said Trump groped her on an airplane in the 1970s. “It was a crime then to grope someone on a plane, it is a crime now to grope someone on a plane,” said Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan. On the Access Hollywood video, Kaplan said it would’ve been better admitted as a confession. She noted that Trump was in court today, but he also had every chance to show up in court during the trial to take the stand in his own defense, which he did not do. She said the Access Hollywood tape and excerpts from Trump’s deposition were appropriately admitted at trial especially in the absence of Trump’s own testimony. More about the case: The sexual abuse and defamation trial in 2023 was the first of several cases against Trump and marked the first time he was found liable for sexually abusing a woman. The jury returned the verdict within three hours of deliberating, finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll but that she had not proven that Trump raped her. Trump does not face jail time in the case. The case is separate from a related defamation trial that was held earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages after finding Trump defamed her in 2022 when he repeated similar statements about Carroll. This post has been updated with more details from today’s hearing. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is seeking to undercut former President Donald Trump’s remarks to the nation’s largest law enforcement union Friday, touting a letter from more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country backing her campaign while framing Trump as a convicted felon who urged an unruly mob of supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. On a call with reporters organized by the Harris campaign ahead of Trump’s Friday remarks to the National Fraternal Order of Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, retired Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn sought to cast Trump as “an existential threat to our democracy.”  Last month Dunn joined fellow Capitol Police officer Aquilino Gonell and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, both of whom have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump’s handling of January 6th, to campaign for Harris in Michigan.   Durham County North Carolina Sheriff Clarence Birkhead also joined the campaign call Thursday—ahead of Trump’s visit to the state, Birkhead issued a stark warning of what a second Trump term would look like, including possibly “weaponizing the FBI and Justice Department to prosecute his political enemies.” The National Fraternal Order of Police has yet to endorse in the 2024 race—but in 2020, it backed Trump over President Joe Biden, writing, “During his first four years, President Trump has made it crystal clear that he has our backs.” The FOP endorsed Trump in 2016 as well. Former President Donald Trump is expected to appear at a New York City court hearing this morning to appeal the verdict in the E. Jean Carroll sex abuse case. Trump will then hold a news conference at Trump Tower at noon ET before traveling to Charlotte, North Carolina, to deliver remarks to the nation’s largest law enforcement union. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to remain in Pennsylvania and does not have any public events scheduled for Friday. CNN previously reported that Harris is expected to stay in Pittsburgh as she prepares for the presidential debate on Tuesday. She has two pre-taped interviews expected to be released, including on “The Rickey Smiley Show” and Uforia’s Amor 106.3 FM. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, is expected to be in California today. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, does not have any public events scheduled for Friday following his campaign swing this week in Pennsylvania. He taped two radio interviews airing today in “The Morning News with Nancy Kman and Jason Barsky” and “The Chad Holmes Show.” Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview with Uforia’s Amor 106.3 FM, a Spanish-language radio station in Arizona, where she continued to make the case for why she is running in the presidential race while emphasizing her vision for moving the country forward. The interview comes as the vice president continues to court a key demographic ahead of the November election. The latest CNN polls across six battlegrounds showed that in Arizona, former President Donald Trump holds a narrow lead overall, which stood out in these polls as the one state where Harris appears not to have restored support among several key Democratic groups — notably Latino voters, younger voters and White voters with college degrees. According to a news release announcing the interview, the vice president also discussed the current state of the economy, her plan to bolster the middle class with new housing initiatives, business incentives and the stakes of a second Trump term. The full interview will air Friday at 1 p.m. ET on Uforia stations nationwide. Lawyers for Donald Trump and E. Jean Carroll will square off Friday in lower Manhattan as the former president tries to convince a federal appeals court that he should get a new trial after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the one-time columnist. A nine-member jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages following a two-week trial last year. Trump did not attend the trial or call any witnesses, but people familiar with his plans say he is expected to attend Friday’s oral arguments in person. Carroll is also expected to appear. The court will not issue a decision on Friday and one is unlikely before November’s presidential election. The court hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. ET, will bring Trump, the Republican nominee for president, back to what had become a familiar stop during the campaign — the corridors of a courthouse. Unlike the New York civil fraud trial and criminal trial related to hush money payments — where Trump spoke to cameras in the hallways claiming he was unfairly prosecuted and using the opportunity to campaign — there are no cameras inside federal court, though media will be outside tracking his motorcade. The sexual abuse and defamation trial in 2023 was the first of several cases against Trump and marked the first time he was found liable for sexually abusing a woman. Carroll testified in vivid detail that Trump raped her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her in 2019 when he denied the attack, said she wasn’t his type and suggested Carroll made up the story to sell copies of a new book. The jury returned the verdict within three hours of deliberating, finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll but that she had not proven that Trump raped her. Trump does not face jail time in the case. The case is separate from a related defamation trial that was held earlier this year. A jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages after finding Trump defamed her in 2022 when he repeated similar statements about Carroll. Keep reading here about the case. Candidates are investing an enormous amount of money working to get their message out on television in crucial states like Pennsylvania. Democrats have reserved more than 78 million dollars, while Republicans have reserved more than 72 million. And Pennsylvania voters are taking notice.  “How can anybody be swayed by this BS?” Mercurio’s partner, Tammy Ryan, 63, chimed in, dismissing the ads attacking Vice President Kamala Harris.  Ryan says she’s excited Harris is using Pittsburgh as her home base to prep for next week’s crucial debate. The couple describe the Democratic nominee as more qualified, compassionate and prepared than former President Donald Trump, though Mercurio said he hasn’t always voted solely for Democratic candidates.  Some of the college students walking just off Forbes Avenue on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh were not aware the vice president was in town, but all of them told CNN they were registered to vote.   They cited issues like reproductive rights and the economy as the issues of most concern to them but some didn’t want to disclose who they were voting for in the fall.  Sabina Kadariya, a freshman, said she wasn’t sure if she was informed enough to make a “proper vote,” but said the economy was her number one issue and that she’d consider voting for Trump. Rishi Wadgaonkar, a 23-year-old grad student at Carnegie Mellon studying mechanical engineering, said he’s most worried about LGBTQ rights and women’s rights and that Harris best reflects his values. He recently changed his voter registration from New York to Pennsylvania.  “Pennsylvania is really a state that really could go either way,” he told CNN. On the last Saturday of July, with the presidential race in flux from an unthinkable month of turmoil, Donald Trump looked out at an overflowing St. Cloud, Minnesota, crowd and predicted he could accomplish what no Republican presidential candidate had managed in nearly half a century. But since that bold declaration, Trump hasn’t returned to the Gopher State. His running mate JD Vance, on stage with him that evening, hasn’t either. Nor have Minnesotans seen Trump campaign ads on their televisions recently, and they likely won’t this fall. Trump and his advisers once envisioned an ambitious electoral map that would take the presidential race through blue-tinted states and provide the Republican nominee more paths to the White House. In May, surrounded by donors at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump presented his plans to compete for Minnesota and Virginia. His campaign maintained an office in New Hampshire and even held a rally on the Jersey Shore. The final stretch of the race for the White House, though, is setting up to be fought over much more familiar ground. Trump’s campaign and his allies have reserved about $160 million in airtime this fall with nearly all of it planned for the same states that proved pivotal in the 2020 election: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Read more on Trump’s campaign here. Former President Donald Trump is expected to hold a press conference in New York on Friday around noon ET. The campaign did not announce the topic of the press conference. The former president is expected to appear this morning at a New York City court hearing, where his lawyers will attempt to overturn the civil court verdict ordering him to pay $5 million to E. Jean Carroll.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign increased its already blistering fundraising pace last month, bringing in $361 million in August — easily swamping the $130 million raised by her Republican rival last month and giving the Democrat a whopping $404 million in cash reserves for the final, two-month sprint to Election Day, her campaign aides announced Friday. The cash stockpiled across Harris’ affiliated committees tops the $295 million that Trump’s political operation said it had available in its bank accounts and underscores how much Harris’ historic and late-breaking candidacy has energized donors and transformed the 2024 race. The $361 million is by far the best monthly haul for either party this cycle. If this rate continues, Harris is poised to collect more than $1 billion in the condensed campaign window between becoming the party’s de facto nominee in late July and Election Day. She’s already raised more than $615 million since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21, her campaign noted Friday. Last month’s haul topped the $310 million that Harris and Democrats raised in July and came amid the fanfare of her announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and formally accepting her party’s nomination at last month’s celebrity-studded Chicago convention, which also included appearances from Biden and two of his White House predecessors. Continue reading. The judge overseeing the New York hush money case against former President Donald Trump informed both Trump and the Manhattan district attorney that he will render his decision Friday on whether to delay the Republican presidential nominee’s sentencing date, according to a Thursday court filing. The former president is currently scheduled to be sentenced on September 18, but Trump asked to delay the sentencing until after Election Day, a request Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office did not oppose. An attorney for Bragg’s office reported the timing of Judge Juan Merchan’s decision in a letter filed with a federal court in New York where Trump is fighting to move the state case to federal court. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday that while he isn’t helping former President Donald Trump prepare for next week’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, he and his running mate are “constantly trading ideas.” Vance also added that Harris is hoping for a debate moment where she can tell Trump, “I’m speaking,” as she did at the 2020 vice-presidential debate with then-candidate Mike Pence. “She doesn’t want to be the vice president. She wants to be the vice principal,” Vance said. “She really likes, she really likes to just tell people what to do.”"

She’s already raised more than $615 million since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21, her campaign noted Friday. “In just a short time, Vice President Harris’ candidacy has galvanized a history-making, broad, and diverse coalition – with the type of enthusiasm, energy, and grit that wins close elections,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. Last month’s haul topped the $310 million that Harris and Democrats raised in July and came amid the fanfare of her announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and formally accepting her party’s nomination at last month’s celebrity-studded Chicago convention, which also included appearances from Biden and two of his White House predecessors. CLICK FOR CNN’S ROAD TO 270 INTERACTIVE ELECTORAL COLLEGE MAP Harris’ campaign also touted August as the best grassroots fundraising month in presidential history, saying it drew record support from first-time contributors. Nearly 3 million donors gave to the Harris political operation in August, with 1.3 million of them making their first donation of the 2024 election cycle, according to her aides. The third strongest grassroots fundraising day of the campaign came on August 6 – the day Harris announced Walz’s selection, campaign officials said. The August haul does not best the monthly fundraising record of $383 million set by the Biden-Harris political operation in September 2020 at the height of that presidential campaign. The August totals announced by Trump’s team show his fundraising pace has slowed – with his election effort bringing in slightly less last month than the $138.7 million it had collected in July. An earlier CNN analysis of donations that exceeded $200 this cycle found that some of Trump’s biggest fundraising days came in May around his felony conviction in New York, exceeding even the amounts the campaign reported collecting in July during his party’s nominating convention. Harris campaign officials said they are plowing their money into reaching voters, citing a “weekend of action” in the coming days that will feature 2,000 events and a $370 million digital and TV ad campaign running through the election. The campaign said it also has established more than 312 offices with the Democratic Party and employs more than 2,000 staffers with the party across battleground states but warned of a close, hard-fought contest in the home stretch. The presidential campaigns will release a full accounting of their August fundraising and spending later this month in filings with federal election regulators."
Analysis: Vladimir Putin trolls US presidential race with ‘endorsement’ of Kamala Harris | CNN,"Updated 4:09 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",2024-09-05T14:32:47.038Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/vladimir-putin-kamala-harris-endorsement-intl/index.html,"Russian President Vladimir Putin raised eyebrows Thursday when he expressed his support for US Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, flattering the Democratic nominee with some curiously timed remarks. “Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. [Joe] Biden. But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so – we will support her,” Putin said Thursday at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. “She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that she is doing well.” Putin also criticized former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump for placing “so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.” Putin’s comments come on the heels of sweeping sanctions announced by the Biden administration to combat a Russian government-backed disinformation effort to influence the 2024 elections and boost Trump’s candidacy. And despite the Russian leader’s vocal support of the Democrats, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said on Wednesday that three Russian companies – at Putin’s direction – used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to support Trump’s candidacy or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit. So what is Putin trying to accomplish? If the past is any guide, Putin is simply stirring the pot of US domestic politics. In December 2015, Putin praised Trump, calling him the front-runner months before the businessman secured the Republican nomination. “He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” Putin said, calling Trump “an outstanding and talented personality.” Did Putin know something about the 2016 US presidential elections that the pollsters didn’t? No, but the Kremlin leader did little to conceal his dislike of Hillary Clinton, then the likely Democratic nominee. And when purloined Democratic National Committee emails were leaked just ahead of the Democratic National Convention, Putin did not hide his glee. While US officials pointed a firm finger of blame at Russia for the hack, Putin denied the Russian state had anything to do with it. And in remarks at the same forum in September 2016, he praised the leak as a sort of service to the voters, saying, “The important thing is the content that was given to the public.” That content being the embarrassing revelation in the leaked emails that Democratic officials gave preferential treatment to Clinton. In other words, the whole DNC hack episode supported the Kremlin’s view that American democracy is a sham: Nothing matters but power, everything is decided in smoke-filled rooms, and hectoring countries like Russia about adherence to democracy and human rights is hypocritical. Putin’s view of the American political system makes even more sense when we are reminded of an insight from exiled Russian political journalist Mikhail Zygar, the author of “All the Kremlin’s Men.” Zygar noted that Putin loved “House of Cards” – the darkly cynical television series about Washington politics – and even recommended it to his ministers. “That’s his American politics textbook,” Zygar said in an interview. It’s also possible that Putin was simply trolling Harris by winking at a consistent insult from Trump about the way she laughs. So if Putin’s take on US election politics is seen through the lens of “House of Cards,” then, Putin’s support of Harris is a sort of Frank Underwood move: A kind of endorsement poisonous to its recipient.

Fact check: Trump falsely claims Harris used notes in CNN interview | CNN Politics,"Published 9:31 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",2024-09-05T13:31:05.947Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-kamala-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump delivered his usual assortment of long-debunked false claims in an appearance on Fox News in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night. But one of the false claims was new. Trump, who has repeatedly insulted the intelligence of his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, claimed that Harris used speaking notes to assist her in her interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash last week. Trump said: “If you watch that that interview, she had notes. That means she knew the questions. And she had notes. She kept looking down – ‘uhhh.’ Nobody wants to cover it.” He continued, “I know all about notes. I mean, you know, it’s all right if people know that. But she wasn’t supposed to have notes.” Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. Harris did not use notes during the CNN interview. Photos and videos of the interview make clear that the only notes on the table belonged to Bash, as CNN staffers who were present confirm. And CNN did not inform Harris of any questions in advance; a CNN spokesperson called Trump’s claim that Harris had prior knowledge of the questions “categorically false.” Here are some of the other false claims Trump made at the Fox News event on Wednesday. Terror during Trump’s presidency: Trump repeated his previous false claim that there were “no” terror attacks by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a mass murder in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was a terrorist attack carried out in support of ISIS; Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. Trump’s Justice Department also alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.

Iran during Trump’s presidency: Trump repeated his previous false claim that Iran was so “broke” during his presidency that “they didn’t have the money for Hamas and for Hezbollah, they didn’t have the money for anybody.” Iran’s funding for Hamas, Hezbollah and other terror groups continued throughout his presidency, as Trump’s own administration acknowledged in 2020, though experts say Iran did make funding cuts when its economy was squeezed by Trump sanctions.

Trump’s tax cuts: Trump repeated his previous false claim that “I gave you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.” His major 2017 tax cut was not the biggest in history either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. You can read more here. Harris’ immigration role: Trump repeated his previous false claims that Harris was “border czar” and “in charge” of the border. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security; President Joe Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Hondurasin an attempt to address the “root causes” that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. You can read more here, Migrants and mental health facilities: Trump repeated his previous false claim that foreign countries are “emptying out their prisons and jails, they’re emptying out their mental institutions and insane asylums” so people can travel to the US as migrants. His own campaign has been unable to substantiate such claims, and experts say they have seen no evidence for them."
Emhoff’s reaction to hostage murders underscores unique way he speaks for Harris | CNN Politics,"Published 8:31 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",2024-09-05T12:31:38.224Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-israeli-hostages/index.html,"The murders of six more Israeli hostages marked a critical new moment for Doug Emhoff, who’s speaking out on his own and Kamala Harris’ behalf, as only a Jewish American and the spouse of a presidential candidate can. “In light of the retraumatizing of the tragedy of the weekend, speaking here, even though it’s so hard to do – this is a way that I can use this voice,” the second gentleman said Tuesday at a vigil for the hostages in Washington, DC. For Emhoff, it’s a reflection of historical circumstances: he has spoken often about how he reconnected to his Judaism after seeing the response he received when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris for the ticket four years ago. Then as second gentleman, he felt compelled first by the rise in antisemitism and then the October 7 Hamas terror attacks to speak up about how much hurt he felt. Now, with his wife suddenly the Democratic nominee and both of them thrust more into the spotlight — and as the world approaches the anniversary of those attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza — friends and advisers say they’re seeing a man continuing to search for his own response to an issue that is policy, politics and personal all at once. And advisers and campaign aides are trying to match strategy with a principal whose emotions and determination have struck them in both his private comments and public remarks. As Donald Trump attacks Jews who vote for Harris as being self-hating, it was Emhoff who sat in the front row of Tuesday night’s vigil – brought together by an array of Washington-area Jewish groups and hosted at the Adas Israel synagogue – wiping tears from his eyes, then struggling to speak through his grief as he stepped to the microphone. “This is raw,” he said, telling the hundreds assembled he was there “as a fellow congregant, fellow mourner and as a Jew.” “When Doug talks about how the VP encouraged him to be closer to his Jewish faith and take on antisemitism as an issue, it may be affirming to Jewish voters,” a friend of Emhoff told CNN. “But it also illuminates how they support each other as a couple, the connection to faith they both have, and that is important for all voters to know.” As Biden has amped up public pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal, some outside allies have suggested the Israeli prime minister is instead trying to maneuver toward Trump’s benefit. And with voters on all sides of the issue uncertain of where Harris stands, every twist in events could complicate her efforts to win in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab and Jewish populations, but also some other key battlegrounds where the number of Jewish voters is larger than the 2020 margins of victories. Several people who know Emhoff said that Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s murder hit him particularly hard. He knew the 23-year-old’s parents. He’d just seen them at the Democratic National Convention. The ache of knowing that the hostage only a few years younger than his daughter had been killed just days before his body was found has been overwhelming. It’s left him raw. Going to the vigil, one person who knows him told CNN, was about standing up as a leader — but also about feeling like he needed to be with his community amid the horror and the shock. “How you all feel right now is how I feel. And how we all feel is something that Kamala hears directly from me almost each and every day,” Emhoff said on Tuesday night. “I share what I’m feeling with Kamala as my partner, as my wife – not just as our vice president. She knows. She gets it. She cares. She’s committed. Hersh’s loss feels so personal to the two of us, just like it feels to all of you.” Ted Deutch, the former Florida congressman and current CEO of the non-partisan American Jewish Committee, praised the second gentleman while introducing him at the vigil for “reminding the world that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us.” “He understands the unique agony of feeling that our cries for justice have gone unheard and yet he knows that our strength lies in our unity,” he added. Emhoff has long stressed that he has no policy role in the administration or the campaign, and he continues not to. But the perspective has changed — until six weeks ago, he was married to a leader who was deferential to policy set by Biden. But after being elevated to the Democratic nominee, his wife is being watched closely for any shifts on Israel policy she might make. Campaign aides say they expect Emhoff to continue to be key as he races around the country campaigning and fundraising, with anxiety already building over how the anniversary of October 7 will play out less than a month before Election Day. Emhoff says he won’t stop speaking out, linking the need to remind the world repeatedly of what happened to the events of the Holocaust. “If we don’t tell this story again and again,” he said at the vigil, “we have no hope of ‘Never Again.’”"
Judge holds hearing in election interference case against Donald Trump | CNN Politics,No Edits Made,2024-09-05T12:00:40.244Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hearing-jan-6-election-09-05-24/index.html,"At Thursday’s hearing in the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump — the first proceeding before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the Supreme Court granted him some immunity in the prosecution — the trial judge did not finalize a schedule for the next steps in the case, but previewed her thinking on how the case should advance. She was skeptical of the Trump team’s request that she first decide whether the then-Vice President Mike Pence-related allegations in the indictment were immune, and Chutkan repeatedly stressed the discretion she believes she has for how she structures the proceedings in her courtroom. Though Thursday’s one-hour-and-15-minute hearing was mainly about process, a sharp back-and-forth she had with a Trump attorney brought attention to how the 2024 election is looming over the case. Here are key takeaways from the hearing: Chutkan will lay out next steps as soon as Thursday: The judge did not issue a ruling from the bench but said she planned to put forward a scheduling order as soon as possible, which she said could be later Thursday. That could lay out the steps in the case that will play out before the November election. During the hearing, prosecutors explained why they want the chance to file an opening brief that would argue why they believe their new indictment complies with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. Trump’s attorneys argued against that and proposed a longer schedule. Election looms over hearing, but Chutkan says she’s not considering it: As the judge debated with Trump attorney John Lauro over how quickly she should move to allow the prosecution to file a brief defending their indictment on immunity, they eventually addressed the political elephant in the courtroom: the looming presidential election. After a back and forth with the judge over what the process should be for deciding the immunity issues in the case, Lauro acknowledged that among his team’s concerns about the prosecutors’ proposed approach is what would be aired on the court’s public record at a “sensitive time.” The crux of the process disagreement comes down to who gets to file their immunity brief first and when that brief gets filed. Trump has repeatedly complained that the new indictment filed last week was an attempt to interfere with the campaign — just as he complained about his New York trial in the spring — but Chutkan’s comments signaled she isn’t going to wait until after November 5 before moving forward on the issues that have to be dealt with in the case following the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. Read more key takeaways from the hearing CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report. Judge Tanya Chutkan fired off several zingers from the bench during the first hearing in Donald Trump’s election interference case in almost a year. They nearly all were in response to Trump defense attorney John Lauro: Special counsel Jack Smith, with a beard even longer than the last time he attended a court hearing in a Trump case in Florida at the beginning of summer, watched with lively reaction, looking around, smiling occasionally. Surrounded by several security agents in a full courtroom, he smirked when the courtroom conversation brought up the coming challenges to his Constitutional authority. But the moment in which the tenor of the courtroom changed when Lauro mentioned to the judge that it’s a “very sensitive time in our nation’s history.” Chutkan and Lauro had been quipping back and forth so quickly the court reporter said she had some trouble keeping up with the cross-talk. But with that line from Lauro, Chutkan leaned back in her chair, sighed, then interrupted him with a finger up. She paused, halting down their pace. Judge Tanya Chutkan hinted that she was dubious of Donald Trump’s coming attempt to get the Washington, DC, case dismissed on the grounds that special counsel Jack Smith was supposedly illegally appointed. She took a swipe at the ruling that Judge Aileen Cannon handed down dismissing the classified documents case on that basis, calling that ruling not particularly “persuasive.” Chutkan also emphasized that a concurrence by Justice Clarence Thomas — which Cannon’s ruling cited — that laid out those constitutional concerns was “dicta,” meaning non-binding language. And she brought up that there is already DC Circuit precedent in the books upholding the constitutionality of special counsels, which would be binding on her as a trial judge in Washington, DC. Nevertheless, she is letting the Trump team take a shot. However, when his lawyers file the motion that asks for permission to formally make those arguments, they must elaborate on why they should be allowed to do so, Chutkan said. Judge Tanya Chutkan addressed setting a trial date in the federal election subversion case against former President Donald Trump as she concluded Thursday’s hearing, but she did not schedule a date. Chutkan acknowledged the likelihood that the issue of presidential immunity in the case will continue to be litigated and appealed once she hands down her next round of rulings on the next matter. Both parties agreed. “That’s all I have,” Chutkan said. “Thank you all.” The parties are now discussing discovery in the case. Defense attorney John Lauro says that there is likely new discovery because prosecutors never had to weigh the issue of immunity before. “We’re still getting discovery in this case,” Lauro says. Lauro says there are also unresolved discovery issues in the case. The defense attorney says the motion to dismiss will be a legal argument and won’t require more discovery or evidence. Judge Tanya Chutkan says it makes sense to resolve the pending discovery motions sooner rather than later. She asks Lauro if he has any objections to that, and he says he does not. Tom Windom says prosecutors do not expect to make any immunity-based discovery disclosures. “We have nothing further to provide” in discovery, he says. He adds that the defense has not told them what other evidence they think the government should hand over on the issue of immunity. Chutkan says that she is going to “assume” the parties will continue to work together to resolve discovery issues on their own. Chutkan says she will consider other motions over discovery together. Judge Tanya Chutkan is now moving to the Supreme Court’s decision limiting how prosecutors can use obstruction charges against January 6 defendants. Defense attorney John Lauro says that “it will be a whole new brief” to address the issue of obstruction in the case. Chutkan pushes Lauro over his repeated assertion that defense attorneys are now dealing with a new indictment. It’s not new, she says, its the same charges. And of the allegations: “It’s not more stuff, it’s less.” Donald Trump’s team is trying to tee up a key early battle: Whether the entire indictment should fall if former Vice President Mike Pence-related conduct is immune.  Trump’s lawyers previewed the arguments in Friday’s filing. In Thursday’s hearing, Trump attorney John Lauro is focused on trying to convince Judge Tanya Chutkan that if she decides Trump’s interactions with Pence are covered under the immunity ruling, the whole case must be thrown out. Lauro contends that moving forward that way is actually the more economical approach, because it could save the court from doing lengthy briefings on other allegations in the indictment if she decides the whole case must be dismissed on the Pence issue alone. The argument does not appear to be resonating with Chutkan, who told Lauro that that she does not believe that deciding the Pence matter first — and whether its fatal to the entire case — is what “I was instructed to do by the Supreme Court.” Smith’s team pushed back as well, arguing that Trump lawyers were taking a line out of the Supreme Court opinion out of context. If the Pence-related conduct is deemed immune, “It is not an automatic dismissal of the indictment,” prosecutor Thomas Windom said. Prosecutor Tom Windom again says that it would be prudent for the judge to decide immunity issues first. The judge could then decide whether to dismiss the case, he adds. Defense attorney John Lauro says that immunity should be decided before statutory motions, which Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed with. The judge says that “immunity is the linchpin here.”  Judge Tanya Chutkan is now turning to another potential defense motion over whether the grand jury improperly heard evidence about former Vice President Mike Pence. She says she wants to know whether this is a separate challenge to the indictment than the one they have already discussed. Donald Trump attorney John Lauro says the motions are separate but the communication with Pence will be the main focus as they move to dismiss the superseding indictment. Prosecutor Tom Windom responds, saying, “It seems that what Mr. Lauro is suggesting is a two-step process.” Trump’s defense has returned to an argument over whether special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment to lead the election interference case was legitimate, alluding to a ruling by a federal judge in Florida to throw out the classified documents case — a separate investigation into the former president also led by Smith and his team. During a protracted back-and-forth with Judge Tanya Chutkan, defense attorney John Lauro raises the “illegitimacy of Mr. Smith.” “We have an illegitimate prosecutor, we have an illegitimate indictment, and we have illegitimate legal issues raised in that indictment,” Lauro says. He points to the ruling by Florida Judge Aileen Cannon — who has faced intense scrutiny over her handling of the documents case — to suggest something similar could be done in this case regarding Smith’s appointment. But Chutkan says there is DC circuit precedent that may lead her to deny a motion to dismiss Smith. And Chutkan sounds skeptical of the Cannon ruling. Lauro is also arguing that the court should factor in criticism of Smith’s appointment from conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote in a concurrence on the court’s presidential immunity ruling that Attorney General Merrick Garland may have violated the Constitution when he appointed Smith. Prosecutors respond: Prosecutor Tom Windom responds to the arguments from Lauro, saying Trump’s team could have filed on the issue of Smith’s appointment earlier. “They knew about the issue, they had the opportunity to file before,” Windom says, arguing that Trump should have filed his challenge to Smith before the case was paused for appeals. “They are suggesting somehow that a lone justice’s concurrence” has “somehow reopened the issue” of Smith’s appointment, Windom says. Bottom line: Chutkan says she will allow Lauro to file a motion on the issue of Smith’s appointment, but says she wants him to address the DC precedent she referenced. During Thursday’s hearing, prosecutor Thomas Windom repeatedly deferred to Judge Tanya Chutkan on the timing for when the special counsel’s office could file a brief defending the new indictment as complying with the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. Chutkan pressed Windom to give a timeline for how quickly prosecutors could file the brief the special counsel proposed that would begin the process for Chutkan to sort out the immunity issues in the federal election subversion case.  She continued to ask Windom for a date, and he said that prosecutors had “begun” writing estimated two to three weeks. At the same time, he emphasized that prosecutors would leave the exact timing “to the court’s discretion.” Left unsaid was how a briefing schedule would be inevitably intertwined with the election calendar, with Election Day — now two months away.  In the brief, Windom said prosecutors “would set forth for the court” why the conduct is “private in nature and not subject to immunity.”  The political elephant has made its appearance in Judge Tanya Chutkan’s courtroom. After a back and forth with the judge over what the process should be for deciding the immunity issues in the case, Trump attorney John Lauro acknowledges that among his team’s concerns about the prosecutors’ proposed approach is what would be aired on the court’s public record at a “sensitive time.” The crux of the process disagreement comes down who gets to file their immunity brief first and when that brief gets filed. Lauro contends that if the special counsel Jack Smith’s team gets to file an opening brief on the immunity question first, it’s “unfair” and “prejudicial” to Trump. Instead, he argues, Trump should file the initial brief in the form of the motion to dismiss, after he has some time to obtain additional discovery from the government. Lauro keeps claiming that going the prosecutors’ way would run afoul of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. Chutkan seems skeptical, and brings up the discretion she believes the high court has left to how to move forward. Lauro denied that his arguments were connected to the presidential campaign. Prosecutor Tom Windom is back to respond to arguments from Trump attorney John Lauro, who argued vigorously against the schedule set out by the special counsel’s team. Windom says some of Lauro’s arguments are moot, because there is no additional evidence in the case to turn over. The prosecutor declines to say how much of their evidence should remain under seal. Remember: Lauro has been arguing against a “rush to judgment” and suggesting a protracted schedule, including an evidentiary hearing and a chance to review evidence from the prosecution. He has also suggested it’s unfair to let prosecutors enter evidence into the public record against Trump so close to the 2024 presidential election, though Judge Tanya Chutkan has said she won’t factor the electoral schedule into her decisions. Judge Tanya Chutkan and defense attorney John Lauro are going back and forth in court now. “We are talking about the presidency of the United States,” Lauro says. “I am not talking about the presidency,” Chutkan says. “I am talking about a four count indictment.” Chutkan continues: “The decisions here will not just affect this case, it will affect the republic going forward” Lauro responds. Defense attorney John Lauro again argues that Judge Tanya Chutkan may rule that the former Vice President Mike Pence evidence is immune and “as an initial matter the court can dismiss this case right away.” Chutkan says that the Supreme Court could have decided the entire indictment was flawed, adding that she doesn’t agree that she can dismiss the superseding indictment out of hand. “The ruling is clear, crystal clear,” Lauro argues of the Supreme Court, prompting a chuckle from Chutkan. Lauro is arguing that evidence in the case needs to be made public before a long fight over presidential immunity begins. That is because he thinks that the indictment should be dismissed immediately over grand jury issues, and that arguing over immunity would no longer be necessary. Lauro says that prosecutors want to “leap frog” over grand jury issues. Judge Tanya Chutkan suggests that it is too early to set a trial date. Defense attorney John Lauro continues to push back, saying the potential brief from prosecutors would be “a rush to judgement.” Defense attorney John Lauro continues to fight for a protracted schedule. Lauro says that he believes defense attorneys and the special counsel will be able to work out some of these evidentiary issues around immunity themselves. “What is the rush to judgement that the special counsel is suggesting,” Lauro says. “There is something unseemly” about how quickly this case is going, Lauro says. Judge Tanya Chutkan pushes back, saying that “we are hardly sprinting to the finish line here.” “We all know that whatever my decision on immunity is is going to be appealed,” Chutkan says, adding that “there needs to be some forward motion in this case.”  The Trump team is being “pretty dramatic” in their arguments in court today, CNN’s chief legal correspondent Paula Reid said, when compared to what the defense has submitted in filings. Reid added that the defense attorneys also argued “that the Supreme Court has already decided whether prosecutors can use evidence around Vice President Mike Pence and the judge cut him off and said, ‘I would disagree with that.’ And this is significant because this is really going to be the next area of dispute between prosecutors, defense attorneys and clearly, the judge. The judge noting here that it is up to her, the Supreme Court has given her discretion on this issue.” Reid said that it’s looking like this may not go the way defense attorneys had hoped, but their number one goal here today is to delay anything here until after November. Judge Tanya Chutkan and defense attorney John Lauro are sparring over which legal team would file briefings on the issue of presidential immunity first, and whether Trump’s attorneys can have access to prosecutors’ evidence before those filings are due. Lauro says they’re not suggesting the case should go into the fall of next year, but rather that the issues at hand need to be dealt with carefully. Chutkan says “immunity needs to be dealt with as early as possible.” But Lauro is asking for an evidentiary hearing, saying, “We need a full and robust record.” He adds that “it’s incredibly unfair that they (prosecutors) are able to put in the public record” evidence against Trump at this time, suggesting that it’s too close to the election. “I am definitely not getting dragged into” the election, the judge adds Defense attorney John Lauro wants Judge Tanya Chutkan to first make a decision on whether the superseding indictment against former President Donald Trump itself is legitimate. Lauro explains that because evidence about former Vice President Mike Pence’s role in the certification of electoral college certification was presented to a grand jury, prosecutors have already breached presidential immunity protections. Chutkan suggests handling the issue as part of their reply to the government’s first brief on immunity. Trump attorney John Lauro says that the Supreme Court “already decided” whether prosecutors can use evidence around former Vice President Mike Pence. Chutkan responded, “I would disagree with you, Mr. Lauro They sent that to me to figure out.” This issue of communications with Pence “needs to be decided right away,” Lauro said. “I don’t think I can decide that as a matter of law. I’d be risking reversal if I tried to,” Chutkan said of the Pence evidence. Judge Tanya Chutkan drilled down on what she saw as the disagreement between the two parties for how the case should move forward. She sees it as “two main questions:” How to resolve immunity question and how that approach fits in with the rest of the schedule. Her ability to distill the 10 pages of courts filings submitted Friday that laid out Donald Trump’s and the special counsel’s differing proposals is trademark to her no-nonsense style and her desire to move proceedings like these in an efficient matter. Though she won’t finalize the schedule at the hearing, she wants to do so soon after, and to do so, she wants to keep the discussions today very focused on where the parties diverge in their preferred approaches. Trump’s attorney John Lauro is now discussing the schedule with Judge Tanya Chutkan. The defense discussion follows a lengthy exchange between the judge and the prosecution about how they envision the proceedings unfolding. Lauro tells the judge he “can’t imagine a more unfair protocol” on proceeding with the special counsel’s proposed schedule for the case. Lauro argues the proposal “turns the criminal rules on its head,” arguing that it denies the defense the ability to go through discovery issues. Chutkan asks why Lauro can’t deal with these issues simultaneously, saying, “We can all walk and chew gum at the same time.” But Lauro insists “we need everything that we are entitled to … before we address these issues.” Prosecutor Tom Windom and the judge are discussing timing for the prosecution’s brief, which Windom says would address why they believe the “presumption of immunity is rebutted” related to former Vice President Mike Pence. “What we have said is that we leave the specific date to the court’s discretion” Windom says of filing deadlines. But, he notes, “we do actually have to write this thing.” Judge Tanya Chutkan jokes that maybe Windom has it in his binder. “I would be surprised by that,” Windom says. Windom says that prosecutors have “begun” writing those arguments, but expect they need two to three weeks to finish. Chutkan notes that would put the brief at the end of September. Judge Tanya Chutkan calls prosecutor Thomas Windom to the lectern to discuss immunity. “Why should we depart from the ordinary course here?” Chutkan asks Windom. “I don’t think that we are in a typical situation,” Windom says. “We are in a place where the Supreme Court has created new law.” “A guiding principle here is that we should structure a schedule” that leads to only one appeal, Windom says. Windom says he wants a single appeal to deal with all immunity issues “at the same time, simultaneously.” More on the prosecutor’s stance: He also said prosecutors are asking for a “comprehensive” discussion to both “pled and unpled acts” in order for Chutkan to make holistic decisions on the issue of immunity. Windom says that the special counsel’s immunity arguments would contain “a number of exhibits,” including transcripts of grand jury testimony. In the brief, the prosecutor says, “we would set forth for the court” why the conduct is “private in nature and not subject to immunity.” The prosecutor says that their arguments would also explain why they could use evidence around former Vice President Mike Pence’s involvement in Trump’s alleged plot. Judge Tanya Chutkan says she sees “two main questions” today in court: how to resolve the immunity issue and what the rest of the schedule will look like. “Let’s first talk about the immunity issue,” Chutkan says. Judge Tanya Chutkan is now reviewing what she has done since the election interference case returned to her jurisdiction last month, and which motions or court filings are still outstanding. Before doing so, Trump’s attorney confirmed that the former president understands the substance of the charges against him and received a copy of the new indictment. Chutkan is going through the timeframe of several issues including expert witnesses and exhibit lists before the case was stayed pending appeal. “Obviously, all those deadlines have long since passed,” the judge says. She also notes how many days attorneys had left to file briefings before the case was paused. Chutkan also notes that “there’s also some common ground” on scheduling between the parties. She says that both sides identify issues that need to be resolved, including on immunity. Former President Donald Trump is being arraigned on the superseding indictment, Judge Tanya Chutkan said in court Thursday. Trump’s attorney John Lauro just pled not guilty to the superseding indictment. Chuktan confirmed Trump’s plea of not guilty. “That is right,” Lauro responded. “I will consider his arraignment for the superseding indictment to be complete,” Chutkan said. Chutkan also said she doesn’t “intend to finalize a schedule at the hearing,” but added she hopes to do so as soon as possible — and possibly as soon as later today. Judge Tanya Chutkan is at the bench and the hearing to consider how to proceed with special Jack Smith’s election interference case against Donald Trump is underway in a federal courthouse in Washington, DC. She is reviewing the Supreme Court’s mandate on presidential immunity. Both parties introduced themselves to the judge, including prosecutors Thomas Windom and Molly Gaston. “It’s been almost a year, you look rested Mr. Lauro” Chutkan told Trump’s attorney, John Lauro. “Life was almost meaningless without seeing you,” Lauro said. “Enjoy it while it lasts,” Chutkan replied, laughing. More context: This is the first hearing in the federal election subversion case since prosecutors revised their indictment to try to bring their case in line with a Supreme Court ruling extending to Trump some presidential immunity in the prosecution. Cameras are not allowed into Chutkan’s courtroom, but CNN’s reporters are there and will provide live updates as the hearing unfolds. Here’s what to watch for in today’s hearing. While Donald Trump is not expected to be in attendance Thursday for the first court hearing since prosecutors reworked their indictment in his election interference case, his team of lawyers are in Washington, DC, to argue on his behalf. Special counsel Jack Smith is back in the spotlight as he’s reworked his indictment in the election interference case against former President Donald Trump in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. Smith not only narrowed the allegations against Trump but also removed references to communications between Trump and federal government officials.  His determination to rescue his case after the Supreme Court immunity ruling underscores the huge personal stake that Trump has in winning in November and reacquiring the executive authority that would allow him to end federal proceedings against him. Smith was also special counsel in a separate probe regarding Trump’s taking of classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. Although the criminal case was dismissed last month, Smith is arguing to revive the case with a vigorous defense of its authority. Smith has investigated members of both parties, handling some of the highest-profile political corruption cases in recent memory, with mixed outcomes. His experience ranges from prosecuting a sitting US senator to bringing cases against gang members who were ultimately convicted of murdering New York City police officers.  His career spans multiple stints in the Justice Department and international courts, which until his appointment had allowed him to keep a relatively low profile in the oftentimes brassy legal industry.  For several years, Smith lived outside of the United States as the chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, a role he assumed in 2018 in which he investigated war crimes in Kosovo. Former President Donald Trump’s legal team is heading into today’s hearing with the goal of convincing Judge Tanya Chutkan not to schedule any substantive hearings before the upcoming election, according to a source familiar with the legal strategy. They expect today’s hearing will be brief — an hour or so — and that a “win” for them would be just getting the judge not to schedule any newsy hearings, such as testimony with former Vice President Mike Pence, before November. They do not believe there will be any “mini trial” in this case, as some legal analysts have suggested.  The Trump team also does not believe that the former president has caused problems for himself in this case with recent comments acknowledging that he lost the election.  There are still many issues that have to be litigated before this case can go to trial and, if Trump is not reelected and the federal cases are dismissed, the Trump team believes this case will make at least one more trip back to the Supreme Court.   As the case moves forward, Trump’s lawyers are going to argue that the certain key pieces of evidence must be tossed under the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. If the judge does not agree, they will appeal all the way to the top court. What may happen next: While the Supreme Court doesn’t have to take the case, the Trump team believes there was an implicit invitation in the court’s decision to come back with additional issues. The Trump team predicts this case would go to trial until next fall at the earliest, if it goes at all. Former President Donald Trump is facing four criminal cases while aiming to regain the White House in November. In May, Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush money trial in Manhattan criminal court — becoming the first former president in US history to be convicted of a felony. Here are key things to know about each case: Election interference case: Special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment on August 27 in his investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims down the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped. The Trump campaign has previously denied the allegations and Trump pleaded not guilty to all four counts. A judge will hold a hearing today in Washington, DC, to discuss how to proceed in the case. Classified documents case: Trump was indicted in June 2023 by a federal grand jury in Miami for taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. Both Trump and his aide Walt Nauta have pleaded not guilty. On July 27, 2023, the special counsel charged Trump with three new counts, including one additional count of willful retention of national defense information. US District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case on July 15, 2024, saying in a ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution. Hush money case: Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush-money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. On May 30, he was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree by 12 jurors. Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. Further, they alleged he was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including the $130,000 payment. Trump pleaded not guilty. He will not be sentenced until September 18, a New York judge ruled on July 2, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity. Fulton County case: An Atlanta-based grand jury on August 14, 2023, indicted Trump and 18 others on state charges stemming from their alleged efforts to overturn the former president’s 2020 electoral defeat. Four people have pleaded guilty. The charges, brought in a sweeping investigation led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, cover some of the most overt efforts by the former president and his allies to meddle in the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty via court filing, waiving an in-court appearance as allowed by Georgia law. On June 5, a Georgia appeals court indefinitely paused the case until a panel of judges rules on whether Willis should be disqualified. Special counsel prosecutors reworked the indictment against Donald Trump to narrow the allegations to try to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity earlier this summer. That ruling granted immunity to some of Trump’s conduct that falls within his official powers. Prosecutors reworked the indictment in two ways – by cutting language about the former president’s interactions with senior Justice Department officials, and by adding language describing when Trump was acting as a candidate and not the president. Prosecutors noted several times that Trump didn’t have any constitutionally-assigned presidential duties regarding the post-election transition of power. Here are some of the things that were changed in the new indictment: The judge in the case will hold a status conference on Thursday where both sides will discuss how the case moves forward. It’s the first hearing in the case after the immunity ruling. Read more about what was edited in the new indictment against Trump. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has former President Donald Trump’s criminal case in Washington, DC, back in her hands and will decide how to proceed with the federal case about efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Chutkan, of the DC District Court, is left with a number of crucial decisions to make, including whether Trump’s efforts count as official acts following the Supreme Court issuing a game-changing ruling on presidential power. The judge already has decided over a dozen major pre-trial issues, ruling in favor of special counsel prosecutors in most of those. She’s also rejected a series of motions by Trump’s lawyers, including refusing to strike language that Trump believed was “inflammatory” from the indictment and to dismiss the case entirely based on his First Amendment claims. Chutkan has repeatedly spoken out in very strong terms against the efforts to overturn the election and disrupt the transfer of power. She has presided over dozens of January 6 criminal prosecutions and is known as a harsh sentencer for those convicted of charges related to the US Capitol riot. Chutkan, a Jamaica native, has been on the federal bench for a decade.  After graduating from University of Pennsylvania Law School, Chutkan spent more than a decade working as a public defender in Washington, DC. According to her biography on the court website, Chutkan “argued several appellate cases and tried over 30 cases, including numerous serious felony matters” as a public defender. Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges laid out in special counsel Jack Smith’s retooled election subversion indictment against him in federal court. The pleading came in a Tuesday court filing, which also indicated he wished to be excused from appearing in person at an upcoming court hearing in the case. Thursday will mark the first court hearing before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the case was paused for the US Supreme Court to determine the extent of presidential immunity to which Trump is entitled. Chutkan said later Tuesday that Trump does not have to appear at the hearing Thursday – when the former president’s formal arraignment will occur. Trump’s attorneys plan to attend the hearing. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Wednesday that he’s standing by special counsel Jack Smith and insisted the superseding indictment against former President Donald Trump did not violate Justice Department rules around elections. The Justice Department has a general policy against taking overt investigative steps against a candidate close to an election, usually referred to as the “60-day rule.” Trump’s attorneys have previously pointed to this policy to fight against actions by the special counsel, and Trump has repeatedly claimed that Smith is interfering in the 2024 election. Garland added that “the special counsel is required by the regulations to follow the policies of the Justice Department, including the election sensitivities policies, and I’m confident that he did so.”  The superseding indictment against Trump was handed up last week in the federal election subversion case. Read takeaways from it here. Donald Trump has, so far, successfully avoided coming face to face with DC District Judge Tanya Chutkan in his federal election subversion case.  Trump was arraigned before DC Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya on August 3, 2023. It is common practice to be arraigned before a magistrate judge before a federal judge takes over the case. There have been two hearings before Chutkan in the case, one in August 2023 and one in October. Trump waived his appearance for both hearings and has also waived his appearance for today’s hearing. His legal team has also successfully delayed the trial until after the 2024 presidential election. In fact, a trial date hasn’t been set yet.  Trump did attend oral arguments on his presidential immunity claims in January 2024 in the same courthouse where Chutkan presides, but that hearing was before a panel of three judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Today’s status conference is the first hearing in Trump’s election subversion case since the Supreme Court ruled that Trump could claim some immunity in the case. It is also the first hearing since prosecutors charged Trump in a superseding indictment in the case just last week.  Lawyers for former President Donald Trump and special counsel Jack Smith will be before Judge Tanya Chutkan today for the first hearing in the federal election subversion case since prosecutors revised their indictment to try to bring their case in line with a Supreme Court ruling extending to Trump some presidential immunity in the prosecution. Here’s what to watch for: How quickly will Chutkan want to move forward? Smith and Trump both offered their perspectives of the case’s schedule on Friday: Smith did not offer firm dates for the next phase of the case, while Trump recommended a schedule for certain pre-trial disputes that would carry through until at least the beginning of 2025. Their staunch disagreements set up what could be a fierce debate in front of the judge, who will ultimately decide how the case will move forward. How does Chutkan want to resolve the immunity issue? Trump and Smith have different procedural ideas for how the battle over immunity that the Supreme Court ruling teed up should be tackled. Chutkan could indicate that she is choosing one of those approaches over the other, or she might press to find some middle ground way that melds their opposing proposals. Will Chutkan weigh in on Trump’s new plans to attack the case? In addition to the immunity issue, Trump previewed in Friday’s filing what will be several other possible efforts he launches to attack Smith’s case. Chutkan could lay out a process for dealing with those potential requests for the case’s dismissal, while signaling how seriously she views them. Here’s what else to watch for. While Donald Trump faces a fresh indictment over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, some of his biggest allies are hoping the revised charging document helps them evade professional consequences and criminal prosecution for their roles nearly four years ago.  Special counsel Jack Smith rewrote Trump’s federal indictment after the US Supreme Court ruled this summer that the president can’t be prosecuted for “official acts” taken while president. Smith not only narrowed the allegations against Trump but also removed references to communications between Trump and federal government officials. Now former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark are trying to use their onetime boss’ winnowed indictment to their advantage. Trump is the only one charged in the federal case, but several of his allies and members of his administration are facing state-level criminal charges over their meddling after the last election, including Clark and Meadows. Clark and others also are facing professional disciplinary proceedings that could disrupt their ability to practice law. Meadows, in particular, could stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment handed up in federal court last week. Meadows was cut from much of the document, except for some interactions he had with Trump as the then-president sought to reach the secretary of state in Georgia on the phone to pressure him into aiding his election reversal gambit. That has led Meadows’ attorneys to argue he should not be prosecuted for actions he took while serving in the White House. He’s been charged in Georgia and Arizona over his efforts to reverse the election results in the battleground states. His main defense so far has been to try to get the cases moved to federal court, which could make it easier for him to make a bid for his own immunity. “I don’t think that’s Jack Smith’s intent,” an attorney close to the case told CNN about the new indictment bolstering Meadows’ argument. But, the attorney added, “it’s the way chips have fallen.” Smith’s office declined to comment. Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan, of the DC District Court, will have to decide how to proceed with the criminal case against Donald Trump over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including setting a schedule. She must also decide whether prosecutors can take Trump to trial and be able to call certain witnesses, such as former Vice President Mike Pence. The new indictment, approved by a grand jury last week, requires Trump to enter a new pleading. While prosecutors cut back some of the allegations against the former president in light of the Supreme Court ruling, Trump faces the same four criminal charges as before. Special counsel Jack Smith defiantly re-injected the question of Donald Trump’s bid to steal the 2020 election into the intensifying end game of this year’s White House race. By trying to rescue his case after his initial indictment was gutted by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, Smith signaled that he is determined to bring the former president to justice — even though there will be no trial before Election Day. His move underscored the huge personal investment Trump has in winning the presidency in November: He not only would return to the nation’s top office, but would also gain the authority to halt this and another federal case against him and head off any sentences that could include jail time if he is convicted. Being indicted, yet again, in the middle of a presidential campaign would be a disqualifying badge of shame for most candidates. Yet Trump has used his criminal problems to revive his campaign before — especially during the Republican primary contest. His new indictment came almost exactly a year after he showed up to be booked in an Atlanta jail and submitted to a mug shot that his campaign turned into a defiant emblem. Trump has struggled in recent weeks to find traction for his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris. And the issue of the ex-president’s legal woes had not been a central focus of the election race in recent months. But no sooner had the new Smith charges been filed, the muscle memory of his team returned, as he revived the core narrative of his bid for a second term — a false claim that he’s a victim of election interference by a weaponized Biden Justice Department.

Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. The judge overseeing the New York hush money case against former President Donald Trump informed both Trump and the Manhattan district attorney that he will render his decision Friday on whether to delay the Republican presidential nominee’s sentencing date, according to a Thursday court filing. The former president is currently scheduled to be sentenced on September 18, but Trump asked to delay the sentencing until after Election Day, a request Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office did not oppose. An attorney for Bragg’s office reported the timing of Judge Juan Merchan’s decision in a letter filed with a federal court in New York where Trump is fighting to move the state case to federal court. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a fundraising email Thursday that he wants his supporters to back former President Donald Trump “no matter what state you live in,” a departure from his previous call to supporters to back Trump only in key battleground states and support him in non-competitive states. When suspending his own presidential campaign last month, Kennedy said he would withdraw his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states but urged his supporters to vote for him in the states where his name would remain on the ballot. He also suggested that he could still win the presidency through a contingent election. But Kennedy said in Thursday’s email that that the margin of victory may be too narrow to risk voting for anyone besides Trump, adding that a “disputed election result would be a disaster” for the country. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday that while he isn’t helping former President Donald Trump prepare for next week’s debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, he and his running mate are “constantly trading ideas.” Vance also added that Harris is hoping for a debate moment where she can tell Trump, “I’m speaking,” as she did at the 2020 vice-presidential debate with then-candidate Mike Pence. Former President Donald Trump is expected to hold a press conference in New York on Friday around noon. The campaign did not announce the topic of the press conference. Former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined health care policies he would like to see former president Donald Trump take if he’s reelected, including calling for budget cuts to the National Institute of Health and advocating for alternative health treatments.   In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday, Kennedy suggested Trump could “unite the country” by addressing higher incidence of chronic diseases and focusing on several health-related policies he said would “make America healthy again.” Kennedy suspended his own presidential bid late last month and immediately endorsed Trump. The former president said if he is reelected, Kennedy would work with a panel he promised to create that would investigate rising rates of chronic disease diagnoses. Among the recommended policies, Kennedy proposed redirecting half of “research budgets” away from NIH and a new regulation to prevent NIH funds from being distributed to “researchers with conflicts of interest.” The proposals directed at NIH come after Kennedy has spent years attacking the agency and its former director Dr. Anthony Fauci for his role in the research behind various vaccines, including the Covid-19 vaccine. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance argued Thursday that strict gun laws are not the determining factor in preventing school shootings and instead advocated for bolstering school security, following a school shooting in Winder, Georgia, on Wednesday. Vance said schools are “soft targets” for shooters to make headlines and bolstered school security would solve the problem.  As a parent of three young children, Vance said he doesn’t want his kids to go to school with additional security. But, he added, “if these psychos are going to go after our kids, we’ve got to be prepared for it.”  Vance also alleged in response to a question from CNN that Vice President Kamala Harris’ solution to gun violence “is to take law-abiding American citizens’ guns away from them.” This post has been updated with additional comments from JD Vance. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday appeared to address recent public criticism of his political views that he has received from family while campaigning in a narrowly divided county in battleground Pennsylvania. While arguing that former President Donald Trump’s policy agenda includes tax cuts “for the wealthy” and curtailing reproductive rights, Walz remarked that Trump “openly says these things that we need to talk to our relatives about.” The reference, which was met by some laughter in the crowd, comes after Walz’s older brother, Jeff, posted in comments on social media last week that he is “100% opposed” to his brother’s political views and was considering officially endorsing Trump.  Jeff Walz, who said he hadn’t spoken to his brother in eight years, told NewsNation on Tuesday that he didn’t intend to “influence the general public” with the posts and said he has no plans to be campaigning for or against his brother’s campaign ahead of November’s election. The Democratic vice presidential nominee often brings up his conservative family, friends and neighbors on the campaign trail and in interviews as a way to relate to rural and working people. Trump’s running mate JD Vance later Thursday dismissed endorsements from the family members of politicians, after late Republican presidential nominee John McCain’s son exclusively told CNN this week he plans to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. “John McCain died what five, six, seven years ago? And the media is turning into a story what John McCain’s family says about Donald Trump,” Vance said, arguing the opinions of Walz’s family are a “bigger story.” This post has been updated with comments from JD Vance. Candidates are investing an enormous amount of money working to get their message out on television in crucial states like Pennsylvania. Democrats have reserved more than 78 million dollars, while Republicans have reserved more than 72 million. And Pennsylvania voters are taking notice.  “Oh I hate them,” 64-year-old college administrator Larry Mercurio said of the influx of television ads. “Every election cycle it gets worse. And this year, it’s very bad already.” “How can anybody be swayed by this BS,” Mercurio’s partner, Tammy Ryan, 63, chimed in, dismissing the ads attacking Vice President Kamala Harris.  Ryan says she’s excited Harris is using Pittsburgh as her home base to prep for next week’s crucial debate. The couple describe the Democratic nominee as more qualified, compassionate and prepared than former President Donald Trump, though Mercurio said he hasn’t always voted solely for Democratic candidates.  Some of the college students walking just off Forbes Avenue on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh were not aware the vice president was in town, but all of them told CNN they were registered to vote.   They cited issues like reproductive rights and the economy as the issues of most concern to them but some didn’t want to disclose who they were voting for in the fall.  Sabina Kadariya, a freshman, said she wasn’t sure if she was informed enough to make a “proper vote,” but said the economy was her number one issue and that she’d consider voting for Trump. Rishi Wadgaonkar, a 23-year-old grad student at Carnegie Mellon studying mechanical engineering, said he’s most worried about LGBTQ rights and women’s rights and that Harris best reflects his values. He recently changed his voter registration from New York to Pennsylvania.  “Pennsylvania is really a state that really could go either way,” he told CNN. As the Harris campaign worked to capitalize on post-convention momentum, the message to donors was clear: As much money as possible, as quickly as possible. The goal, donors close to the campaign say, is to front-load as much spending as possible in swing states where early voting is getting underway. Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state Harris will crisscross in the coming days as she prepares to debate Donald Trump, begins in-person early voting September 16. “We’re 64 days out from this election,” Harris told a crowd of union leaders in Pittsburgh on Sept. 2, urging them to get out the vote. “Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days.” Absentee ballots in North Carolina are expected to be distributed beginning Friday, September 6, though in-person early voting doesn’t begin until October 17.  And Georgia, a state once outside Democrats’ path to victory with Biden as the candidate, begins early voting October 15. Harris raked in $310 million in July, a month in which she spent just 10 days at the top of the ticket. If the current trajectory holds, the Harris campaign would rake in well over $1 billion over the course of just 107 days between her ascension to the party’s presumptive nominee and election day. It has been an interesting thing to watch Trump and Elon Musk circle each other this year. Musk had already been clearly gravitating toward Trump, but it was in the moments after Trump was shot in July that Musk officially endorsed Trump, in a post to X.  The Wall Street Journal later reported, incorrectly it seems, that Musk would be supporting a Trump-aligned super PAC with tens of millions of dollars.  Musk later said the support would be at a “much lower level,” as CNN’s Chris Isidore pointed out. Isidore also charted Musk’s path from criticizing Trump over climate change to supporting Trump, despite the former president’s dislike of electric vehicles like Tesla. In the months since, Musk has become a frequent peddler of conspiracy theories about US election security and a vocal opponent of Vice President Kamala Harris. Musk and Trump overcame technical difficulties for an extremely friendly chat — it wasn’t exactly an interview — that broadcast on X in August, in which Musk suggested a government efficiency commission. Thursday, in a speech laying out his economic plan, Trump endorsed the idea and said he would appoint Musk to be part of it. On X, Musk shared a photo of a slimmer version of himself standing at a podium that read, “Department of Government Efficiency, D.O.G.E.” DOGE also happens to be the moniker for Musk’s cryptocurrency, which at least foreshadows the idea that any Musk public service would echo if not amplify his own business. It would be something interesting to witness if Musk did join Trump’s administration — although it would also seem like a comedown for the world’s richest man to spend his days digging through federal bureaucratic red tape. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance told volunteers and supporters at the Trump-Vance Campaign Phoenix office that former Donald President Trump is “pissed off” about Project 2025, and urged them to remind voters that no one speaks for Trump except himself. Swinging by the office with his wife, Usha, before a Phoenix event, Vance asked the room what they’re hearing as they knock on doors and make phone calls to voters.  One person said she hears concerns about Trump’s association to Project 2025 through Kamala Harris campaign ads. “Of course, Kamala Harris is running dishonest TV advertisements because Kamala Harris is a dishonest person who doesn’t have a record to run on,” Vance said. “When you’re talking to people, just remind them: ‘Look, I know this from experience nobody speaks for Donald J. Trump except for Donald J. Trump.’”  Project 2025 is the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president organized by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has publicly rejected Project 2025 and denied knowing who is behind it, despite at least 140 people who formerly worked for him being involved. “Just say look, Donald Trump will set a Trump 47 agenda. Donald Trump will set the January 20, 2025 agenda. No one else will do it. Don’t believe the lies. Believe what you see,” Vance said.  As CNN previously reported, Vance wrote the forward for a forthcoming book by Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts. Vance has not endorsed the blueprint, previously saying it has “no affiliation with the Trump campaign.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed Vice President Kamala Harris’ calls for a ceasefire-hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas while calling the conditions in Gaza a “humanitarian crisis” in his most fulsome public comments on the Israel-Hamas war since joining the Democratic ticket last month.  Walz condemned the October 7 attack as a “horrific act of violence” and endorsed Israel’s right to self-defense. But he also said protesters opposed to the US facilitating Israel’s military operation in Gaza are “speaking out for all the right reasons.” Walz specifically referenced Arab-Americans and Muslims in Michigan who have opposed the Biden administration’s handling of the war. While the interview marks Walz’s first substantial foray into the politics around the Israel-Hamas war, they reflect the position Harris has taken since taking over the top of the Democratic ticket in July. Harris has repeatedly called for a ceasefire-hostage deal to be reached soon. In a CNN interview last week, Harris said “far too many Palestinians have been killed” during Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the West Bank. Former President Donald Trump plans to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants, he said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. Trump claimed the measure would help address housing affordability because a “flood” of people entering the country illegally are pushing up housing costs, but undocumented immigrants only make up a tiny portion of the mortgage market. Key context: In 2023, only 5,000 to 6,000 mortgages were made to holders of Individual Tax Identification numbers, according to a recent Urban Institute report. Those who are not legally authorized to work in the US obtain ITINs to file taxes, since they are not eligible for Social Security numbers. Most ITINs are issued to those from Latin American countries. It’s often very difficult for undocumented immigrants to obtain home loans, even though the USA Patriot Act of 2021 allowed banks to accept ITINs as a form of identification. More from Trump: The former president said he would make housing more affordable by getting rid of regulations that increase costs and by opening up some federal land available for large-scale housing construction in low-tax, low-regulation zones. He also said falling interest rates will send mortgage rates down to 3% or even lower, which will make financing less expensive for homebuyers. Judge Tanya Chutkan has set a schedule in the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump that will allow prosecutors to release never-before-seen evidence, such as grand jury transcripts, before the presidential election. The deadline for the filing from prosecutors is September 26, according to the latest order from the judge, which largely sides with special counsel Jack Smith’s proposed schedule discussed at Thursday’s hearing. Trump’s defense team had sought to delay the public release of evidence in the case until after the November election. The schedule allows the judge to resolve enduring immunity disputes on a much quicker timeline than the former president proposed, with the final round briefs on the matter set for October 29. Chutkan also requested that Trump file his challenge to the legality of Jack Smith’s appointment and for the special counsel to respond in late October, with the final brief from Trump on that issue due on November 7, two days after the election. At Thursday’s hearing, Chutkan made clear she would not take into account the presidential campaign in crafting the next steps in the case. She rebuffed the defense team’s concerns about the government getting to decide what evidence is aired on the public court record during a “sensitive time” close to the election. This post has been updated with additional details about the schedule. President Joe Biden sought to lift up Vice President Kamala Harris while also attacking her opponent former President Donald Trump during a stop in Westby, Wisconsin, tonight. Biden said his vice president has “fought like hell for all of you and for a future worthy of your aspirations.” Biden criticized Trump’s impact on taxes during his time as president, while touting a recent announcement of more than $7 billion in financing for rural clean energy projects, made possible through the Inflation Reduction Act. It was an official White House event — not a campaign event — as the president seeks to highlight key pieces of his administration’s agenda. The president also called out Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin for voting against the bill, while praising the state’s Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for re-election. “Ron Johnson voted against every one of the things I talked about today. Every single thing I talked about in terms of rural economy, he voted against it,” Biden said adding that the decision is “hard to imagine” in a rural state “so large and so consequential as the state of Wisconsin.” Donald Trump unveiled a slate of new economic plans in a speech on Thursday as his campaign attempts to contrast the former president’s economic plans with those of Vice President Kamala Harris. Here’s a look at the plans Trump outlined today: The Trump campaign, which views the economy as its top issue ahead of the November election, planned the former president’s Thursday address in an effort to contrast his economic plans with those of Harris, Trump advisers said. Harris has in recent days unveiled a slew of economic proposals, including measures aimed at aiding small businesses and at making housing, groceries, child-rearing and health care more affordable for the middle class and working Americans. Read more about the campaign promises Trump has made so far. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made the case for stricter gun safety measures in response to the Apalachee High School shooting in Georgia that left four people dead, arguing during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Thursday that “none of the things we’re proposing” impede on the constitutional right to bear arms. While speaking to volunteers in Erie, Kamala Harris’ running mate called for Americans to be able to enjoy the “freedom for our kids to go to school without being shot,” and indicated support for federal laws that replicate gun safety measures he approved in Minnesota, including universal background checks and a “red flag” law to restrict access to guns for people with high risk of injuring themselves or others.   Walz said the issue of gun safety is “heavy on every one of our hearts” after the shooting in Winder, Georgia, on Wednesday.  The gun used in Wednesday’s shooting was an “AR-platform style weapon,” according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. Walz has previously endorsed an assault weapons ban.  Walz insisted the stricter gun safety measures he proposed would not dampen the Second Amendment rights of gun owners. Asked at an economic forum Thursday whether he would commit to prioritizing legislation that would make child care affordable, former President Donald Trump pivoted to tout the economic growth that he says his policies, particularly tariffs, would promote if re-elected. Trump said child care is “a very important issue” and that the country under his leadership would be able to “afford to take care of its people.” “We are going to be taking in trillions of dollars. As much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” he said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. Some background: Child care is a major financial burden for many families in the US. Parents with two kids in a child care center paid on average at least twice as much for that care as they did for the typical rent in 11 states and the District of Columbia in 2023, according to a Child Care Aware of America report released in May. Placing two kids at a child care center cost at least 25% more than the typical rent, on average, in every state in the US. And the tab exceeded annual typical mortgage payments in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia, according to the Child Care Aware report, which looked at care for an infant and 4-year-old. Nationwide, the average annual cost of care rose to $11,582 per child last year, up 3.7% from the prior year. It was the smallest annual increase since the pandemic began and trailed inflation. Former President Donald Trump said Thursday he would reduce the corporate tax rate to 15%, from 21% — but only for companies that make their products in the US.  Trump has said repeatedly that he’s interested in lowering the corporate levy further than the 21% rate put in place by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of his signature achievements during his first term. Prior to the law, the corporate tax rate was 35%.  He argues that reducing the rate, along with making other provisions of the TCJA permanent and enacting additional tax cuts, would grow the economy, raise revenue and cut the deficit. However, the economic effects of the 2017 law remain a matter of debate among experts. Also, slashing the rate that low could prove a hard sell in Congress, which would have to approve the measure amid concerns about the rising federal debt. Trump pushed for a 15% corporate tax rate as part of his 2016 presidential campaign, but Republicans opted for the 21% rate even though they controlled Capitol Hill at the time. Slashing the rate to 15% would reduce federal revenue by $673 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, which also estimates the proposal would boost the economy by 0.4% over the long run. Reducing the corporate tax rate is among the many contrasts Trump is drawing with his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. She supports raising the rate to 28% as part of her aim to make big companies and the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes to raise funding for her proposals aimed at supporting the middle class and working Americans. As the campaign season continues without President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, his son is making his way back into the spotlight. Hunter Biden is offering to plead guilty to the nine tax offenses he faces in federal court, without a deal with prosecutors, his attorneys said in court Thursday. Biden had earlier attempted to resolve his federal tax evasion case in California with a plea in which he would maintain his innocence but still accept punishment. The arrangement wouldn’t have become final until District Judge Mark Scarsi, a Trump appointee who has presided over the tax case, gave his stamp of approval in open court. He said Thursday that he would make that decision at a later date. This type of arrangement, called an “Alford plea,” would have seen Biden acknowledge that special counsel David Weiss has enough evidence to convict him – and then he would accept whatever sentence Scarsi eventually hands down. But in a surprising turn Thursday afternoon, Biden’s team changed course and instead said Biden is prepared to admit that his conduct satisfied the elements of the tax offenses with which he had been charged. Prosecutors from Weiss’ team had said they would object to an Alford plea. Prosecutor Leo Wise told the judge that Lowell’s comments in court earlier in the day were the first time he learned about a potential plea change. Lowell had earlier “there has not been an agreement” between the parties – like a plea agreement – in which Biden would plead guilty to some charges in exchange for other charges being dropped. The only offer that Hunter’s team ever got from prosecutors, Lowell said, was for him to plead guilty to all nine counts. The potential resolution of the tax case came on the brink of a trial in downtown Los Angeles. This would have been Biden’s second criminal trial this year, after he was convicted in June on three federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. Read more on his case here. This post has been updated with more details on today’s developments. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is planning a slew of organizing events this weekend designed to appeal to Republican voters who are wary of Donald Trump’s agenda, tying the GOP nominee to the conservative policy proposal Project 2025. The organizing push will feature Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff, Alex Padilla and Amy Klobuchar appearing at events in battleground states, the campaign announced Thursday. The push comes as the Harris campaign looks to capitalize on support from prominent Republican figures, including endorsements this week from former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney and 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain, son of the former Republican presidential nominee John McCain.  The Harris campaign will host over 2,000 events and 20,000 volunteer shifts in hopes of reaching over 1 million voters in battleground states, the campaign said. The slate of events is the latest effort by the Harris campaign to link Trump to the Heritage Foundation policy document crafted with help from many of his allies and former members of his administration. Democrats frequently cite proposals in the document to portray Trump’s agenda, while the former president has repeatedly denied any connection to Project 2025. Former President Donald Trump promised Thursday to make gasoline dirt-cheap again by slashing red tape and drilling for more oil. “We’re going to get gasoline below $2 a gallon,” Trump said at the New York Economic Club. However, some experts warn it could take an economic calamity to make that happen. Trump vowed to “end Kamala Harris’ anti-energy crusade,” a claim that does not match up with the fact that America is producing more oil now than at any point under his presidency. US oil production recently stood at 13.4 million barrels per day, according to weekly federal data. That is higher than the pre-Covid peak of 13.1 million under Trump – and it is higher any other point in US history. Trump on Thursday bragged about gas prices tumbling to $1.87 a gallon during his time in office. In fact, at one point in the spring of 2020 gas prices dropped below $1.80 a gallon. However, many Americans could not take advantage of those ultra-low prices because they took place during the height of the Covid-19 crisis. “I don’t think anyone wants to return to those pandemic times,” Lipow said. The first ballots in the nation are scheduled to start going out Friday in North Carolina, but that may be delayed after a judge ordered a temporary pause to ballot distribution.   The ruling came in response to a request from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove his name from the ballot.   North Carolina’s State Board of Elections rejected that request last week, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.  Kennedy challenged that decision in court.  Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt denied Kennedy’s request, but also ordered a 24-hour pause to allow Kennedy to appeal.  After the hearing, state board general counsel Paul Cox instructed counties to not send ballots out Friday morning.  However, Cox said that ballots would need to be go out Friday afternoon, unless an appeals court ordered a further delay. In a speech Thursday, former President Donald Trump greatly overstated the number of people who lost their job in the past year. Trump falsely claimed that “1.3 million workers have become unemployed in the past 12 months” when speaking at the Economic Club of New York. Trump appears to be citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ survey of households, which is one of two surveys that feeds into the monthly jobs report. As of July 2024, the estimates from the household survey show there were 7.163 million “unemployed persons,” an increase of 1.259 million from July 2023. People are classified as “unemployed” if they do not have a job, were available for work and have actively tried to find work. In addition to permanent and temporary job losers, the BLS’ definition of unemployed includes people who have newly entered the labor force, as well as those who have re-entered the workforce. Through the 12 months that ended in July, that 1.259 million increase was broken down as follows: Former President Donald Trump said Thursday Elon Musk has agreed to lead the government efficiency commission that Trump proposed creating if reelected in November.  The commission was first proposed by Musk. Trump made the comments as he unveiled a slate of new economic plans during his remarks at the Economic Club of New York. Trump said, “And Elon, because he’s not very busy, has agreed to head that task force, be interesting, if he has the time, he’d be good to do it. But he’s agreed to do it.” Republican Jewish Coalition chairman Norm Coleman on Thursday said that the organization has committed to raising $5 million from Jewish donors for former President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.  The RJC is in the middle of a $15 million independent expenditure to mobilize the Jewish community in support of Trump this November – “a record high number for any Jewish group in a presidential campaign,” he claimed.  He said that RJC’s field staffers have already been on the ground in battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, and that their national staff will deploy to these states for GOP get-out-the-vote efforts. “We’re working hard at recruiting volunteers, making phone calls, knocking on doors, sending text message, making inroads with local communities in battleground states,” he said. “We know this election much like 2016 and 2020 will be decided by very narrow margins, including just a few households in certain precincts.”  Former President Donald Trump’s allies on Thursday slammed Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic proposals during a press call ahead of his scheduled speech in New York where he is expected to unveil a set of new economic plans. A day after Harris proposed a new wave of economic proposals aimed at boosting small businesses and entrepreneurs, the Trump campaign argued “we should reject these failed ideas,” claiming that her time serving in the Biden administration has only contributed to high costs and inflation. The call, hosted by the RNC and Trump campaign, highlighted that Trump is expected to spend less time focused on criticizing Harris’ agenda and instead emphasize “he has the plan that works.” Vice President Kamala Harris will attend a rank-and-file roundtable with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, on September 16th, the union announced Thursday.  It marks Harris’ latest effort to win over union support, especially from rank-and-file members that former President Donald Trump is also making a play for in November.  The Teamsters have yet to offer an endorsement in the election. Trump and President Joe Biden each met with the group earlier his year.  Harris will meet with rank-and-file members, the Teamsters general executive board, general President Sean O’Brien and General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. Former President Donald Trump is set to dedicate a substantial portion of the speech he’s delivering Thursday at the Economic Club of New York to calling out what he considers excessive government spending, a source familiar with his remarks told CNN. In an effort to cut down on spending, he’s expected to unveil a commission focused on government efficiency. Absent this, government spending is already inching down. For much of Trump’s presidency, government spending was fairly flat — that was, until the pandemic. To stimulate the US economy after much of it came to a standstill during Covid, government spending ramped up significantly. From fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020, it increased from $5.31 trillion to $7.72 trillion, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It stayed above $7 trillion until fiscal year 2022, when it was $6.48 trillion. For the 2023 fiscal year it fell even more, to $6.13. Even though that’s almost $1 trillion more than what the government spent in fiscal year 2019, it amounts to 23% of gross domestic product for that year, just two percentage points higher than in 2019. But federal outlays are projected to increase to almost 25% of GDP by 2034, according to the latest projection by the Congressional Budget Office. Former first lady Melania Trump on Thursday promoted her upcoming memoir, stating in a new video that she feels “a responsibility to clarify the facts.”  Trump said, “I believe it is important to share my perspective: The truth.”  The black and white video showed clips and photographs from the former first lady’s time in office, including her trips abroad and her interacting with children. Her post linked to a page to pre-order her book.  The text, “My Story. My Perspective. The Truth,” flashed on screen.  The former first lady’s office announced last month her memoir titled “Melania” would be released this fall and described the book as “a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence.” The former first lady has maintained a low profile throughout Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and has not appeared at a campaign event with him except to attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month. With the first presidential ballots going out tomorrow in North Carolina, the Harris and Trump campaigns – and their allies – are pouring advertising money into the key battleground state. Between President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race and Labor Day weekend, North Carolina voters were bombarded by $46.4 million in total presidential advertising, ranking sixth among all states during that stretch, according to AdImpact data. Republicans outspent Democrats in that period by about $26.3 million to $19.98. million, ramping up their efforts to prevent a GOP loss in the state for only the second time since 1976. The Raleigh-Durham (Fayetteville) media market drew the most spending in that period, about $8.7 million total, and Republicans outspent Democrats by about $4.9 million to $3.8 million there. Former President Donald Trump is expected to unveil a slate of new economic plans during his remarks at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, including the creation of a presidential commission focused on government efficiency first proposed by Elon Musk, a source familiar with his speech told CNN.  The commission would conduct “a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,” Trump is expected to announce, and be tasked with finding and eliminating fraud, the source said. Trump is also expected to outline new proposals aimed at tackling government regulations, including those aimed at energy production, and vow to withdraw unspent funds appropriated during the Biden administration. His speech will also address his recent embrace of cryptocurrency and reaffirm his plan to place sweeping tariffs on imports. The Wall Street Journal first reported Trump’s planned announcement. Trump and Republicans have sought to rescind funding boosts contained in recent legislation that Democrats have pushed through Congress, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which funneled about $80 billion over 10 years to the Internal Revenue Service and put in place a wide array of climate measures. Congressional Republicans have already succeeded in paring back $20 billion of the IRS funds. Also, Trump and congressional Republicans have long pointed to combatting waste, fraud and abuse as ways to save the federal government money. But that refrain is “often an excuse to do nothing,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  Trump’s commission would have to be given a broad mandate to review the largest federal spending programs – Social Security, Medicare and defense – to be most effective, he said. The Trump campaign, which views the economy as its top issue ahead of the November election, planned the Thursday address as an effort to contrast the former president’s economic plans with that of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump advisers said.  Economic issues, which posed a notable weak point for President Joe Biden, remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters to their choice for president; with an average of 39% of likely voters across the six top battleground states choosing the economy as their top issue, a recent CNN poll found. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz visited Pamela’s Diner in Pittsburgh on Thursday, an unannounced stop on his schedule during his two-day swing through Pennsylvania.  A restaurant staff member told CNN that Walz and his daughter Hope ate breakfast at the popular Pittsburgh restaurant on Thursday. The press pool traveling with Walz did not accompany him to the restaurant.   The staff member said Walz and his daughter ordered hot cakes and eggs, and shook hands with workers and restaurant goers during his visit. The staff member described Walz as “nice.” As Donald Trump prepares to lay out his plans for the American economy, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign will argue the former president’s proposals would cost “trillions” of dollars and disproportionately hurt the middle class.  In a memo obtained by CNN, Brian Nelson, a top economic adviser to Harris, contends that Trump’s economic policies will “serve billionaires and big corporations” and his proposals would lead to “massive tax windfalls” for the wealthy. Trump, who lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% in his first term, has promised another cut for businesses if elected again, as well as eliminating taxes on tipped wages. He has also proposed sweeping tariffs across the economy in hopes it will generate revenue to pay for these new cuts and encourage more investments in the US. Nelson, who until recently served as the US Department of the Treasury’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, pointed to analyses from economists across the political spectrum who have cautioned Trump’s approach could backfire and set off a trade war that would bring economic growth to a standstill.  As CNN and others have reported, many economic experts warn that a broad and unprecedented hike in tariffs could cause considerable harm and lead to a sharp spike in prices on goods for Americans and kill jobs. “But Donald Trump is denying this broad, bipartisan consensus, ‘hoping that most economic analyses of his ideas are dead wrong’ and blatantly lying to the American people about the severe costs and consequences of his economic plans,” Nelson wrote in the memo, which the campaign intends to release as Trump speaks Thursday. Trump will deliver remarks at the Economic Club of New York Thursday – a day after Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled the latest piece of her economic agenda Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was “going to let her talk” when asked about his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.  “You know when I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion and I let him talk. I’m going to let her talk,” Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  “It depends a lot on ABC, will they be fair or not?” Trump said. “I hope they will be fair.”  ABC News on Wednesday officially announced the rules of next week’s presidential debate between Harris and Trump, and both candidates have agreed to the format that microphones will be muted while the other is speaking. Trump claimed Wednesday Harris’ team “wanted notes” and “wanted a desk” but that Trump objected. The rules set out by ABC News do not allow for notes, and the candidates will be standing behind podiums.  Trump also made the baseless claim that he had “already heard” that Harris’ team would “get the questions in advance.” Kamala Harris’ campaign on Thursday launched its second ad highlighting Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that has attracted considerable blowback. The ad, which began airing this morning in Georgia, specifically warns of the impact the plan would have on Black Americans, and emphasizes the threat to abortion rights. Trump and his campaign have made efforts to distance the former president from the controversial policy blueprint, as it’s become a focus of Democratic attacks. A CNN analysis, however, found nearly 240 people with ties to both Project 2025 and Trump. The murders of six more Israeli hostages marked a critical new moment for Doug Emhoff, who’s speaking out on his own and Kamala Harris’ behalf, as only a Jewish American and the spouse of a presidential candidate can. For Emhoff, it’s a reflection of historical circumstances: he has spoken often about how he reconnected to his Judaism after seeing the response he received when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris for the ticket four years ago. Then as second gentleman, he felt compelled first by the rise in antisemitism and then the October 7 Hamas terror attacks to speak up about how much hurt he felt. Now, with his wife suddenly the Democratic nominee and both of them thrust more into the spotlight — and as the world approaches the anniversary of those attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza — friends and advisers say they’re seeing a man continuing to search for his own response to an issue that is policy, politics and personal all at once. Continue reading about Emhoff’s reaction to the hostage murders. Former President Donald Trump wants to spend trillions of dollars on tax cuts. His plan to pay for that is alarming some mainstream economists. Trump proposed sweeping tariffs on all $3 trillion worth of imports into the United States, including a 60% tariff on imports from China and a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports from other nations. Recently, Trump doubled down on the threat, saying he is considering tariffs of up to 20% on most imports in a bid to protect working-class jobs and punish what he labels unfair trading practices. In theory, the unprecedented tariff hikes could raise trillions of dollars, funds that would help cover the cost of the tax cuts. However, many economists warn that those tariffs could backfire — badly — by raising prices on American families, killing jobs and setting off a global trade war. It’s part of the reason Goldman Sachs in an analyst note this week said Trump’s economic policies — particularly on trade — would cause America’s economy to shrink. By contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic policy proposals would grow the economy, Goldman Sachs predicted. Goldman and other experts fear Trump’s tough proposed trade tactics could worsen the affordability crisis in America. Kelly warned that tariffs are a “perfect stagflation machine,” threaten to scramble supply chains and invite a punishing response from trading partners. Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, emphasized that Vice President Kamala Harris is “her own candidate,” separate from President Joe Biden, when pressed about her decision to break from Biden on her capital gains tax proposal. Sams continued that, “when it comes to something like the capital gains tax rate, she thinks that 39.6% is too high and that we can come down a little lower to 28% to better incentivize the kind of investment and entrepreneurs that we want to see in this country.”  He added, “I think as the campaign continues, you’ll see places where there are distinctions because she’s her own candidate.” The Trump campaign on Wednesday warned staff against talking to the press in a memo, telling staffers that “information is power.” This is not the first time top campaign officials have lectured staffers on talking to press. CNN has reported on the extensive efforts since the campaign began to curb leaking to the press among campaign staffers. It was not immediately clear if a specific story or event prompted this memo or if the memo is simply a routine warning against leaks. “Information is power - and the press doesn’t give a damn if you lose your job because you spoke out of school,” LaCivita and Wiles wrote.  NBC News was first to report the leaked campaign memo. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Pittsburgh on Thursday, according to her campaign, where she is expected to remain as she prepares for the presidential debate next week.  CNN previously reported that Harris intentionally pared back her travel leading up to the upcoming presidential debate at National Constitution Center in Philadelphia to dedicate time to preparation. While in Pittsburgh, she will prepare with her team, according to two sources familiar with the planning, and will stay for several nights until the debate Tuesday. It’s the second time the vice president will visit the city this week after campaigning with President Joe Biden on Labor Day. She plans to make community stops while she’s in Pittsburgh and stay on the campaign trail in a critical battleground state, according to one of the sources. Meanwhile, her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will travel to Erie, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. In Erie, he will participate in “a series of campaign engagements” before speaking at a rally at 6 p.m., according to a news release from the Harris campaign. CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, Kristen Holmes and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. ABC News has officially announced the rules of next week’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump — meaning both candidates have agreed to the format, including that microphones will be muted while the other candidate is speaking. Additionally, a virtual coin flip held this week was won by Trump, to determine podium placement and order of closing statements. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen.  Whether microphones would be cut was the last sticking point for the Harris campaign, after Trump’s team had already agreed to the rules last week.  Over the weekend, Harris posted on X that Trump is “surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn’t have confidence in him, the American people definitely can’t.” “We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a transparent way — with the microphones on the whole time,” she added.  Last week Trump said at a campaign stop that while they had already agreed to the rules, he didn’t mind if the mics were on.   The ABC News debate rules largely mirror those used by CNN in its presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Trump in June, when the Biden campaign, at the time, was the one that advocated for muted microphones.  In addition to the muted microphones, the rules state there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and they cannot ask questions of one another. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to visit battleground states, where his name remains on the ballot, as part of a “Make America Healthy Again tour” to support former President Donald Trump. RFK Jr. has removed his name from the ballot in several key states but has faced obstacles in Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Asked if he would be campaigning alongside the former president, Kennedy said that he plans to do so. Last month, RFK Jr. announced that he was suspending his independent presidential campaign and endorsing Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris is adding tax relief for small businesses to her economic policy platform aimed at helping middle-class and working Americans. Harris unveiled Wednesday a proposal to massively increase the existing small business tax deduction for startup costs and cut the red tape that impedes small businesses’ formation and growth. Her goal: 25 million new small business applications by the end of her first term, up from the record 19 million received under the Biden administration as of mid-August. Harris on Wednesday also proposed raising the capital gains tax rate, though not by as much as President Joe Biden has called for. The measures come three weeks after Harris released a four-part package aimed at making housing, groceries, child rearing and prescription drugs more affordable. Many of the proposals build upon efforts the Biden administration has already unveiled. Here’s what we know about Harris’ economic proposals: Find out what else Harris is proposing for the economy here. The 2024 presidential race has entered a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump preparing to debate in less than a week and the first ballots going out Friday in North Carolina.

Caitlin Clark posts second career triple-double in Indiana Fever victory over Los Angeles Sparks | CNN,"Published 7:31 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",2024-09-05T11:31:32.955Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/sport/caitlin-clark-triple-double-wnba-spt-intl/index.html,"Caitlin Clark stuffed the stat sheet yet again in another Indiana Fever win, recording a triple-double in a 93-86 victory against the Los Angeles Sparks on Wednesday. The 22-year-old superstar posted 24 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists to achieve the second triple-double of her young career. She became the first rookie in WNBA history to achieve the feat earlier this year. Per the Fever, she is only the sixth WNBA player in history to record multiple career triple-doubles. Indiana is 7-1 since the league resumed after the Olympic break and secured a playoff berth for the first time since 2016 on Tuesday. Clark also became the first rookie ever to make 100 three-pointers in a season with a step-back triple in the third quarter of the game. She is the sixth WNBA player to ever reach triple-digit three-pointers in a year. The 2024 No. 1 overall draft pick has set multiple records and made frequently history over the course of her rookie campaign, but stated that she is more focused on achieving team success than anything else. “You’ve got to win to have all that on the side,” Clark said. “For me, it’s fun winning basketball games. It’s fun walking off the court and the crowd’s going crazy because you just won, and you played a good game. So for me, that’s where my main focus is. And I think when I do that, everything else comes along with it.” Clark said that she knew that she had secured the triple-double when she pulled down her 10th rebound in the final seconds of the game and dribbled out the clock with a smile on her face. “Somebody had to get the rebound,” she laughed. “AB [Aliyah Boston] was joking, we always joke about stealing each other’s rebound, so that was funny.” The triple-double continues what has been one of the best periods of Clark’s season – she is the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week, Eastern Conference Player of the Month and WNBA Rookie of the Month. Boston, the 2023 Rookie of the Year, also had an impressive performance, posting 24 points and 14 rebounds, while Kelsey Mitchell scored 18 as the Fever moved to 18-16. “We’re not done yet,” said Fever head coach Christie Sides, via the team. “Our goal is to make the playoffs, and we’ve done that, and we have six games now remaining … We don’t have to prove ourselves anymore. We just have to make sure we keep doing what we’ve been doing and find ways to get that 1% better.” Odyssey Sims led the way with 20 points for the Sparks, while Dearica Hamby chipped in with 16 as LA fell to 7-26, the worst record in the league. The team is currently without star rookie Cameron Brink, who tore her ACL earlier this year."
Travis Kelce’s Hollywood aspirations: How the football star is writing a new playbook for tackling showbiz | CNN,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",2024-09-05T10:00:20.919Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/entertainment/travis-kelce-football-hollywood/index.html,"In his scripted television debut in 2020, Travis Kelce, playing a hot-headed athlete-turned-astronaut, fell into a desert sinkhole and died. His career in Hollywood, however, is alive, well and seemingly with more prospects than ever for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end who appears to be exploring the career he wants to build beyond the goalposts. Thursday marks Kelce’s return to the field for his 12th season in the NFL as the league’s highest paid tight end. But he’s doing so with more eyes on him than ever, which is saying a lot for a three-time Super Bowl champ. He’s entering this season having just landed roles in the Ryan Murphy-produced FX show “Grotesquerie” and Adam Sandler’s hotly-anticipated “Happy Gilmore” sequel. In October, he will debut as the host of Prime Video’s upcoming game show “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?” He also just inked a deal upwards of $100 million to bring his popular sports podcast “New Heights with Jason & Travis Kelce,” now in its third season, to Amazon’s Wondery. “We positioned Travis to be world famous,” André Eanes, who with his brother Aaron Eanes manages Kelce, told the New York Times in an April interview. “We didn’t know how it would happen, or when it would happen, or what would help push that further along. But it’s always been the thought in the back of our minds.” Kelce is far from the first to attempt to go from touchdowns to Tinseltown. Former NFL-ers Terry Crews and Michael Strahan and college football players Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Carl Weathers and Mark Harmon are among those who did it successfully. What he has made clear – both through the projects he chooses to pursue and his just-happy-to-be-here approach to being Taylor Swift’s boyfriend – is that Kelce is charting a path for himself in Hollywood in his own way and writing a new playbook for tackling showbiz. At the time he booked “Moonbase 8,” Kelce wasn’t a household name and had little acting experience. His only Hollywood job up until that point was starring in the 2016 E! dating reality show “Catching Kelce.” (Spoiler alert: It didn’t work out.) John C. Reilly, who co-created the space comedy alongside Fred Armisen, Tim Heidecker and “Portlandia” executive producer Jonathan Krisel, told The Ringer in 2020 that they booked Kelce for the job after former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski passed on the role. “When Gronkowski said no we were like, ‘We’re gonna make Gronkowski regret this! We’re gonna get the kid who’s nipping at his heels!’” Reilly joked. “And guess what, our little Travis Kelce went right ahead of Mr. Gronkowski and won the Super Bowl.” Kelce played a satire of himself, coming off as a bossy and entitled football star who was commissioned by NASA as a PR ploy to join three aspiring astronauts (Reilly, Heidecker and Armisen) who were attempting to qualify for their first lunar mission at a moon base simulator in Winslow, Arizona. He only appeared in one episode. “I think like anyone dipping into new territory, Travis required a bit of warming up to the whole acting thing but after a few takes he felt very natural and funny,” Heidecker told CNN via email, recalling his time on the set with Kelce. “I don’t think I was begging him to quit his day job but he was extremely dedicated, open minded and a real pleasure to work with, so it’s no surprise to me he’d find success in whatever field he’s interested in!” Heidecker, also a musician who has a new album coming out next month, added: “It’s been cool to see him break out in such a wholesome and admirable way.” After “Moonbase 8,” Kelce appeared to toggle between winning Super Bowl rings and making buzzy appearances on “Saturday Night Live.” Just one month after the Chiefs won the big game in 2023, Kelce made his “Saturday Night Live” hosting debut. The next time Kelce appeared on “SNL” was in an October 2023 cameo alongside Swift and then in February 2024, he scored his third Super Bowl ring when the Chiefs beat the San Fransisco 49ers in a nail-biter rout. Overall, the reception to his “SNL” appearances were so positive that it sparked buzz about his Hollywood pursuits, something he was asked about during a Super Bowl press conference in February. “I’m comedy all the way… I just like to have a fun time and make people laugh,” Kelce said at the time, speaking about which genre he’s most interested in pursuing. “I’ll dabble in everything though just to see if I have fun doing it and I know there’s definitely Hollywood talks out there.” Perhaps dabbling across all genres is a good strategy but he may also consider take cues from other athletes-turned-actors like “The Rock,” who previously spoke about one of the most important parts of his transition from college football player to professional wrestler to Hollywood star. “I was done trying to be someone I’m not to conform to Hollywood,” Johnson wrote on his Instagram page in 2020. “Instead, I decided to be my own man and Hollywood would eventually conform to me.” In recent months, Kelce has become attached to several upcoming projects, marking what appeared to be a busy off-season. In April, Prime Video announced that Kelce had been selected to host the streamer’s upcoming game show “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?” And then in May, Kelce landed a role on Ryan Murphy’s horror drama “Grotesquerie,” acting alongside Niecy Nash, Courtney B. Vance and Lesley Manville. Kelce had admitted that he had some some nerves about the gig. “I feel like an amateur right now, but it’s definitely a fun challenge, and I’m enjoying every bit of it,” he said in an interview with “Good Morning America” in June. “I’m coachable. That’s one thing I know from being in sports, I am a coachable guy.” Kelce is also set to make a cameo in the upcoming “Happy Gilmore 2” movie, according to Adam Sandler, who is returning to star in and co-write the long-awaited sequel to the 1996 golf comedy. During a recent episode of Kelce’s “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce” podcast, Sandler teased the scene Kelce is in, saying, “We’re gonna have fun because the scene you’re doing is with so many great golfers. It’s going to be amazing, you’re going to be funny as hell.” The sequel will stream on Netflix. Earlier this year, Kelce also became a first-time executive producer when he invested in the indie movie “My Dead Friend Zoe,” a dark comedy starring Sonequa Martin-Green, Natalie Morales, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman. The movie premiered at SXSW and won the SXSW Film Festival’s Audience Award. Then there’s the podcast, the one that started as two NFL stars and brothers casually talking sports. Now, it’s a chart-topping production that has the brothers signing nine-figure deals that eclipse the ones that they signed to stay on the field. Kelce co-hosts “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce” with his brother Jason, who retired this year from the Philadelphia Eagles after 13 years in the NFL. If he wanted to, Kelce could arguably just keep on chatting with his brother on “New Heights” in his NFL afterlife, but history shows that Kelce isn’t one to be happy on the sidelines, particularly when the Hollywood game is calling his name. For now, at least, Kelce maintains that he’s happiest just being the “guy on the chiefs.” “I just love football and how it takes me away from life and gives me something I can feel genuinely happy about,” Kelce said on Tuesday during a Chiefs pre-season press conference. “I have so much excitement doing it, it’s going to be hard trying to figure out when to call it quits or not.” But as someone once sang, Trav, who are we to fight the alchemy?"
Analysis: Harris’ attempt to separate herself from Biden on the economy frustrates Trump | CNN Politics,"Published 12:05 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",2024-09-05T04:05:37.159Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-separate-biden-economy-trump/index.html,"At the Throwback Brewery, Kamala Harris pivoted to the future, separating herself a little more from Bidenomics as she tries to run as a change candidate from an incumbent administration who is driving Donald Trump to distraction. The vice president on Wednesday stopped in New Hampshire — home to 4 precious electoral votes — before heading off to debate camp in Pittsburgh ahead of her televised clash with the former president next week that could define the election endgame. Harris’ political momentum and her chances in November hinge partly on her success in painting herself as a fresh option for voters and dispelling any notion she’s pitching for the second term of the unpopular president, Joe Biden. This underpins her efforts to court Americans who are sour about high grocery prices and inflation and are locked out of the housing market, as well as her outreach to suburban moderates and middle-class voters in swing states. The vice president had previously vowed to clamp down on price gouging by supermarket giants and pledged to give low-income, first-time homebuyers $25,000 for a downpayment. On Wednesday, she tacked toward the political middle by promising to nurture 25 million new small businesses in her first term with a $50,000 tax deduction for startups. And she called for a significantly lower hike in capital gains taxes than Biden proposed to spark investment and innovation. “I believe America’s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy,” Harris said at a brewery founded by two female business pioneers that sources local ingredients. “Small businesses in our country employ half of all private sector workers. Half of all private sector workers own or run a small business or work for a small business.” The former president, who has been stoking nostalgia for the Trump economy before the crisis set off by the Covid-19 emergency, may attempt to respond to Harris’ recent economic maneuvering when he addresses the New York Economic Club on Thursday. The politics behind Harris’ strategy is clear. On the capital gains tax measure, for instance, Harris ditched a more progressive approach from Biden as she called for a 28% rate on those earning $1 million or more instead of the 39.6% rate that the president included in his budget for fiscal year 2025. Her gesture allows her to show she’s not a hostage to her boss’ policies as she rebuts Trump’s claim that she’s the heiress to a failed economic legacy. The proposal may not go unnoticed either by Democratic donors with wealth in investment income who have helped her raise half a billion dollars in campaign cash. Harris’ embrace of the powerful mythology of American small businesses driving broader prosperity and the wider economy also seems designed to counter attempts by Trump and surrogates to dismiss the California Democrat as an extreme “San Francisco liberal,” a “communist” and a “Bolshevik.” Her new approaches have led economists to debate the workability of “Harrisomics.” Would her federal ban on price gouging simply lead to shortages of goods as happened in the past? And would throwing more money into the housing market inevitably trigger price inflation and make homes even more unaffordable? These questions might prove troublesome in the early weeks of a potential Harris administration. But less than nine weeks from the election, Harris is more concerned with creating a striking political impression than the mechanics of economic policy. Given Trump’s polling advantage on the economy, an in-depth fight on policy on the issue with her rival would probably not be wise anyway. Harris needs to make the election a referendum on personality and on which candidate can pose as a fresh political force. Even small steps out of Biden’s shadow therefore can be important. Harris has, for instance, done far more than Biden to show that she understands the pain of young adults cut out of the housing market and shoppers who dread the cost of their weekly groceries. During his campaign, the president would often indignantly defend the successes of the economy and downplay the hardship that remains. James Carville laid out a potential strategy for Harris in a New York Times column Monday. He said the 2024 election would be defined by “who is fresh and who is rotten.” The veteran Democratic strategist also wrote that it would not be an insult to Biden for Harris to go her own way — it was imperative for her political identity. “It shows even more sharply that she is passionate about her own ideas and represents change rather than more of the same,” he wrote, recalling the slogan that helped former President Bill Clinton prevail as a change candidate over President George H.W. Bush in 1992. Harris’ attempt to convince voters she’s a new breeze is infuriating Trump. The ex-president’s comments and his campaign statements bristle with frustration that Harris, after four years in the Biden administration, is getting a fresh look and that he’s lost his role as change agent in the race. Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance expressed incredulity that Harris could attempt this pivot in an interview with the Hugh Hewitt radio show on Wednesday. The Ohio senator sought to thwart Harris’ image makeover by stressing she was an incumbent. “You’re the vice president of the United States. You could be pursuing these policies immediately, but you’re not,” Vance said. “She has caused this inflation crisis with her policies, and now she wants to fix it by waving the magic wand.” Vance also rejected the vice president’s plan for lowering grocery prices even as he admitted that not every American corporation was an “angel.” “We’ve had price controls before in this country and everywhere else. It fails every time it happens,” Vance said. “It means you’re not able to buy flour. You’re not able to buy eggs in the grocery store. That’s what price controls do.” The Trump campaign is also seeking to squelch Harris’ economic positioning with a cutting advertising campaign. One recent ad that ran in Georgia patched together clips of news coverage of tough economic headlines. A television anchor bemoaned “the alarming spike in inflation soaring to its highest level in nearly 40 years.” Another says, “We’re still dealing with inflation.” In between these clips, the campaign shows tape of Harris praising “Bidenomics” and cheerfully saying in speeches that “Bidenomics is working.” The Trump campaign on Wednesday dismissed the Harris small business plan, arguing that she would push for higher income taxes and expanded inheritance taxes among others that would hurt small firms and consumers. The ex-president has previously balked at the vice president’s adoption of his own proposal to end taxes on tips, which was especially seen as a play for hospitality workers in the swing state of Nevada. Trump has been proclaiming that if Harris wins in November, the economy would slump into a Great Depression. He said much the same about Biden in 2020, but the president has presided over strong, consistent jobs growth and one of the strongest rebounds from the pandemic of any developed economy, notwithstanding the inflation crisis that his White House initially underestimated. Trump’s plans are often as vague as those of his Democratic rival. As he did as president, Trump promised great deals for Americans without specifying how he’d make them work or pay for them. He offered this jumble of words on Fox News on Sunday, for instance: “We’re going to take care of Social Security, we’re not going to do anything to hurt our seniors. There is so much cutting, there’s so much waste in this government. There’s so much fat in this government.” Trump’s plan, meanwhile, to drastically raise tariffs on imports — especially those from China – has prompted many economists to warn he will drastically raise costs for consumers and spark a new round of inflation. But at this critical moment of a bitter, close campaign, both Harris and Trump seem less concerned with economic policies that are proven to work than those that can deliver an immediate political benefit."
"Harris campaign has agreed to debate rules, including muted mics | CNN Politics","Updated 10:55 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",2024-09-04T22:32:53.276Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-abc-debate-rules-microphones/index.html,"Kamala Harris’ campaign has accepted the terms of next week’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations. However, in a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the letter from the Harris campaign to the network, shared in part with CNN, said. ABC News officially announced the rules later Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format. The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said. Pool reporters, who can report on what they hear both sides saying, will also be in the room, the source added. “Beyond the debate rules published today, which were mutually agreed upon by two campaigns on May 15th, we have made no other agreements,” an ABC News spokesperson told CNN. The campaign wrote in its letter that it was accepting the terms so as not to risk Trump pulling out of the debate. “Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,” the campaign said. “We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accept the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.” The former president on Wednesday said he was going to “let her talk” when asked about the upcoming debate with Harris. “You know when I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion, and I let him talk. I’m going to let her talk,” Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. “It depends a lot on ABC, will they be fair or not?” Trump said. “I hope they will be fair.” Trump, according to ABC News, won a virtual coin flip held earlier in the week to determine podium placement and order of closing statements during the debate. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen. The Trump campaign had previously accepted the rules governing the September 10 matchup. The former president addressed the issue of microphones during an event in Virginia last week, saying: “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.” But in a post on his Truth Social platform the next day, Trump added, “The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden.” ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke. It was a rule that the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change after she became a presidential candidate. The network’s rules also state that there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and the candidates cannot ask questions of one another.

Liz Cheney says she is voting for Harris for president | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:27 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",2024-09-04T22:19:12.041Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/liz-cheney-voting-kamala-harris/index.html,"Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in November, she said during remarks at Duke University, according to audio obtained by CNN. The former Wyoming congresswoman noted the importance of voting for Harris in states like North Carolina, where she appeared on Wednesday. “I think it is crucially important for people to recognize, not only is what I just said about the danger that Trump poses something that should prevent people from voting for him, but I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” Cheney said. She made the announcement in North Carolina specifically because it is a battleground state, according to a source close to Cheney. “And as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” she continued. The Harris campaign highlighted Cheney’s endorsement Wednesday night and pointed to other Republicans who have backed her, including former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. “The Vice President is proud to have earned Congresswoman Cheney’s vote. She is a patriot who loves this country and puts our democracy and our Constitution first,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a vocal critic of Trump, previously told CNN she is committed to doing what’s necessary to stop the former president from returning to the White House. Cheney’s outspokenness against Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election — including her vote to impeach him — eventually cost her her post in House Republican leadership. The House GOP ousted her as conference chair, replacing her with a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the insurrection, ultimately losing her seat in Congress in a 2022 primary to a Trump-backed challenger. Cheney tried to counteract Trump’s influence in the 2022 midterms by opposing candidates who repeated his falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen. The political action committee she started placed an ad buy urging Arizona voters to reject GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and Republican Secretary of State nominee Mark Finchem. She also crossed party lines to stump for two moderate Democrats in competitive House races that year. This story has been updated with additional information."
"KFile: Harris move to the center on border wall, asylum contradicts her years of progressive immigration positions | CNN Politics","Published 3:30 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",2024-09-04T19:30:34.677Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/kfile-harris-border-wall-asylum-contradicts-progressive-immigration-positions/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris likes to portray herself as tough on the border and immigration. Recent TV ads highlight her time as a “border state prosecutor” who aggressively targeted criminal cartels and drug smugglers, as well as her support for “the toughest border security bill in decades.” That bill, which failed in the Senate in February and again in May, included $650 million for new border wall construction. Images of the border wall built during the Trump administration are featured in the Harris ads, yet Harris repeatedly criticized the wall over the years, describing it as an affront to both hers and America’s values. In her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” Harris called the wall “useless” and said it was “nothing more than a symbol, a monument standing in opposition to not just everything I value, but to the fundamental values upon which this country was built.” A CNN KFile review of Harris’ social media posts found that she criticized the border wall more than 50 times during the Trump administration, calling it, among other things, “stupid,” “useless,” and a “medieval vanity project.” As she tries to strengthen her image on the border, Harris will have to reckon with her years of opposing some of the very policies she now embraces. That includes building more border wall and also making it harder for migrants to come to the US seeking asylum. Harris has tacked to the middle on other key issues, such as no longer banning fracking or supporting Medicare for All — positions she once supported before being picked as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last Thursday, Harris said, despite her policy shifts, “my values have not changed.” Immigration and the border remain significant vulnerabilities for Harris and the Democratic party, according to some national polls, although recent polling suggests Harris has managed to narrow the gap. Not all border work stopped during the Biden administration. In 2021 and 2022, the administration continued work near the border wall to prevent flooding, complete prior construction of access roads and close “small gaps that remain open from prior construction activities and remediating incomplete gates.” In October 2023, the Biden administration allowed the additional building of border wall in Texas, with Biden saying he had to use money appropriated for the wall in 2019 and could not redirect it. “I tried to get them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money. They didn’t, they wouldn’t. And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can’t stop that,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office at the time. In response to questions from CNN, a Harris campaign aide said in referencing the recent campaign ad that it was “inaccurate to imply a few images” are “somehow representative of the VP’s overall policy position on a complex issue when the entirety of the ad, the VP’s remarks as the nominee, and the governance of this Administration have been clear where she stands on border security - supporting the bipartisan border agreement.” Along with extending funding for more border barriers and hiring more federal immigration authorities, the border security bill that Harris has vowed to sign as president would also largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. Many of the people who encounter Border Patrol agents at the southern border are migrants seeking asylum and claim to be fleeing conflict or persecution in their home country. A CNN KFile review of Harris’ comments from 2017 through August 2020, before Biden picked her as his running mate, found that she repeatedly pledged to “honor the process” of asylum established decades ago and slammed policies that restricted asylum seekers. Harris was one of seven US senators who signed onto an amicus brief in late 2018 supporting a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers challenging a Trump administration rule that effectively barred all asylum claims outside ports of entry. “United States law is crystal clear that men, women, and children who arrive at any point on our borders may seek asylum,” read the brief. “In our democratic system, laws may not be overturned by Executive fiat.” A judge struck down that rule in August 2019 and the Trump administration lost its appeals. While running for president in 2019, Harris pledged to respect asylum law and called restricting asylum a “stain on our moral conscience.” “Under a Harris administration, issues like asylum, for example, we are gonna honor the process and not try to circumvent the process and expedite the process for the sake of some political goal as opposed to the sake of justice and fairness,” Harris said on the “Pod Save America” podcast in 2019. She reiterated the pledge in several tweets at that time, writing in July 2019, “As president, I will immediately put in place a meaningful process to review asylum cases. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. It’s time we had a president whose actions reflected the values of our country.” During a June 2019 interview with CBS News, she vowed that a Harris administration would honor established asylum procedures, stating, “If they are deserving of protection, we will give it to ‘em.” A year later, in June 2020, Harris was one of 34 senators to sign a congressional letter criticizing the Covid-era Title 42 authority, which allowed the government to bar migrants from entering the country because of the public health crisis. The letter equated Trump’s asylum policies to the denial of safe passage to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust. Shortly after Biden and Harris took office in 2021, the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border significantly strained US immigration resources. The Biden-Harris administration initially kept Title 42 in place. In 2022, Republicans sued to keep the administration from ending Title 42, which it finally did in May 2023 when it announced the end of national Covid-era emergency restrictions. As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration. Despite this role, Harris’ current stance on asylum marks a notable departure from her earlier promises to uphold the asylum process and protect vulnerable migrants. After Senate Republicans abandoned the border bill at the behest of Trump, the Biden administration took executive actions to restrict asylum. In June, Biden signed an executive order largely barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is reached, a departure from longstanding US asylum policy. While Harris has yet to publicly comment on her plans for asylum, her campaign manager has signaled Harris would continue implementing Biden’s executive orders curbing asylum. Throughout the Trump administration, Harris was a consistent critic of the border wall. In April 2018, Harris signed onto a letter that urged the appropriations committee to reduce funding for the border wall and to halt hiring new Border Patrol agents. CNN identified one of the border walls in her new campaign ads as constructed during Trump’s presidency in Sasabe, Arizona, in an area where there had not previously been border wall. The other walls feature signs that they were Trump-era walls, such as so-called anti-climbing plates that were built during the Trump years. “It’s the president’s vanity project,” Harris said in June 2019 at an event promoting her book. “Let’s just point to the facts and the evidence and the data. And the fact is that we are not facing a crisis.” “This president rode a wave into office of vilifying, a whole population of people,” she said at another event in 2019. “His multi-billion dollar vanity project called a wall is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that he actually hasn’t focused on working people in America. So instead of focusing on the needs of working families in America, he creates a scapegoat, a boogeyman.”"
"Harris to break with Biden on capital gains tax, proposing a smaller increase | CNN Politics","Updated 6:38 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",2024-09-04T18:45:02.982Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-capital-gains-tax/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris proposed increasing the long-term capital gains tax rate to 28% for wealthy Americans during an economic speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday, breaking with the policy laid out by President Joe Biden in his 2025 budget by suggesting a lower rate. The current long-term capital gains tax rate – 20%, plus an additional 3.8% tax on higher earners – is paid when an investment is sold, or gains are realized. The Biden budget proposes raising that rate to the top rate he wants to levy on ordinary income – 39.6% – for households with taxable income over $1 million. Harris, the people familiar with the matter say, believes 39.6% is too high. While Harris still supports taxing the wealthiest individuals and corporations at higher rates – as Biden’s budget also calls for – she believes that a lower capital gains rate would incentivize investors to put more money into startups and small businesses. She has also proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the current 21% rate set by Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Advisers said Harris supports allowing many Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations to lapse in favor of funding more targeted programs for families and small businesses. “My vision of an opportunity economy is one where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed - where everyone, regardless of who they are, where they start, can build wealth, including intergenerational wealth,” Harris said in New Hampshire. She added: “I believe America’s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy.” Biden’s budget proposal also contains other tax increases on the wealthy, including raising the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6%, up from the 37% rate established by the 2017 Trump tax cuts law, and levying a 25% minimum income tax on households with more than $100 million in net worth. Harris said Wednesday that she also supports the latter measure – known as the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax – though various efforts to levy such taxes have failed to make it through Congress. Under Biden’s budget proposal, unrealized gains on assets would also be subject to the minimum tax, unlike current law. Plus, she is in favor of quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks to 4%. That levy was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Democrats pushed through Congress in 2022. The move comes as Harris attempts to establish herself as more moderate in some areas of economic policy while still embracing some elements of a more populist platform, like a $25,000 credit for first-time homebuyers, a $6,000 child tax credit for newborns and federal investigations into retail grocery pricing. During a truncated sprint toward Election Day, Harris has embraced the policies of the Biden administration, which ushered trillions of government spending into the American economy, which also grappled with inflation at its highest in decades. Her remarks on Wednesday, part of a policy rollout that came after criticisms of the lack of policy from her campaign since Biden dropped from the race in July, represented the first time Harris has publicly diverged from Biden administration policy. Democratic strategist James Carville wrote in The New York Times that, in order to brand herself as a forward-looking candidate, Harris would need to establish some distance between Biden’s policies and her own. As part of the rollout of her economic policy in recent days, Harris has proposed a major, 10-fold tax deduction for small businesses - from up to $5,000 to up to $50,000 - and vowed to pursue measures that would cut red tape that would make such businesses easier to operate. She has also pushed for a federal ban on price gouging and a permanent expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000. The vice president has also vowed to end the federal income tax on tips, sparking Trump’s ire because he has made a similar campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
The stark contrasts between Harris and Trump are on full display in their preparations for next week’s debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:41 PM EDT, Sat September 7, 2024",2024-09-04T11:30:19.888Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-debate-prep/index.html,"When Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris walk onstage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia next week, it will be their first in-person encounter — a moment each has been mulling as they prepare with advisers for the high-stakes moment. For Harris, a stand-in for the former president — wearing his signature red tie — has helped her visualize the scene ahead of time. Trump, meanwhile, has eschewed a sparring partner in the role of Harris, choosing instead to replicate the informal “policy time” that formed his preparation ahead of June’s debate with President Joe Biden. That debate ended in disaster for the incumbent president, who ended his reelection bid three weeks later and thrust the presidential race into uncharted waters. Sources close to Trump insist not much had changed in terms of how he will prepare for upcoming debate, despite a switch at the top of the Democratic ticket. One difference: the enlisting of one of the vice president’s ex-rivals, Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 in a crowded field that also included Harris. The addition of Gabbard is particularly notable given the tense exchanges she had with the vice president during their 2020 race that left Harris rattled. Whether Trump’s approach with a new, younger candidate will prove as effective remains an open question. Harris’ team, for its part, views her as an underdog given Trump’s lengthy experience in general election debates — this will be his seventh in total, more than any candidate in history. In the week ahead of the Tuesday face-off, Trump has a relatively light campaign schedule and will shuttle between his Bedminster and Mar-a-Lago resorts, as well as Trump Tower in Manhattan, where advisers said he has built in “policy time” on his schedule Allies have advised Trump to hammer the same issues of inflation and immigration, with a goal of trying to make Harris the incumbent in this race. Many of those close to Trump believe their best bet on winning in November is linking Harris to some of Biden’s more unpopular areas, particularly the economy and immigration, where polls showed Trump held a clear advantage against Biden among voters and where Harris has now closed the gap. Trump’s team has been sketching out potential responses on reproductive rights with the expectation Harris will make that a focus during the debate. The Harris and Trump campaigns remain in discussions about the debate rules, according to sources, in particular whether microphones will be muted when a candidate isn’t speaking. The Harris campaign has been pushing for microphones to remain on for the duration of the debate, while the Trump campaign wants them turned off while the other candidate is speaking, in line with the rules at the CNN-hosted debate in June. The Trump campaign has insisted the matter is settled. Even before Biden dropped out and Harris emerged as the Democratic standard-bearer, the vice president had begun putting together a debate preparation team ahead of her expected showdown with Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Her elevation to Democratic nominee added urgency to the preparations, with a new opponent to game out and the stakes exponentially higher. Over the past month, Harris has engaged in debate prep sessions with a small team of advisers, led by Rohini Kosoglu, a top policy adviser, and Karen Dunn, a longtime Democratic debate specialist. Others involved in preparation sessions include Harris’ White House chief of staff, Lorraine Voles; her campaign chief of staff, Sheila Nix; and Sean Clegg, a veteran strategist. The preparations have included mock debate sessions, with the role of Trump played by Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton who stood in for Trump during Clinton’s own debate prep in 2016. One advantage Harris has benefited from is advice from the only two Democrats to have faced off against Trump on a debate stage: Biden and Clinton. Harris maintains a close relationship with both, and each has offered their counsel since she became the nominee. Still, even some of Harris’s top supporters have cautioned against overconfidence heading into the showdown. In an interview on CNN this week, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said underestimating Trump would be a mistake, pointing to debates the Republican won against Biden and Clinton. “We shouldn’t be thinking that somehow that Kamala Harris has a greater ability to win a debate than Donald Trump,” he said. “They’re going to come in as significant rivals with very, very different points of view. And I think getting those points of view across and making sure that you’re not getting, you know, flummoxed, frankly, by Donald Trump will be an important thing for Kamala Harris.” Those around Trump tend to stay away from using the word “preparation” when it comes to the debate. Thus far, no one is expected to sit in for Harris, just as no one played Biden ahead of the June debate. In some sessions, aides have acted as moderators, but more often than not, these conversations serve as briefings with occasional questioning. Among those helping with the policy review are senior advisers Jason Miller and Vince Haley, as well as Stephen Miller. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who helped ahead of Trump’s debate with Biden, is also expected to play a role in this round of preparation. While Trump’s team is hoping to mimic the results of the first debate against Biden, some allies of the former president acknowledge that Harris is a much different debater than the sitting president. Allies also have expressed concern over the tone Trump will strike with Harris, noting that the former president’s often aggressive demeanor may play differently with a woman. Sources say Harris is keenly aware of the approach Trump may take on the stage. “She’s very aware of who he is and what he’s going to bring,” one source close to the campaign told CNN, adding: “She has a plan, she has a vision, she’s going to put it forward.” The race itself has also fundamentally changed. In a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll, 46% of likely voters viewed Harris favorably versus 43% unfavorably. Trump’s favorability ratings were a dismal 33% to 58%. Tuesday’s debate stage will be the closest Harris and Trump will have ever come to each other over the course of their overlapping careers. The only time they’ve previously been in the same room was inside the House chamber during Trump’s State of the Union addresses; Trump skipped the inauguration when Harris was sworn in as vice president. Depending on how the night goes, it could also be their last. Neither has committed to a second debate. Coming face-to-face is a moment Harris has been thinking about for several weeks as she scales up her campaign effort and considers the attacks her rival may deploy. As Harris allies brace for personal broadsides from Trump, their message to the Democratic candidate: Don’t get roped in. “Prepare her for Donald Trump to walk in there hot and prepare to attack and get her off balance,” said Donna Brazile, a close Harris ally who also managed Al Gore’s 2000 campaign, citing the debate between Trump and Clinton in 2016. “This is a candidate and former president who knows how to command a stage. That’s his strength,” Brazile said. “Don’t try to compete with someone who’s a master.” Instead, allies like Brazile have underscored the need to stay on message. “In these environments, there has to be an argument, a thesis, a message they want to communicate about Trump, and then they will use the evidence to prove that. This is where her prosecutorial chops come into play,” one former Harris adviser told CNN. “Part of the challenge in debate prep is to push her on things that will make her uncomfortable so that she won’t have heard those things for the first time onstage,” the former adviser said, adding that the vice president has become more familiar with personal attacks amid GOP criticism in the last three years. One of the standout moments that allies often point to is her 2020 debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Early on in the debate, as Harris rebutted the Trump administration’s assertion that its disastrously slow response to the Covid-19 pandemic was out of a desire to keep Americans calm, Pence tried to cut her off. “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking,” Harris said. Harris intentionally pared back her travel leading up to the upcoming presidential debate to dedicate time to preparation, sources told CNN. She will travel to Pittsburgh on Thursday to prepare with her team, according to two sources familiar with the planning, and will stay for several nights until the debate Tuesday. It’s the second time the vice president will visit the city this week after campaigning with Biden on Labor Day. She plans to make community stops while she’s in Pittsburgh and stay on the campaign trail in a critical battleground state, according to one of the sources. It’s a slightly different approach than Biden took ahead of his sole, disastrous debate in June. He retreated to Camp David in Maryland, without any public appearances in the week or so ahead of the debate. Harris’s approach more resembles then-President Barack Obama, who in 2012 took his “debate camp” to resorts outside Las Vegas and in Williamsburg, Virginia."
"September 4, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-09-04T10:02:01.095Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-04-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Lawyers for Donald Trump asked a federal appeals court to stop his sentencing until the judges can hear the former president’s legal argument to move the hush money case into federal court. The last-ditch request comes after a federal judge rejected Trump’s motion to move the state case into federal court and delay the sentencing currently scheduled for September 18.  Trump filed a motion to appeal the decision denying the move into federal court Wednesday morning. That evening his lawyers filed motions with the federal judge and appeals court to stay the federal judge’s ruling until the appeals court can hear an argument on the merits of moving the case to federal court. The one-two effort is Trumps latest attempt to delay his sentencing.  Trumps lawyers have argued the case should be moved into federal court following the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers. Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney’s office have opposed the challenge to move the case into federal court. They said they defer to the trial judge on Trump’s effort to postpone his sentencing until after the election. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said it’s “hard to believe” that Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent campaign advertising shows the border wall, given the Biden-Harris administration signed an executive order halting American taxpayer dollars from being diverted to construct a border wall.  “That’s hard to believe, even for me,” Vance said at a Turning Point Action event in Mesa, Arizona. “She stopped construction of the border wall on day one, that’s what Kamala Harris did, so is it the border wall that’s laying on the ground? Because that would be appropriate, because that’s what Kamala Harris actually did.” As CNN’s K-File reported earlier Wednesday, recent Harris TV ads highlight her time as a “border state prosecutor” who aggressively targeted criminal cartels and drug smugglers, as well as her support for “the toughest border security bill in decades.” Despite her past criticisms, images of the border wall built during the Trump administration are featured in the ads.  He also continued to falsely claim that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed and supported legislation that allows the state to effectively kidnap children if their parents don’t consent to them seeking gender affirming care. As CNN previously reported, Walz signed an executive order that directed Minnesota agencies to do whatever they could to protect and support Minnesotans seeking gender-affirming health care services. Walz also signed “trans refuge” legislation that safeguarded access to such care. Part of the law states, “A court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this state” and “has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care.” Former President Donald Trump during a Fox News town hall Wednesday claimed Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz’ brother endorsed him and hit Vice President Kamala Harris over past policy reversals. “His bother endorsed me,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity. The Minnesota governor’s brother, Jeff Walz, told NewsNation in an interview Tuesday that he doesn’t agree with his brother’s policies but expressed some remorse for inserting himself into the spotlight, after he posted on social media last week he is “100% opposed” to his brother’s political views and was considering officially endorsing former President Donald Trump. Jeff Walz told NewsNation in an interview that he didn’t intend to “influence the general public” with social media posts that indicated his support for Trump over Harris’ and his brother’s campaign and said he has no plans to campaign “for him or against him” ahead of November’s election. Trump during the town hall also touted the tax cuts he passed in office and criticized Harris’ economic policies — which she expanded on at an event Wednesday. Trump is scheduled to give a speech at The Economic Club of New York on Thursday.  The former president claimed Harris was still in favor of a ban on fracking, despite her campaign saying she no longer holds that position.  “She’s been there for 20 years, that’s what she’s been saying for a long time,” Trump said Wednesday night. “The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot even take a chance,” Trump added. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was “going to let her talk” when asked about his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris.  “You know when I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion and I let him talk. I’m going to let her talk,” Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  “It depends a lot on ABC, will they be fair or not?” Trump said. “I hope they will be fair.”  ABC News on Wednesday officially announced the rules of next week’s presidential debate between Harris and Trump, and both candidates have agreed to the format that microphones will be muted while the other is speaking. Trump claimed Wednesday Harris’ team “wanted notes” and “wanted a desk” but that Trump objected. The rules set out by ABC News do not allow for notes, and the candidates will be standing behind podiums.  Trump also made the baseless claim that he had “already heard” that Harris’ team would “get the questions in advance.” Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday again stressed how much he wants to win New Hampshire in the 2024 election, and he claimed President Joe Biden “dumped New Hampshire” during the primary.  “We really want to win New Hampshire,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Trump’s comments come after a top Trump volunteer wrote in an email to other volunteers in the state that “the campaign has determined that New Hampshire is no longer a battleground state,” and to instead focus on Pennsylvania. Trump also called into a New Hampshire radio show earlier in the day and posted on Truth Social urging his supporters to turn out in New Hampshire.  Trump referenced how Biden wasn’t on the ballot after the state defied the primary calendar set by the national Democratic Party. Biden won the New Hampshire Democratic primary after Biden loyalists launched an unofficial write-in campaign.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said she is “proud to have earned” Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney’s endorsement on Wednesday.  Cheney, an outspoken critic of Trump, said she would vote for Harris in November during remarks at Duke University, according to audio obtained by CNN. The former congresswoman is the latest Republican to publicly back Harris’ presidential bid, joining former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Last week, more than 200 former GOP presidential staffers also signed an open letter endorsing Harris. Republican Senate candidate Larry Hogan of Maryland on Wednesday touted his pushback to Donald Trump and contrasted himself with the former president over their response to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot. The popular former Maryland governor also touted his response on January 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters attempted to stop Congress’ certification of the 2020 election results and stormed the US Capitol. “On January 6th, when the president was watching the chaos on television, I was the first leader in America to send in the National Guard to protect our nation’s capital and our democracy,” he said. The comments build onto Hogan’s new campaign ad launched earlier today, in which he condemns the violence on January 6 as he looks to defeat Democratic Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks. Hogan has been a longtime critic of Trump. He previously said that he has “no interest” in an endorsement from Trump for his Senate bid as he has been working to distance himself from the national GOP in the blue state. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Pittsburgh on Thursday, according to her campaign, where she is expected to remain as she prepares for the presidential debate next week.  CNN previously reported that Harris intentionally pared back her travel leading up to the upcoming presidential debate at National Constitution Center in Philadelphia to dedicate time to preparation. While in Pittsburgh, she will prepare with her team, according to two sources familiar with the planning, and will stay for several nights until the debate Tuesday. It’s the second time the vice president will visit the city this week after campaigning with President Joe Biden on Labor Day. She plans to make community stops while she’s in Pittsburgh and stay on the campaign trail in a critical battleground state, according to one of the sources. Meanwhile, her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will travel to Erie, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. In Erie, he will participate in “a series of campaign engagements” before speaking at a rally at 6 p.m., according to a news release from the Harris campaign. CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, Kristen Holmes and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. This post has been updated with details of Tim Walz’s Thursday schedule. Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance ripped into Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney who said Wednesday she would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris over former president Donald Trump. Cheney, who has been outspoken against Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, threw her support behind Harris during remarks at Duke University earlier Wednesday, according to audio obtained by CNN. “This is a person whose entire career has been about sending other people’s children off to fight and die for her military conflicts and her ridiculous ideas that somehow we were going to turn Afghanistan, a country that doesn’t even have running water in a lot of places, into a thriving liberal democracy. And for that, Liz Cheney was willing to kill thousands of your children. Liz Cheney, you know what? I think it’s the best thing in the world that she’s supporting Kamala Harris,” Vance continued, appearing to knock Cheney’s opposition to the Trump administration making a deal with the Taliban for the US to pull out of Afghanistan. Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, the wife of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, mourned a school shooting in Georgia on Wednesday that left four dead and nine injured, calling for an end to gun violence in schools. Georgia officials confirmed on Wednesday that two teachers and two students were killed in the shooting at Apalachee High School. Walz told the Michigan teachers that they “deserve the right to go to school every single day without fear of gun violence in their classrooms.” Walz, a former English teacher, also looked to draw a contrast between the policies proposed by Democrats and Republicans, connecting Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic policy rollout earlier in the day with teachers, saying “we are the middle class” that the policies are meant to uplift.  On the other hand, Walz argued, “Trump and Vance see this differently. Their Project 2025 agenda would devastate a generation of students,” referencing the far-right policy blueprint written by several people close to Trump that would drastically overhaul the federal government. ABC News has officially announced the rules of next week’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump — meaning both candidates have agreed to the format, including that microphones will be muted while the other candidate is speaking. Additionally, a virtual coin flip held this week was won by Trump, to determine podium placement and order of closing statements. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen.  Whether microphones would be cut was the last sticking point for the Harris campaign, after Trump’s team had already agreed to the rules last week.  Over the weekend, Harris posted on X that Trump is “surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn’t have confidence in him, the American people definitely can’t.” “We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a transparent way — with the microphones on the whole time,” she added.  Last week Trump said at a campaign stop that while they had already agreed to the rules, he didn’t mind if the mics were on.   The ABC News debate rules largely mirror those used by CNN in its presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Trump in June, when the Biden campaign, at the time, was the one that advocated for muted microphones.  In addition to the muted microphones, the rules state there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and they cannot ask questions of one another. The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of a Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation targeting the 2024 US election is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter. The indictment unsealed in New York’s Southern District accused two employees of RT, the Kremlin’s media arm, of funneling nearly $10 million to an unidentified company, described only as “Company 1” in court documents. CNN has independently confirmed that “Company 1” is Tenet Media, a platform for independent content creators. It is a self-described “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,” according to its website, which matches language contained in the newly-unsealed indictment. The goal of the operation, according to prosecutors, was to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Donald Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests. The indictment also says that Company 1’s website identifies six commentators. Among the commentators listed on Tenet Media’s website are right-wing personalities Benny Johnson and Tim Pool. Both have millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms. Pool interviewed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on his podcast in May. In separate statements released Wednesday, Johnson and Pool say they were victims of the alleged scheme and said they maintained editorial control of the content they had created.  Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris, she said during remarks at Duke University, according to audio obtained by CNN. Cheney previously said she is committed to doing what’s necessary to stop former President Donald Trump from returning to the White House. She joins a number of Republicans and former Republicans who have come out against Trump in support of Harris, including 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain — the youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain — who told CNN he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Harris in November. This post has been updated with more details. Vice President Kamala Harris said debate preparations are “so far, so good,” as she boarded Air Force Two in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  Harris was responding to a question from a pool reporter who asked her how debate prep is going as she departed the Granite State back to Washington, DC. CNN previously reported the vice president will hunker down in Pittsburgh beginning Thursday to prepare ahead of next week’s presidential debate. The debate at National Constitution Center in Philadelphia next week will be Harris’ and Donald Trump’s first in-person encounter. Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday “our hearts are with the victims” after officials said four people were killed in a shooting inside Apalachee High School and nine others were transported to hospitals with injuries. Law enforcement officials at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon identified the 14-year-old student who killed two fellow students and two teachers at the high school. Later Wednesday, Trump during a Fox News town hall was asked about the Georgia shooting and the recent assassination attempt on his life, and he said, “It’s a sick and angry world for a lot of reasons.” Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance also reacted to the shooting Wednesday afternoon. “Our hearts go out to everyone affected by this despicable violence just days into the new school year. We are keeping the victims, their families, and the whole community of Winder, Georgia in our prayers this evening,” Vance said in a message on X. Follow live updates about the shooting here. This post has been updated with additional comments from Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has accepted in a letter sent to ABC News the terms of Harris’ debate with former President Donald Trump next week, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations.  However, in their letter to the network, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “fundamentally disadvantaged by this format.” ABC News has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, the network may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said, according to the source familiar. In addition, there will be pool reporters in the room who can also hear and report on what both sides are saying, the source added.   The campaign went on to write in the letter: “Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format. We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accept the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.” CNN is reaching out to ABC News for comment. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit Wednesday trying to stop one of the biggest counties in his state from mailing voter registration forms to large swaths of unregistered voters.  On Tuesday, the county judge and commissioners in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, approved a contract with a vendor to mail the unsolicited forms to approximately 210,000 people, with the goal of registering about 75,000 voters. Paxton had previously warned of legal action if Bexar County moved forward with its plan to work with the vendor, Civic Government Solutions. In the new complaint, Paxton argues that it’s illegal for county officials to arrange for unsolicited, mass mailing of voter registration forms. Paxton’s lawsuit is the latest step in a large-scale effort by Republican leaders in Texas against largely-Democratic cities that are trying to make voting easier and more accessible. Paxton’s office also launched an election integrity unit in 2018 investigating allegations of voter fraud, but the unit has yielded few convictions.  The company contracted by Bexar County is run by a known progressive activist, Jeremy Smith, but Smith sought to reassure county leaders on Tuesday that his company (CGS) is strictly nonpartisan, saying it’s in the company’s financial interest to register as many voters as possible on both sides of the aisle. Reached for comment after the lawsuit was announced, county leaders indicated they still plan to move forward with the registration effort. In a statement, Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai said he and the commissioners sought their own legal opinion and feel the county still has the right to mail out registration forms. This post has been updated with a statement from Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai. Vice President Kamala Harris is adding tax relief for small businesses to her economic policy platform aimed at helping middle-class and working Americans. Harris unveiled Wednesday a proposal to massively increase the existing small business tax deduction for startup costs and cut the red tape that impedes small businesses’ formation and growth. Her goal: 25 million new small business applications by the end of her first term, up from the record 19 million received under the Biden administration as of mid-August. Harris on Wednesday also proposed raising the capital gains tax rate, though not by as much as President Joe Biden has called for. Here’s what we know about Harris’ economic proposals: Find out what else Harris is proposing for the economy here. This post has been updated with the policies Harris unveiled on Wednesday. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign announced Wednesday it raised $130 million in the month of August, ending the month with nearly $300 million cash on hand.  Vice President Kamala Harris by the end of July had surpassed Trump for the amount of cash each campaign had on hand, reporting $219.7 million to Trump’s $151.3 million. While Harris’ campaign has not yet shared its August fundraising numbers, a Harris campaign official said last month it was nearing $500 million in fundraising. Trump’s campaign said in a news release that 98% of the August donations were under $200. “These fundraising numbers from August are a reflection of that movement and will propel President Trump’s America First movement back to the White House so we can undo the terrible failures of Harris and Biden,” said Brian Hughes, a senior advisor for the Trump Campaign. CNN’s David Wright and Alex Leeds Matthews contributed to this report. Vice President Kamala Harris called a deadly school shooting in Winder, Georgia, a “senseless tragedy” in her first public comments on the incident. On Wednesday, at least four people were killed at Apalachee High School, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Another nine people have been taken to hospitals with injuries, the bureau said. “It does not have to be this way, and this is one of the many issues that’s at stake in this election,” Harris said. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also reacted to news of the shooting Wednesday. He called the incident “tragic” and “a situation that’s all too common.” “Our hearts are out there right now, but our work needs to do to prevent these in the future, as we know,” Walz said during a visit to a Lancaster, Pennsylvania Democratic field office. Follow live updates about the shooting here. Vice President Kamala Harris proposed a smaller increase in taxes on capital gains during an economic speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday, breaking with the policy laid out by President Joe Biden in his 2025 budget. The current capital gains tax rate – 23.8% for higher earners – is paid when an investment is sold, or gains are realized. The Biden budget proposes raising that rate to the top rate he wants to levy on ordinary income – 39.6% – for households with taxable income over $1 million. Harris, the people familiar with the matter say, believes 39.6% is too high and outlined her proposal in New Hampshire. While Harris still supports taxing the wealthiest individuals and corporations at higher rates – as Biden’s budget also calls for – she believes that a lower capital gains rate would incentivize investors to put more money into startups and small businesses. Advisers said Harris supports allowing many Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations to lapse in favor of funding more targeted programs for families and small businesses. Biden’s budget proposal also contains other tax increases on the wealthy, including raising the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6%, up from the 37% rate established by the 2017 Trump tax cuts law, and levying a 25% minimum income tax on households with more than $100 million in net worth. The move comes as Harris attempts to establish herself as more moderate in some areas of economic policy while still embracing some elements of a more populist platform, like a $25,000 credit for first-time homebuyers, a $6,000 child tax credit for newborns and federal investigations into retail grocery pricing. Read more about Harris’ proposal. This post has been updated with a quote from Harris’ speech Wednesday. Former President Donald Trump posted a short video on TikTok and his social media platform, Truth Social, ahead of North Carolina’s early voting. North Carolina is the first battleground state to begin the voting process, sending out absentee by mail ballots on Friday. “So whether it’s mail-in ballots, early voting, or voting on Election Day, you’ve got to get out and vote.” Trump added. “We’ve got to save our country, we’re the only ones that are going to save it. That other group of people, they’re going to destroy our country. We can’t let that happen.” Trump continued.  This comes as Trump has recently stated in an interview with Dr. Phil, and repeatedly during some of his rallies, that mail-in ballots “shouldn’t be allowed.” The battle for control of the House of Representatives will come down to a few dozen of the most competitive races, and the parties and their allies are honing in on those battleground districts, booking tens of millions worth of ad time over the coming weeks. These top battleground districts are spread across the country. But a few states, like California and New York – which typically see little competitive action at the presidential or senate level – are home to buckets of key races that could be decisive. On the frontlines are several freshman GOP members, many facing rematches of extremely close 2022 contests. Five districts from California and three from New York populate the list of the 20 House races with the most ad buys remaining between this week and Election Day, while a fourth New York district makes the top 30.  Here’s a snapshot of some of the key races in California and New York: California: Top California House races feature several freshman or second-term GOP incumbents, multiple rematches, and an open seat race in a competitive district formerly held for Democrats by Katie Porter, who left to unsuccessfully run in the Senate primary earlier this year. Voters in the 22nd District are set to see $16.9 million worth of advertising as GOP Rep. David Valadao looks to fend off repeat challenger Rudy Salas, and Republicans have more future ad bookings there, about $10.2 million to $6.7 million. The parties are placing similar bets on the 27th District, where another Republican, Rep. Mike Garcia, is seeking reelection, and Republicans have about $10.1 million booked here, while Democrats have $6 million reserved.  New York: In New York, a trio of freshmen Republican incumbents are also on the frontline of their party’s effort to retain its slim House majority. Rep. Marc Molinaro in the 19th District, Rep. Mike Lawler in the 17th District, and Rep. Anthony D’Esposito in the 4th District are all among the 20 races set to see the most ad spending through Election Day. In the 19th, Molinaro’s district, Republicans have about $10.3 million booked, while Democrats have about $8.9 million reserved, hoping to lift challenger Josh Riley after his extremely narrow loss to Molinaro in 2022. It’s currently ranked third overall among House races set to see the most ad spending through Election Day. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s brother said in an interview Tuesday he doesn’t agree with his sibling’s policies but expressed some remorse for inserting himself into the spotlight after making political comments on social media last week. Jeff Walz, the older brother of Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, told NewsNation he didn’t intend to “influence the general public” with his social media posts. He said he has no plans to be campaigning “for him or against him” ahead of November’s election. Jeff Walz’s comments come after he wrote in the comment section of an old Facebook post on Friday that he hasn’t spoken to his brother in eight years, but is “100% opposed to all his ideology.”  In another comment Friday, he responded to someone suggesting he “get on stage” with Trump and offer his official endorsement. “I’ve thought hard about doing something like that!,” he wrote in response to the idea of formally endorsing Trump. “I’m torn between that and just keeping my family out of it. The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future,” he said of his brother. He has since said he regrets sharing his views on Facebook, and explained he made the posts to clarify his views to people in his life who thought he was aligned with his brother politically.   Jeff Walz lamented the distance between him and his brother, saying “it’s too bad” they’ve grown apart and expressed hope for the possibility they can “disagree and still be civil brothers.” He added that any “stories” he had to share about Tim Walz wouldn’t reveal anything “hidden” about him.  Jeff Walz declined to share with NewsNation who he would be voting for in November. But he has a history of supporting Trump dating back to his first presidential campaign in 2016.  CNN has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment. The Biden administration announced a sweeping set of actions to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, including unveiling criminal charges against two Russian nationals, sanctions on ten individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains. At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Two employees of RT, the Russian state media network, were indicted in a US court for allegedly being part of a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans, according to the Justice Department. Taken together, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s expected actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, the sources said. CNN first reported on the pending US actions earlier Wednesday. The Russian disinformation operation is being laundered through both Americans and non-American voices, four of the sources said. On Wednesday afternoon, Attorney General Merrick Garland hosted a meeting of the Justice Department’s Election Threats Task Force that was attended by senior law enforcement leaders, including FBI Director Christopher Wray. Read more about these developments here. This post has been updated with more details on the US actions. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz visited a produce market before meeting volunteers in the first stops on his two-day swing through battleground Pennsylvania on Wednesday, his first solo visit to the state since joining the Democratic ticket. Walz and his daughter Hope purchased some baked goods at the Cherry Hill Orchards Outlet produce market in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, including some “whoopie pies” and apple cider donuts, according to pool reports.  Walz then brought the baked goods to campaign volunteers at a “volunteer appreciation” event in Lancaster, where he thanked them for working on behalf of the Harris-Walz campaign, according to pool reports. Why Pennsylvania is key: The destiny of the White House may hang on a deadlocked fight between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for Georgia and Pennsylvania, two battlegrounds that have been decisive in crowning the last two presidents. The evolving electoral map is revealed in new CNN/SSRS polls out Wednesday of six swing states that captured the transformation in the race since the vice president replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. The polling data suggests that Harris is two-thirds of the way to consolidating, at least for now, the critical midwestern “Blue Wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that have long been the most credible route back to the White House for a Democratic nominee. But the tied race at this point in Pennsylvania suggests that Harris still faces a massive task in putting away a state that Biden won by only 1.2% of the vote four years ago. CNN’s Stephen Collinson contributed reporting to this post. The 2024 presidential race has entered a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump preparing to debate in less than a week and the first ballots going out Friday in North Carolina. Read about other upcoming campaign events here. CNN’s Annette Choi and Zachary B. Wolf contributed reporting. Former President Donald Trump continues to juggle his campaign and the multiple legal challenges he faces. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office on Wednesday again expressed its opposition to Trump’s request to pause the proceedings in his New York state criminal case.  After filing a petition to remove Trump’s hush money case to federal court last week, his lawyers asked Judge Juan Merchan to let that litigation play out before ruling on Trump’s pending motion to vacate the conviction over the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling.   But a federal judge denied Trump’s request to move the case to the Southern District of New York Tuesday evening. Trump’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal of that decision hours later.  In a letter filed with the state court Wednesday the DA’s office says Trump now has no basis for his request to pause the state proceedings because of that federal ruling.  The letter does not reference Trump’s notice of appeal filed late Tuesday night.   Judge Merchan has not ruled on Trump’s separate request to delay the sentencing until after the election. Merchan could issue a decision as soon as this week. Trump could face as much as four years in prison when he is sentenced. He was convicted earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records. This is one of four criminal cases the former president faces while running again for president. Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver a speech in New Hampshire today where she is expected to unveil the next tranche of her economic plan.  High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give President Joe Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their wrath. In new CNN polling of six swing states, economic issues remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters in their choice for president. Harris now trails Trump on trust to handle the economy by relatively smaller margins than Biden did; across the current polls, former President Donald Trump is more trusted than Harris on the economy by 8 points on average. Harris spoke last month about some of her economic proposals, including enhanced tax credits for kids, housing assistance and efforts to stop price gouging. She described her forward-looking agenda as “an opportunity economy,” where Americans are given a real chance to succeed. Highlights of Harris’ economic promises Highlights of Trump’s economic promises: Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s economic plans. You know the feeling you have the second you step off a Tilt-A-Whirl? That moment when your foot finally hits terra firma after your body’s been through a spin cycle? That’s kind of where the US economy lives right now — a little dizzy from the ride, vision blurry, feet stepping cautiously forward and trying not to take a tumble. Meanwhile, everyone at the fair is watching to see what happens next. Here’s the deal: The next two weeks will bring unusually close attention to the US monthly jobs report (due Friday morning) and the Federal Reserve policy decision (streaming live from Washington, DC, on September 18). Those two events are the kind of thing that, in normal times, are tracked mostly by economists and Wall Street types. Of course, we’re not in a normal time — we’re in election time. That means even the stodgiest of reports could force the presidential candidates to recalibrate their message on the issue voters have repeatedly told pollsters is their top concern. For former President Donald Trump and the Republicans, the narrative is simple: Anything bad you’re feeling about inflation or the job market? That’s the Biden administration’s fault. For Vice President Kamala Harris, who moved to the top of the Democratic ticket in late July, the message about the economy has had to be more nuanced, recognizing consumers’ legitimate frustrations about high prices and inflation, while touting Democrats’ success in keeping the labor market afloat and avoiding a recession. Keep reading here. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have a busy schedule today as they prepare for next week’s presidential debate and hit the trail in this last critical stretch of the 2024 campaign. Harris and Trump, along with their respective running mates Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, are visiting multiple states to make their case. Here’s a look at what the candidates are up to today: The Biden administration on Wednesday plans to accuse Russia of a sustained effort to influence the 2024 US election by using Kremlin-run media and other online platforms to target US voters with disinformation, six sources familiar with the matter told CNN. It’s expected the US will make a series of moves on Wednesday aimed at addressing the Kremlin’s efforts including the White House publicly condemning the actions and the Justice Department announcing law enforcement action targeting the covert Russian, the sources said. RT, the Russian state media network, is a major focus of the US announcement, the sources said. US officials see the Russian outlet as a key piece of Kremlin propaganda efforts. The Russian disinformation operation is being laundered through both Americans and non-American voices, four of the sources said. Taken together, the actions would be the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s expected actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, the sources said. Read more about these developments here. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday attacked Vice President Kamala Harris’ intelligence and claimed Democrats coalesced around Harris — who is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party — because they “wanted to be politically correct.”  Trump’s call into a New Hampshire radio show comes as Harris is expected to campaign in the state on Wednesday. It also comes the day after he posted on Truth Social urging his supporters to turn out for him in that state after the Boston Globe reported that a top Trump volunteer wrote in an email to other volunteers in the state that “the campaign has determined that New Hampshire is no longer a battleground state,” and to instead focus on Pennsylvania.  Trump said he’s having meetings in preparation for next week’s debate with Harris but said “there’s not a lot you can do.”   “I’ve been preparing all my life for this debate,” Trump said.  New CNN polls conducted by SSRS in six battleground states show a mixed outlook on the upcoming presidential election, with voters chiming in on how they view each candidate’s policies and how they would handle important issues. Across nearly all of these states, likely voters are more apt to describe former President Donald Trump than Vice President Kamala Harris as having clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (voters split about evenly on this question in Wisconsin and Michigan), but voters in these swing states largely describe Harris’ views and policies as mainstream and Trump’s as too extreme. About half in each state (between 46% and 51%) say Trump’s views and policies are so extreme that they pose a threat to the country, while around 4 in 10 (between 37% and 42%) say the same about Harris’ positions. Focus on the economy and democracy: An average of 39% of likely voters across states choose the economy as their top issue, with protecting democracy next at an average of 25%. But Harris now trails Trump on trust to handle the economy by relatively smaller margins than President Joe Biden did; across the current polls, Trump is more trusted than Harris on the economy by 8 points on average. (In New York Times/Siena College polls of the same six states this spring, the same calculation yielded a 20-point Trump advantage over Biden.) Trump maintains a broad advantage as more trusted to handle immigration, while Harris has built on Biden’s lead as more trusted to handle abortion and reproductive rights, with women across these six states preferring her by an average of 27 percentage points on the issue. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will deliver the keynote address at the Human Rights Campaign’s National Dinner in Washington, DC on Saturday Former President Donald Trump will continue to fight to move his New York hush money case into federal court — and delay his sentencing on that conviction — now appealing to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a notice of appeal filed Tuesday night.  A federal judge in Manhattan denied his initial request to move the case to the Southern District of New York on Tuesday. Trump’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal of that decision later that night.   Trump’s legal team filed the petition last week to move the state case to federal court in the wake of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. They also asked the federal judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18. Judge Juan Merchan still has not ruled on Trump’s separate request to delay the sentencing until after the election. The judge could issue a decision as soon as this week. When former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris walk onstage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday, it will be their first in-person encounter — a moment each has been mulling as they prepare with advisers for the high-stakes moment. For Harris, a stand-in for the former president — wearing his signature red tie — has helped her visualize the scene ahead of time. Trump, meanwhile, has eschewed a sparring partner in the role of Harris, choosing instead to replicate the informal “policy time” that formed his preparation ahead of June’s debate with President Joe Biden. That debate ended in disaster for the incumbent president, who ended his reelection bid three weeks later and thrust the presidential race into uncharted waters. Sources close to Trump insist not much had changed in terms of how he will prepare for upcoming debate, despite a switch at the top of the Democratic ticket. One difference: the enlisting of one of the vice president’s ex-rivals, Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 in a crowded field that also included Harris. The addition of Gabbard is particularly notable given the tense exchanges she had with the vice president during their 2020 race that left Harris rattled. Whether Trump’s approach with a new, younger candidate will prove as effective remains an open question. Harris’ team, for its part, views her as an underdog given Trump’s lengthy experience in general election debates — this will be his seventh in total, more than any candidate in history. Find out more about Harris’ and Trump’s preparations ahead of the Tuesday face-off. The destiny of the White House may hang on a deadlocked fight between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for Georgia and Pennsylvania, two battlegrounds that have been decisive in crowning the last two presidents. The evolving electoral map is revealed in new CNN/SSRS polls out Wednesday of six swing states that captured the transformation in the race since the vice president replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. The surveys show Harris has vastly improved her party’s chances in November and could open several paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. But they suggest any stalling of her momentum could be disastrous to her hopes. Trump, despite weeks of failing to find a coherent anti-Harris message, still has a serious chance nine weeks out of pulling off one of the most stunning political comebacks in US history. Strong showings in a few key states could land him back in the Oval Office. More broadly, the new polls show that Harris has at least made a strong start on her extraordinary task of turning around an election that looked lost within the space of a few months. But they also reflect Trump’s stunning and enduring strength among millions of Americans in his third presidential election — eight years after he won his first. Continue reading Collinson’s analysis. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Pittsburgh on Thursday to prepare for next week’s presidential debate, according to two sources familiar with the planning.  Harris will remain in the city until the debate takes place on September 10, sources say. It’s the second time the vice president will visit the city this week after campaigning with President Joe Biden on Labor Day. CNN previously reported that Harris would pare back her travel leading up to the debate to dedicate time to preparation.   She plans to make community stops over the week while she’s in Pittsburgh and stay on the campaign trail in a critical battleground state, while also preparing for the presidential debate, according to one of the sources.   The September 10 debate, which has been the subject of much back and forth, will provide Harris another opportunity to speak to a large audience and draw a stark contrast with former President Donald Trump. ABC, the host network, previously announced it will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The Harris and Trump campaigns remain in ongoing discussions about the debate rules, according to sources. The Harris campaign has been pushing for microphones to remain on for the duration of the debate, while the Trump campaign wants the microphones turned off while the other candidate is speaking like the CNN debate in June.  Biden went to Camp David to prepare for his June debate. Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens urged the Harris campaign to “not take anything for granted” in her home state of Michigan, even as new CNN polling shows the Democratic presidential nominee leading former President Donald Trump there.  Calling Vice President Kamala Harris “the underdog,” Stevens said, “we’re not leaving anyone behind.” Stevens — who represents Oakland County — said that her Michigan district previously backed Republicans two decades ago, but that the area has since “turned” — a positive sign for the Harris campaign. She pointed to the district’s “trajectory of strong, Democratic female leadership” along with “incredibly exercised volunteers.” Asked about the vice president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, Stevens called it an “incredibly painful issue” and noted that she spoke with Harris about the recent killing of six Israeli hostages during her visit to Michigan on Labor Day. The congresswoman emphasized that the Biden-Harris administration is focused on reaching a ceasefire deal and remembering the hostages. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday appeared supportive of former President Donald Trump’s proposal for the federal government or insurance companies to cover the cost of in vitro fertilization. Abbott also spoke about Texas resident Amanda Zurawski, who nearly died when she was denied an abortion and went into septic shock. Zurawski has now been campaigning on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign against restrictive abortion measures. Abbott said her medical case was a “a complete false application of the Texas law.” Vice President Kamala Harris is set to propose a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new businesses, as part of a second wave of economic proposals set to be unveiled today. In an economic speech in New Hampshire today, Harris plans to call for expanding a tax deduction for costs associated with starting a business and removing regulatory hurdles — like filing requirements and operational licenses — for businesses of a certain size, according to a Harris campaign official. It’s an attempt by the Harris campaign to appeal to a critical middle-class constituency that could help boost her chances in November. Harris also alluded to the forthcoming tax credit during a stop in Savannah, Georgia, last week. Small businesses are currently granted a $5,000 deduction for expenses related to their first year of operation, according to the Congressional Research Service. Harris will propose raising that to $50,000, the official said, citing the average business’ outlays of $40,000 to get off the ground. And, advisers say Harris is expected to borrow another page from a playbook that’s traditionally been used by conservatives: Branding herself as fiscally disciplined. Read more about Harris’ plan. While former President Donald Trump faces a fresh indictment over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, some of his biggest allies are hoping the revised charging document helps them evade professional consequences and criminal prosecution for their roles nearly four years ago. Special counsel Jack Smith rewrote Trump’s federal indictment after the US Supreme Court ruled this summer that the president can’t be prosecuted for “official acts” taken while president. Smith not only narrowed the allegations against Trump but also removed references to communications between Trump and federal government officials. Now former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark are trying to use their onetime boss’ winnowed indictment to their advantage. Trump is the only one charged in the federal case, but several of his allies and members of his administration are facing state-level criminal charges over their meddling after the last election, including Clark and Meadows. Clark and others also are facing professional disciplinary proceedings that could disrupt their ability to practice law. Meadows, in particular, could stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment handed up in federal court last week. Meadows was cut from much of the document, except for some interactions he had with Trump as the then-president sought to reach the secretary of state in Georgia on the phone to pressure him into aiding his election reversal gambit. Keep reading. The 2024 presidential race has entered a crucial stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend. As the calendar gets into September, both campaigns are focusing on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the upper Midwestern states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020. Here are headlines you should know: Upcoming events: Upcoming debate: Advertising: More headlines: A gala at former President Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf club for those who were incarcerated for their participation in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol has been postponed indefinitely, according to the event’s website. The “J6 Awards Gala,” hosted by First Class Label Group and Vote Your Vision, was initially scheduled for Thursday at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey. The event date is now “postponed” and the location and time are “to be announced,” the event’s website says. Trump was invited to the event but has not confirmed whether he plans to attend.  Some background: Trump said if he becomes president, he would pardon January 6 rioters who were convicted in an interview in July at the National Association of Black Journalists conference. “Oh absolutely, I would. If they’re innocent, I would pardon them,” Trump said. “They were convicted by a very tough system.” Trump has regularly referred to those jailed for their role in the riot on the Capitol on January 6 as “hostages.” The battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania may be pivotal in the race for the White House, but winning those blue wall states alone does not guarantee a campaign victory without something else: Omaha’s blue dot. Yard signs with blue circles have begun appearing on lawns across town here, a hopeful symbol for Democrats in a sea of Nebraska red, with one of the state’s lone electoral votes likely critical for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in the closing two months of the campaign. Nebraska and Maine are the only states that award electoral votes by congressional district rather than statewide winner. Republicans have long sought to change the law here, but for Democrats, it’s a point of pride. Barack Obama in 2008 and Joe Biden in 2020 are the party’s only two candidates to reap a single electoral vote reward. The Harris campaign and its Democratic allies are investing millions to follow suit. For all of the pathways for Harris and Trump to reach the White House, the race for 270 electoral votes could come down to Nebraska’s sprawling 2nd District covering Omaha and parts of two nearby counties, which hold many similarities to suburban areas across the country. Here’s why: If Harris carries the three “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin and Trump wins the sunbelt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the race could become a 269-269 tie, decided by the House of Representatives. A single electoral college vote in Nebraska could change that, providing no other states deliver surprising results. Read the full story. Both Georgia and Pennsylvania remain thoroughly up for grabs, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in each state, with tight margins overall and double-digit shares of likely voters — 12% in Georgia and 16% in Pennsylvania — saying they haven’t yet decided on a candidate, or that they might change their minds. Black voters are a key bloc in both states, particularly in Georgia, and according to these polls, Harris stands at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. In both states, though, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote in this year’s election than White voters do. In Georgia, 61% of Black registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote compared with 70% among White voters, and in Pennsylvania, just 56% of Black voters say they are deeply motivated to vote compared with 72% of White voters. Both states see significant gender gaps in presidential preference, with Harris ahead by double-digits among female likely voters in both states while Trump has similarly large leads among male likely voters. Harris widens her margin slightly in both states among suburban women, topping Trump by 16 points with that group in Georgia and 18 points in Pennsylvania. Harris carries a majority of likely voters younger than 35 in both states, leading 59% to 36% in Pennsylvania, and 54% to 41% in Georgia. White likely voters without college degrees in both states break broadly for Trump, particularly in Georgia, where roughly 7 in 10 support him. White likely voters who do have four-year college degrees, though, split in opposite directions across the two states. In Pennsylvania, they broadly favor Harris, 59% to 37%, while in Georgia, they are solidly in Trump’s camp, 65% to 32%. That dynamic is similar to the divide seen in 2020 exit polling. Read more here. The 2024 presidential campaign’s home stretch kicks off with a mixed outlook across six key battlegrounds, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in each state.  Vice President Kamala Harris holds an advantage over former President Donald Trump among likely voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, while Trump has the edge in Arizona. The two split likely voters almost evenly in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest electoral vote prize that’s widely seen as up for grabs. Across each of them, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not yet firmly decided their choice, suggesting a sizable share of voters could shift their views on the race as attention to the campaign rises and campaign activity, especially in these states, hits a fever pitch in the final nine weeks before Election Day. Likely voters in Wisconsin break 50% for Harris to 44% for Trump, and in Michigan, it’s 48% Harris to 43% Trump. In Arizona, Trump lands at 49% to Harris’ 44%. In Georgia and Nevada, 48% back Harris to 47% for Trump, and in Pennsylvania, the candidates are tied at 47%. The polls, conducted after the Democratic National Convention in August, reflect results among likely voters determined through a combination of past vote behavior and current intention to vote.

This week could shift the focus of a key narrative for Harris and Trump | CNN Business,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",2024-09-04T09:00:19.656Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/economy/economy-jobs-report-harris-trump-nightcap/index.html,"You know the feeling you have the second you step off a Tilt-A-Whirl? That moment when your foot finally hits terra firma after your body’s been through a spin cycle? That’s kind of where the US economy lives right now — a little dizzy from the ride, vision blurry, feet stepping cautiously forward and trying not to take a tumble. Meanwhile, everyone at the fair is watching to see what happens next. Here’s the deal: The next two weeks will bring unusually close attention to the US monthly jobs report (due Friday morning) and the Federal Reserve policy decision (streaming live from Washington, DC, on September 18). Those two events are the kind of thing that, in normal times, are tracked mostly by economists and Wall Street types. Of course, we’re not in a normal time — we’re in election time. That means even the stodgiest of reports could force the presidential candidates to recalibrate their message on the issue voters have repeatedly told pollsters is their top concern. For former President Donald Trump and the Republicans, the narrative is simple: Anything bad you’re feeling about inflation or the job market? That’s the Biden administration’s fault. For Vice President Kamala Harris, who moved to the top of the Democratic ticket in late July, the message about the economy has had to be more nuanced, recognizing consumers’ legitimate frustrations about high prices and inflation, while touting Democrats’ success in keeping the labor market afloat and avoiding a recession. Harris entered the race trailing Trump on a range of issues, including the economy. But in just over a month, her campaign has caught up and eroded much of his lead on the economy specifically. Also potentially benefiting Harris is some solid economic news over the past few months. Price increases are moderating, with July’s Consumer Price Index falling below 3% for the first time in three years. A separate inflation gauge, the Fed-preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed a 2.5% increase year over year. Americans have also continued to spend, powering the broader economy to grow at an annualized rate of 3% in the second quarter. (That’s not to say Americans are happy about paying 20% more for goods and services this year than they did in 2020, but they’re not so mad that they’ve stopped shopping completely.) If that were the whole story, Trump might have a harder time disparaging Harris’ and President Joe Biden’s economic record. But lower inflation has come at a cost: The labor market, while still historically strong, is finally feeling the sting of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes, which make it harder for businesses to expand. In July, unemployment ticked up unexpectedly, to 4.3% from 4.1%, putting markets on edge about a potential economic slowdown. And while layoffs remain historically low, they surged in the summer months, contributing to those anxieties. Bears (and plenty of Republicans) saw those cracks forming and concluded the recession we’d avoided for three years was around the corner. The dizzy economy was headed for a full-on face plant, a sign of reckless management by the Biden-Harris camp. That’s a convenient political message. But it’s not an entirely fair one. The economy is cooling, yes. That’s by design. “Slowing job growth itself doesn’t mean trouble,” said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the WE Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. “We are close to full employment, so job growth basically has to slow.” The July jobs report, which showed a relatively paltry 114,000 positions added to the economy, was hardly a disaster. But it was a surprise slowdown. And in an election season, that makes it ripe for cherry-picking. “The overreaction to monthly numbers is the most predictable thing in the world,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. “It feels extra important because there’s an election coming … that seems to add fuel to the overreaction fire.” Monthly jobs numbers are volatile, so it’s important to zoom out and look at the longer trend, Shierholz says. For most of the Biden administration — and nearly half of Trump’s administration — unemployment was under 4%, hovering around half-century lows. This Friday, economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to announce that the US added 160,000 new jobs last month and that unemployment ticked down slightly to 4.2%. That level of job growth — roughly in line with pre-pandemic averages — would all but guarantee a quarter-point rate cut by the Fed when it concludes its September policy meeting. But a worse-than-expected jobs report Friday could land us back to where we were a month ago, when financial markets fell for three straight days, partly on fears that the economy was headed south and the Fed was too slow to start cutting rates. Markets eventually hit record highs to close out the month. And then tumbled again Tuesday on some weak manufacturing data. The Fed, like a Tilt-A-Whirl operator, can control only the speed of the ride, not how pleasant it is for any one passenger (just to torture the metaphor). The central bank has raised interest rates to slow things down. If its timing works out, interest rate cuts beginning this month should keep the labor market humming in its current state — effectively propping up the nauseated economy and giving it something steady to train its gaze on. If the data doesn’t behave, however, then jobs — not inflation — may become the key economic narrative that Harris and Trump will start talking about in their stump speeches."
"September 3, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-09-03T12:03:20.118Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-03-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan held a town hall with Wisconsin Democrats on Tuesday evening, criticizing Project 2025 and encouraging them to inform voters in the battleground state about the policy agenda linked to former President Donald Trump. Standing alongside Dr. Kristin Lyerly, the Democratic candidate running to represent Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District, Pocan gave a detailed presentation on the policy blueprint organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who previously served in Trump’s administration. The Wisconsin Democrat said he’s gotten pro-Trump pieces of campaign mail at his home in Madison trying to distance the former president from Project 2025, adding that “you don’t do that, right, unless you have that connection.” Trump has repeatedly denied any affiliation with Project 2025, saying he doesn’t know who is behind it, as Democrats have leaned in heavily to warning voters about the conservative agenda, which would radically reshape the executive branch. A CNN analysis found that at least 140 people, including six cabinet secretaries, who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025. Asked about Trump’s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025, Pocan told reporters: “In places like Wisconsin, we call that a lie.” Second gentleman Doug Emhoff grieved with the Jewish community of Washington, DC, following the deaths of six hostages held captive in Gaza, promising to use his voice to fight antisemitism and reach a ceasefire deal. “This is hard. This is raw. I’m gutted, and I know you all are too,” a visibly emotional Emhoff said at the Adas Israel Congregation Tuesday night as they held a vigil for the six hostages killed and those still in captivity. Emhoff spoke to a full synagogue, with most wiping tears from their eyes after listening to those who have lost family members or still have family held in Gaza.  Emhoff described a call he and Harris had with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American hostage who was killed. Emhoff reiterated the administration’s support for a hostage deal, saying the president and vice president were “working around the clock” to secure a deal. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Wednesday to deliver remarks at a campaign. As CNN previously reported, Harris is set to propose a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new companies, as part of a second wave of economic proposals. Donald Trump’s campaign sought to argue in a new memo Tuesday that it “has the momentum” in the presidential race, and attacked the media for what it argued was biased coverage of the former president and his campaign.  Wiles and LaCivita attacked Vice President Kamala Harris and called her “the same Radical Left lunatic she has always been.” They falsely portrayed her positions on several issues, including fracking, health insurance and electric vehicles.  Wiles and LaCivita also touted support from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after Trump and Kemp appeared to have repaired their relationship. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Tuesday that military recruitment would continue to suffer if Vice President Kamala Harris were elected in November, and offered advice to those considering joining the military if she ultimately becomes president: “You’re probably not going to want to sign up.” Claiming Harris wants to “blunder” the US into “World War III,” Vance said, “Of course, it’s not her family that’s going to be fighting that war. It’s going to be working and middle-class kids across the state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.”   “If you’re a person thinking about joining the military, you’re probably not going to want to sign up if Kamala Harris is the potential commander-in-chief,” Vance said.   Vance, who served four years in the Marines and served a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent, said the best solution to fixing military recruitment problems is to elect former president Donald Trump.  “People trust his leadership, they also know that a military, led by Donald Trump is about what unites us as Americans and it’s not about this ridiculous division of Kamala Harris,” Vance said. The comments were in response to a question from Fox anchor Laura Ingraham about “woke leadership” potentially prompting the need for a military draft due to low military recruitment.  A top volunteer for Donald Trump’s political operation in New England was barred from the campaign after he told supporters in an email that the former president was effectively pulling out of New Hampshire to focus on other battlegrounds.   Tom Mountain, a former vice chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, wrote in an email Sunday that the Trump campaign “has determined that New Hampshire is no longer a battleground state.” The email, obtained by CNN and first reported by the Boston Globe, quickly circulated around New Hampshire politics. In it, Mountain advised Trump supporters to shift their energy to Pennsylvania, where the former president is mounting a more aggressive campaign. Trump’s campaign said Mountain overstated his involvement, contending he had volunteered during the primary but hasn’t worked for them since and didn’t have knowledge of the New Hampshire operation. Mountain is no longer allowed to volunteer for the campaign following Sunday’s email.  “What he said is not true,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN. “We have a strong ground presence in New Hampshire, including a headquarters, several paid staffers and hundreds of volunteers who love Donald Trump, have been with him since 2016 and are actively working to turn out voters on Nov. 5.” Attempts to reach Mountain were unsuccessful. A former federal judge along with a government watchdog group and two top scholars on judicial ethics want the appeals court to reassign the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump to a new judge. The group is seeking to file an amicus brief with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, criticizing the way Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed the classified documents prosecution earlier this summer, has handled the criminal case.  They also took issue with Cannon allowing Trump to slow down the federal investigation in 2022 by appointing a special master to review evidence and blocking investigators’ access to documents seized at Mar-a-Lago. The 11th Circuit reversed Cannon’s decisions on this matter. Ret. Judge Nancy Gertner, who was a federal trial judge in Massachusetts, along with legal ethics scholars Stephen Gillers and James J. Sample, and the government watchdog group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, are seeking to file the brief with the Atlanta-based appeals court that is considering whether Cannon’s dismissal ruling should be reversed. They pointed to how Cannon’s slowness to resolve issues in the criminal case that has been mired in delay, as well as her controversial request for lawyers on both sides to file briefs on a hypothetical jury instruction that would seem to virtually guarantee Trump’s acquittal. Former President Donald Trump said again on Tuesday there was “no conflict” during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week. The campaign has been grappling with the fallout of an incident that took place at the cemetery that led to the US Army issuing a stark rebuke to his campaign. NPR first reported that there had been a “verbal and physical altercation” during the cemetery visit, and a source with knowledge of the incident told the outlet that a cemetery official attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. In response, Trump campaign staff “verbally abused and pushed the official aside,” according to NPR.  Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung previously disputed claims of a physical altercation, but said an unnamed individual decided to “physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony.” Cheung suggested Trump’s team had a video to back up the claim but they have not released any such video. Trump told Hannity that he was asked by the family members of those killed during the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing if Trump could take pictures with them during his visit to the cemetery. “I would take pictures with the families at the different grave sites, a couple of them asked me to take it just by myself, would I take a picture. They were as happy as you can be, I mean it was a very sad day but it was a day of honor,” Trump said. The 2024 presidential race has entered a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend. As the calendar turns to September, both campaigns are focusing on on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the upper Midwestern states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020. Here are headlines you should know: Advertising: Upcoming debate: Upcoming events: More headlines to know: A Michigan judge ruled on Tuesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must remain on the ballot in the battleground state after he filed a lawsuit asking the court to remove him, inhibiting his plan to withdraw from key states to ease former President Donald Trump’s path to victory after endorsing him last month.  Michigan Court of Claims Judge Christopher Yates dismissed Kennedy’s request to be removed after he qualified for the ballot through a minor party earlier this year. Kennedy had initially requested the Michigan Secretary of State’s office remove him from the ballot, but that request was denied.  The ruling undermines Kennedy’s strategy to withdraw his name from ballots in competitive states to boost Trump’s chances of winning in those states. Kennedy is also continuing to push for ballot access in states where his name won’t likely have an impact on the outcome of November’s election.  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a social media post that candidates who accept the nomination of a minor party in Michigan “shall not be permitted to withdraw.” Her statement came in response to a post from Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, who labeled the decision to keep Kennedy on the ballot in Michigan “election interference.” Obstacles in other states: Wisconsin’s elections office ruled last week Kennedy would appear on the ballot despite Kennedy’s request to withdraw. Kennedy also filed a lawsuit last week against North Carolina’s elections board challenging their decision to keep him on the ballot. A federal judge denied Donald Trump’s request to move the New York hush money case into federal court, finding there is nothing in the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling that alters his view of the facts that the payments were “private, unofficial acts.” Donald Trump previously filed a petition Thursday seeking to move his New York state criminal case to a federal court in Manhattan and push off the upcoming sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The petition asked the federal court to confirm the former president cannot be sentenced while the litigation over the removal to federal court is pending. Judge Alvin Hellerstein said no facts have changed since he previously rejected Trump’s attempt to move the case last year. At the time the judge found that Trump’s reimbursement to Michael Cohen, who facilitated hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, were not official acts he took as president. Trump also claimed the case should be moved into federal court because he alleged Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, was biased against him. Hellerstein said it was not his place to evaluate the New York trial. The former president has separately asked Merchan to delay the sentencing until after the election. Prosecutors haven’t opposed that request and the judge could issue a decision as soon as this week. Trump also argued in a motion to Merchan that his conviction should be overturned in light of the Supreme Court immunity decision. The judge said he would rule on that motion on September 16. This post has been updated with additional information. Former President Donald Trump is pleading not guilty to the charges laid out in special counsel Jack Smith’s retooled election subversion indictment against him in federal court.   The pleading came in a court filing Tuesday, which also indicates he wants to be excused from appearing in person at an upcoming court hearing in the case on Thursday. Thursday is the first court hearing before DC District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan since the case was paused for the Supreme Court to determine the extent of presidential immunity to which Trump is entitled. Trump’s attorneys plan to attend the hearing. Chutkan will have to decide how to proceed with the criminal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including setting a schedule. She also must decide if prosecutors can take Trump to trial and be able to call certain witnesses, such as his then-Vice President Mike Pence.  The new indictment, approved by a grand jury last week, requires Trump to enter a new pleading. While prosecutors cut back on the some of the allegations against the former president in light of the Supreme Court ruling, Trump faces the same four criminal charges as before. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to propose a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new businesses, as part of a second wave of economic proposals set to be unveiled Wednesday. In an economic speech in New Hampshire tomorrow, Harris plans to call for expanding a tax deduction for costs associated with starting a business and removing regulatory hurdles — like filing requirements and operational licenses — for businesses of a certain size, according to a Harris campaign official. It’s an attempt by the Harris campaign to appeal to a critical middle-class constituency that could help boost her chances in November. Harris also alluded to the forthcoming tax credit during a stop in Savannah, Georgia, last week. Small businesses are currently granted a $5,000 deduction for expenses related to their first year of operation, according to the Congressional Research Service. Harris will propose raising that to $50,000, the official said, citing the average business’ outlays of $40,000 to get off the ground. And, advisers say Harris is expected to borrow another page from a playbook that’s traditionally been used by conservatives: Branding herself as fiscally disciplined. Read more about Harris’ plan Former President Donald Trump released a new video Tuesday, seeking to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to President Joe Biden’s record in the White House.  The video highlights a clip from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying, “Are you aware that this is the Biden-Harris administration and she is indeed the vice president?”   The video shows news clips showing conservative commentators and Republican officials on TV seeking to blame Harris for inflation and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021. It shows news coverage of the six hostages whose bodies were recently recovered by the Israeli military and written on screen is: “Kamala Harris owns foreign affairs failures.”   “Kamala Harris’ weakness and her dangerously liberal agenda have created these crises and will simply further damage our nation in the future,” Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a news release. Elon Musk’s disdain for the Democratic Party was never subtle, but in recent weeks his commentary on the upcoming US presidential election and his attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris have intensified, aided by a crude use of burgeoning artificial intelligence technology. On Monday, Musk posted an AI-generated image on his social media platform that depicted Harris as a communist, wearing a red uniform complete with a hammer and sickle emblazoned hat.  Musk, who has endorsed former President Donald Trump for president and poured millions into a super PAC supporting the Republican, captioned the image with the false assertion, “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?”  The image, which appeared to violate X’s policy on manipulated content, resembled an AI-generated image posted by Trump last month during the Democratic National Convention, envisioning Harris addressing a crowd under communist symbols. Musk’s post came a day after he shared another post with a screenshot suggesting that only “high status males” should be able to participate in government because women (and men with “low testosterone”) are not capable of critical thought. Musk posted it to his 196 million followers with the comment, “interesting observation.” The sexist screed appears to have originated on 4Chan, the notorious hate-filled website that has been linked to mass shootings. By choosing to amplify disinformation and misogynist views, Musk, a South African billionaire who is both the owner of X and the most-followed account on the platform, is promoting radical content to the masses that might otherwise languish in the darkest corners of the internet. By Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after Musk shared the fake image and false statement depicting Harris as a communist, the post had been viewed nearly 60 million times, according to data from X. Musk’s post suggesting women shouldn’t take part in democracy had been viewed more than 19 million times. X did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Read Donie O’Sullivan’s full analysis Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Pittsburgh on Thursday to prepare for next week’s presidential debate, according to two sources familiar with the planning.  Harris will remain in the city until the debate takes place on September 10, sources say. It’s the second time the vice president will visit the city this week after campaigning with President Joe Biden on Labor Day. CNN previously reported that Harris would pare back her travel leading up to the debate to dedicate time to preparation.   She plans to make community stops over the week while she’s in Pittsburgh and stay on the campaign trail in a critical battleground state, while also preparing for the presidential debate, according to one of the sources.   The September 10 debate, which has been the subject of much back and forth, will provide Harris another opportunity to speak to a large audience and draw a stark contrast with former President Donald Trump. ABC, the host network, previously announced it will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The Harris and Trump campaigns remain in ongoing discussions about the debate rules, according to sources. The Harris campaign has been pushing for microphones to remain on for the duration of the debate, while the Trump campaign wants the microphones turned off while the other candidate is speaking like the June CNN-hosted debate.  Biden went to Camp David to prepare for his June debate. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised medical marijuana ahead of some states voting on the issue this fall. Trump’s comments come after he posted on Truth Social over the weekend that he thought adults in Florida shouldn’t be arrested for carrying “personal amounts” of marijuana and that he thought the Florida ballot initiative on recreational marijuana use would pass.  When asked on the Lex Fridman Podcast to expand on his post, Trump praised medical marijuana and said his statement was about how he thinks “we can live with the marijuana,” and that the ballot initiative in Florida would be “very good.”  “Medical marijuana has been amazing. I’ve had friends, and I’ve had others and doctors telling me that it’s been absolutely amazing, the medical marijuana,” Trump said.  Trump also said his campaign will put out a statement on marijuana policy later this week. CNN has asked the campaign for more specifics on the potential announcement. Can I vote early? What deadlines should I know about? Do I need to show an ID? People will begin casting votes for the 2024 presidential election this month.

The Harris-Walz campaign kicked off a bus tour focusing on reproductive health care with an event in Boynton Beach, Florida, on Tuesday — near former President Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago home in Palm Beach. It’s the latest effort by Democrats to center access to reproductive health care as a key issue for voters in the final weeks of the election. The first stop on the bus tour, which the campaign said would feature “at least 50 stops” across the country heading into Election Day, featured remarks from Florida campaign surrogates, including Florida Democratic Senate candidate Debbie Murcasel Powell and television personality Ana Navarro. The event was headlined by remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Speakers throughout the event rallied support for Amendment Four, the Florida ballot initiative that would prohibit restrictions to abortion access prior to viability. Last week, Trump said he would vote against the measure. Several speakers also criticized Trump for his role in shaping the Supreme Court that overturned abortion protections in Roe v. Wade and chastised Trump for his recent proposal to mandate either government or private insurance to pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. “You don’t get to create a problem and then pretend you have the solution,” Navarro said. “The only IVF Donald Trump understands is ‘I violate your freedoms.’” A federal judge has ruled former President Donald Trump and his campaign must pause on using the song “Hold On, I’m Coming.” The decision came after the estate of the late R&B artist and songwriter Isaac Hayes sought an emergency injunction to stop the Trump campaign from using the song at campaign events, alleging the campaign does not have approval. Judge Thomas Thrash Jr. made the ruling in Atlanta on Tuesday. He denied a motion by the Hayes estate to force the Trump campaign to take down any previously recorded uses of the song. Ronald Coleman, an attorney for Trump, told members of the media after the hearing that “the campaign has no interest in annoying or hurting anyone. And if the Hayes family feels it hurts or annoys them, that’s fine, we’re not going to force the issue.” Hayes died in 2008 at age 65 after suffering a stroke. The 1966 song, co-written by Hayes and David Porter, was performed by Sam Moore and Dave Prater, who were professionally known as the duo Sam & Dave. Prater died in 1988. CNN has reached out to a representative for Moore for comment. According to court documents obtained by CNN, attorneys for the estate claimed that the campaign has not “obtained a valid public performance license” and have requested “compensatory damages for the unauthorized use” of Hayes’ music. The estate is the first to end up in court over complaints of Trump and his campaign allegedly using music they had not properly licensed, but other artists have complained. CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report. This post has been updated to include the temporary injunction being issued. Political ads have been seen in Philadelphia falsely claiming the Eagles have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency. The Eagles posted on X that the team is “aware of the counterfeit ads being circulated” and working to have them removed. According to CNN affiliate WPVI, the ads state that Harris is the “official candidate of the Philadelphia Eagles.” They are prominently displayed in bus shelters throughout the city.  The ad directs people to a page on the Eagles’ website that informs Pennsylvania and New Jersey voters of important election dates. Nowhere on the page is there an endorsement of a candidate.  Intersection, the media company responsible for the advertising in the bus shelters, said the bus shelters were “vandalized” and that paid advertising copy at the bus stops were replaced with “unauthorized copy.” In a statement, the city of Philadelphia noted the fake posters were not caused by a digital breach. “Whomever is responsible for the illegally placed posters, broke into the securely covered shelter ad space and somehow placed the posters in the space,” it said. Intersection was conducting an inventory of all the bus shelters and removing any illegal posters, the city added. Philadelphia, the largest city in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, promises to play a pivotal role in the upcoming presidential election. CNN has reported on fake celebrity endorsements becoming a weapon in the misinformation wars surrounding the election. The post has been updated with the statement from the city of Philadelphia. Vice President Kamala Harris is planning to deliver a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday to unveil the next tranche of her economic plan, according to three advisers.  High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give President Joe Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their wrath. Harris spoke last month about some of her economic proposals, including enhanced tax credits for kids, housing assistance and efforts to stop price gouging. She described her forward-looking agenda as “an opportunity economy,” where Americans are given a real chance to succeed. What’s in Harris’ tax and economic plan: What’s in Trump’s tax and economic plan: Read more about Harris’ and Trump’s economic proposals. When former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at Arlington National Cemetery last week, 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain says he viewed it as a “violation.” The youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain had already been moving away from the Republican Party — just weeks ago, he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, he told CNN in an exclusive interview this week. But he is speaking out now for the first time about Trump because of the former president’s conduct at the hallowed ground where several generations of McCain’s family, including his grandfather and great grandfather, are buried. “It just blows me away,” McCain, who has served in the military for 17 years, told CNN. “These men and women that are laying in the ground there have no choice” of whether to be a backdrop for a political campaign, he said. Keep reading more from McCain’s interview. The post-Labor Day sprint to Election Day includes several highly competitive Senate contests to decide control of the chamber, and with general election matchups formalized, both parties are set to spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few months. In a few key states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Montana – Republicans appear poised for a fierce effort to unseat vulnerable Democratic incumbents, while in others — Nevada and Wisconsin – the GOP appears to have less appetite. In two other open seat races where Democrats are looking to hang on after retirements —Arizona and Michigan — they’re set to have a big advertising edge. Meanwhile, in a pair of under-the-radar contests in Texas and Maryland, Republicans have bought millions in airtime, playing a bit of both defense and offense. Here’s a look at some of the races that are set to see the most spending between now and Election Day. Former President Donald Trump responded to the US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane. “That’s OK, he can now go out and get a much bigger and better one with all the money we pay to Venezuela for oil that we don’t need,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, blaming the current administration for lifting the oil sanctions his administration had imposed on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, also calling current US leaders “stupid.” Some background: As CNN exclusively reported, the US seized Maduro’s plane after determining that its acquisition violated US sanctions and involved other criminal activities. This latest development marks an escalation in the already tense relationship between the countries. The plane’s seizure in the Dominican Republic underscores the ongoing investigation into what the US views as corrupt practices within Maduro’s government. Earlier this year, the US reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to the Maduro government’s failure to allow “an inclusive and competitive election” to take place. The situation in Venezuela has had implications for US politics as millions flee the country, many of whom have chosen to migrate to the US-Mexico border. Manhattan prosecutors are urging the judge overseeing Donald Trump’s hush money case to rule on the former president’s motion to vacate his conviction. Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office said Judge Juan Merchan should decide Trump’s motion on presidential immunity and not wait until a federal judge considers a separate motion filed by Trump last week to move the case into federal court and stop the state court judge from sentencing Trump until that motion is resolved.  Merchan previously said he will rule on Trump’s challenge to his conviction based on the Supreme Court’s immunity decision on September 16. Last week Trump’s attorneys asked Merchan to pause his decision over presidential immunity to allow the process in federal court to play out.  This is Trump’s second effort to move the case into federal court. He renewed his efforts after the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. Trump has also separately asked Merchan to postpone his sentencing, which is currently scheduled for September 18. A decision is expected this week. Read more about the hush money case. Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar discussed why the Harris campaign’s “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour is kicking off Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida, close to former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. Klobuchar told CNN it’s clear now that Trump is in favor of an “extreme abortion ban” in Florida, after he said last week he will not support a ballot referendum to expand abortion access in his home state just 24 hours after suggesting he might. Klobuchar also said she “can’t wait” for the debate between Harris and Trump on September 10. “You’re going to see clearly two different people on the split screen. One guy overturned Roe v. Wade, and then you have Kamala Harris, who protected these rights,” Klobuchar said. More on the bus tour: CNN reported earlier that thebus tour will make at least 50 stops in key battleground states to highlight the contrasts between Harris and Trump’s stance on reproductive freedom. It will feature elected officials, celebrities and Republicans for the Harris-Walz ticket. The second gentleman and first lady of Minnesota Gwen Walz will also participate in the coming weeks.  The 2024 presidential race has entered a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend. As the calendar turns to September, both campaigns are focusing on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the Upper Midwestern states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020. Meanwhile, voting will begin this week. The first ballots of the 2024 election will go out Friday in North Carolina, one of a handful of potentially critical Sun Belt states. Then, two weeks later, early in-person voting starts in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia. Read about other upcoming campaign events here. CNN’s Annette Choi and Zachary B. Wolf contributed reporting  Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee will transfer more than $24 million to support down ballot races, according to an announcement made on Tuesday.  The campaign is touting the investment as a “historic sum” that will help Democrats across the country in a number of races at the state level, campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. CNN has learned that the investment will include: Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison added in a statement that the DNC is “proud to be delivering nearly $25 million in funding to our sister committees for down-ballot races in November, from boosting on-the-ground organizing power to bolstering voter protection efforts.” CNN has previously reported that the campaign said it raised $540 million since the vice president launched her presidential bid after President Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July.  A Republican-linked group has purchased digital ads targeting Michigan voters about Vice President Kamala Harris’ ties to Israel, as she seeks to balance her messaging on the issue and maintain outreach to Arab American voters in the critical battleground state. Michigan has a significant Arab American population. And about 13% of the state’s Democratic primary voters, more than 100,000 individuals, chose to be “uncommitted” instead of voting for President Joe Biden when he was on the primary ballot earlier this year, largely to send a signal of disapproval of the administration’s actions on the war in Gaza. Versions of the 30-second video have started running on Facebook and Instagram in Michigan, according to Meta data. Similar content has also been shared in ads on Snapchat, per data from that platform. Future Coalition PAC purchased the advertisements on all platforms. The recently formed political action committee lists Ray Zaborney, a Republican strategist, as its treasurer, according to FEC documentation. Vice President Kamala Harris is planning to deliver a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday to unveil the next tranche of her economic plan, according to three advisers.  CNN previously reported that Harris would unveil her proposals in a series of rollouts, with the next expected to focus on innovation, entrepreneurship and small business.  Harris told a small-business owner in Georgia last week that one of her top priorities would be instituting a tax credit to assist Americans starting and growing businesses. Here’s a look at Harris’ and Trump’s economic plans so far. As the fall election season gets into high gear, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer predicted that more Americans will be engaged — and she said they will see why Vice President Kamala Harris is a better choice over former President Donald Trump. “All Donald Trump offers is anger and grievance, whereas Kamala Harris has actual plans that will help people keep more money in their pockets,” Whitmer told CNN. Whitmer joined Harris at a Labor Day event in Detroit on Monday, where she blasted the Republican ticket as disconnected from the average American. “Look, if your most famous line is ‘You’re fired,’ you sure as hell don’t understand workers,” Whitmer said yesterday, referencing Trump’s catchphrase on his former reality show “The Apprentice.” Whitmer today further laid out the case for Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, who she said “worked hourly jobs, have scraped to get ahead.” She said Trump “doesn’t get it and cares about winning an election, not necessarily what he’s going to do once he does.” Donald Trump is trying to crush Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ persona as a force of change and to destroy her credibility as a potential president as their still-fresh competition careens into the final nine weeks before Election Day. In recent days, the ex-president has unveiled a broad assault using the insult-driven politics with which he won power in 2016, even as his advisers have been pleading with him to focus his attention on top voter concerns including high prices and immigration. He is seizing on foreign tragedies to accuse the vice president of responsibility for the deaths of US troops in Afghanistan and claiming she’s complicit in killings of hostages in Gaza. He and his running mate, JD Vance, implied her mixed-race heritage is evidence of a sinister “chameleon”-like character that also explains policy reversals on energy and immigration. In an ugly moment, he amplified a sexually themed social media slander against her. And his dark campaign ads allege she will slash Social Security benefits by welcoming millions of undocumented migrants to the country. And in a reprise of past GOP campaigns branding Democratic nominees as extreme liberals, Trump and his supporters are trying to frame Harris as a communist and a “Bolshevik.” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem blasted Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, as a “security risk” because he once taught in China. Read the full analysis. Kamala Harris’ campaign on Friday announced the launch of a new bus tour aimed at advocating for women’s reproductive rights and warning of the stakes in the upcoming election as it remains a key issue ahead of November. The “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour will kick off Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro and reproductive rights storyteller Anya Cook. They are expected to “hold Trump directly accountable for the devastating impacts of overturning Roe v. Wade, including threatening access to IVF.” The bus tour will make at least 50 stops in key battleground states to highlight the contrasts between Harris and former President Donald Trump’s stance on reproductive freedom. It will feature elected officials, celebrities and Republicans for the Harris-Walz ticket. The second gentleman and first lady of Minnesota Gwen Walz will also participate in the coming weeks.  According to the campaign, each stop will make the case that Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, will restore protections of Roe, while warning of Trump and Sen. JD Vance’s “dangerous Project 2025 agenda to ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control, create a national anti-abortion coordinator, force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions, and jeopardize access to IVF.” Under the Biden administration, Harris specifically has become the administration’s foremost voice on reproductive rights, both in public events and behind the scenes. Earlier this year she kicked off the “reproductive freedoms tour” in an effort to focus on an issue the former Biden campaign believed would be critical to mobilizing voters in November. The bus tour, according to the campaign, also aims to serve to grow the campaign’s organizing infrastructure by energizing and mobilizing supporters and volunteers, including through direct voter contact at field offices, canvass launches and phone banks. The campaign will also host influencers to engage online audiences, specifically young voters. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are taking two different paths to prepare for their September 10 debate, the first time the nominees will face off since Democrats upended their ticket this summer. The week leading up to the debate, hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia, represents the candidates’ last chance to set the agenda before they meet. It may also offer a preview of what attacks the two will level against each other. Since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Trump has struggled to land on a message to blunt Harris’ momentum. Trump has tested out personal attacks and nicknames, criticized her lack of press conferences and new interviews, blamed Biden administration policies for inflation and high costs, and hammered Harris and Biden over the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Harris, meanwhile, has focused on moderating many of the positions she laid out during her 2019 Democratic presidential primary campaign. In an interview with CNN, her first since becoming the Democratic nominee, she argued that her values have stayed the same even if her stance on issues such as fracking has not. For much of this week, Harris will take a step back from the trail ahead of the debate after spending yesterday campaigning in the so-called “blue wall” states with labor leaders. Trump, meanwhile, is ramping up his appearances after skipping Labor Day campaigning. He will virtually headline the Republican Jewish Coalition’s Annual Leadership Summit in Las Vegas on Wednesday and deliver a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday before holding a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, on Saturday. Read the full story. Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is launching an ad Tuesday zeroing in on inflation and the economy ahead of her Wednesday speech in New Hampshire that will roll out her next tranche of economic proposals. The ad is titled “Focused” and includes a voiceover narrator over images of the grocery store and the gas pump — while acknowledging that “costs are too high.” The economy and inflation are two issues where the vice president is down to her rival, former President Donald Trump, by several points in recent polling. A poll from ABC News and Ipsos released Sunday shows that more Americans say they trust Trump than Harris to handle the economy (46% Trump to 38% Harris), inflation (44% Trump to 36% Harris), and immigration (45% Trump to 36% Harris). Harris is more trusted on abortion (47% Harris to 31% Trump) and protecting American democracy (45% Harris to 38% Trump).  In the new ad, Harris is seen saying: “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.” The ad will air on TV and digital as part of the campaign’s previous $370 million advertising commitment from Labor Day to Election Day. Donald Trump claimed last week that he was the president who “created” the Veterans Choice health care program and got it “passed in Congress” after others had wanted to do so “for 57 years.” In reality, President Barack Obama was the president who signed the program into law in 2014. The law Trump signed in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, expanded the Veterans Choice program but didn’t create it. I could fact-check this Trump lie half-asleep — because he’s been telling it for more than six years. Trump’s lying is most exceptional in its relentlessness, a never-ending avalanche of wrongness that can bury even the most devoted fact-checkers. But it’s also notable for its repetitiveness. He has found his hits, and he’ll keep playing them no matter how many times they are debunked. As Trump enters the post-Labor Day sprint of his 2024 presidential campaign, his commentary is filled with many of the same false claims he made as president from 2017 to 2021. He’s even repeating some false claims he used during his 2016 presidential campaign. As a fact-check reporter for CNN, I watch or read the transcript of every public appearance by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris’ campaign remarks to date have been heavy on thematic rhetoric and light on assertions of fact, with a smattering of false or misleading claims, Trump’s 2024 interviews and speeches are littered with old falsehoods I’ve come to call “the repeats” — assertions I have fact-checked as false over and over for years. Read the full analysis. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign held a string of Labor Day-themed events in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, marking the unofficial launch of the fall campaign sprint in the states that will determine the November election. While the Democratic presidential nominee has sought to expand the map of states where she is competitive, the Labor Day stops point to the importance of winning those three “blue wall” states that propelled President Joe Biden to victory in 2020. Biden joined Harris for a rally in Pittsburgh, the president’s first joint campaign appearance with the vice president since ending his reelection bid and endorsing her. Harris used the Pennsylvania event to say that US Steel should be owned domestically and that she opposed the company’s purchase by the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel. Harris’ remarks largely echoed an earlier event in Detroit, where she emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining to a crowd of union members and leaders, drawing sharp contrasts with her opponent, former President Donald Trump. Harris was joined by national union leaders, including United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and National Education Association President Becky Pringle. Trump has been critical of labor leaders, including the United Auto Workers’ Fain, but has sought the support of workers in the same Rust Belt states Harris and Gov. Tim Walz campaigned in. The former president has focused his attention on the Biden administration’s efforts to boost the production and purchase of electric vehicles, which Trump has argued will come at the expense of autoworkers. Read the full story. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining in remarks to a crowd of union members and leaders in Detroit on Labor Day. Harris praised the labor movement for worker protections, saying, “You better thank a union member” for the five-day workweek, sick leave, and vacation time. Recalling her upbringing attending marches and meetings in California with her progressive parents, Harris reiterated that she learned “when people stand together,” they can “drive extraordinary change.” Harris also criticized Donald Trump for actions she said were harmful to workers, prompting some members in the room to chant, “Trump’s a scab,” a critique popularized by United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who has sparred publicly with the former president. Harris was joined onstage by national union leaders, including Fain, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and National Education Association President Becky Pringle. As Harris talked about what she would do to fight for Americans’ future, she vowed to ensure the “PRO Act,” legislation safeguarding workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and to “end union busting once and for all.”"
Here’s what Harris is proposing for the economy | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:55 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",2024-09-03T21:28:07.126Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/harris-economic-proposals/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris is adding tax relief for small businesses to her economic policy platform aimed at helping middle-class and working Americans. Harris unveiled Wednesday a proposal to massively increase the existing small business tax deduction for startup costs and cut the red tape that impedes small businesses’ formation and growth. Her goal: 25 million new small business applications by the end of her first term, up from the record 19 million received under the Biden administration as of mid-August. Harris on Wednesday also proposed raising the capital gains tax rate, though by not as much as President Joe Biden has called for. The measures come three weeks after Harris released a four-part package aimed at making housing, groceries, child rearing and prescription drugs more affordable. Many of the proposals build upon efforts the Biden administration has already unveiled. Most, if not all, of Harris’ proposals would require congressional approval, which would be a significant hurdle if Capitol Hill remains as divided as it is currently. Plus, her ideas come with significant price tags, and she has yet to detail how she will cover the costs. Her prior package would add $1.7 trillion to the deficits over the next decade, before interest, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. So far, her campaign has said she would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate set by former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut law – which would raise about $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the committee. Harris has also said she supports the revenue-raising provisions in Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget blueprint, which includes tax hikes on wealthy Americans and big companies. Overall, these measures would raise about $5 trillion. Here’s what we know about Harris’ economic proposals: Harris proposed a 10-fold expansion to a tax deduction for new small businesses. Currently, small businesses are allowed to deduct up to $5,000 of eligible startup expenses in the year they begin to operate, according to the Congressional Research Service. Harris’ plan would expand the tax deduction to up to $50,000 and allow businesses to wait to claim that deduction until the year they first turn a profit to make sure they receive the full benefit, according to the campaign official. “It’s essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,” Harris said during a speech in New Hampshire Wednesday. Harris proposed measures aimed at making it easier for small business owners to operate. Creating a standard deduction for small businesses could make it easier for them to file taxes. Harris also wants to make it easier to do business across state lines and to ensure that one-third of federal contract dollars goes to small businesses. Additionally, Harris called for boosting investment in community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, which are dedicated to serving low-income people and communities that are missed by traditional lenders. While many small businesses struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic, those owned by people of color were hit hardest. The investment in CDFIs could help them provide low- and no-interest loans to small businesses that want to expand. Harris said Wednesday that her small business policies will have a particular focus on those in rural communities. Harris also said Wednesday that she would raise the long-term capital gains tax rate to 28%, up from the current 20%, for those who earn $1 million or more. Biden’s budget called for hiking the rate to 39.6% – the same rate levied on ordinary income – for high earners. The vice president also expressed support for Biden’s proposed Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would levy a 25% minimum income tax on households with more than $100 million in net worth. And, like Biden, she would quadruple the tax on stock buybacks to 4%. In August, Harris unveiled a multipart, four-year plan to address the nation’s affordable housing crisis. It includes providing up to $25,000 in down-payment support and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. To spur construction, Harris would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing and create a $40 billion fund for innovative housing construction. Plus, she would ban algorithm-driven price-setting tools for landlords to set rents and remove tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. Economists have mixed views on the effectiveness of Harris’ proposals. Incentives to build more homes should increase inventory and help drive prices down. But several experts warned that down-payment support could stimulate demand and fuel an increase in prices. Harris’ $25,000 homebuyer credit and additional affordable housing policies would cost $200 billion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which assumed these provisions would be in effect for four years. Harris called in August for a federal ban on price gouging in an effort to lower grocery prices, though her campaign has released few details about the proposal. More than three dozen states have laws that prohibit price gouging during special circumstances, such as emergencies, disasters or market disruptions. However, how much price gouging contributed to the spike in inflation over the last few years remains a matter of debate, prompting some experts to question the effectiveness of a national ban. Also included in the suite of proposals Harris unveiled in August was the restoration of the American Rescue Plan Act’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000. She is calling for the beefed-up credit, which was only in effect in 2021, to be made permanent. The share of children in poverty fell by nearly half that year, thanks mainly to the temporary credit enhancement, according to the Census Bureau. The plan would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. Beefing up the child tax credit would cost $1.1 trillion over a decade, while creating a credit for newborns would add another $100 billion to the price tag, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. Also in August, Harris called for extending the more generous Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhancement, which was made available through the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, has helped push sign-ups for Obamacare coverage to record levels. The vice president also wants to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January. (The three major insulin manufacturers in the US offer price caps or savings programs that lower the cost of insulin to $35 for many patients – a move Biden pushed for in his State of the Union address last year.) Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration last month announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026. Medicare gained this historic power through the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, Harris said she would work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign. Harris has overseen the Biden administration’s efforts to remove medical debt from credit reports. Harris also promised in August to end federal income taxes on tips, sparking Trump’s ire that she is copying his campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan. Her campaign has said she supports an income limit and requirements that would prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from being able to take advantage of the measure. She also plans to push for an increase in the minimum wage. This story has been updated with additional information."
"Elon Musk’s attacks on Kamala Harris become more unhinged, with help from AI | CNN Business","Updated 6:20 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",2024-09-03T19:48:46.384Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/media/elon-musk-x-kamala-harris-trump-misinformation/index.html,"Elon Musk’s disdain for the Democratic Party was never subtle, but in recent weeks his commentary on the upcoming US presidential election and his attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris have intensified, aided by a crude use of burgeoning artificial intelligence technology. On Monday, Musk posted an AI-generated image on his social media platform that depicted Harris as a communist, wearing a red uniform complete with hammer and sickle emblazoned hat. Musk, who has endorsed former President Donald Trump for president and poured millions into a super PAC supporting the Republican, captioned the image with the false assertion, “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?” The image, which appeared to violate X’s policy on manipulated content, resembled an AI-generated image posted by Trump last month during the Democratic National Convention, envisioning Harris addressing a crowd under communist symbols. Musk’s post came a day after he shared another post with a screenshot suggesting that only “high status males” should be able to participate in government because women (and men with “low testosterone”) are not capable of critical thought. Musk posted it to his 196 million followers with the comment, “interesting observation.” The sexist screed appears to have originated on 4Chan, the notorious hate-filled website that has been linked to mass-shootings. By choosing to amplify disinformation and misogynist views, Musk, a South African billionaire who is both the owner of X and the most-followed account on the platform, is promoting radical content to the masses that might otherwise languish in the darkest corners of the internet. By Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after Musk shared the fake image and false statement depicting Harris as a communist, the post had been viewed nearly 60 million times, according to data from X. Musk’s post suggesting women shouldn’t take part in democracy had been viewed more than 19 million times. X did not respond to a CNN request for comment. The posts come after Brazilian authorities blocked access to X in the country in a battle over the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform aimed at undermining the nation’s democracy. Since taking over the platform, Musk has touted X’s “community notes” feature as a way of transparently allowing crowd-sourced fact-checking misinformation on his platform. Yet neither post was fact-checked through the community notes feature. Musk’s defenders, of which there are many who are vocal on X, have attempted to argue that some posts like these are satirical or are not meant to be taken seriously. But Musk is taken seriously. He is one of the world’s most powerful people who controls one of the world’s most important online platforms on the precipice of an historic American presidential election where he is actively campaigning for a candidate. When Musk took over Twitter in 2022 in a $44 billion acquisition, he claimed that the platform would remain impartial to avoid the perception of tilting the scales for a political party. “For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,” he wrote. But Musk’s posts, and the lack of scrutiny they receive from his company’s own fact-checking system, lay bare how Musk has turned X into a pro-Trump machine."
"Harris to unveil new wave of economic policies for small businesses, communities, in economic speech Wednesday | CNN Politics","Updated 5:32 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",2024-09-03T21:00:05.504Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/kamala-harris-new-economic-policy/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to propose a handful of new benefits to entrepreneurs and small business owners to spur the creation of millions of new businesses, as part of a second wave of economic proposals set to be unveiled Wednesday. In an economic speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Harris plans to call for expanding a tax deduction for costs associated with starting a business and removing regulatory hurdles – like filing requirements and operational licenses – for businesses of a certain size, according to a Harris campaign official. It’s an attempt by the Harris campaign to appeal to a critical middle-class constituency that could help boost her chances in November. “This is one of my singular priorities, is to invest and grow our small business,” Harris told a small business owner in Savannah, Georgia, last week, alluding to the forthcoming tax credit she’d propose. Small businesses are currently granted a $5,000 deduction for expenses related to their first year of operation, according to the Congressional Research Service. Harris will propose raising that to $50,000, the official said, citing the average business’ outlays of $40,000 to get off the ground. Harris is also aiming to surpass the 19 million new businesses under the Biden administration with a new goal of 25 million. After releasing a first wave of more populist policies to increase government involvement in retail pricing and the housing market, Harris is crafting a pro-business, low-regulation platform aimed at taking the air out of Republican broadsides. And, advisers say Harris is expected to borrow another page from a playbook that’s traditionally been used by conservatives: Branding herself as fiscally disciplined. Harris is expected to argue on the campaign trail that the revenue gained by rolling back certain provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of former President Donald Trump’s signature achievements in his first term, should be used to fund community-level investments and other programs that affect Americans in a more targeted way. One close adviser told CNN that Harris believes the federal government should “use those expiring tax cuts to get at issues that affect the bottom line for the average American.” Small business growth is at the top of a list that, as CNN has previously reported, also includes investing in underserved communities and assisting working families. Harris also plans to propose a new fund of undisclosed size to allow the country’s smallest banks to cover interest costs on loans to new business. As a senator and as vice president, Harris has worked to provide funding to these banks to invest in startups outside major cities. In particular, Harris promoted legislation that provided capital to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which are dedicated to serving low-income people and communities that are missed by traditional lenders. While many small businesses struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic, those owned by people of color were hit hardest. On Wednesday, Harris will call for more funding for those banks. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, who has worked with Harris to increase access to this capital across the country, said CDFIs are critical because they have been able to step in to lend to new businesses with no financial history. “Some new businesses go to seven different banks to try to get a loan, but they can’t get one because they don’t have a three-year track record,” Adeyemo told CNN in an interview. Interest rates – which have risen for all businesses in recent years – are far higher for smaller companies, too, often making it cost-prohibitive for them to borrow even if they can get a loan. “Ultimately the cost of capital is going to be something that matters a lot,” Adeyemo said. The small business measures come three weeks after Harris released a four-part package aimed at making housing, groceries, child rearing and health care more affordable. Many of the proposals build upon efforts the Biden administration has already unveiled. To make purchasing a home more affordable, Harris would provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She also wants to create a tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers and to expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. Plus, she would ban algorithm-driven price-setting tools for landlords to set rents. Harris is also proposing a federal ban on price gouging in an effort to lower grocery prices, though her campaign has released few details about the measure. In addition, Harris wants to restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and is calling for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021. Harris would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. The vice president also wants to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. Plus, she would extend the more generous Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025 and accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations."
Analysis: Trump’s hardline new quest to destroy Harris’ momentum | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:57 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",2024-09-03T04:00:19.738Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-quest-destroy-harris-momentum/index.html,"Donald Trump is trying to crush Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ persona as a force of change and to destroy her personal credibility as a potential president as their still-fresh competition careens into the final nine weeks before Election Day. In recent days, the ex-president has unveiled a broad assault using the insult-driven politics with which he won power in 2016, even as his advisers have been pleading with him to focus his attention on top voter concerns including high prices and immigration. He is seizing on foreign tragedies to accuse the vice president of responsibility for the deaths of US troops in Afghanistan and claiming she’s complicit in killings of hostages in Gaza. He and his running mate, JD Vance, implied her mixed race — heritage that millions of Americans share — is evidence of a sinister “chameleon”-like character that also explains policy reversals on energy and immigration. In an ugly moment, he amplified a sexually themed social media slander against her. And his dark campaign ads allege she will slash Social Security benefits by welcoming millions of undocumented migrants to the country. And in a reprise of past GOP campaigns branding Democratic nominees as extreme liberals, Trump and his supporters are trying to frame Harris as a communist and a “Bolshevik.” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem blasted Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, as a “security risk” because he once taught in China. And Trump has also started to imply the coming election might not be “free and fair” and said in an interview that aired Sunday that it was ridiculous to indict him for “interfering” in the 2020 election. This and other recent comments raised the specter of another national nightmare if he loses in November and refuses to accept defeat. Trump’s desperation to find traction has also seen him perform his own policy gyrations on reproductive rights as he seeks to narrow a huge gender gap in polling. But his credibility may already be shattered after he built the conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. Vance also seems to have a knack for alienating female voters — like when he compared Harris to a nerve-struck Miss Teen USA contestant. Trump is not simply being true to his ill-disciplined self. He’s illustrating his struggle to respond to Harris’ transformation of the race. Increasingly brazen attempts to puncture Harris’ bubble of hope also betray frustration in the Trump camp that she’s managing to distinguish herself from her boss and is presenting a fresher option than her 78-year-old GOP rival. And Trump is showing that there’s almost nothing he won’t do to win. Trump’s invective amounts to some of the most hardline political rhetoric in years, even by his own standards, and means the next two months are likely to be brutal. The question is whether this barrage of negative attacks is merely successful in stoking feelings of existential anger Trump uses to drive his base the polls, or whether it begins to tarnish Harris at the margins in battleground states. It may make some sense for Trump to throw everything he can think of at Harris. In two presidential elections, the ex-president has never risen above 49% of the vote in the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin or in the national popular count. So his chances in November may depend more on destroying the current feel-good factor around Harris and depressing her prospects among small groups of persuadable voters in swing states than on holding out hope of winning over new voters himself. But Trump’s behavior brings its own risks. His antics last week, including a grinning, thumbs-up gravesite campaign photo-op in Arlington National Cemetery that may have broken the law, could bolster Harris’ warnings that Americans are pining for a chance to leave the bitterness and chaos of the Trump era behind. Even though Harris has restored the contest to a neck-and-neck race, her campaign recognizes the still potent threat from Trump. “Make no mistake: the next 65 days will be very hard,” Harris campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillion wrote in a weekend memo despite arguing the vice president has multiple paths to the White House. “This race will remain incredibly close, and the voters who will decide this election will require an extraordinary amount of work to win over.” Harris campaigned in Detroit and with Biden in Pittsburgh to mark Labor Day on Monday, reflecting the importance of union members. Blue-collar workers traditionally voted Democrat, but Trump’s cultural transformation of the GOP now appeals to many workers, especially in rural areas. And Harris’ appearance with Biden in the Steel City previewed how the lame-duck president could help her campaign in a state and among a voting demographic where he remains popular. The campaign swing comes a week before the critical meeting between Harris and Trump on a debate stage slated for September 10 in Philadelphia — one of the final foreseeable turning points of this campaign, with mail-in voting starting later this week. Trump’s feral political offensive is a warning for Harris about what may lay ahead and underscores how hard it will be to prolong the smooth rollout of her sudden candidacy, her pick of Walz and her successful convention. But the ex-president’s intensity is also a sign — which is reflected in favorable public polling nationally and in swing states — that his early efforts to negatively define her have not worked. Harris is being criticized by Republicans for a lack of policy specificity and reversing previous positions on fracking and immigration. But her adoption of centrist positions also appears to be squeezing Trump and frustrating his efforts to land a decisive political attack. Her decision to take on high grocery prices with a vow to clamp down on supermarket giants might explain how she’s narrowed the gap with Trump on who is most trusted on the economy. The flap over Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week also showed how the ex-president’s hardball tactics could hurt him as much as her. Trump’s honoring of 13 US service members killed in a suicide bombing amid the chaotic US evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021 highlights one of the worst moments of the Biden-Harris administration. And while the vice president joined Situation Room meetings on the crisis, it’s not clear yet whether Trump can saddle her with personal responsibility for the deaths in the minds of voters since Biden was commander in chief at the time. Harris took steps to counter Trump’s Afghan gambit when she wrote on social media that he had “disrespected sacred ground all for the sake of a political stunt” in filming campaign videos at gravesites and that this was part of a pattern of disparaging the sacrifices of American warriors. Trump responded by posting videos of some of the relatives of the fallen soldiers accusing Harris and Biden of complicity in the murder of their loved ones and supporting Trump. The harrowing episode showed how Trump is willing to cross lines that more conventional politicians would consider off-limits. While some voters might consider he’s honoring slain troops, others might agree with Harris that he is seizing on the deaths of Americans in foreign wars for political gain. On other issues, Harris is refusing to be drawn into gutter for political fights with Trump that might tarnish her image. For instance, the vice president was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash in an exclusive interview last week about Trump’s claim that she “happened to turn Black” for political reasons. “Same old tired playbook. Next question, please,” Harris said. The Harris campaign did, however, jump on Trump’s argument that he did nothing wrong in 2020. The ex-president said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday: “Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election, where you have every right to do it?” Harris-Walz spokesperson Sarafina Chitika folded his comment into the campaign’s wider argument that it’s time to consign Trump’s dictatorial instincts to the past. “The American people are ready for a new way forward. They know Vice President Harris is the tough-as-nails prosecutor we need to turn the page on chaos, fear, and division, and uphold the rule of law,” Chitika said. The exchange encapsulated the bets at the center of the campaign’s bitter endgame: Trump is putting his faith in a searing attempt to do anything it takes to bring Harris down; the vice president is wagering that his extreme attempts to do so will convince enough voters he’s unfit to return to the Oval Office."
Harris and Trump take different approaches as September debate nears | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",2024-09-03T10:00:19.571Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/harris-trump-2024-campaign/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are taking two different paths to prepare for their September 10 presidential debate, the first time the nominees will face off since Democrats upended their ticket this summer. The week leading up to the debate, which will be hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia, represents the candidates’ last chance to set the agenda before they meet. It may also offer a preview of what attacks the two will level against each other. Since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed his running mate more than five weeks ago, Trump has struggled to land on a message to blunt Harris’ momentum. The former president has tested out personal attacks and nicknames, criticized her lack of press conferences and new interviews, blamed Biden administration policies for inflation and high costs, and hammered Harris and Biden over the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan that left 13 US service members dead. Harris, meanwhile, has focused on moderating many of the positions she laid out during her 2019 Democratic presidential primary campaign. In an interview last week with CNN, her first since becoming the Democratic nominee, she argued that her values have stayed the same even if her stance on issues such as fracking have not. Harris is also planning to deliver a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday to unveil the next tranche of her economic plan, according to three advisers. CNN previously reported that Harris would unveil her proposals in a series of rollouts, with the next expected to focus on innovation, entrepreneurship and small business. Harris told a small-business owner in Georgia last week that one of her top priorities would be instituting a tax credit to assist Americans starting and growing businesses. But for much of this week, Harris will take a step back from the trail ahead of the debate after spending Monday campaigning in the so-called blue wall states with labor leaders. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, campaigned in Wisconsin, while Harris held a solo event in Michigan and was joined by Biden for a rally in Pittsburgh, the president’s first time campaigning with Harris since he ended his reelection bid. Biden is preparing to emerge as a top surrogate for Harris in the final two months of the campaign, and will hold events in key battleground states later this week. Trump, meanwhile, is ramping up his appearances after skipping Labor Day campaigning. The former president will virtually headline the Republican Jewish Coalition’s Annual Leadership Summit in Las Vegas on Wednesday and deliver a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday before holding a rally in in Mosinee, Wisconsin, on Saturday. The former president tried to flesh out his economic proposals last month. At a rally in Asheville, North Carolina, billed as an economic policy speech, Trump said he would impose tariffs on other countries and sign an executive order directing agencies to combat inflation on the first day of a second term. Harris has also sought to flesh out her policy platform, striking a balance between running on the Biden administration’s accomplishments and defining her own priorities. She said during an economic address last month that she would prioritize fighting price gouging, lowering grocery costs, cutting taxes for the middle class, reducing the burden of medical debt and prescription drug costs, and making it more affordable to buy and rent a home. “As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability and dignity,” she said in Raleigh, North Carolina. Next week’s debate will come after weeks of back-and-forth between the two campaigns over the scheduling and rules around the event. During the debate, the candidates will have their microphones muted when it’s not their turn to speak. The Harris campaign had pushed back on the rule, while the former president and his campaign have offered conflicting messages on their stance. In addition to the ABC News debate first agreed upon by Trump and Biden, the former president agreed to attend a September 4 Fox News debate. After Harris declined that event, the former president said he would hold a town hall with the network hosted by Sean Hannity."
"Harris backs US ownership of US Steel, in blow to takeover by Japanese company | CNN Politics","Updated 11:42 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",2024-09-02T14:24:59.623Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/kamala-harris-us-steel/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris said Monday that US Steel should remain domestically owned, saying during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh that it is “vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies.” Harris’ comments marked the first time she lent her voice to the dispute over the proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker. “The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies,” Harris said at the Labor Day event after being introduced by Joe Biden. “And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated.” The White House has previously opposed the controversial deal, with Biden saying it is “important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.” Biden outlined his position during a March event in Pittsburgh, nicknamed “Steel City,” where he visited the headquarters of the United Steelworkers and called for higher tariffs to protect American manufacturing. One week prior, when Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit, Kishida was asked by a reporter whether he saw US politics influencing the $14 billion takeover bid. Kishida said, “Japan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the US government” to evaluate the deal. Biden, asked the same question, said simply that he stands with both American workers and American allies overseas, without elaborating on his further involvement. For the deal to close, it needs approval from both the Justice Department, which enforces antitrust laws, and the normally low-profile but powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates takeovers on national security grounds. That committee comprises members of Biden’s cabinet, including the secretaries of treasury, commerce, defense, state, homeland security and the attorney general. It remains unclear to what extent Biden or Harris, in their official capacity, will work to block the deal on national security grounds in the treasury-led review. Representatives for US Steel and Nippon Steel declined to comment on whether the companies had briefed Harris on the deal. In August 2023, US Steel rejected a takeover bid by Ohio-based Cleveland Cliffs to buy the company for $7.3 billion. After months evaluating alternate suitors, US Steel agreed to sell to Japan’s largest steelmaker for more than twice what Cleveland Cliffs had proposed paying. US Steel shareholders overwhelmingly voted in support of the Nippon deal. Under the current terms of the deal, US Steel would retain its name and Pittsburgh headquarters. Nippon has also pledged an additional $1.3 billion to refurbish two outdated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana. In a statement to CNN, US Steel’s chief executive officer said those investments go well beyond what the company would be able to do on its own. “The bottom line is these are investments in the future of American steelmaking and the employees, families, and communities that rely on it,” CEO David Burritt told CNN. “US Steel will be a much stronger company as a result of the transaction and these investments – the entire American steel industry will be stronger and more globally competitive, too.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments."
"September 2, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-09-02T11:56:40.144Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-02-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Democrats had a busy campaign schedule this Labor Day, with Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spending the day appealing to union workers in major swing states. Former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, mostly stayed out of the spotlight as the two candidates gear up for next week’s debate. Here’s what happened on the campaign trail today: Harris supports a domestically owned US Steel: Harris said for the first time that US Steel should remain domestically owned, saying during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh that it is “vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies.” Her remarks echoed Biden’s stance against a proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker. During an earlier event in Detroit, Harris also vowed to ensure the “PRO Act,” legislation that would ensure workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and to “end union busting once and for all.” Biden goes back to his roots in Pennsylvania: Biden emerged as a powerful surrogate at a joint event with Harris in Pittsburgh, reappearing in a city that he has often visited over the course of his political career and attempting to boost Harris in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Biden said that he “celebrated many Labor Days in Pittsburgh” and that it was “good to be back to so many great friends.”  Walz’s motorcade gets into a crash: While en route to an event in Milwaukee, several vehicles in Walz’s motorcade were involved in a crash, and some passengers were taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Walz, who was not injured, made it to the event, where he touted that he was in “the pocket” of unions, pitching himself as a working-class vice presidential candidate as he tests his campaigning skills in the Midwestern “blue wall.” Trump stays out of the spotlight: The former president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had no scheduled events Monday. Trump, in an interview that aired Sunday, said he had “every right to” interfere with a presidential election, as he faces an updated indictment in the federal election interference case against him.  Vice President Kamala Harris said for the first time that US Steel should remain domestically owned, saying during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh on Labor Day that it is “vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies.”  Harris directly addressed the proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker, a controversial deal the White House previously opposed, with President Joe Biden saying it is “important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.”  Biden had outlined his position during a previous event in Pittsburgh, nicknamed “Steel City,” where he visited the headquarters of the United Steelworkers and called for higher tariffs to protect American manufacturing. At Monday’s event, the vice president began her remarks by thanking Biden, who introduced her and stood near Harris while she spoke, encouraging the crowd to chant, “Thank you, Joe.”  Harris also noted that ballots will “start dropping in 14 days” in Pennsylvania, one of the most important swing states this election. “This election is as much as anything else a fight for the promise of America,” she said. Watch here: Vice President Kamala Harris is planning to deliver a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday to unveil the next tranche of her economic plan, according to three advisers.  CNN previously reported that Harris would unveil her proposals in a series of rollouts, with the next expected to focus on innovation, entrepreneurship and small business.  Harris told a small-business owner in Georgia last week that one of her top priorities would be instituting a tax credit to assist Americans starting and growing businesses.  President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off the final sprint to the election together on Labor Day, using the holiday to woo working-class voters with an event at a local union hall in Pittsburgh — a symbolic show of force in a city Biden himself often turned to at key points in his political career. “I’ll be on the sidelines, but I’ll do everything I can to help,” Biden said of Harris’ bid for president. “Are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again?” Harris is getting a boost from Biden in battleground Pennsylvania, one of the “blue wall” states that were key to Biden’s victory in 2020 and one that will be critical this year. Labor Day marks the first time both the president and vice president appeared together for a campaign event since Biden announced he was ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris. While appearing as a top surrogate for Harris, Biden spoke at length about the pro-union actions he’d personally taken during his time in office: crossing a picket line with autoworkers, opposing foreign takeovers of American manufacturers, and demanding certain unions accept more women.  “We know the simple truth: Wall Street did not build America, the middle class built America, and unions built the middle class,” the president said.  Watch here: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s trip to Wisconsin on Monday marked the first use of the Harris-Walz campaign’s new campaign charter plane, the campaign said.  The plane bears an American flag on its tail, along with a “Harris-Walz” decal and another decal that reads “A New Way Forward.” Walz had previously been traveling on chartered planes without campaign insignia for his events across the country. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz proudly boasted his ties to organized labor at a union event in Milwaukee on Monday, celebrating Labor Day by declaring himself in “the pocket” of unions. The Democratic vice presidential nominee detailed his union membership as a former public school teacher, his record of backing unions in Congress and as Minnesota’s governor, and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of unions. Walz challenged Republicans to attack his support for unions while defending collective bargaining rights and fair working conditions.   The Minnesota governor emphasized the importance of union support to rebuilding the coalition of Midwestern battleground states that represent Harris’ clearest path to victory in November.   “We know exactly who built this country. It was labor that built this country,” Walz said. “We also know it was unions that built the ‘blue wall’ too, people, just to be very clear.”  Some pro-Palestinian protesters were escorted out of the event after they stood on benches in silent protest. Several of Harris’ speeches have been interrupted by demonstrators, reflecting the angst within her party over the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thanked first responders and Secret Service personnel for their response after several passengers were injured when vehicles in his motorcade crashed en route to a Milwaukee event. Walz told supporters at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council’s “Laborfest 2024” event that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called him to check in following the crash, which he said resulted in “a few minor injuries.” The Democratic vice presidential nominee reassured those in the crowd that “everybody’s going to be OK.”   Walz also stopped by a Milwaukee-area hospital to check on a staff member being treated for injuries following his motorcade’s crash, according to reporters traveling with the governor. He spent approximately 15 to 20 minutes at the hospital.  A campaign official confirmed to CNN that Walz visited the staffer at the hospital. Watch more here: This post has been updated with additional developments. Three vehicles in the motorcade escorting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to a campaign stop in Milwaukee were involved in a crash Monday, and some passengers were taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to the Secret Service. Several press vans got into a crash on Interstate 794 en route to Walz’s appearance at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council’s “Laborfest 2024,” where the Democratic vice presidential nominee was slated to speak this afternoon. Staff in the vehicles were “violently thrown forward” as one van slammed into another, according to reporters traveling with Walz. The governor’s vehicle was not involved in the crash, and ambulances responded to the scene, according to reporters. Vice President Kamala Harris was briefed on the crash, and her staff will update her throughout the day, according to a White House official. Harris spoke with her running mate to check on him and his staff, the official said. President Joe Biden also called Walz after the collision, the Harris-Walz campaign said. A White House official confirmed the president made the call before taking off on Air Force One for Pittsburgh. According to a press pool report, one reporter suffered a bloody nose in the crash and another has a possible concussion. US Secret Service spokesperson Joe Biesk said the injured passengers were treated by medical personnel on-site before being taken to a local hospital. Biesk confirmed that Walz was not injured and said the crash is being investigated by the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office.  This post has been updated with additional developments. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, on Monday posted a fake image of what appears to be Vice President Kamala Harris dressed in a red communist uniform. “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, in response to the vice president’s post warning about Trump being a “dictator on day one.” According to X’s policy, users “may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm. … In addition, we may label posts containing misleading media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context.” Musk’s post does not have any such label on it. Last month, Trump posted a fake, AI-generated image depicting Harris speaking in front of a communist symbol at the Democratic National Convention.  Some context: Images generated by artificial intelligence have exploded on social media in the run-up to the election. The fake posts come as technology platforms dismantle guardrails and moderation policies designed to reduce the spread of dangerous misinformation. These changes have been most acute on X, formerly known as Twitter, after Musk purchased the company, gutted in-house teams that worked to stop the spread of election disinformation and restored the banned accounts of prominent conspiracy theorists and extremists. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining in remarks to a crowd of union members and leaders in Detroit on Labor Day. “We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America’s middle class,” she told a packed high school gymnasium. Harris praised the labor movement for worker protections, saying, “you better thank a union member” for the five-day workweek, sick leave and vacation time. Recalling her upbringing attending marches and meetings in California with her progressive parents, Harris reiterated that she learned “when people stand together,” they can “drive extraordinary change.” Harris also criticized Donald Trump for actions she said were harmful to workers, prompting some members in the room to chant, “Trump’s a scab,” a critique popularized by United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who has sparred publicly with the former president. Harris was joined onstage by national union leaders, including Fain, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and National Education Association President Becky Pringle. As Harris talked about what she would do to fight for Americans’ future, she vowed to ensure the “PRO Act,” legislation that would ensure workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and to “end union busting once and for all.” Can I vote early? What deadlines should I know about? Do I need to show an ID? Voters will begin casting their votes for the 2024 presidential election starting this month.

Gretchen Whitmer praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on labor while bashing the Republican ticket as disconnected from the common man ahead of Harris’ Labor Day remarks in Detroit. “The labor movement was born here. The middle class was built here. We changed the world right here in the city of Detroit, Michigan,” Whitmer told hundreds of union members and local leaders packed into a high school gym. “What you do is informed by the people you’re around. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have stood with the people their entire lives. They grew up middle class,” she said. Whitmer then turned her attention to “that guy from Ohio,” a riff on Donald Trump’s previous labeling of her as “that woman from Michigan,” and pointed to how a steel mill in Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s Ohio hometown has been revitalized by an investment backed by the Biden-Harris administration. The Michigan governor also poked fun at Trump for not being able to relate to average Americans. “Look, if your most famous line is ‘You’re fired,’ you sure as hell don’t understand workers,” Whitmer later said, referencing Trump’s catchphrase on “The Apprentice,” adding, “I want our next president to say to workers, whomever she might be, ‘I’ve got your back.’” Since President Joe Biden exited the 2024 presidential race, there’s been a flood of ad spending. Republicans and Democrats have evenly contested battleground airwaves, but Democrats have had an edge overall, pouring nearly $100 million into digital advertising – much of it aimed at online fundraising.  Republicans lead slightly in battleground states, spending about $241.4 to Democrats’ $235.7 million across the seven most competitive states between July 22 and today. Where they’re spending: Both parties appear to agree that just seven states are the most competitive – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada – and they’ve targeted those states with tens of millions of ad dollars. Pennsylvania looms especially large, accounting for more ad spending than any other state. Each side is also pouring resources into Michigan and Georgia. Looking ahead: Democrats are currently poised to have the edge in advertising over the coming months. Between tomorrow, September 3, and Election Day, Democrats have bought $323.1 million worth of ad time, while Republicans have about $136.1 million booked. President Joe Biden reemerges on the campaign trail this week, entering a new political phase as he closes out his time in the White House and works to ensure Vice President Kamala Harris succeeds him. Biden and Harris will kick off the final sprint to the election together on Labor Day, using the holiday to woo working-class voters with an event at a local union hall in Pittsburgh – a symbolic show of force in a city Biden himself often turned to at key points in his political career. Biden’s campaign travel comes as he’s also navigating the latest developments in the Middle East after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages it says were killed by Hamas in Gaza. The carefully crafted return to the campaign trail comes as the president is shifting from candidate to surrogate mode after abandoning his own bid for a second term. Biden told reporters he’s looking forward to hitting the campaign trail after a two-week vacation in California and Delaware. His advisers have spent the past few weeks sketching out what his fall plans will entail on the campaign trail as he looks to burnish his legacy, sources familiar with the situation said. The president is emerging with an initial roadmap running through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan over the next five days, visiting the critical “blue wall” states where he narrowly beat former President Donald Trump in 2020. It will include a mix of campaign and official events to promote popular agenda items, offering a blueprint for how he’ll be deployed in the coming months. Read the full story. Allies of former President Donald Trump in Michigan railed against Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue of auto manufacturing ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee’s Labor Day visit to Detroit, where she’ll greet union members and national and local leaders. McClain, who represents the northern part of the metro Detroit area, as well as Rep. John James, who represents a neighboring district, both argued that Biden-Harris administration policies meant to increase the producing of electric vehicles in the US are unrealistic. James called EV mandates “detached from reality,” arguing that the country isn’t ready for an influx of electric vehicles from a critical infrastructure, charging infrastructure or affordability perspective. “No one is against EVs themselves, but this is not a well thought out plan,” he said. On Thursday, Trump said during an economic messaging event at a steel distributor in Potterville, Michigan that he is a “big fan of electric cars,” but said he thinks they’re “limited” in functionality and expensive to make in the US. He accused Harris and Democrats of wanting “immediately all electric cars,” adding, “we don’t have enough electricity to supply ourselves.” The Harris campaign distributed a fact check earlier last week that pushed back on previous claims by Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, including that Harris supported a “mandate” for all electric vehicles, saying instead, the administration’s goal is to have EVs comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030. Vice President Kamala Harris plans to say that US steel should remain domestically owned during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh on Monday, a campaign official said, lending her voice to a dispute over prospective Japanese ownership of the iconic American brand. Harris plans to “stress her commitment to always have the backs of American steel workers,” the official said. It would be the first time Harris has waded specifically into the proposed sale of US steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker. The White House has previously opposed to the controversial deal, with President Joe Biden saying it is “important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.” Biden outlined his position during an event in Pittsburgh, nicknamed “Steel City,” where he visited the headquarters of the United Steelworkers and called for higher tariffs to protect American manufacturing. For the deal to close, it needs approval from both the Justice Department, which enforces antitrust laws, and the normally low profile but powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates takeovers on national security grounds. That Committee is comprised by members of the President Joe Biden’s cabinet, including the secretaries of Treasury, Commerce, Defense, State, Homeland Security and the Attorney General. It remains unclear to what extent Biden or Harris, in their official capacity, will work to block the deal on national security grounds in the Treasury-led review. Representatives for US Steel and Nippon Steel declined to comment on whether the companies had briefed Vice President Harris on the deal.  Read more about Harris’ plans on US steel. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were not invited by Gold Star Families to Arlington National Cemetery on the anniversary of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to a White House official.  CNN previously reported that former President Donald Trump was invited by some of the families in his personal capacity. The ceremony was organized for families and their guests, not designed for elected officials.  Remember: Trump has faced controversy over his visit to the cemetery last Monday, after a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the 13 US service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing in 2021. Trump was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.” CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg, Kate Sullivan and Shania Shelton contributed to this report. Actor George Clooney applauded President Joe Biden’s decision to exit the 2024 presidential race during the premiere of his movie “Wolf” at the Venice Film Festival on Sunday.  Biden “did the most selfless thing anyone’s done since George Washington,” Clooney told reporters at the event. Clooney’s July 10th opinion piece in the New York Times calling for Biden to leave the race was a startling admission from a leading Democratic booster and someone who has interacted with Biden privately that, in his view, the president was unfit to serve to another term. But Clooney downplayed his own role in urging Biden to drop out. “All the machinations that got us there – none of that is going to be remembered, and it shouldn’t be,” the Oscar-winning actor said. Clooney insisted that Biden’s “selfless act” is what should be remembered. “It’s very hard to let go of power. We know that, we’ve seen it all around the world. And for someone to say, ‘I think there’s a better way forward’ – all the credit goes to him.” A self-professed “lifelong Democrat,” Clooney holds significant sway in the party as a well-known celebrity and a prolific fundraiser. He hosted an event earlier in the year, before Biden exited the race, that brought in $28 million for the president’s reelection.   This is how the Harris and Trump campaigns are spending the holiday today: Kamala Harris: The vice president is set to travel to Detroit before being joined by President Joe Biden in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event as part of the campaign’s push to appeal to working class voters across battleground states. The event will be held at 4:45 p.m. ET, per the White House. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff will also attend a Labor Day event in Newport News, Virginia. Tim Walz: The Democratic vice presidential nominee will deliver remarks at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council’s Laborfest 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Trump allies: At 9 a.m. ET, the Trump campaign in Michigan will host a press video call with current and retired members of the United Auto Workers to respond to Harris’ visit to Detroit. President Joe Biden is set to return to the campaign trail on Monday, joining Vice President Kamala Harris at a Labor Day event in Pittsburgh after spending most of the past weeks out of sight. Biden has been resetting in California and Delaware following a whirlwind six weeks after ending his future in presidential politics. The president has stayed out of the public eye for large stretches of the bicoastal vacation, charting out how to spend his remaining months in office after abandoning his bid for a second term in the White House. Biden is expected to return to the campaign trail on Monday to support Harris before returning to Washington. What’s still to come: Now free from the pressures and time constraints that come with being a campaign principal, Biden has worked over the last few weeks to set his legacy — with a special focus on foreign affairs. His administration’s negotiation with Russia that led to the largest prisoner exchange in decades at the beginning of this month was a crucial achievement. Throughout his time in California and Delaware, the president participated in a series of calls with foreign leaders as the US continues to push for a deal that would see a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Hamas-held hostages, while trying to stop clashes between Israel and Hezbollah from devolving into a wider war that could draw in the United States and Iran. Biden has also spoken with at least five world leaders since his speech at the Democratic National Convention last week. He spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the continued threats from Iran and the need for a ceasefire deal last Wednesday. Read more here about Biden’s time away from the spotlight Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is touting her role in helping the Biden administration become “the most pro-labor administration in history” ahead of a slate of nationwide events showcasing support for her campaign from labor groups, punctuated by President Joe Biden and Harris hosting a joint event in Pittsburgh.  The campaign is highlighting Harris casting the deciding vote to advance the 2021 Covid stimulus package and to pass the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, along with her support for unions as a senator and as California’s attorney general ahead of her visit to Detroit on Monday, where she’ll appear alongside union leaders and members ahead of her appearance in Pittsburgh. The Harris campaign reiterated her promise to sign the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a bill expanding protections for workers’ rights to collectively bargain.  The Harris campaign is also drawing a contrast with former President Donald Trump’s record as “one of the most anti-worker and anti-union presidents in history,” and pointing to proposals outlined in the conservative policy document Project 2025 to suggest a second Trump administration will hurt workers. Harris will be joined in Michigan by American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, National Education Association president Becky Pringle, and United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain. Some of the largest unions in the country will have national and local leaders present at both the Michigan and Pennsylvania events as well as Gov. Tim Walz’s visit to Milwaukee, including the AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers, and the Service Employees International Union, among others. Former President Donald Trump, in an interview aired Sunday, said he had “every right to” interfere with a presidential election, as he faces an updated indictment in the federal election interference case against him.  Special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment last week in his investigation into the former president’s and his allies’ alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped.  Trump said of Vice President Kamala Harris: Pence, who served as Trump’s vice president, has been critical of Trump after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and has said he won’t endorse Trump for president. Pence was targeted that day by a mob of pro-Trump supporters — including some chanting “Hang Mike Pence” — who were trying to stop the election results from being certified. Trump continues to falsely claim that Pence had the power to stop the certification of the results.  Trump, who is set to debate Harris next week, referenced the viral moment where she said to Pence, “I’m speaking,” when he was interrupting her during their vice presidential debate in 2020.   Trump was initially talking about Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Harris was a part of as a senator from California, and said Harris was “vicious” during the hearing.  The 2024 presidential race is set to enter a critical new juncture, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday. With the calendar turned to September, both campaigns are narrowing their focus on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the upper Midwest states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from it in 2020. It all comes as voting is set to begin this week: Harris last week focused on the Sun Belt, with a bus tour in Georgia and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also visiting North Carolina. Trump, meanwhile, turned his attention to the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, holding events in all three states late in the week and promising an economic revival.

Harris kicks off fall campaign blitz with Labor Day events in key states | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:19 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",2024-09-02T18:52:57.619Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/2024-harris-trump-labor-day/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign held a string of Labor Day-themed events in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, marking the unofficial launch of the fall campaign sprint in the states that will determine the November election. The events come as Harris seeks to extend her momentum over the next two months. While the Democratic presidential nominee has sought to expand the map of states where she is competitive, the Labor Day stops point to the importance of winning those three “blue wall” states that propelled President Joe Biden to victory in 2020. Biden joined Harris for a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening, the president’s first joint campaign appearance with the vice president since ending his reelection bid and endorsing her. “I’ll be on the sidelines, but I’ll do everything I can to help,” Biden said. “Are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again?” Harris used the Pennsylvania event to say that US Steel should be owned domestically and that she opposed the company’s purchase by the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel. “The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated,” Harris said to a crowd of union members. In a statement, a Nippon Steel spokesperson defended the deal, arguing that “U. S. Steel and the entire American steel industry will be on much stronger footing” under the acquisition. Harris’ remarks in Pennsylvania largely echoed an earlier event in Detroit, where she emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining to a crowd of union members and leaders, while drawing sharp contrasts with opponent Donald Trump. “We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America’s middle class,” she told a packed high school gymnasium here in Michigan. Harris was joined onstage by national union leaders, including United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and National Education Association president Becky Pringle. The vice president reiterated her support for the PRO Act, legislation that would ensure workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and vowed to “end union busting once and for all.” Monday’s events come 64 days ahead of Election Day and, as Harris noted in her remarks, 24 days before mail-in absentee voting begins in Michigan and 14 days before it begins in Pennsylvania. The vice president echoed previous warnings that the race would be close to the end. “I’m telling you we know how they play, we know what they do,” she said. “So let’s not pay too much attention to the polls. Let’s know, like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.” Meanwhile, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, proudly boasted his ties to organized labor at a union event in Milwaukee, celebrating Labor Day by declaring himself in “the pocket” of unions and daring Republicans to “roll the damn dice” if they want to criticize his support for labor. Walz detailed his union membership as a former public school teacher, his record of backing unions in Congress and as Minnesota’s governor, and highlighted Harris’ support for unions. Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had no scheduled events Monday. Trump used his social media site to bash Harris over high gas and grocery costs and tout his work renegotiating America’s trade deal with Mexico and Canada. “We can’t keep living under this weak and failed ‘Leadership,’” Trump said on Truth Social. The Harris campaign knocked the former president for not holding any events on the holiday. “Donald Trump is ditching workers on Labor Day because he is an anti-worker, anti-union extremist who will sell out working families for his billionaire donors if he takes power,” campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement. Ahead of Harris’ Labor Day remarks in Detroit, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer praised the vice president’s record and bashed the Republican ticket as disconnected from the common man. “Look, if your most famous line is ‘You’re fired,’ you sure as hell don’t understand workers,” Whitmer later said, referencing Trump’s catchphrase on his former reality show “The Apprentice.” “I want our next President to say to workers, whomever she might be, I’ve got your back.” Whitmer said Harris has been part of “the most pro-labor administration in American history,” and praised Harris’ work as a senator and attorney general to stand with picketing workers and take on big banks and pharmaceutical companies, as well as Walz’s work to bring infrastructure investments to his state and raise minimum wage for delivery drivers. Trump has been critical of labor leaders, including the United Auto Workers’ Fain, but has sought the support of workers in the same Rust Belt states Harris and Walz campaigned in Monday. The former president has focused his attention on the Biden administration’s efforts to boost the production and purchase of electric vehicles, which Trump has argued will come at the expense of autoworkers. Michigan Trump allies railed against Harris on the issue of auto manufacturing ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee’s Labor Day visit to Detroit. “What makes America great, part of it, is our economy, and the Harris administration is coming after autoworkers’ jobs,” Rep. Lisa McClain, a Michigan Republican, told reporters on a call Monday morning. “There will continue to be more layoffs.” McClain, who represents the northern part of the metro Detroit area, as well as Republican Rep. John James, who represents a neighboring district, both argued that Biden-Harris administration policies meant to increase the producing of electric vehicles in the US are unrealistic. The Harris campaign has pushed back on previous claims by Trump and Vance, including that the vice president supported a “mandate” for all electric vehicles. The administration’s goal is to have EVs comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
"No longer the candidate, Biden reemerges as top surrogate for Harris campaign | CNN Politics","Published 5:00 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",2024-09-02T09:00:19.820Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/biden-reemerges-as-top-surrogate-for-harris-campaign/index.html,"President Joe Biden reemerges on the campaign trail this week, entering a new political phase as he closes out his time in the White House and works to ensure Vice President Kamala Harris succeeds him. Biden and Harris will kick off the final sprint to the election together on Labor Day, using the holiday to woo working-class voters with an event at a local union hall in Pittsburgh – a symbolic show of force in a city Biden himself often turned to at key points in his political career. Biden’s campaign travel comes as he’s also navigating the latest developments in the Middle East after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages it says were killed by Hamas in Gaza. This included Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose parents Biden and Harris each spoke to on Sunday. The carefully crafted return to the campaign trail comes as the president is shifting from candidate to surrogate mode after abandoning his own bid for a second term. Biden told reporters he’s looking forward to hitting the campaign trail after a two-week vacation in California and Delaware. His advisers have spent the past few weeks sketching out what his fall plans will entail on the campaign trail as he looks to burnish his legacy, sources familiar with the situation said. The president is emerging with an initial roadmap running through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan over the next five days, visiting the critical “blue wall” states where he narrowly beat former President Donald Trump in 2020. It will include a mix of campaign and official events to promote popular agenda items, offering a blueprint for how he’ll be deployed in the coming months. His reentry also coincides with Harris scaling back her own public appearances as she shifts her focus to preparing for the September 10 presidential debate. Biden is filling the gap on her behalf in key battleground states this week. Biden, who has seen a small uptick in his approval rating in some polls since ending his reelection campaign, is expected to spend a substantial amount of time in Pennsylvania, the state where he was born and where allies hope his political capital can help Harris. It’s a state Biden believes the vice president has “got to win,” and he’s indicated he’s spoken with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro about launching a tour in the commonwealth. Democratic allies also believe Biden will continue to hold sway with blue-collar voters and older voters, who made up an important bloc of the president’s backing in his 2024 bid even as he saw a dwindling in support from other key groups. There is close coordination between the West Wing, the vice president’s office and the campaign on plans to get Biden on the road where most helpful, a source familiar with the matter said. Exactly where and how often he is deployed could evolve as the race progresses, sources said, as Harris’ campaign faces a truncated period to make its case to voters. Discussions also are underway to determine how the president can be utilized on the fundraising circuit in the fall, sources said. The teams have yet to determine how often Biden and Harris will campaign together, with one ally saying there could be a “divide and conquer” approach in the lead-up to Election Day. The president has indicated he’s willing to do whatever is needed in the campaign, a source familiar with the dynamic said, because in the White House’s view, he has taken “a huge gamble” in stepping aside, “and it has to work.” Biden this week will hold White House events in a rural area of southwestern Wisconsin, where he’ll focus on investments in clean energy jobs and efforts to combat climate change, and in Michigan, where he’ll highlight job creation in a local community. “He’s actually going to participate in the campaign and lay out what the administration has done. That’s one of the key things that needs to be emphasized,” said former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, a close friend and longtime adviser of Biden. “It’s all hands on deck.” But it could prove a fine line for Democrats to walk as Republicans are eager to tie Harris to what they view as failed Biden policies on issues including immigration and the economy, areas where Trump has performed better in polls throughout the campaign. Even as she’s pushed for a “new way forward,” Harris has yet to distance herself from Biden’s record on domestic or foreign policy. But she has tapped into different messaging strategies, including an economic pitch focused on affordability around issues such as grocery prices and housing. In a sit-down interview with CNN last week, Harris defended the president’s economic record and brushed aside questions about why she has not acted on the new items she’s proposing on the campaign trail during her term as vice president. “We had to recover as an economy, and we have done that,” she said, pointing to her work with Biden to reduce inflation and lower prescription drug costs. “There’s more to do, but that’s good work,” she said. Harris also offered praise to her former running mate, telling CNN that Biden “has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president.” On top of looking to boost Harris’ candidacy, the president is also using this period to zero in on key goals on domestic and foreign policy that he wants to address before leaving office, Ben LaBolt, White House communications director, said the president will be “leaning in heavily” to campaign for Harris while also focusing on governing. “The schedule will be robust, and he plans to leave it all on the field in securing as much progress as possible for hard-working Americans, be that through implementation or legislative action,” LaBolt said. Biden has pressed his team to focus on the implementation of key legislation and efforts to lower costs, along with work on legacy issues such as the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, supporting veterans, combating gun violence, and stewardship of artificial intelligence, among other priorities. Working toward an end to the conflict between Israel and Hamas remains a key priority for the president, who has recently placed separate calls to the leaders of Israel, Egypt and Qatar to push along efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal. “It’s time this war ended,” Biden said Saturday. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.” The war in Ukraine is also a top agenda item for Biden in his final months in office. He recently spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who dispatched senior officials to Washington last week. The president, no longer constrained by the demands of the campaign trail, is also expected to travel abroad, considering trips to Poland, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru, the G20 Summit in Brazil, and Africa, where he has long promised a visit. He is also expected to attend the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering in New York next month. It can be beneficial to Harris to have Biden on the world stage meeting with his counterparts and reaffirming US leadership. “He’s teeing her up for success by refreshing those relationships – and no one is better at that,” a former US official said. With his decision to step aside, Biden has made the transition from principal to surrogate, acknowledging the new dynamic in his remarks at the Democratic National Convention last month. “I promise I’ll be the best volunteer the Harris-Walz campaign has ever seen,” he said. Biden’s service and legacy were widely lauded that evening in Chicago, but the three following days of convention programming turned toward the party’s future. Still, he maintains popularity with some key demographics that will be critical this November. Though he was forced out of the 2024 race over concerns about his age and ability to campaign, some polls have shown Biden’s approval ratings move up. The president’s approval rating sits at 41%, according to the CNN Poll of Polls – up from 37% in July. “He’s going to be a particularly powerful surrogate for the vice president because he is well-liked, and he will be well remembered,” said Mitch Landrieu, a co-chair of the Harris campaign who worked with the president and vice president in the White House. “His selfless act to step down has given him an incredible amount of credibility.” Biden, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in an interview with CNN, will be “the ultimatevalidator” for Harris with union workers. Shuler has noted that 1 in 5 voters in blue wall states Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota are union voters, and 22% of Pennsylvania voters are union voters – a group that roundly favors Harris. “He would be very motivating for people, and it’ll be just yet another asset that the campaign has in its toolbox that they can deploy,” Shuler said. Biden will also be a key surrogate for Harris among older voters. While he lost ground with several key demographics while he was in the 2024 race, the president made significant inroads with older voters, a group that has typically voted for Republicans. In their first event together after Biden bowed out of the race, the president and vice president focused on Medicare’s ability to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, an issue that could resonate with senior voters. Biden has made no secret how important Pennsylvania will be in the November election. He moved the state back to the blue column in 2020, beating Trump there by less than 2 percentage points. “We have got to win Pennsylvania, my original home state. (Shapiro) and I are putting together a campaign tour in Pennsylvania,” Biden said in an interview with CBS’ “Sunday Morning” last month. “I’m gonna be campaigning in other states as well. And I’m gonna do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most.” Biden’s victory in 2020 stemmed from driving out support in the Philadelphia area and appealing to voters in the western and northeastern parts of the state, including the area where his beloved Scranton is based. “Joe Biden, I think, proved uniquely capable of clawing back the carpenters, teamsters, laborers who had drifted away to Trump in 2016,” Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, said of Biden’s work in the northeastern and western regions of the state. The president and vice president are set to campaign together in Allegheny County where Biden’s campaign saw growth in support in 2020 compared to former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s run against Trump one cycle before. It’s also an area that’s helped shape Biden’s political career. In 2015, he jogged down a Labor Day parade route in downtown Pittsburgh to chants of “Run, Joe, run!” at a time when he was weighing a late entry into the Democratic primary. He ultimately decided against launching a campaign as he continued to grapple with the death of his son Beau. Biden returned to that same Labor Day parade as he mulled entering the 2020 race. And Pittsburgh is where he started and ended that run for the White House – kicking things off with a rally with union workers in April 2019 and then returning on the eve of the election for an outdoor car rally featuring Lady Gaga. Now Biden will turn back to that city as he enters a new chapter in his more than five decades in politics, looking to boost his chosen successor Harris, who he’s said will make “one hell of a president.”"
"September 1, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-09-01T12:39:46.639Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-09-1-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump claimed in an interview that aired Sunday that he had “every right to” interfere with a presidential election as he faces an updated indictment in the federal election interference case against him.   “It’s so crazy that my poll numbers go up. Whoever heard — you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election where you have every right to do it — you get indicted and your poll numbers go up,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News.  Special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment last week in his investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims down the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court’s controversial immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped.  Trump also said in the interview that the way Vice President Kamala Harris “treated Mike Pence was horrible.”   Pence, who served as Trump’s vice president, has been critical of Trump after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and has said he won’t endorse Trump in 2024. Pence was targeted that day by a mob of pro-Trump supporters — including some chanting “Hang Mike Pence” — who were trying to stop the election results from being certified. Trump continues to falsely claim that Pence had the power to stop the certification of the results.  Trump was initially talking about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearing, which then-Sen. Harris took part in. “She was vicious. Oh, she was the most vicious,” Trump said of Harris. “She was going after them. Just like with Mike Pence, where she said, ‘You’re interrupting me, I want to talk.’” The former president, who is set to debate Harris next week, was referencing the viral moment from the 2020 vice presidential debate in which Harris said to Pence, “I’m speaking” when he was interrupting her.   Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are gearing up as the 2024 presidential race enters a pivotal stretch. Ahead of the pair’s September 10 debate, both campaigns are focusing on key battlegrounds, while the first swing-state ballots will hit mailboxes after the Labor Day weekend. Here’s what to know as the campaigns prepare for the final two months before Election Day: Harris hits the trail: The Democratic nominee is set to travel to Detroit on Monday before being joined by President Joe Biden in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event as part of the campaign’s push to appeal to working-class voters across battleground states. Meanwhile, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will deliver remarks at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council’s Laborfest. Trump heads to the Badger State: The former president will hold a rally Saturday in Mosinee, Wisconsin — one of the country’s top battleground states — as he turns his attention to the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. First swing-state ballots will soon hit mailboxes: The first ballots of the 2024 election will go out Friday in North Carolina, one of a handful of potentially critical Sun Belt states. Two weeks later, early in-person voting starts in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia. Arlington controversy continues: The fallout over Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery is continuing nearly a week after Trump sparked criticism over rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. After Harris said the former president “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself,” Trump highlighted the support of families of service members killed in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. The former president on Sunday thanked the families for videos he posted to social media in which they praised Trump while condemning Harris and Biden. Former President Donald Trump sought to blame Vice President Kamala Harris for the hostage crisis after the Israeli Defense Forces recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza.  Harris has been working with President Joe Biden on negotiating a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas — something she reiterated during her speech last month at the Democratic National Convention. “Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said during her speech. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff spoke Sunday with the parents of Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was among the hostages who were killed. “Doug and I just spoke to Jon and Rachel, Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s parents, to express our condolences following the brutal murder of their son by Hamas terrorists,” the Democratic presidential nominee wrote on X. “My heart breaks for their pain and anguish.” Sen. Tom Cotton said Sunday that he would be open to former President Donald Trump’s costly new IVF proposal even as he raised concerns about how to fund such a measure.  Trump said Thursday that if reelected, he would implement a policy to pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how it would be paid for. “I’m announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment,” the former president said at a campaign event in Michigan. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Senate ally of Trump, said Sunday he wouldn’t support the former president’s proposal, instead proposing a tax credit for families seeking financial assistance with IVF.  “I think a tax credit for children makes sense, means-tested, and I think let’s look at that concept for people trying to have a child,” the South Carolina Republican said on ABC’s “This Week.” Some context: In the months since the Alabama high court’s February ruling that frozen embryos are children, Democrats have sought to use threats to IVF to paint Republicans, including Trump, as seeking to restrict access to reproductive health care. But Trump has worked to distance himself from the decision, saying shortly after the ruling that he “strongly” supports “the availability of IVF for couples.” This post and headline have been updated with additional information. Donald Trump on Sunday thanked the Gold Star families who recorded videos defending him, which the former president posted to social media after his controversial appearance last week at Arlington National Cemetery. The videos Trump posted to Truth Social and X show families of US service members who were killed at the Kabul airport bombing three years ago bashing Vice President Kamala Harris and praising Trump. The videos came as the Trump campaign grapples with the fallout over a confrontation with a cemetery official regarding rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. In his Sunday post, Trump also continued attacking Harris — who slammed the former president on Saturday, saying he “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.” “Lightweight V.P. Kamala Harris tried turning it around, because they weren’t there, have never spoken to the families, and have no intention to do so,” Trump said. Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over former President Donald Trump in a new national poll from ABC News and Ipsos, with numbers nearly identical to those in a pre-convention poll from ABC/Washington Post/Ipsos.  Overall, Harris tops Trump 50% to 46% among registered voters in a two-way matchup, about the same as the 49% to 45% race the poll found in early August. The results suggest a slightly wider lead for Harris among likely voters, 52% Harris to 46% Trump, a finding also similar to the likely voter result pre-convention (51% Harris to 45% Trump). Sean O’Brien, president of the Teamsters, said his union is waiting to formally endorse a presidential candidate until its members have a chance to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris.  The president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters told CBS News on Sunday the group is hoping for “the opportunity to sit down with” Harris before it decides whether to endorse her or former President Donald Trump.  “You don’t hire someone unless you give them an interview. And you know, this is our opportunity to ask her about Teamster-specific issues and also labor issues. So until we have that meeting, you know, obviously we will wait to make that determination,” he continued.  O’Brien also reiterated his criticism of Trump after he appeared to celebrate the firing of striking workers during a live conversation with Elon Musk, and said he supports the United Auto Workers union filing a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against Trump.  “I support anybody that attacks labor, they should be held accountable, and any organization that’s going to hold them accountable,” he said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Sunday discussed the balancing act of campaigning for vice president while still serving as governor, crediting a “good team” for helping him do both. “We appointed three great judges last week in Ramsey County, as you saw. Every night, we go through all of the decision memos and um — meeting with the commissioners. I stay updated throughout the day, and I’m in and out,” he said. Walz was visiting the Minnesota State Fair, where he greeted supporters, sampled fair food and served ice cream at what he called the best state fair in the country. He was accompanied by his wife, Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, and his daughter, Hope.  After sampling pork chop on a stick and serving ice cream, Walz met with the “Princess Kay of the Milky Way,” the winner of the Midwest Dairy Association’s annual Minnesota Dairy Princess Program competition. Walz and the contest winner looked at butter sculptures made of past winners. He concluded his visit by shaking hands and taking selfies with hundreds of fairgoers, who chanted his name intermittently throughout his visit.  Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for Senate in California, reiterated Sunday that he would support a ban on fracking, differentiating himself from Vice President Kamala Harris’ stance while acknowledging that Harris is seeking to represent a broader constituency. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked whether she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,” Harris said at the time. By the time she became Biden’s running mate, she had moved away from that stance and even cast the tie-breaking vote to expand fracking leases, as she said to Bash in an interview last week. “What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,” she said. Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser on the Trump-Vance campaign, said there would be “no changes at the top” within the team as the fall campaign season begins. Lewandowski also committed to former President Donald Trump being at the September 10 presidential debate under rules which include muted mics throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. “We’ve agreed to the rules of the debate. We are looking forward to being there on September 10. The microphones will be off. People will be standing at a lectern and there will be no notes,” he said. Trump seemed to undercut his campaign last week, signaling that he would be willing to debate with the mics on.  Lewandowski said the Harris campaign should be on board with the previously set debate rules, because she had been involved in the discussions when the parameters were negotiated under the Biden campaign.  “When we originally set the parameter for the debates, which was for, at the time, President Biden, Kamala Harris was also part of that, because we set the same parameters for the vice presidential debate,” he said. “Once again Kamala Harris and her team are changing what the positions have been,” he said.  Former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, who is helping former president Donald Trump prepare for his first presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, previewed a face off where voters will be able to compare the candidates’ policy records. “Kamala Harris has a lot of experience. She is not to be underestimated,” Gabbard told CNN of her one-time Democratic primary opponent. Gabbard noted that both candidates have “served at the highest offices in the land,” explaining, “this will be an opportunity for voters to look at and compare and contrast those records.” Gabbard said she would help Trump by sharing her own experiences engaging in fierce debate exchanges with Harris during the 2020 primary, and “helping to point out some ways that Kamala Harris has already shown that she is trying to move away from her record, move away from her positions, and how that contradicts the positions and statements that she is making now that she is the Democratic nominee.” Harris told CNN earlier this week that though she has changed positions on certain policy issues like banning fracking, “The most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.” Gabbard, along with former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have both been added to Trump’s transition team after endorsing Trump in recent days. Though Gabbard has alluded to an interest in serving in a second Trump administration as secretary of state or defense secretary, she said she had not addressed the matter with Trump directly. “It’s important for us right now to point out the difference between Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump, what kind of president and commander in chief they would be,” she said. Vice President Kamala Harris’ top campaign adviser says the Democrat remains the “clear underdog” in a critical stretch of the presidential contest, looking to guard against complacency as the fall campaign season begins. Jen O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, wrote in a memo Sunday that rival Donald Trump retains a “motivated base of support,” and predicts a result as close as 2020. “In 2020, the election came down to about 40,000 votes across the battleground states. This November, we anticipate margins to be similarly razor-thin,” she writes in the memo. Pointing to the September 10 debate and an increased pace of travel, O’Malley Dillon said the weeks ahead will be critical in defining the Democratic ticket. The country “needs to hear relentlessly from us about Vice President Harris and her vision for the country,” she wrote. This is how the Harris and Trump campaigns are spending Labor Day on Monday: Kamala Harris: The vice president is set to travel to Detroit on Monday before being joined by President Joe Biden in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event as part of the campaign’s push to appeal to working class voters across battleground states. The event will be held at 4:45 p.m. ET, per the White House. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff will also attend a Labor Day event in Newport News, Virginia. Tim Walz: The Democratic vice presidential nominee will deliver remarks at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council’s Laborfest 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Minnesota governor will be joined by his wife, Gwen Walz. Trump allies: At 9 a.m. ET, the Trump campaign in Michigan will host a press video call with current and retired members of the United Auto Workers to respond to Harris’ visit to Detroit. In videos posted by Donald Trump on Saturday, parents of US service members who were killed during the Abbey Gate bombing praised the former president and condemned Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. The videos posted to Truth Social come as the Trump campaign grapples with controversy over his visit this week to Arlington National Cemetery to honor the 13 US service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing in 2021. Trump was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. Earlier Saturday, Harris blasted Trump in a statement, saying he is “unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.” Darin Hoover, father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, said in another video Trump posted: “Kamala, I want you to understand — and I know it will be difficult for you because you lack empathy and basic understanding — the events that happened on August 26, 2024, with President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery were solemn and in keeping with the reverence and respect that is given to all members of our military that are buried there.”  Coral Doolittle, mother of Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez, said in a video, “Kamala Harris and President Biden didn’t even say their 13 names. They called the withdrawal in Afghanistan a success, and for us, it was just sadness and a disgrace.” Another family’s account: In addition to the grave sites of soldiers killed in Kabul, the grave of an Army Special Forces soldier who died by suicide was also featured in at least one photo posted online from the visit. The family of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano has since said they did not give the campaign permission to photograph the plot. The family said in a statement this week that, while they support the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan in their “quest for answers and accountability,” they had spoken to the cemetery and do not believe the campaign followed the rules for its visit to the grounds. The 2024 presidential race is set to enter a critical new juncture, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend. As the calendar turns to September, both campaigns are narrowing their focus on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the Upper Midwest states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020. It all comes as voting is set to begin this week. Harris last week focused on the Sun Belt, with a bus tour in Georgia and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also visiting North Carolina. Trump, meanwhile, turned his attention to the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, holding events in all three states late in the week and promising an economic revival. Read more here about the 2024 presidential campaign President Joe Biden is set to return to the campaign trail on Monday, joining Vice President Kamala Harris at a Labor Day event in Pittsburgh after spending most of the past weeks out of sight. Biden has been resetting in California and Delaware following a whirlwind six weeks after ending his future in presidential politics. The president has stayed out of the public eye for large stretches of the bicoastal vacation, charting out how to spend his remaining months in office after abandoning his bid for a second term in the White House. Biden is expected to return to the campaign trail on Monday to support Harris before returning to Washington. What’s still to come: Now free from the pressures and time constraints that come with being a campaign principal, Biden has worked over the last few weeks to set his legacy — with a special focus on foreign affairs. His administration’s negotiation with Russia that led to the largest prisoner exchange in decades at the beginning of this month was a crucial achievement. Throughout his time in California and Delaware, the president participated in a series of calls with foreign leaders as the US continues to push for a deal that would see a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Hamas-held hostages, while trying to stop clashes between Israel and Hezbollah from devolving into a wider war that could draw in the United States and Iran. Biden has also spoken with at least five world leaders since his speech at the Democratic National Convention last week. He spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the continued threats from Iran and the need for a ceasefire deal last Wednesday. Read more here about Biden’s time away from the spotlight Anyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states. In 2020, Joe Biden turned a handful of states from red to blue to defeat then-President Donald Trump. The difference between victory and defeat was a tiny fraction of voters in those states. In 2024, it could again be small margins in these few states that are the difference between another Trump Republican presidency or a win for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Trump will try to win those same states back from Democrats. The map could also change since the US population is shifting and both sides are hoping to bring a few more states into their respective column. In any event, the margins could be just as close. But to say that a small number of voters “decide” the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved. Here’s how things work."
2024 race hits pivotal new stretch as debate approaches and first ballots are set to go out | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:51 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",2024-09-01T04:00:19.571Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/2024-debate-ballots-harris-trump/index.html,"The 2024 presidential race is entering a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend.

Harris’ campaign is pouring money into advertising in the Savannah media market as it seeks to broaden its appeal outside Atlanta. According to AdImpact data, Harris’ campaign has spent a total of about $1.7 million in advertising there over the last three weeks. Harris’ top campaign adviser said in a memo Sunday the vice president remains the “clear underdog” in the race, setting expectations and looking to guard against complacency as the fall campaign season begins.

The candidates are interspersing their campaigning with preparation for their September 10 debate, hosted by ABC. That debate — the first between Harris and Trump, and the only one both campaigns have agreed to so far — could prove the most pivotal moment in the 2024 race. Trump has enlisted the help of former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, whose failed 2020 presidential bid featured several notable clashes on debate stages with Harris over foreign policy and Harris’ record on criminal justice. Harris, meanwhile, is working closely with Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign. Polls show a tight race nationwide and in critical swing states. A Wall Street Journal survey released Thursday found no clear leader, with Harris at 48% to Trump’s 47% among registered voters. A Quinnipiac University poll out the same day similarly found Harris at 49% and Trump at 47% among likely voters. Sun Belt states that once appeared to have slipped out of Democratic reach have reemerged on the battleground map since Harris became the party’s nominee. Fox News polls released Wednesday found no clear leader among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and South Carolina. The polls found Harris at 50% to Trump’s 49% in Arizona; those numbers flipped, with Trump at 50% and Harris at 49%, in North Carolina. In both Georgia and Nevada, Harris was at 50% to Trump’s 48%. More than a month after the Democratic change at the top of the ticket, with President Joe Biden dropping his reelection bid and Harris stepping in, Democrats believe they still have momentum. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said in an interview that the race has shifted from one where Democrats were on track to lose and in need of a fundamental shake-up, to one where Republicans are “hoping that there’s some catastrophic moment” in which Harris blows it. “They’re clearly taken aback by a change in the candidate. But it’s the candidacy that I think is throwing them off. They’ve never run with against someone with such an orientation towards the future,” Schatz said. “It was always about how you felt about Donald Trump – you were either for Donald Trump or not for Donald Trump or ambivalent. And I think what’s happening is after more than eight years a lot of people would just like not to talk about that man anymore,” he said. “Lots of politicians have attempted to be the leader that could help us to turn the page as a nation and Kamala Harris is evidently the only one that is capable of doing that.” Republicans, meanwhile, are arguing that Harris’ economic proposals, and her promises of a new era in American politics, are hollow, since she has been vice president for three and a half years and bears at least partial ownership of Biden’s record. “If she wants to tackle the affordability crisis or close down the southern border, she should be doing it now,” Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance said Friday on “CNN News Central.” “And I think it takes a lot of shame — shamelessness, I should say — to be able to stare at the American people’s eyes and say, I’m going to fix your problems now, when I’ve already been in power for three and a half years.” Polls have shown Trump with an advantage among men who are likely to vote, but Harris with a huge edge with women. That split is common in presidential elections, but Trump is attempting to chip away at Harris’ advantage with women in part through a focus on reproductive rights. It’s a topic that has been a huge Democratic advantage since the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority that includes three members appointed by Trump, in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade’s nationwide abortion rights protections — opening the door to a new patchwork of state-level restrictions. Trump last week infuriated conservatives with his answer to a question about how he plans to vote on a referendum that will decide the future of abortion access in his home state of Florida. Under current Florida law, abortion is illegal in most cases after six weeks. Voters this fall will decide on a ballot measure that would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy. Trump had repeatedly declined to weigh in on the referendum, but on Thursday, he told NBC that Florida’s six-week ban was “too short” and said he would be “voting that we need more than six weeks.” A day later, he said he was going to vote “no” on the referendum and, in explaining why he was doing so, repeated a false claim that Democratic states are passing laws that allow people to execute babies after birth. Also on Thursday, while campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin, he offered a new proposal aimed at women, pledging universal coverage of in vitro fertilization. “Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for – or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for – all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said during a campaign event in Michigan. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.” However, senators in his own party, including his running mate, Vance, defeated a bill with a similar provision earlier this summer. On a Harris campaign call with reporters on Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump’s promise to have fertility treatments paid for is “just smoke and mirrors” without a commitment to protect the treatments from legal threats. She pointed to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that deemed that frozen embryos are children, jeopardizing the legality of IVF treatments before Alabama’s Republican governor signed a law protecting IVF access in the state after Trump said he supports the treatment. She also cited a Senate bill to codify access to IVF nationwide that was blocked by Republicans in June and a House GOP bill that seeks to legally define life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization to draw the contrast on protections for reproductive health care. “Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single extremist judge or state legislature from banning IVF. Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single one of the 131 Republicans in Congress from advancing their fetal personhood bill that would ban IVF. Despite what Trump seems to think, American women are smart and we aren’t falling for his gaslighting,” Warren said. Harris’ campaign on Friday also countered Trump by announcing a new bus tour aimed at advocating for women’s reproductive rights. The “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour will kick off Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida – Trump’s hometown – with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro and reproductive rights storyteller Anya Cook. It wasn’t just Trump’s pledge of universal coverage of IVF that lacked details. Both Harris and Trump have discussed policy through the lens of details and aspirations, rather than addressing the difficult questions about the exact contours of their proposals, how they’d win approval on Capitol Hill and how they’d be funded — all of which would confront them in the Oval Office. Harris has said she would aim to help the middle class by targeting price-gouging, making housing more affordable through $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers, offering a child tax credit, lowering drug prices and creating new jobs. Trump, meanwhile, has pledged the largest deportation effort in US history, and has said it would involve the National Guard and perhaps the military. But he has not addressed how he would solve the constitutional, logistical and manpower issues that such an undertaking would involve. He has also ducked specific questions about abortion rights, claiming he could bring about a national consensus policy on an issue that has been a wedge in American politics for more than 50 years. In fact, the most detailed policy blueprint in the 2024 race — “Project 2025,” a 920-page document organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration — is one Harris’ campaign has used to attack Trump, while the former president distanced himself from it. The missing details could be fleshed out when Harris and Trump meet for their first debate on September 10. Another key moment will come on October 1, when CBS hosts the vice presidential debate between Harris’ running mate, Walz, and Trump’s No. 2, Vance. This story has been updated with new reporting.

Arlington cemetery controversy deepens as Trump and Harris trade attacks | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:31 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",2024-08-31T21:51:49.274Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/politics/harris-slams-trump-arlington-national-cemetery/index.html,"Donald Trump on Saturday continued to defend his visit this week to Arlington National Cemetery amid mounting criticism, including from Vice President Kamala Harris, who said the former president “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.” Veterans, service members and their families “should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,” Harris wrote Saturday in a lengthy post on social media. “And it is my belief that someone who cannot meet this simple, sacred duty should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.” Trump has faced controversy over his Monday visit to the cemetery after a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the 13 US service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing in 2021. Trump was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.” After Harris’ statement, the former president highlighted the support of parents of service members killed in the airport bombing. In videos posted to Truth Social, the parents praised Trump while condemning Harris and President Joe Biden. Jaclyn Schmitz, mother of Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, said in her video, “Kamala, your statement is nothing more than a political spin to help you look better in your presidential campaign against Donald Trump. You have never walked a single day in our shoes. Our kids were murdered because of your administration, and you are partly to blame.” Similarly, Coral Doolittle, mother of Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez, slammed Harris and Biden as the people responsible for “murdering our kids.” “They called the withdrawal in Afghanistan a success, and for us, it was just sadness and a disgrace,” Doolittle added. Darin Hoover, father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, said in another video that “the events that happened on August 26, 2024, with President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery were solemn and in keeping with the reverence and respect that is given to all members of our military that are buried there.” Hoover said while at the cemetery, “We asked the Trump team to take the videos, take the pictures, of our time there.” Saturday’s statement marks the first time the vice president has directly addressed the controversy as she attempts to draw a contrast between herself and her rival ahead of their September 10 debate. Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign’s communications director, previously called the incident “pretty sad” in an interview on CNN but said it is what people have “come to expect from Donald Trump and his team.” The Trump campaign on Saturday also sent out a statement from Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, an Army veteran and Trump ally, defending the former president and attacking Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Cotton, who was not present during Trump’s trip to the cemetery, said that “neither the families nor President Trump violated cemetery regulations or policies” and claimed the “political apparatchiks working for the incompetent secretary of the Army disrespected the wishes of these Gold Star families.” Accounts of the incident on Monday have varied. Trump campaign officials have said an individual physically blocked the former president’s team from accompanying him during the visit, and a cemetery spokesperson confirmed to CNN “there was an incident” and a “report was filed.” The campaign has insisted there were no violations of the law, while cemetery officials have said Trump’s team was told ahead of time to avoid political activity. Federal law prohibits political campaigning or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, according to a statement from Arlington National Cemetery obtained by CNN. A video of the visit posted by the Trump campaign on TikTok earlier this week showed the former president walking through Arlington and visiting grave sites, with audio of him criticizing the Biden administration’s management of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. NPR first reported there had been a “verbal and physical altercation” during the cemetery visit. A source with knowledge of the incident told the outlet that a cemetery official attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. In response, Trump campaign staff “verbally abused and pushed the official aside,” according to NPR. An Army spokesperson said while the incident was reported to the police department at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, the employee in question “decided not to press charges” so the Army “considers this matter closed.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments."

In videos posted by Donald Trump on Saturday, parents of US service members who were killed during the Abbey Gate bombing praised the former president and condemned Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. The videos posted to Truth Social come as the Trump campaign grapples with controversy over his visit this week to Arlington National Cemetery to honor the 13 US service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing in 2021. Trump was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. Earlier Saturday, Harris blasted Trump in a statement, saying he is “unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.” Veterans, service members and their families “should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,” Harris wrote in a lengthy post on social media. Darin Hoover, father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, said in another video Trump posted: “Kamala, I want you to understand — and I know it will be difficult for you because you lack empathy and basic understanding — the events that happened on August 26, 2024, with President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery were solemn and in keeping with the reverence and respect that is given to all members of our military that are buried there.”  Hoover said while at the cemetery, “We asked the Trump team to take the videos, take the pictures, of our time there.” President Joe Biden said Saturday that he plans to be on the campaign trail this fall to stump for Vice President Kamala Harris. “Memorial Day in Pittsburgh, and I’m on the road from there on,” Biden told reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, confusing Memorial Day and Labor Day. His comments come ahead of a joint campaign appearance with Harris in Pittsburgh on Monday. When asked about the controversy following former President Donald Trump’s trip to Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week, Biden declined to weigh in. “I don’t want to answer because I may tell you what I think,” he said. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign has sent out a statement from Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a US Army veteran and Trump ally, defending him over his controversial visit to Arlington National Cemetery this week and attacking Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Trump was rebuked by the Army earlier this week over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. Cotton, who was not present during Trump’s trip to the cemetery, said “neither the families nor President Trump violated cemetery regulations or policies,” and claimed officials working for “the incompetent secretary of the Army disrespected the wishes of these Gold Star families.” Some context: Trump visited the cemetery following a wreath laying to honor 13 US military service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing three years ago. His campaign posted video of the visit with audio of Trump criticizing the Biden administration’s “disaster” of the Afghanistan withdrawal. The US Army then issued a critical statement saying the Trump campaign had been made aware of regulations that “prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” and adding that a cemetery employee was “abruptly pushed aside” while trying to enforce those rules during Trump’s visit. He has also been criticized by some veterans groups and the family of one soldier whose grave site was shown in the campaign content. Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, went on offense over the visit on Saturday, saying Trump only understands “service to himself.” This is how the Harris and Trump campaigns are spending Labor Day on Monday: Kamala Harris: The vice president is set to travel to Detroit on Monday before being joined by President Joe Biden in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event as part of the campaign’s push to appeal to working class voters across battleground states. The event will be held at 4:45 p.m. ET, per the White House. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff will also attend a Labor Day event in Newport News, Virginia. Tim Walz: The Democratic vice presidential nominee will deliver remarks at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council’s Laborfest 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Minnesota governor will be joined by his wife, Gwen Walz. Trump allies: At 9 a.m. ET, the Trump campaign in Michigan will host a press video call with current and retired members of the United Auto Workers to respond to Harris’ visit to Detroit. Vice President Kamala Harris is criticizing former President Donald Trump over his controversial handling of a visit to Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week, saying in part that Trump “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.” “I will always honor the service and sacrifice of all of America’s fallen heroes, who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our beloved nation and our cherished freedoms. I mourn them and salute them. And I will never politicize them,” she added. It’s the first time the vice president appears to be directly addressing the controversy. Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign communications director, had previously called the incident “pretty sad,” but said it’s what they’ve “come to expect from Donald Trump and his team.” What we know: As CNN has previously reported, Trump was visiting the cemetery following a wreath laying to honor 13 US military service members who were killed in Afghanistan three years ago. A video of the visit posted by the Trump campaign showed video of the former president walking through Arlington, with audio of him criticizing the Biden administration’s “disaster” of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Accounts of the incident on Monday have varied, with the Trump campaign insisting there were no violations of the law, while cemetery officials have said the campaign was told ahead of time to avoid political activity. The US Army also issued a stark rebuke, saying in a statement that participants had been told that federal law prohibits political activity at the cemetery, and that a cemetery employee trying to enforce those rules was “abruptly pushed aside.” Trump has since been criticized by some veterans groups and the family of one soldier whose grave site was shown in the campaign content. CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. Anyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states. In 2020, Joe Biden turned a handful of states from red to blue to defeat then-President Donald Trump. The difference between victory and defeat was a tiny fraction of voters in those states. In 2024, it could again be small margins in these few states that are the difference between another Trump Republican presidency or a win for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Trump will try to win those same states back from Democrats. The map could also change since the US population is shifting and both sides are hoping to bring a few more states into their respective column. In any event, the margins could be just as close. But to say that a small number of voters “decide” the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved. Here’s how things work. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will campaign this upcoming Wednesday and Thursday in Pennsylvania, the Harris campaign announced Saturday.  The trip marks Walz’s third visit to the key battleground state since joining the Democratic ticket as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Janelle King, a Republican member of the Georgia State Election Board, defended controversial new election rules in the state, saying Saturday that the board is “just cleaning” up the process.  Key context: Earlier this month, and less than 90 days before the general election, the key swing state’s five-member election board passed new rules that give county election boards the authority to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying election results and permit members of county election boards to investigate ballot counts. The new rules have been the subject of much criticism from both sides of the aisle, with Democrats suing to block the rules over what they warned could be post-election “chaos.” Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger made a statement earlier this month defending Georgia’s election integrity laws and “denouncing” efforts to make last-minute changes. More from King: The Republican responded to a Tuesday remark from Raffenspergercalling the board “a mess,” claiming he went straight to the public and never expressed his concerns to King and her colleagues. Last week, the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials released a statement calling for the State Election Board to pause future rule changes ahead of the 2024 presidential election, warning further tweaks could cause errors. But King insisted Saturday that the board is “just cleaning” the process up. “It’s not (creating confusion) because they will have enough time,” King told CNN. “We’re not creating new laws, so it’s already on the books, we’re just lining everything up.” Former President Donald Trump on Saturday said he thinks adults in Florida shouldn’t be arrested for having “personal amounts” of marijuana in their possession, as the state’s voters are set to weigh in this November on recreational use of the drug.  Trump said in a new post on Truth Social that he thought the proposal, known as Amendment 3, would pass. Trump called for the Florida state legislature to “responsibly create laws that prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat run Cities.” “At the same time, someone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other States. We do not need to ruin lives & waste Taxpayer Dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl laced marijuana. We will make America SAFE again!” Trump wrote. The former president made similar comments about legalizing marijuana during a news conference earlier this month at Mar-a-Lago. Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, have each staked out positions in recent weeks that appear aimed at broadening their appeal in the general election. President Joe Biden spent most of the last two weeks out of sight while Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump hit the campaign trail, sparring over key issues and trying to win over swing voters in a flurry of appearances. Biden has been resetting in California and Delaware following a whirlwind six weeks after ending his future in presidential politics. The president has stayed out of the public eye for large stretches of the bicoastal vacation, charting out how to spend his remaining months in office after abandoning his bid for a second term in the White House. Biden is expected to return to the campaign trail on Monday to support Harris before returning to Washington. What’s still to come: Now free from the pressures and time constraints that come with being a campaign principal, Biden has worked over the last few weeks to set his legacy — with a special focus on foreign affairs. His administration’s negotiation with Russia that led to the largest prisoner exchange in decades at the beginning of this month was a crucial achievement. Throughout his time in California and Delaware, the president participated in a series of calls with foreign leaders as the US continues to push for a deal that would see a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Hamas-held hostages, while trying to stop clashes between Israel and Hezbollah from devolving into a wider war that could draw in the United States and Iran. Biden has also spoken with at least five world leaders since his speech at the Democratic National Convention last week. He spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the continued threats from Iran and the need for a ceasefire deal last Wednesday. Read more here about Biden’s time away from the spotlight Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday continued to push for open microphones at the first presidential debate against former President Donald Trump. “Donald Trump is surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn’t have confidence in him, the American people definitely can’t,” Harris said in a post on X. CNN previously reported that ABC News intends to mute the microphones of Trump and Harris while their opponent speaks, according to a copy of the formal rules, but the Harris campaign is continuing to push back on the final sticking point. While the Trump campaign has accepted the rules governing the September 10 matchup, Harris’ campaign said it remains in ongoing discussions with the network about the microphone issue. More context: During an event in Virginia on Monday, Trump said of the microphones, “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.” Behind the scenes, the Trump campaign continued to advocate for the rules they had already agreed to with ABC. Trump then said in a Truth Social post Tuesday that the rules would be the same as the CNN debate against President Joe Biden. That has led to Harris needling Trump that his advisers are overruling him. Vice President Kamala Harris slammed Donald Trump for saying he’s voting “no” on a Florida abortion amendment on Friday. Trump made the comment during a Fox New interview earlier that day. “So, of course he thinks it’s a ‘beautiful thing’ that women in Florida and across the country are being turned away from emergency rooms, face life-threatening situations, and are forced to travel hundreds of miles for the care they need,” she added. Some context: A “no” vote would pave the way for a 6-week abortion ban, which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed last year, to stay in effect. The amendment would protect the right to have an abortion until a fetus is viable, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. Under the Biden administration, Harris has been leading the charge on the issue of reproductive rights. In April, Harris traveled to Florida just hours after the controversial ban went into effect and warned another Trump term would mean “more bans, more suffering, less freedom.”  In the statement released on Friday, Harris echoed the sentiment and vowed to restore reproductive rights if she is elected president. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have picked their running mates and held nominating conventions to rally their parties. They have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. While we don’t know specifically what will happen between now and Election Day — or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going — we do have some idea of what to expect: There were some interesting and off-brand pledges on the environment from Vice President Kamala Harris and on abortion policy from former President Donald Trump to close out the week: Harris on fracking: The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee made very clear during an interview with CNN that she now supports fracking, the oil and gas extraction process that climate and environmental activists largely oppose. “I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking, as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand,” she said, arguing the US can have a clean-energy economy and still embrace fracking. Trump on reproductive health: The former president and Republican nominee floated making either the US government or insurance companies pay for expensive in vitro fertilization treatments, crossing both abortion activists and small-government conservatives. Trump also had to clarify his position about a six-week abortion ban in Florida. Trump told NBC News he thinks the six-week ban is “too short” for women. But he later told Fox News he would oppose a Florida ballot initiative that would reverse the current six-week policy put in place by Republicans who run the state government. Obvious political explanations: On the one hand, Harris acknowledges the threat of the climate crisis and brags about the Biden administration’s record on climate policy. On the other, she is also hoping to hold on to Pennsylvania and Michigan, “blue wall” states won by President Joe Biden in 2020, where fracking is big business. And Trump, on the one hand, wants credit with conservatives for appointing the US Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, which allowed some states to severely limit or end access to abortion. On the other, a more moderate position on abortion and support for more affordable IVF could appeal to women. Keep reading “What Matters” from Zachary B. Wolf. Former President Donald Trump and special counsel Jack Smith are at odds over how the election subversion case in Washington, DC, should move forward, according to a status report filed late Friday. However, neither side is rushing to get to trial before the November presidential election — or even before the end of the year. Smith is not offering firm dates for the next phase of the case, while Trump is recommending a schedule for certain pre-trial disputes that would carry through until at least the beginning of 2025. Trump’s proposed schedule, however, says that it could take until fall 2025 to work through “additional proceedings, if necessary.” The Friday filing sets the stage for a potentially contentious hearing next week in DC’s federal courthouse where Judge Tanya Chutkan will determine how the case will proceed. It will be the first hearing in the case after the landmark Supreme Court ruling that said Trump has some immunity in the election subversion prosecution. The filing also comes just days after the special counsel refashioned his indictment to bring it in line with the ruling from the Supreme Court’s conservative majority this summer. Trump wants to challenge Smith’s appointment: The parties disagree in the Friday filing on the order of operations and whether certain issues in the case can be resolved concurrently. Smith would like Chutkan to first tackle the questions raised by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity, but he says she can do that while also handling certain other pre-trial issues that Trump plans to bring up in the case. Trump, meanwhile, said that he plans to challenge the legality of Smith’s appointment and argued the judge should deal with that issue before moving on to the immunity dispute. Continue reading. Former President Donald Trump rushed to clarify his stance on a ballot measure in Florida this week following intense blowback from anti-abortion advocates online, leading to concerns among Republicans that Trump’s continued waffling on the issue might lose him some deeply religious voters in a tightening race. The episode marked the latest illustration of Trump straining to navigate the new era of post-Roe politics that he helped create. Florida is set to vote on the referendum, which would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy. The state currently bans the procedure after six weeks. Here’s a timeline of Trump’s latest comments on reproductive rights: Thursday: Trump told NBC that Florida’s six-week ban was “too short” and added that he would be “voting that we need more than six weeks.” The campaign quickly clarified in a statement that Trump had not, in fact, picked a side. The same day, Trump promised universal coverage of in vitro fertilization if he is elected, though he did not specify how the treatments would be paid for. This came despite senators in his own party, including his running mate, JD Vance, had defeated a bill with a similar provision earlier this summer. Friday: Trump told Fox News that he will be voting “no” when asked about the Florida amendment. The former president also sidestepped a question on whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if he were to get elected and such a bill made its way to his desk. Vance has said earlier this week that he thinks Trump would veto a federal abortion ban. Read more on how Trump is navigating the issue. Former President Donald Trump on Friday defended his visit to Arlington National Cemetery with the families of the 13 service members killed in Afghanistan three years ago. Speaking at the Moms for Liberty annual convention in Washington, DC, he recounted the Arlington visit as a “beautiful” moment and appeared to call it “disgusting” that he was criticized for taking pictures of the gravesites for his campaign. Of his Democratic opponent, Trump suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn’t sit for any other media interviews and accused her of not wanting to debate him. He again attacked Harris over her CNN interview, specifically over her answer on fracking. He mentioned Harris’ attack against President Joe Biden over desegregation busing during a 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate, calling Harris the “nastiest person” to Biden. He accused Harris of lying about working at McDonald’s. He also joked that he would send Harris a MAGA hat, “because she loves everything we’re doing.” “So we’re going to send her a nice, bright red Make America Great Again hat,” he said. CNN conducted the first joint interview of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on Thursday. Here’s how the Democratic ticket responded to some key questions from CNN’s Dana Bash: Flip-flop on fracking: In 2019, Kamala Harris opposed fracking — a position that could have proven politically damaging in Pennsylvania, where it’s a huge employer. Now, she says, she supports it. Progressives have opposed fracking due to concerns about climate change. But under the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in the Senate and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, fracking has expanded. Harris said she had already changed her position on fracking in 2020, when she said that Biden “will not end fracking.” “What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,” she told Bash. Appointing a Republican to the Cabinet: Asked if she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, Harris said: “Yes, I would.” “No one in particular,” she said. “We have 68 days to go in this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would.” Refusing to engage in identity politics: Last month, Donald Trump questioned Harris’ racial identity, suggesting she’d previously identified as South Asian but “happened to turn Black” for political purposes. Shaking her head, Harris said Trump’s remark is part of his “same old tired playbook.” “Next question, please,” she said. Her refusal to comment further aligns with her campaign’s strategy to avoid leaning into identity politics following Trump’s remarks. Blaming Trump on border security: Trump has made attacking the Biden administration’s handling of the US-Mexico border a signature issue, but Harris said Trump bears much of the blame for the border security problems he bemoans. She pointed to his opposition to the bipartisan border security bill hashed out by a group of lawmakers. Asked if she would push that bill if she is elected president, Harris said: “I would make sure that it would come to my desk and I would sign it.” Read more takeaways from the exclusive interview."
Analysis: Harris and Trump race to the middle | CNN Politics,"Published 9:00 AM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",2024-08-31T13:00:20.069Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/politics/election-harris-trump-what-matters/index.html,"There were some interesting and off-brand pledges on the environment from Kamala Harris and on abortion policy from Donald Trump to close out the week. The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee made very clear during an exclusive interview with CNN that she now supports fracking, the oil and gas extraction process that climate and environmental activists largely oppose. “I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking, as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand,” she said, arguing the US can have a clean-energy economy and still embrace fracking. The former president and Republican nominee floated making either the US government or insurance companies pay for expensive in vitro fertilization treatments, crossing both abortion activists and small-government conservatives. “I kept hearing that I’m against it, and I’m actually very much for it,” Trump said at a town hall in Wisconsin. It’s not clear how he would square an expensive government mandate with his longtime opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which also required insurance companies to cover certain services. Trump also had to clarify his position about a six-week abortion ban in Florida. Trump told NBC News he thinks the six-week ban is “too short” for women. “It has to be more time,” he said. But he later told Fox News he would oppose a Florida ballot initiative that would reverse the current six-week policy put in place by Republicans who run the state government. Trump’s rhetoric against a six-week ban but effective support for it in his home state is contradictory, at best, but also speaks to the difficulty of his position. On the one hand, Harris acknowledges the threat of the climate crisis and brags about the administration’s record on climate policy. On the other, she is also hoping to hold on to Pennsylvania and Michigan, “blue wall” states won by Joe Biden in 2020. Fracking is big business in both places. Meanwhile, recent polling has shown a strong advantage for Harris with women voters, although the race remains close overall. On the one hand, Trump wants credit with conservatives for appointing the US Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, which allowed some states to severely limit or end access to abortion. On the other, a more moderate position on abortion and support for more affordable IVF could appeal to women. “Yes, I would,” Harris said simply in the CNN interview, when asked if she’d put a Republican in her Cabinet. “Of course,” said Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance when asked by Fox News if a second Trump administration would put a Democrat at the table. There’s a long history of cross-party Cabinet officials in the US, but neither Trump’s first administration nor the Biden administration brought in a voice from the other party when they had the opportunity. For reference, then-President Barack Obama’s secretary of transportation was Republican Ray LaHood, and then-President George W. Bush’s secretary of transportation was Democrat Norman Mineta. At the Democrats’ convention this month, Republicans were featured as speakers every night. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan were both given prime spots to raise the alarm about Trump. Kinzinger, a longtime Trump critic, has the kind of foreign policy views that would be welcomed in the old-school GOP of Sens. Mitt Romney or Mitch McConnell, both of whom have acknowledged the Republican Party has moved away from them. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, another hawk who says Trump should not be elected, has not endorsed Harris, but she has said she won’t vote for Trump. On the other side, Trump got the endorsement of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran and a former Democrat who made her name as an anti-war activist. The parties have drifted on foreign policy. Following Trump’s cue, many Republicans now question giving Ukraine additional aid to stand up to Russia’s aggression, for instance. Along with Gabbard, Trump named another former Democrat, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to his transition team. Kennedy’s unique brand of vaccine skepticism, opposition to processed food and environmental activism might appeal to some on the far left. But Kennedy drew the ire of his family members and Democrats by endorsing Trump. Conservatives have focused on fighting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the government and in corporations, and Trump has tried to question both Harris’ identity and her qualifications. Harris, on the other hand, has noticeably avoided overt appeals to minority groups. When CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris about Trump’s ridiculous insult that Harris recently “turned Black” for political reasons, Harris did not engage. “Same old, tired playbook,” she said. “Next question, please.” Later, Bash noted that Harris did not mention gender or race in her speech accepting the nomination, and she asked the vice president about an inspiring photo of Harris’ young grandniece looking up at her at the DNC, wondering how Harris feels about the fact that her candidacy means a lot to a lot of people. Before saying she was humbled, Harris first stepped back from the historic nature of her candidacy. “I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment – for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” she said. Even Trump has heard from advisers, according to a recent report from CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Steve Contorno, that he should steer clear of the insults that are in his DNA and focus on policy contrasts with Harris. Some of the policies he’s pushing sound like they could come from Democrats: appealing to wage earners by calling to exempt tipped earnings from taxes, and now an IVF proposal aimed at anyone struggling to pay for infertility treatments. None of this means the country is not divided – and you can bet that when Trump and Harris meet for their first debate on September 10 hosted by ABC News, they will each try to paint the other as extreme. Plus, Trump can be told to avoid insults and focus on policy, but he has so far been unable or unwilling to do so. These larger appeals on specific, across-the-aisle policies from both sides, however, do show that the presidential campaigns see value in toning down their rhetoric and moderating their positions as they try to win the White House."
Fact check: New Trump ad uses edited quote to attack nonexistent Harris immigration proposal | CNN Politics,"Published 4:00 AM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",2024-08-31T08:00:19.844Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/politics/fact-check-trump-ad-harris-immigration/index.html,"A new television ad from former President Donald Trump’s campaign piles deception upon deception to attack Vice President Kamala Harris on immigration. The ad uses an edited quote to attack Harris over a supposed proposal that she hasn’t actually made. The ad features a narrator saying this: “Attention seniors: Kamala Harris has promised amnesty for the 10 million illegals she allowed in as border czar, making them eligible for Social Security. Studies warn this will lead to cuts in your Social Security benefits.” A quote shown on the screen, which the ad attributes to the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that favors reduced immigration, says this: “Harris’ amnesty imposes large cost on Social Security.” Facts First: The ad’s claims are false. Harris has not made any promise to grant legal status to all of the migrants who have crossed the border during her vice presidency. Though she has expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for some unspecified group of undocumented people, she has never said that recent migrants should be included. And Harris’ name does not appear in the actual Center for Immigration Studies quote about the likely cost of “amnesty” to Social Security; the center says it hasn’t analyzed a specific 2024 amnesty proposal from Harris because it hasn’t seen her make a specific proposal. There are other problems with the ad, too. Harris was never “border czar.” Rather, she was given a diplomatic role focused on addressing the “root causes” of migration from three Central American countries, not put in charge of border security. You can read a longer fact-check of that claim here. And the ad’s claim that 10 million migrants have been “allowed in” during Harris’ vice presidency is an exaggeration. Though there have been roughly 10 million official border “encounters” with migrants nationwide during the Biden-Harris administration, that “encounters” figure includes people who were rapidly kicked out of the country. It also counts each attempt at entry by an individual who tried more than once. Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director for the Migration Policy Institute think tank that researches immigration policy, told CNN that the actual number of people let into the country under the Biden-Harris administration would be around six million, not 10 million, even if you used a generous estimate that counts people let in under designated parole programs for Ukrainians and Afghans; counts people permitted to lawfully fly into the country under a program for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela; and counts every “encounter” at the northern border as a successful entry even though we know it was not. Regardless of the number, though, it’s clear that Harris has not promised to grant “amnesty” to all of the migrants who have come into the country during her vice presidency. “We are unfamiliar with any statement by Kamala Harris that she has promised to amnesty border arrivals allowed into the country since January 2021,” Mittelstadt said in an email. Harris has not released many policy specifics on immigration since she became the Democratic presidential candidate in late July, when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. During Harris’ speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, she pledged to sign a bipartisan border security bill Trump had helped to kill earlier this year, and she said, “I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border.” That “earned pathway to citizenship” language makes clear that, as Harris has said before, she wants to provide legal status to some group of undocumented people. But here’s the key: it is simply not clear which group of undocumented people she now wants to include. Her campaign declined to comment this week. While it’s theoretically possible Harris could eventually propose amnesty for every undocumented person in the country, various “amnesty” proposals do not cover the entire undocumented population – and many include a time restriction that excludes the most recent arrivals. For example, when Harris was running for president in 2019, she proposed a pathway to citizenship for many “Dreamers,” undocumented people who arrived in the US as children, not for all undocumented people. And an executive action Biden announced in June, which has been paused by a judge, seeks to give legal status to the undocumented spouses and children of US citizens without making them leave the country to wait – but the spouses must have lived in the US for 10 years or more to qualify. So what is the Trump campaign’s source for the claim that Harris has specifically promised “amnesty” for the migrants who have arrived during her vice presidency? When CNN asked the campaign for comment, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded in an email: “Kamala supports amnesty. She always has! Has she said otherwise? NO!” The example Leavitt cited was a bill Biden sent to Congress on the first day of the Biden-Harris administration in 2021, which Leavitt noted the Democrats’ 2024 platform continues to promote. That bill, however, does not corroborate the ad’s claim that Harris has promised “amnesty” to the people who have arrived during her vice presidency. With some limited exceptions, the bill requires an undocumented person to have been in the US by the first day of 2021 to be eligible for a pathway to citizenship. If Harris simply re-proposed this bill, the migrants who arrived during her vice presidency – from January 20, 2021 onward – would not be eligible. Asked for comment, the Center for Immigration Studies made clear that the quote the Trump ad attributes to the center – “Harris’ amnesty imposes large cost on Social Security” – is not an actual quote from the organization. “We have many different cost estimates for various amnesties. We have done work on the costs to retirement programs in particular and that appears to be what the ads refers to. But we have not done anything specific on Harris’ proposal,” Steven Camarota, the organization’s director of research, said in a Tuesday email to CNN. The analysis Camarota linked to, from 2021, was headlined “Amnesty Would Impose Large Costs on Social Security and Medicare.” Contrary to the quote in the ad, the analysis never mentioned Harris. Camarota was not particularly critical of the Trump campaign for adding Harris’ name to the quote. In a follow-up interview with CNN on Wednesday, Camarota said that Harris has been supportive of “amnesty” proposals in the past, has signaled her support for some sort of amnesty during this campaign, and that “it’s very difficult to imagine” that any such Harris program “would exclude the recent arrivals.” Still, arguing that a future Harris program is likely to include this group is significantly different from claiming, as the ad does, that Harris has already “promised” to include this group."

We’ll be back bright and early Tuesday — and the Sunday edition of 5 Things will be posted as scheduled. In the meantime, here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday offered her most expansive explanation to date on why she’s changed some of her positions, including on fracking and immigration. In an exclusive sit-down interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Harris said her values haven’t shifted but that her time as vice president provided new perspective on some of the country’s most pressing issues. Speaking alongside running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris also said she would name a Republican to serve in her Cabinet if elected. She also sought to frame the 2024 race as one that offers the American people “a new way forward” after a political decade in which Trump — in office or out — was a central figure. Elon Musk is stepping up his online attacks on a Brazilian Supreme Court judge threatening to suspend social media platform X, calling him “an evil dictator” in an ongoing feud between the two. Musk, who had previously called Justice Alexandre de Moraes “Darth Vader,” retweeted a statement from X’s Global Government Affairs team saying it would publish the judge’s “illegal demands and all related court filings” in the coming days. Brazil is a major market for social media platforms, including X, formerly known as Twitter. Former President Donald Trump filed a petition Thursday seeking to move his New York state criminal case to a federal court in Manhattan and push off the upcoming sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The petition asks the court to confirm Trump cannot be sentenced while the litigation over the removal to federal court is pending. Trump’s sentencing is currently scheduled for September 18, though Judge Juan Merchan is expected to rule in early September on a previously filed motion from Trump’s legal team — which the Manhattan district attorney’s office did not oppose — to delay it until after the election. Two deaths from West Nile virus have been reported in Wisconsin and one in Illinois — the first such deaths in those states this year, according to the state health departments. The CDC said Thursday that it has received reports of 18 deaths from West Nile across the country so far this year, according to preliminary data. Overall, the CDC has received 289 reports of West Nile cases in 33 states this year. Of those cases, 195 have been neuroinvasive, in which the virus invades the brain and nervous system. This can lead to complications such as brain swelling, brain damage or death. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for West Nile, which is spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. After spending 12 weeks docked to the International Space Station, Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft is finally set to return home — empty. The troubled spacecraft will undock from the space station on September 6 at around 6 p.m. ET, and will spend about six hours maneuvering closer to home before landing near midnight in New Mexico’s White Sands Space Harbor. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who rode the Starliner to the ISS on June 5, will fly home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule no earlier than February. Shocking defeat at the US Open

Analysis: Harris bolsters momentum in first sit-down interview but leaves gaps on policy detail | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri August 30, 2024",2024-08-30T09:00:19.761Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/politics/harris-momentum-cnn-interview-analysis/index.html,"Kamala Harris showed how she plans to deal with Donald Trump and win the presidency in CNN’s exclusive first interview with the vice president since becoming Democratic nominee, avoiding slips that could slow her momentum. Harris went into the interview on Thursday under enormous scrutiny, with Trump and his allies accusing her of dodging the press and predicting she’d fizzle under pressure, be undermined by her own policy switches and burst the bubble of joy around her campaign. The vice president preferred sweeping themes and aspirations rather than detailed policy blueprints and declined to fully explain reversals on issues like immigration and energy. But she was a more deft, disciplined and prepared political figure than she appeared in her short-lived bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination or in accident-prone moments early in her tenure as vice president. Harris smoothly countered questions and follow-ups about her vulnerabilities by pivoting to safer talking points as she failed to do in a damaging interview with NBC in 2021. Harris also steered clear of any obvious errors that would knock her campaign off track and require her to perform damage control in the vital build-up to her debate showdown with the former president on September 10 in Philadelphia. And a week after her keynote speech at the Democratic convention expanded on her core argument that it was time to “turn the page” from Trump’s divisiveness, she also refused to be drawn into her Republican rival’s provocations over her racial identity. She dismissed the issue by simply telling CNN’s Dana Bash: “Same old tired playbook. Next question, please.” Her response showed that she has no intention of allowing the campaign to be overtaken by questions about race, even though her potential as the first Black woman and Indian American president will form a constant backdrop to the rest of the campaign. Harris was at ease and pragmatic, contrasting with the tetchy self-obsession and bombast of her opponent. Her demeanor, as she tried to appeal to available voters who were unenthusiastic about former President Joe Biden, probably fulfilled most of her campaign’s goals for the interview and was in keeping with her apparent strategy of providing a safe harbor for any American disgusted by Trump. She also debunked claims by Trump and conservative media that she was using running mate Gov. Tim Walz as a crutch in the interview and was unable to answer questions herself as she dominated the time and was clearly the senior partner in their double act. She used the interview to develop her core attack on Trump’s character and conduct, which is the foundation of the case she’s making to voters. “I think sadly, in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation,” Harris told Bash. Later, at a rally in Savannah, Georgia, where the interview was conducted, she warned her crowd that the US Supreme Court’s recent ruling carving out significant immunity for Trump from criminal prosecution meant that the ex-president would seek vengeance against people who disagree with him. “Understand: This is not 2016 or 2020. This is different.” But Harris was elusive on what she would actually do as president, dealing in themes and aspirations rather than policy specifics and sometimes straddling key issues to avoid painful choices that she’d face in the Oval Office. Her answers were replete with ways she hoped to help the middle class by lowering prices, making housing more affordable, lowering drug prices and creating new jobs. But Harris did not lay out a clear path for navigating treacherous politics to enact such plans. She also did not say how she’d pay for such programs. Her tendency to talk in generalities rather than policy nuts and bolts was exemplified by the first question in the interview when she was unable to provide a precise answer on one distinct step that she’d take on day one of her presidency. She spoke broadly about her economic plan and work to invest in the American family, concluding, “There are a number of things on day one.” Harris also shrugged off questions about why she had been vice president for three-and-a-half years in the administration and had not effected items in her economic plan, offering a potential opening to the Trump campaign. And while she effectively showed she understands the painful impact of high grocery prices, she was not fully able to account for why they had risen so high under the Biden-Harris administration. Instead, the vice president accused Trump of creating an economic crisis she and Biden inherited through his mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and pointed to the White House’s strong job creation record and the easing of inflation. At times, Harris’ pragmatism faded into fuzziness. When confronted on reversing her previous opposition to fracking — a huge issue in swing state Pennsylvania – she insisted she’d not really reversed her position. “What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,” she said. Many climate change campaigners would argue that fracking — a practice used to extract hard to reach oil and gas and that can pollute water sources and harm wildlife – is incompatible with a green economy. Yet Harris insisted that while she opposed a fracking ban “my values have not changed,” apparently seeking to disguise contradictory positions. She also took a both sides approach on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. Harris argued that Israel must have the right to defend itself but that “far too many Palestinian civilians have been killed.” As the administration seeks to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas to release remaining hostages and reach a ceasefire, the vice president insisted, “We have to get a deal done.” This may be the only way out of the horror, but US diplomacy has for months fallen short of this goal and failed to end the civilian toll in Gaza. And events in the conflict have shown that the Harris position that Israel must have the right to defend itself but that too many Palestinians have died has often been an irreconcilable one. Harris also finessed the question of why she argued that Biden was fit to serve another four-year term, even after his disastrous performance in the CNN debate in Atlanta. She said she didn’t regret her remarks and paid warm tribute to the president, saying that “he has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgement and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president.” And displaying the political dexterity that many in her party and outside once believed she lacked but that succeeded in uniting her party around her and erasing Trump’s opinion poll leads, Harris quickly flipped to a harsh critique of Trump — expanding on the entire rationale of her bid for the White House. “I’m talking about an era that started about a decade ago, where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.” “That’s what’s at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election.”"

Tim Walz sat down exclusively with CNN Thursday for her first interview since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket. Just days after accepting the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Harris answered wide-ranging questions from CNN’s Dana Bash, including on her economic and border policies, attacks on her race from former President Donald Trump and the call from President Joe Biden to tell her he was withdrawing from the race. Read the full transcript of the exclusive interview below. BASH: Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me and bringing the bus. Bus tour is well underway here in Georgia. You have less time to make your case to voters than any candidate in modern American history. The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House? HARRIS: Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you first and foremost one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by — by hope and by optimism. I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans — really dividing our nation. And I think people are ready to turn the page on that. BASH: So what would you do day one? HARRIS: Day one, it’s gonna be about one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I’ve already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we’re gonna do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we’re gonna do to invest in America’s small businesses, what we’re gonna do to invest in families. For example, extending the child tax credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child’s life to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. There’s the work that we’re gonna do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing, a big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one. BASH: What about you? WALZ: Well, I’m excited about this agenda, too. As I said, the idea of inspiring America to what can be. And I think many of these things that the vice president’s proposing are — are — are things that we share in values. And the child tax credit’s one we know that reduces childhood poverty by a third. We did it in Minnesota. To have a federal partner in this —unbelievable, I think, in the impact that we can make BASH: You talk about — you call it the opportunity economy. You are well aware that right now many Americans are struggling. There’s a crisis of affordability. One of your campaign themes is, “We’re not going back.” But I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy specifically because their groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president. HARRIS: Well, let’s start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. People — I mean, literally we are all tracking the numbers. Hundreds of people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed. In large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices in particular for groceries are still too high. The American people know it. I know it. Which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging. What we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first-time home buyers so they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream. BASH: So you have been vice president for three and a half years. The steps that you’re talking about now, why haven’t you done them already? HARRIS: Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy, and we have done that. I’m very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3%, the work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was gonna do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it. So now, and I — as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I’ve met — I was in Nevada recently. A grandmother who showed me her receipts. And before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month she was paying hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She’s not doing that any longer. BASH: So you maintain Bidenomics is a success. HARRIS: I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost — of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000; when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%; when we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America; what we have done to improve the supply chain so we’re not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs, I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work. BASH: I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one. In — when you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal. And in 2019 you said, quote, “There is no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania. HARRIS: Sure. BASH: Do you still want to ban fracking? HARRIS: No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking. BASH: In 2019, I believe in a town hall you said — you were asked, “Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?” and you said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. So yes.” So it changed in — in that campaign? HARRIS: In 2020 I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I have not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word, and I will keep my word. BASH: What made you change that position at the time? HARRIS: Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far. The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation over t— probably a trillion dollars over the next ten years investing in a clean energy economy. What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as vice president we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana — Dana, excuse me — I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand. BASH: And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, “Oh, okay. I get it now”? HARRIS: What I have seen is that we can — we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking. BASH: Okay. Another issue, big one, is immigration. As vice president you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and — HARRIS: Northern part of Central America. BASH: The northern parts of — HARRIS: Yeah. BASH: — of — of Central America that deals with, that affects the southern border of the US. During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions? HARRIS: Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we’ve began that work. But I will say this: That Joe Biden and I and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted which we supported, which I support. And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would’ve — that contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, “Don’t put it forward.” He killed the bill: a border security bill that would’ve put 1,500 more agents on the border. And let me tell you something. The Border Patrol endorsed the bill. And I’m sure — (OVERTALK) HARRIS: — and I’m sure in large part because they knew they were working around the clock and 1,500 more agents would help them. That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl. Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and a pain they’ve experienced — BASH: So you would — so you would push that legislation again? I just want to ask ab— HARRIS: Not only push it. I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it. BASH: Just one other question about something that you said in 2019 when you first ran. There was a debate. You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized. Do you still believe that? HARRIS: I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequence. And let’s be clear, in this race, I’m the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. I’m the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws. And I would enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognize the problem. BASH: Generally speaking, how should voters look at some of the changes that you’ve made — that you explained some of here — in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you’ve learned more about the information? Is it because you’re running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you’re saying now is gonna be your policy moving forward? HARRIS: Dana, I think the — the — the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America and by extension the globe around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the passage, illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values did not change. So that is the reality of it, and four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the — the — the aspects to your point is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I’m here in Georgia, I think somebody told me 17 times since I’ve been vice president in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to — to — to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems. BASH: On that note, you had a lot of Republican speakers at the convention. Will you appoint a Republican to your Cabinet? HARRIS: Yes, I would. BASH: Any one in mind— HARRIS: Yes, I would. No, no one in particular in mind. I got — we got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not puttin’ the cart before the horse. But I would. I think — I think it’s really important. I — I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who is a Republican. BASH: Speaking of Republicans, I want to ask you about your opponent, Donald Trump. I was a little bit surprised, people might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him, met him face to face. That’s gonna change soon, but what I want to ask you about is what he said last month. He suggested that you happened to turn Black recently for political purposes, questioning a core part of your identity. HARRIS: Yeah. BASH: Any— HARRIS: Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please. (LAUGH) BASH: That’s it? HARRIS: That’s it. BASH: OK. Let’s talk about some foreign policy issues that would be on your plate if you become commander in chief. President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He’s been doing it for months and months, along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some US weapons shipments to Israel? That’s what a lot of people on the progressive left want you to do. HARRIS: Let me be very clear. I’m unequivocal and — and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself. And that’s not gonna change. But let’s take a step back. October 7, 1,200 people are massacred, many young people who are simply attending a musical festival. Women were horribly raped. As I said then, I say today, Israel had a right — has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we have got to get a deal done. We — we were in Doha. We have to get a deal done. This war must end— BASH: And in the meantime— HARRIS: And we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done. BASH: But no change in policy in terms of arms and — and so forth? HARRIS: No. I — we have to get a deal done. Dan — Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region — it — a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war but will unlock so much of what must happen next. I remain committed since I’ve been on October 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Paletin — the Palestinians have security and self-determination and — and dignity. BASH: Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you’ve described your service in the National Guard. WALZ: Yeah. BASH: You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you? WALZ: Well, first of all, I’m incredibly proud. I’ve done 24 years of wearin’ uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom, whether it’s Congress or — or the governor. My record speaks for itself, but I think people are coming to get to know me. I — I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about — about our children being shot in schools and around — around guns. So I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where — where my heart is, and again, my record has been out there for over 40 years to — to speak for itself. BASH: And the — the idea that you said that you were in war, did you misspeak, as the campaign has said? WALZ: Yeah, I said — we were talking about in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife the English teacher told me my grammar’s not always correct. But again, if it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it’s an attack on my dog. I’m not gonna do that, and the one thing I’ll never do is I’ll never demean another member’s service in any way. I never have and I never will. BASH: And just one other question, because, again, this is all new. This was not — however many days ago, this was not on either of your bingo cards, especially yours. You had to clarify that you had said that you and your wife used IVF, but it turned out you used a different kind of fertility in order to have children. And then when you ran for Congress in 2006, your campaign repeatedly made false statements about a 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. What do you say to voters who aren’t sure whether they can take you at your word? WALZ: Well, I’ve been very public. I think they can see — my students come out — former folks I’ve served with, and they — and they do, they vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make ‘em. The one thing I’ll tell you is I wished in this country we wouldn’t have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues ‘cause it’s hell, and families know this. And I — I spoke about the treatments that were available to us that — that had those beautiful children there. That’s quite a contrast in folks that are trying to — to take those rights away from us. And so I — I think people know who I am. They know that record. They’ve seen that I’ve taught thousands of students. I’ve been out there. And I — I won’t apologize for speaking passionately, whether it’s guns in schools or protection of reproductive rights. The contrast could not be clearer between what we’re running against. The vice president’s position on this has been clear. And I think most Americans get it, if you’ve been through that. I don’t think they’re cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they’re cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child. BASH: Vice President Harris, you were a very staunch defender of President Biden’s capacity to serve another four years right after the debate. You insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people? HARRIS: No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now. And I’ll tell ya it’s one of the greatest honors of my career, truly. He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and — and loyal to the American people. And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president. By contrast, the former president has none of that. And so — one, I — I — I am so proud to have served as vice president to Joe Biden. And, two, I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for president of the United States and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward, and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies. BASH: With the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years has been part of your administration. HARRIS: I’m talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on you beat down instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That’s what’s at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election. BASH: Because we haven’t had a chance to — to talk, I’m just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling outta the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away or did you ask for it? HARRIS: It was — it was a Sunday, so, here, I’ll — I’ll give you a little too much information. (LAUGHTER) BASH: Go for it. There’s no such thing, Madam Vice President. HARRIS: My family was staying with us. And — including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes and, you know, “Auntie, can I have more bacon?” “Yes, I’ll make you more bacon.” And then we were gonna sit — we were sitting down to — to do a puzzle. (LAUGH) And the phone rang. And it was Joe Biden. And — and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, “Are you sure?” And he said, “Yes.” And — and that’s how I learned about it. BASH: And what about the endorsement? Did you ask for it? HARRIS: He was very clear that he was gonna support me. BASH: So when he called to tell you, he said, “I’m pulling outta the race and I’m gonna support you?” HARRIS: Well, my first thought was not about me to be honest with you. My first thought was about him to be honest. I think history is gonna show a number of things about Joe Biden’s presidency. I think history is gonna show that in so many ways it was transformative, be it on what we have accomplished around finally investing in America’s infrastructure, investing in new economics, in new industries, what we have done to bring our allies back together, and have confidence in who we are as America, and grow that alliance, what we have done to stand true to our principles including the — the — one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I think history is gonna show not only has Joe Biden led an administration that has achieved those extraordinary successes, but the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a president, quite selfless and puts the American people first. BASH: I just have to ask you both about two standout moments, aside of course from the addresses that you both gave, but standout moments that were perhaps unexpected during the convention. You mentioned one of them, governor, a moment that you shared, that the world shared with your son, Gus. You were speaking. The camera caught him so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, “That’s my dad.” WALZ: Yeah. I — I don’t know as a father I could’ve ever imagined that. I — I’m grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket. But that moment — to understand what was really important, to — to have my son feel a sense of pride in me, that I was trying to do the right thing. And it was, you know, you try and protect your kids. You know it brings — it brings notoriety in things. But it was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I’m — I’m just — I’m grateful I got to experience it. And I’m — I’m so proud of him. I’m proud of him. I’m proud of Hope. I’m proud of Gwen. She’s a wonderful mother. And these are great kids. And I think the one thing is, talking about the era we’re in, is our politics can be better. It can be different. We can — we can show some of these things. And we can have families involved in this. And I — I hope that there was — I hope people felt that out there. And I hope they hugged their kids a little tighter, because you just never know. And life can be kinda hard. BASH: And last question, Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking. One of your grand nieces that you were just talking about was watching you accept the nomination. You didn’t explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech. But it obviously means a lot to a lot of people. And that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you? HARRIS: You know, I — listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph. And I was deeply touched by it. And, you’re right, she’s — it’s the back of her head, and her two little braids, and — and then I’m in the front of the photograph obviously speaking. It’s very humbling. It’s very humbling in many ways. BASH: Did she talk to you about it afterwards? HARRIS: Oh, she had a lot to talk (LAUGHTER) about. She had a lot. She listened to everything. And she listens to everything. BASH: She gave you her hot takes? HARRIS: Oh, yeah, definitely. Uh-huh. (LAUGH) BASH: Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. HARRIS: Okay, thank you. WALZ: Thanks for having us. HARRIS: Thank you, Dana. Thank you."
"August 29, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-29T12:00:07.703Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/harris-walz-trump-election-08-29-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Here are some takeaways from the Democratic ticket’s interview with CNN’s Dana Bash: Flip-flop on fracking: In 2019, Kamala Harris opposed fracking — a position that could have proven politically damaging in Pennsylvania, where it’s a huge employer. Now, she says, she supports it. Progressives have opposed fracking due to concerns about climate change. But under the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in the Senate and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, fracking has expanded. Harris said she had already changed her position on fracking in 2020, when she said that Biden “will not end fracking.” Appointing a Republican to the Cabinet: Asked if she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, Harris said: “Yes, I would.” “No one in particular,” she said. “We have 68 days to go in this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would.” Refusing to engage in identity politics: Last month, Donald Trump questioned Harris’ racial identity, suggesting she’d previously identified as South Asian but “happened to turn Black” for political purposes. Shaking her head, Harris said Trump’s remark is part of his “same old tired playbook.” “Next question, please,” she said. Her refusal to comment further aligns with her campaign’s strategy to avoid leaning into identity politics following Trump’s remarks. It could also indicate how Harris might handle challenges to her race and gender during her first debate with Trump next month. Biden’s call: Harris said she was having breakfast with her family on July 21 when the phone rang. “It was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do,” Harris said, in her most extensive remarks yet on how she learned the president was ending his reelection bid and endorsing her to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket. “I asked him, ‘Are you sure?’ and he said: ‘Yes,’” Harris recalled. “My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him.” Blaming Trump on border security: Trump has made attacking the Biden administration’s handling of the US-Mexico border a signature issue, but Harris said Trump bears much of the blame for the border security problems he bemoans. She pointed to his opposition to the bipartisan border security bill hashed out by a group of lawmakers. Asked if she would push that bill if she is elected president, Harris said: “I would make sure that it would come to my desk and I would sign it.” She also said she does not support decriminalizing illegally crossing the border into the United States, reversing another position she took in 2019. Walz says he owns his mistakes: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, was pressed on false claims he’s made, including in a 2018 video in which he refers to “weapons of war, that I carried in war.” Though Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, he was never in a combat zone. He said he misspoke. “My wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar’s not always correct,” he said. Walz had also said in his convention speech that he and his wife used IVF to conceive their children but has since clarified it was a different kind of fertility treatment. “I certainly own my mistakes when I make them,” he said. Read the full story. During her exclusive interview with CNN, Vice President Kamala Harris touted the Biden-Harris administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a major climate law for which she cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. Harris spoke of “what we’ve already done, creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs.” The 300,000 estimate comes from a June tally by communications group Climate Power. It was compiled by adding up the jobs promised by companies in publicly announcing 585 clean energy projects after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed through May 2024, a total of 312,900 announced jobs. Not all of these jobs have already been created. Climate Power’s topline number also doesn’t distinguish between construction jobs building new factories and the long-term jobs at those factories – jobs building batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles, among other things. In addition, E2, another clean energy group that tracks Inflation Reduction Act-related investments and jobs, has counted over 109,000 new clean energy jobs created or announced from August 2022 to May 2024 – significantly lower than the Climate Power number. A recent report from the US Department of Energy found 142,000 new clean energy jobs were created in 2023. Different entities use different methodologies when analyzing data, so it is difficult to determine an exact figure. Regardless, there’s no question there’s a huge amount of clean energy investment, and a significant number of new jobs building EVs and renewables like wind and solar are being created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2024 Energy Department report showed clean energy jobs made up more than half of the total for new energy sector jobs and grew at a rate twice as large as the overall US economy. The report also acknowledged how the sudden growth in the clean energy sector from the Inflation Reduction Act has made it difficult to track all the jobs that are being created.

In her first interview since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris touted the impact of the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill President Joe Biden signed into law in 2021, which included a temporary enhancement of the child tax credit. She referred to “when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit, so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%.” The American Rescue Plan increased the size of the child tax credit to up to $3,600 – from $2,000 – for eligible families. The law also enabled many more low-income parents to claim the credit and distributed half of the credit on a monthly basis. These changes helped send child poverty (as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau. But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. That was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began. Harris is now calling to restore the $3,600 credit as well as create a new $6,000 credit for newborns. Read more fact checks from the interview. In the first formal interview of the Harris-Walz campaign, CNN’s Dana Bash noted what Kamala Harris said while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019: “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” When Bash asked if she still wanted to ban fracking, Harris responded: “No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 – that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Thursday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior. Read more fact checks from the interview. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sat down exclusively with CNN Thursday for her first interview since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket. Just days after accepting the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Harris answered wide-ranging questions from CNN’s Dana Bash, including on her economic and border policies, attacks on her race from former President Donald Trump and the call from President Joe Biden to tell her he was withdrawing from the race. Read the full transcript of the exclusive interview Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash for her first major TV interview since becoming the Democrats’ presidential nominee. The interview was conducted in Savannah on the sidelines of a bus tour through the key Sun Belt state of Georgia and alongside her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Here are some of the key lines: What would she do on Day One in the White House? After a broad claim about focusing on the middle class, Harris made a larger point about moving on from Donald Trump. Pushed by Bash about her specific plans, Harris said she would focus on her “opportunity economy” plan to bring down the cost of everyday goods and give parents of newborns a $6,000 tax credit “to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib.” She also mentioned housing affordability. But what about people who feel groceries were less expensive and housing more affordable when Trump was president? Read more of the key lines from Harris’ interview. Former President Donald Trump reiterated his proposal to have in vitro fertilization treatments paid for by either government or insurance companies, casting himself as a defender of fertility treatments despite previous threats against the procedure from Republicans. Trump told Wisconsin voters at a town hall campaign event moderated by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who endorsed Trump earlier this week, that he plans to have the procedure paid for. The former president touted his previous comments in support of IVF following an Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that deemed frozen embryos as children, putting the procedure in legal jeopardy in the state. Gabbard began the town hall by sharing her own experience conceiving via IVF, and called it “a difficult process” and “very, very expensive.” She asked Trump to speak to those viewing the event who are “concerned that it just may not be available.” His comments, reiterating the policy he first proposed earlier today, come as his position on reproductive health care again comes under scrutiny. The Trump campaign was forced to clarify a comment he made in an NBC News interview on Thursday in which he appeared to indicate how he would vote on the Florida ballot measure to protect abortion access by saying he has not said how he vote on the issue.  Trump did not mention the Florida ballot initiative in his remarks. Although Kamala Harris rarely talks about her race and gender and how historic her win could be, the vice president’s nomination marked a moment of unprecedented representation in politics — and one viral photo from the Democratic National Convention last week captured that.  In her first sit-down interview since she began her presidential campaign, Harris told CNN she saw the photo of her grandniece Amara Ajagu staring on as she delivered her address, and added that she was “deeply touched by it.” The photo — shot by New York Times staff photographer Todd Heisler — captured what the moment could mean for many young girls who, in just a few months, could have a president that looks like them. If elected, Harris would be the first woman, the first Asian American and first Black female president. When asked by CNN’s Dana Bash if her grandniece talked to her after the speech, Harris said, “She had a lot to talk about,” followed by a laugh.  CNN’s Arit John contributed to this post.  Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz said he is grateful to have gotten to experience the emotional moment of accepting the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention earlier this month with his family. While Walz was giving his speech at the convention, the camera caught his son, Gus, tearing up and saying, “That’s my dad.” Walz also thanked his daughter, Hope, and his wife, Gwen, who were both also at the convention. He said that he hopes that the moment shows people that “our politics can be better” and he hopes other people felt that sentiment through his family. When President Joe Biden called his vice president to tell her that she was not going to seek reelection, Kamala Harris was sitting down with her nieces after eating a breakfast of bacon and pancakes to do a puzzle. She said Biden was “very clear that he was going to support me,” but Harris said in receiving that news, her first thought wasn’t about herself. Biden ended his reflection bid in July and endorsed Harris as the nominee. Biden’s decision capped off weeks of concern about the 81-year-old president’s stamina and mental capabilities and skepticism of his ability to effectively campaign against former President Donald Trump and govern the country for another four years. “I think history is going to show a number of things about Joe Biden’s presidency. I think history is going to show that in so many ways it was transformative,” Harris said, pointing to infrastructure investments and repairing relationships with allies on the world stage. The vice president said in addition to the administration’s success in the last four years, “the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a president, quite selfless and puts the American people first.” Watch the moment from the CNN interview: CNN’s Michael Williams contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris said she doesn’t have any regrets about defending President Joe Biden’s strength and ability to serve another four years as commander-in-chief. She called her time serving under Biden’s administration as “one of the greatest honors of my career, truly.” She said she is “so proud” to have served as Biden’s vice president. Donald Trump filed a petition seeking to move his New York state criminal case to a federal court in Manhattan and push off the upcoming sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records.   The petition filed Thursday asks the federal court to confirm Trump cannot be sentenced while the litigation over the removal to federal court is pending.  Trump’s sentencing is currently scheduled for September 18, although CNN has previously reported that Judge Juan Merchan is expected to rule in early September on a previously filed motion from Trump’s legal team — that the district attorney’s office didn’t oppose to delay it until after the election.  Read more. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he wishes he didn’t have to speak about the fertility issues his family experienced “because it’s hell and families know this.” In campaign speeches since joining the Democratic ticket as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Walz had characterized the issue of access to IVF treatment as “personal” to him and his family while sharing the story of his and his wife’s journey to conceiving their two children. However, Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz clarified this month in a statement that she did not use in vitro fertilization to conceive, but rather a different fertility treatment called intrauterine insemination. Intrauterine insemination, like IVF, is a common fertility procedure used by couples trying to conceive. But anti-abortion groups have pushed state officials to restrict IVF — when an egg is removed from a person’s body and combined with sperm inside a lab before being implanted. Harris campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg explained at the time that Walz’ prior use of the term IVF to describe his family’s fertility issues by saying he “talks how normal people talk. He was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.” CNN’s Aaron Pellish contributed reporting to this post. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said his “record speaks for itself” when asked about clarifications his campaign has made regarding his time serving in the Army National Guard. Asked if he misspoke in the past about his military record and saying he was “in war,” Walz said he was speaking in the context of a school shooting when talking about “the ideas of carrying these weapons of war” and remarked that his wife tells him that his grammar isn’t always correct. He then pushed back on Republican attacks on him. “If it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me or it’s an attack on my dog.” The governor, who served in the Army National Guard from 1981-2005, added that he would never “demean another member’s service.” Some background: Earlier this month, the Harris campaign acknowledged Walz “misspoke” during a 2018 campaign event when he said he handled assault weapons “in war.” After the Harris campaign shared a video of the 2018 remarks, JD Vance, who served in the Marine Corps, accused Walz of “stolen valor.” CNN’s Aaron Pellish and Dana Bash contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her support for a “two-state solution” between Israel and Gaza on Thursday in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. “I’m unequivocal and — and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself. And that’s not gonna change,” she also said. The vice president stressed that “we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out.” The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October. After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,” she said. Harris echoed then President Joe Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about the civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.” Harris emphasized then need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. But when describing the ceasefire deal in the works, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.” Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in late July, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana. In her speech last week at the Democratic National Convention, Harris called for the Palestinian people to be able to “realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination” while reiterating her support for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Read more about what Harris has said on other key topics. Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed Donald Trump’s previous comments about her identity on Thursday during an exclusive interview Thursday with CNN’s Dana Bash. Remember: Last month at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, Trump falsely claimed Harris “happened to turn Black.” When an interviewer asked him whether he agreed with Republicans on Capitol Hill who have characterized Harris as a “DEI hire.” Trump responded by questioning Harris’ heritage. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said. Initial response: That same day, speaking in Houston at a gathering of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, Harris described the former president’s comments as “the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect.” “Let me just say, the American people deserve better,” she said. Trump’s comments were reminiscent of his similar attacks on Black political rivals in the past, including the years he spent pushing the false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Harris’ mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. Harris was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically Black university, Howard University, in Washington. She is the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. CNN’s Eric Bradner and Aaron Pellish contributed reporting. The Harris campaign’s decisions to credential 200 content creators at the Democratic National Convention last week generated millions of dollars in media exposure, one official said Thursday. The campaign official told CNN that during and in the days after the convention, the creator partnerships “produced nearly 7,000 total posts from 227 creators, resulting in nearly 400 million impressions and more than $800 million worth of estimated media value.” The official pointed to a “major surge in voter registration among 18-29 year-olds as compared to the same week in the 2020 cycle.”  CNN reported Monday that Vote.org registered more than 328,000 Americans since Vice President Kamala Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. 79% of those new registrations were 18 to 34 years old, and 19% were 18 years old. That engagement represented a recognition from the Harris campaign that reaching voters in the countdown to Election Day will require Democrats to go beyond a traditional media strategy and into new spaces.  One piece of the campaign’s strategy is about creating their own content, including on the popular @KamalaHQ account across platforms. The other — and arguably more significant — piece of that is to harness the power of influencers. Harris herself harnessed that strategy, participating in three TikTok interviews last week. Her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, attended a meet and greet with 15 creators. There was also an effort to engage the campaign’s top surrogates with the influencer population in Chicago last week. Embracing her vow to act as a president for “all Americans,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a CNN exclusive sit-down interview Thursday that with she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if elected, though said she did not have a particular name in mind. Read more about what Harris said in her first joint interview with her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz. Vice President Kamala Harris attacked former President Donald Trump for killing a bipartisan deal earlier this year, while side stepping a question on why the Biden-Harris administration didn’t act sooner as the border continues to be a key campaign issue. In her first sit-down interview since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash why the Biden administration waited more than three years to implement sweeping asylum instructions. Harris in response deflected and blamed former President Donald Trump for tanking a bipartisan border bill earlier this year.  CNN reported in February that Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal that was crafted in part by conservative Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma after pressure from Trump, who attacked the deal as too weak.  The bill failed in the Senate again in May due to GOP opposition, along with loss of support from some Democrats.  Harris later affirmed that she commits to pushing the legislation again, adding that she “will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it.” Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record and outlined her policies. Here’s a look at what Trump has proposed on the topic: Here’s a look at where Harris stands on the topic: Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday offered her most expansive explanation to date on why she’s changed some of her positions on fracking and immigration, telling CNN’s Dana Bash her values haven’t shifted but that her time as vice president provided new perspective on some of the country’s most pressing issues. Pressed by Bash on her reversals on fracking and decriminalizing illegal border crossings, Harris sought to explain why her positions had changed. “How should voters look at some of the changes that you’ve made?” Bash asked Harris. “Is it because you have more experience now and you’ve learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you’re saying now is going to be your policy moving forward?” Harris said despite the shifts in position, her values had not changed. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked if she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,” Harris said at the time. By the time she had become Joe Biden’s running mate, she had moved away from that stance. In all, the joint interview in Savannah with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz – their first since becoming the Democratic presidential ticket – provided one of the clearest looks into Harris’ positions and her plans for the presidency. Read more about Harris’ comments in the interview here. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the progress she and President Joe Biden made on the economy as Covid-19 surged across the nation during her first interview with a major media outlet since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris did acknowledge however that “prices, in particular for groceries, are still too high.” She mentioned her proposal for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries, as well as a plan promising to provide up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homeowners. Harris said she has not yet executed these plans during her time in the White House because “we had to recover as an economy” from Trump’s time in office. CNN’s Tami Luhby and Way Mullery contributed reporting. The economy is coming up in CNN’s interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz. High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a period of steep inflation. Many voters give President Joe Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their frustration. What’s in Harris’ tax and economic plan What’s in Donald Trump’s tax and economic plan: Read more about the candidates’ policy views.  On her first day in office if elected president, Vice President Kamala Harris said she would start implementing several of her policy proposals to “support and strengthen the middle class.” That includes her plan for an “opportunity economy,” something Harris has been talking about on the campaign trail while making her pitch to Americans — many who say the economy and the prices of everyday items are a top priority in this election. As part of her economic agenda, Harris told CNN in an exclusive joint interview from Georgia with Gov. Tim Walz that she would invest in small businesses and in “the American family” by making housing more affordable and expanding the child tax credit. She is also calling for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries — something she said would bring down the price of goods. Harris attacked her opponent, Donald Trump, saying the former president has been “pushing an agenda” that is “diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as America.” “When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward,” she said. Walz said he was excited by the agenda proposed by Harris and that both candidates share similar values. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are now appearing on CNN in their first joint interview since becoming the Democratic presidential and vice presidential nominees. In clips released earlier today, Harris offered her most expansive explanation to date on why she’s changed some of her positions on key issues and outlined one of the clearest looks into her plans for the presidency. Watch the interview in the video player above the page. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will appear on CNN at 9 p.m. ET for their first joint interview since becoming the Democratic presidential ticket. Harris announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president after President Joe Biden withdrew from the ticket and endorsed her on July 21. She is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California’s Bay Area and served as California attorney general and the San Francisco district attorney. As a US senator, Harris was known for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings with Trump administration officials and nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Like Biden, she intends to contrast her vision for America with Trump’s. She said the path forward will focus on lifting up working and middle-class Americans, enabling them to join unions, retire with dignity, live without the fear of gun violence and obtain affordable health care. Read more about what she has said on key issues in her campaign. Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, is in his second term as Minnesota governor and chairs the Democratic Governors Association. A onetime high school teacher and football coach who served in the Army National Guard, Walz later spent 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district in Southern Minnesota. Walz had been an outspoken defender of Joe Biden, but when the president dropped out, he endorsed Harris and has since emerged as a reliable, energetic and cutting advocate for the campaign. Read more about the 2024 presidential candidates here. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday told Michigan voters he would be the “American energy president,” slamming Vice President Kamala Harris on economic issues and vowing to restore the American auto industry in the key “Blue Wall” industrial state. He went on to bash Harris for casting tie-breaking Senate votes to pass the Biden administration’s legislative agenda, which Trump and other Republicans blame for causing inflation. Potterville is not far from where General Motors has received a $500 million federal grant from the Biden-Harris administration funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Harris cast the vote to pass, in order to convert an assembly plant to an electric vehicle production facility. On electric vehicles: Trump said he’s a “big fan of electric cars,” despite consistently railing against Biden-Harris administration policies to increase the number of electric vehicles in the country. “They are limited. They don’t go far. They’re very expensive and they’re going to all be made in China because they have the material,” he said of EVs, saying he wants to build gas-powered cars alongside electric vehicles and hybrids. He also accused Harris and Democrats of wanting “immediately all electric cars.” The Harris campaign has refuted Trump’s repeated claim she supports a “mandate” for all electric vehicles, saying instead that the administration’s goal is to have EVs comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has approved a request from the Department of Homeland Security to assist the Secret Service with “additional military support capabilities” to protect major presidential and vice presidential candidates, according to a Defense Department spokesperson. The Secret Service said later on Thursday that the Defense Department will specifically be providing candidates with “logistics, transportation, and communications, through the 2024 campaign season.” Spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN said the additional help is part of the agency’s beefed-up security operations following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in July — for which the Secret Service has faced intense bipartisan scrutiny. Additionally, Singh said the Defense Department will continue supporting security for the candidates through the election, and it will keep providing security support for the future president-elect and vice president-elect through the inauguration. This post has been updated with comments from the Secret Service. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is continuing to needle former President Donald Trump’s campaign on the topic of muted vs unmuted microphones at the upcoming presidential debate hosted by ABC News.  CNN has previously reported that ABC intends to mute Trump and Kamala’s microphones while their opponent speaks during the debate, according to a copy of the formal rules obtained by CNN. Fulks’ comments mirror those made earlier by the Harris campaign’s senior adviser Brian Fallon, who posted on X that Trump’s “handlers don’t trust him to spar live with VP Harris.”   During an event in Virginia on Monday, Trump said of the microphones, “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.”  But in a post on his Truth Social platform the next day, Trump added, “The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden.” ABC’s rules, which were first shared with the campaigns last week, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke, a rule the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change in recent days.  Vice President Kamala Harris offered a stark warning about an emboldened former President Donald Trump to a south Georgia crowd Thursday, suggesting that a Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity could have profound implications for a second Trump term.  “The stakes in 2024 are even higher. Because consider that the United States Supreme Court recently just basically told the former president that going forward, he will be effectively immune — no matter what he does in the White House.” The Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president. The vice president told the crowd to “imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails,” warning that he would “end the independence of the Department of Justice” and use his office to seek vengeance against political foes. Harris reiterated her campaign’s long-held assertion that it will be a very close race in November, and thanked them in advance for their efforts in the final 68 days before the election. President Joe Biden won the Peach State by fewer than 12,000 votes in the 2020 election, and the Harris campaign is in the conservative south Georgia region to cut margins with Trump.   Former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for conducting her CNN interview today alongside her running mate Tim Walz. The Trump campaign previously slammed Harris for not participating in an interview since becoming the democratic nominee.  “As president, you have to be able to do — you’re dealing with the toughest, smartest, most ruthless people in the world. If you can’t do an interview, we got the wrong person,” Trump previously said. More context: Other than Fox News, Trump last took questions from mainstream reporters at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on July 31, although he has also done brief interviews with local and national reporters and given lengthy press conferences. Trump’s other interviews have generally been with friendly online outlets and podcasts. The post was updated with background on Trump’s interviews with the mainstream media. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday that the Harris campaign believes it will flip North Carolina for Democrats in November. He told volunteers in Raleigh that the state is “on the map” and that Democrats’ success in North Carolina could block several paths to victory for former President Donald Trump. Walz also hinted at Democrats’ strategy in the state, focusing on reducing the margins of defeat in traditionally Republican areas of the state. Some context: In 2020, Trump beat President Joe Biden by about 74,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast in North Carolina. The margin of victory of 1.3 points – less than half his spread four years earlier – was the narrowest of any state Trump won. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday defended his visit to Arlington National Cemetery earlier in the week and denied using images from the visit for politics. Trump told a crowd at a steel distributor in Potterville, Michigan, that the families of fallen service members, including some of the 13 Americans killed in Afghanistan, had asked him to visit the cemetery on Monday, the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate attack. “While we were there, they said, could you take pictures over the grave of my son, my sister, my brother? Would you take pictures with us, sir?” Trump claimed, adding, “Absolutely, I did.” Trump said he read later that night that he had been “using the site to politic,” claiming “this all comes out of Washington.” “I go there, they ask me to have a picture, and they say I was campaigning. I don’t need … the one thing I get is plenty of publicity. I don’t need that. I don’t need the publicity,” he said. Some background: The US Army has issued a stark rebuke of Trump’s campaign over the cemetery visit, saying in a statement that his team had been “made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity at the site before it released photos and video of Trump’s stop there, with audio of him criticizing the Biden administration over its Afghanistan withdrawal. It also said a cemetery employee was “abruptly pushed aside” while trying to ensure the political activity rules were followed. Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, according to a statement from the cemetery. Some veterans groups and the family of one soldier whose grave was shown in the Trump clips have criticized the campaign’s handling of the visit. Former President Donald Trump said that as president he would implement a policy that would pay for in vitro fertilization treatments, without specifying how the treatments would be paid for. “Because we want more babies, to put it very nicely. And for this same reason, we will also allow new parents to deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes,” he said. Trump acknowledged that “IVF treatments are expensive. It’s very hard for many people to do it,” while adding that he has “been in favor of IVF right from the beginning.” More context: The new proposal comes as Democrats have sought to use threats to IVF to paint Republicans, including Trump, as seeking to restrict access to reproductive health care. Earlier this year, Trump said he supports women having access to IVF following an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that declared frozen embryos as children. In March, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed a law protecting IVF access in the state following the court’s decision.   Also in his remarks, Trump repeated his belief that abortion policies should be decided by states and that he believes in exceptions in cases of rape and incest and when the life of the mother is under threat. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are locked in a close race nationwide with no clear leader, according to a new poll from The Wall Street Journal. The poll is the second major national poll post-Democratic National Convention to show no clear leader in the race.   Overall, the survey finds Harris at 48% to Trump’s 47% in a head-to-head matchup among registered voters, with a similar 47% to 45% result when independent and third-party candidates are included in the question. Both margins fall within the survey’s 2.5 point margin of sampling error. Democrats are more enthusiastic about their candidate now, with 90% saying they are compared to the 82% of Republicans who say they are enthusiastic. That mirrors findings in a Quinnipiac poll released earlier today, as well as a Gallup survey which found Democratic enthusiasm about voting just one point off its record high dating back to 2000. The Journal poll finds Harris holding an even favorability rating, with 49% having a favorable view of her and 49% an unfavorable one — an improvement from a July Wall Street Journal poll that found views on Harris tilting negative (46% favorable to 52% unfavorable in the July 23-25 poll). In the new poll, Trump’s favorability rating tilts negative, 45% favorable to 53% unfavorable. It’s a touch worse than the 47% favorable to 50% unfavorable rating the Journal measured in July. The survey also found that 84% of voters felt they “know enough about Kamala Harris’s career and policy positions to have a firm opinion of her,” while 15% said they need to know more. Just over half (52%) of voters say they think Harris will largely continue the approach and policies of the Biden administration, while 41% say they think she will bring fresh ideas and new leadership to the White House.  Asked about Trump’s “style and approach,” 56% say it “gets in the way of bringing the right kind of change,” while 37% say it is necessary to bring the right kind of change. The poll was conducted August 24 -28 by phone and online among 1,500 registered voters nationwide. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. Special counsel Jack Smith has resurrected the election interference case against Donald Trump, but prosecutors are being more methodical than they were last year, limiting what will happen before Election Day, people with insight into the case tell CNN. Attorney General Merrick Garland and other top Justice Department officials were briefed on the special counsel office’s decision to rewrite the allegations against the former president this week, the sources said. Notably, the special counsel won’t ask for a so-called mini-trial to take place quickly, one of the sources said. If it were to happen, that could feature witnesses such as former Vice President Mike Pence or Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, others familiar with the case say. Called evidentiary hearings, those types of proceedings may be needed as prosecutors attempt to convince courts that some parts of Trump’s behavior after the election weren’t part of his duties as president. That’s a key issue given that the Supreme Court ruled last month that presidents enjoy immunity for official actions in office and that official work of the presidency can’t be used as evidence at trial. The ruling prompted prosecutors to spend eight weeks closely assessing evidence they believed they could still use before a jury and rewriting parts of the allegations line by line, people familiar with the effort told CNN. The superseding indictment excluded interactions Trump had with officials in his administration after the election. The careful approach also gives federal district court Judge Tanya Chutkan a new framework for the case that preserves the original counts against Trump. Chutkan will have the final say on timing. Read more President Joe Biden will travel to the battleground state of Michigan next week, the White House said. It will be the president’s third battleground state visited next week after trips to both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin earlier in the week. As the White House has previously announced, President Biden will travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Labor Day alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and will be in Wisconsin next Thursday. Ohio Sen. JD Vance said he thinks PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel should “get off the sidelines” and bolster his running mate Donald Trump’s campaign in an interview with the Financial Times published Thursday. Vance, who briefly worked for the tech billionaire’s Silicon Valley investment firm before entering politics, said he’s been working on “persuading” Thiel, but he is “exhausted by politics a little bit.” “He is fundamentally a conservative guy, and I think that he needs to get off the sidelines and support the ticket,” Vance added. Some context: The plea to Thiel comes as Trump’s campaign faces a financial disadvantage. Harris taking over the top of the Democratic ticket has triggered a spike in fundraising for Democrats. As of July 31, her campaign reported over $219 million in cash on hand, dwarfing the Trump campaign’s $151 million cash on hand. Vance on big tech: Vance also told the Financial Times he believes “a lot” of large tech companies should be broken up, identifying Alphabet, the parent company of Google, as one example. “I think Google ought to be broken up,” he said. “I think it’s way too big, way too powerful, and we’ll see how things look in 2025.” Vice President Kamala Harris made a brief stop Thursday at a downtown Savannah restaurant, where her campaign says there was a volunteer appreciation event. At one point, the vice president was handed someone’s phone and said, “I’m so proud of you” and “We have 68 days to go.” “All my friends are voting for you,” the person on the other end of the phone responded. It’s vice president’s second stop to a local business on Thursday afternoon in the Georgia city, following her CNN interview alongside running mate Gov. Tim Walz. She is next expected to travel to the Enmarket Arena in Savannah for a campaign rally before returning to Washington, DC, this evening.   Meanwhile, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, visited a campaign field office in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday to greet volunteers and thank them for their support, a campaign official told CNN. Walz was joined by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. Walz brought campaign volunteers cookies that were purchased from Cookie Queen Savannah during the bus tour with Harris, the campaign said. He is not expected to attend the Savannah rally tonight. This post has been updated with details about Tim Walz’s campaign activities today. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday stopped by Dottie’s Market, a Black-owned business in Savannah, Georgia, where she announced plans to unveil a tax credit proposal next week for startup business ventures. Harris’ stop was part of a bus tour through the southern part of the state. The vice president was greeted by loud cheers upon entering. She spoke with employees and shoppers as she toured the local market. Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson joined Harris on the visit. Harris is expected to make one more stop on her bus tour before heading to a rally tonight at Enmarket Arena in Savannah. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance defended his comments telling Vice President Kamala Harris to “go to hell,” saying it’s “a colloquial phrase” in a pull-aside interview with the Washington Post on Thursday.  Vance said Harris “can go to hell” on Wednesday at a campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania, while slamming her lack of accountability during the Afghanistan withdrawal and defending former President Donald Trump after a reported altercation with campaign staff and an Arlington National Cemetery official.  While Harris has not directly attacked Trump for his visit to the cemetery, as Vance claimed, her campaign communications director called the incident “pretty sad” and said it’s what they’ve “come to expect from Donald Trump and his team.” According to the Post, Vance said he didn’t believe the Trump campaign should apologize to the cemetery official but added that he wanted to have the full details before commenting directly.  Embracing her vow to act as a president for “all Americans,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a CNN exclusive sit-down interview Thursday that with she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if elected, though said she did not have a particular name in mind.

She also brushed off her rival’s questioning of her racial identity, dismissing Donald Trump’s suggestion she “happened to turn Black” as the “same old, tired playbook.” Pressed by Bash on her reversals on fracking and decriminalizing illegal border crossings, Harris sought to explain why her positions had changed. In all, the joint interview in Savannah with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz – their first since becoming the Democratic presidential ticket – provided one of the clearest looks into Harris’ positions and her plans for the presidency. Harris said despite the shifts in position, her values had not changed. “I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,” she said. “You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed – and I have worked on it – that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.” During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked if she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,” Harris said at the time.

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Chris LaCivita posted video of the former president’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery, “hoping to trigger the hacks at @SecArmy” and tagging the account of the Secretary of US Army Christine Wormuth on X. The post comes hours after the US Army released a statement detailing events surrounding an incident between a cemetery employee and the Trump campaign during the former president’s visit on Monday. The stark rebuke said a cemetery employee was “abruptly pushed aside” during the visit. The Army’s account disputed one from the Trump campaign that claimed they were allowed to film in Section 60 of the cemetery, which is an area largely reserved for the graves of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and generally off limits to campaign media by federal law. The video LaCivita posted shows Trump at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier — where filming was allowed — not Section 60.  Veterans criticize visit: Allison Jaslow, the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said there are “plenty of places appropriate for politics — Arlington is not one of them.” In a post on X, VoteVets, a progressive organization that advocates for issues relating to US troops and veterans, said Trump was using the cemetery “for political purposes.” “This whole episode is sickening and (an) affront to all those hundreds of thousands of families who never agreed to allow their deceased loved ones to be dragged into politics,” the post said. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh also said Thursday that the Defense Department stands by the Army’s statement. CNN’s Haley Britzky and Brian Todd contributed reporting to this post. It wasn’t just the graves of those killed in the Kabul airport attack that were featured in photos and videos from former President Donald Trump’s recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery. In at least one photo posted online, the grave of an Army Special Forces soldier who died by suicide is also featured. That soldier’s family has since said they did not give the campaign permission to photograph the plot. The grave of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a Silver Star recipient, sits next to that of Marine Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover, who was killed in the Abbey Gate bombing. A statement from Marckesano’s sister on behalf of their family said that, according to a conversation with cemetery officials, the Trump campaign “did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit to SSGT Hoover’s grave site in Section 60” — the area of the sacred grounds where the photos were taken. The statement added that the Marckesanos support the families of the 13 service members who died in Kabul “in their quest for answers and accountability regarding the Afghanistan withdrawal and the tragedy at Abbey Gate.” Some background: The controversy surrounding Trump’s visit has primarily centered on the social media content his campaign produced at the sacred grounds. The US Army issued a stark rebuke over the incident, saying that participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity at the cemetery, and “abruptly pushed aside” an employee of the cemetery. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will sit with CNN for their first joint interview on Thursday as Democrats work to broaden their base’s excitement from last week’s Democratic National Convention.  The interview, conducted by CNN’s chief political correspondent and anchor Dana Bash, will air at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday. It occurs as the candidates embark on a bus tour through the battleground state of Georgia and marks the first time Harris has sat with a journalist for an in-depth, on-the-record conversation since President Joe Biden dropped his bid for a second term and endorsed her on July 21. The 37 days since her candidacy began have generated a swell of enthusiasm and momentum for Harris, including at last week’s convention in Chicago. But her lack of a formal news conference or interview has generated criticism from her Republican rivals. Thursday’s interview fulfills a vow she made earlier in August to schedule a sit-down before the end of the month. What to watch for: The interview will present Harris with the first chance to elucidate her position on various domestic and foreign issues during a campaign that has so far been heavy on vibes but light on concrete policy. She will also have a chance – if she chooses – to explain how her positions might differ from Biden. Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance will attend a fundraiser in Dade City, Florida, tonight, according to a source familiar with the plans.   The Trump 47 Committee and Florida’s Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson are hosting the event, which is labeled as a “roundtable discussion.” It is $50,000 per person for the roundtable and a photo opportunity.  The fundraiser was first reported on by The New York Times. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ruled on several orders on Thursday that will lock in this November’s presidential ballot in the Peach State.   The six candidates for president will be listed in this order on Georgia’s ballot, according to Raffensperger’s office: Raffensperger denied requests by multiple petitioners who were trying to have former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. included on Georgia’s ballot. The secretary of state’s orders on Thursday uphold a judge’s previous recommendation that Kennedy is not given a spot as part of Georgia’s presidential ballot.   In a survey conducted entirely after the Democratic National Convention, Quinnipiac University’s poll finds Vice President Kamala Harris at 49% among likely voters nationwide, with former President Donald Trump at 47% — a result within the poll’s margin of sampling error, suggesting no clear leader in the race. The survey is the first from Quinnipiac that reports the results among likely voters, and is not directly comparable to past polling from the school. Nationally, the poll finds Harris and Trump tied at 45% each among political independents. There is a wide gender gap in the results, with women splitting 58% to 37% in Harris’ favor, while men break the other direction, 57% Trump to 39% Harris. Harris holds advantages among younger voters (52% to 39% among those age 18-34) and Black voters (75% to 20%), but those leads are narrower than President Joe Biden’s performance nationally among 2020 voters, according to exit polls. Trump and Harris are also tied among Hispanic voters in the poll, with 48% support for each of them. Here are some other takeaways: The poll was conducted August 23-27 by phone among a random national sample of 1,611 likely voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance was booed at multiple points during his remarks Thursday at a firefighters union convention in Boston, but the Ohio senator used his personal story and his own prior skepticism of former President Donald Trump to make his pitch to the organization. Without lobbing any attacks, Vance mentioned how Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz spoke to the union on Wednesday.  Asking the room what supporting Democrats has gotten them over the years, Vance told them “to ignore the campaign rhetoric and look at the record,” also sharing his own shift of opinion on Trump.  Explaining why he changed his mind, Vance said it was “in big part” due to a firefighter friend of his from Dayton, Ohio, who tried to convince him to support Trump in 2016.  ABC News intends to mute the microphones of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris while their opponent speaks during an upcoming presidential debate, according to a copy of the formal rules obtained by CNN — but the Harris campaign is continuing to push back on the final sticking point. While the Trump campaign has accepted the rules governing the September 10 matchup, Harris’ campaign said it remains in ongoing discussions with the network about the microphone issue. “Our latest understanding is that even though Trump said Monday he would be fine with an unmuted mic, his handlers don’t trust him to spar live with VP Harris and are asking ABC to ignore Trump’s comments and keep the mics muted or else they will back out of the debate for a third time,” Harris campaign senior advisor Brian Fallon said in a post on X. “We have been asked to accede to Trump’s handlers’ wishes on this point for the sake of preserving the debate. We find the Trump’s team’s stance to be weak, and remain in discussions with ABC on the final rules.” Fallon added that the rules sent to the campaigns were “a draft” that both sides must still reach an agreement on.  “We have not done so because we think both candidates have expressed a clear desire to have hot mics,” he said. “Not clear why Trump staff is overruling their principal, who should be capable of making up his own mind.” ABC News declined to comment. Read more about the debate rules here Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will remain on the ballot in battleground North Carolina, despite suspending his campaign last week. The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted 3-2, along party lines, in an emergency meeting on Thursday to deny a request from the We The People Party to remove its presidential candidates, Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan, from the ballot. North Carolina begins sending out absentee-by-mail ballots next Friday. The election board’s executive director, Karen Brinson Bell, said during the emergency meeting that around 1.7 million ballots had already been printed or were in the process of being printed.  Democrats on the board argued that removing Kennedy from the ballot and starting over at this point would be “impractical” — and likely quite costly for counties. Brinson Bell noted that it could take vendors at least 12 days to proof and reprint ballots, with additional time required to prepare the absentee packets, pushing past the state’s September 6 deadline to begin sending ballots to voters. The two Republicans, who voted in favor of granting the request to remove Kennedy, said they believed there was an exception that allows the board to delay that deadline. Remember: It’s unclear how RFK Jr. dropping out will impact former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris at the polls, but Trump’s campaign is hoping that the independent dropping off ballots in key states and endorsing him will give him a boost in November. Donald Trump’s campaign is co-managed by the man who engineered the “swift boating” of John Kerry in 2004, so it should come as no surprise that 20 years later, military service and treatment of veterans are turning into uncomfortable political issues. Trump pivoted from a visit to Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week to an attack on President Joe Biden’s Afghanistan policy — a turn that apparently followed a dustup with an official at the cemetery over the campaign’s attempt to use cameras in Section 60, an area where American troops who were killed in recent wars are buried. The story was first reported by NPR, but Trump’s campaign, the cemetery and the US Army have since issued statements. A cemetery official who made a report about the incident has decided not to press any charges, and the Army considers the matter closed. An earlier statement from the cemetery also made clear that federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries. Trump’s campaign noted that he was invited into Section 60 by Gold Star families. Not the first military incident for Trump: It’s notable that the summer is ending with controversy over Trump’s decision to visit Section 60 as a candidate, since the summer began with Biden’s look back at criticism of Trump’s decision as president not to visit a US military cemetery in France in 2018 and comments he reportedly made during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery’s Section 60 in 2017. At the CNN presidential debate in June that was the beginning of the end of Biden’s presidential campaign, the president recalled a 2020 report in The Atlantic that Trump refused to visit a cemetery near Paris honoring Americans who died in World War I because they were “losers.” Trump denied using that term, which came from a recounting of the incident by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff. Kelly later confirmed elements of the Atlantic story to CNN’s Jake Tapper and also discussed a Memorial Day ceremony in 2017 when the two were in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery. “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” Trump said at the time, according to Kelly’s recollection, which Trump denies. Read more analysis about military-related controversies this election cycle. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cast former President Donald Trump as a threat to her state’s economy, while saying Vice President Kamala Harris understands — and can alleviate — the plight of everyday Americans. Ahead of a Trump campaign event in the key battleground state today, she said she wondered: “Is he even gonna talk about the economy?” She slammed Trump for shipping Michigan jobs, including auto industry jobs, overseas and taking anti-union stances while he was president. Whitmer argued that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are from middle-class families and can relate to their issues. Trump’s economy-focused event this afternoon is in Eaton County, where he narrowly defeated President Joe Biden by less than one percentage point. Whitmer won the county when she was elected in 2018 and again in 2022 by a wider margin. Whitmer linked Trump to Project 2025, the conservative policy playbook he has tried to distance himself from, though it was written by several people linked to him. She said Trump’s “Project 2025 agenda would make life more expensive, give him unchecked access to whatever he wants at the expense of everyday Americans.” Ohio Sen. JD Vance previewed his message to a firefighters’ union convention in Boston on Thursday, pledging to work to improve wages of both union and non-union members while declining to say whether he supports right to work laws nationally or at the state level. During a Wednesday campaign event in De Pere, Wisconsin, Vance said he plans to tell workers at the International Association of Fire Fighters conference he wants workers to “have safe jobs” and livable wages “without being destroyed by our public leadership.” When asked by CNN whether he would support a bill similar to the House Republican bill proposed last year to implement a national right-to-work law, Vance noted he did not support the bill and indicated he would want states to implement their own laws individually if they choose. When asked by CNN if he supports Wisconsin’s right-to-work law or if he supports Michigan’s decision to repeal its right-to-work law last year, Vance said states should make their own decisions on the issue. Vice President Kamala Harris is often described by advisers and allies as someone who prepares for most anything extensively and intensely — and that’s also true with how she’s approaching Thursday’s interview with CNN.   Typically Harris has multiple prep sessions over the course of several days with a range of staff from communications to policy to other relevant teams based on the subject matter, according to a former Harris adviser.  Preparation pays off: Last October, Harris did a sitdown interview with Bill Whitaker on “60 Minutes” and discussed issues, including foreign policy. Some aides came away pleased with the interview, seeing it as a good way to spotlight her leadership domestically and on the world stage.  More recently, her defense of President Joe Biden — who was facing criticism for his poor debate performance — during a CNN interview was picked up by surrogates and allies of the president and became a frequent talking point as his team came under fire.  Lessons learned from past interviews: It’s a stark difference from the early months of the Biden administration, when in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in June 2021, Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn’t yet visited the US-Mexico border. That interview continues to dog the vice president in Republican attack ads. Harris campaign officials hope to put that to rest Thursday.  The US Army issued a stark rebuke of the campaign staff of former President Donald Trump over the incident that happened at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. In a statement released on Thursday, the US Army said that participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity at the cemetery, and “abruptly pushed aside” an employee of the cemetery.  The spokesperson noted in the statement the “incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation’s fallen deserve.” The Army spokesperson added, while the incident was reported to the police department at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, the employee in question “decided not to press charges” so the Army “considers this matter closed.” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan touted Vice President Kamala Harris’ experience in shaping the administration’s China policy following engagements with top Chinese leadership this week, noting that he shared his views of the new Democratic nominee directly with the Chinese. This comes as the Biden administration continues intensive diplomatic efforts with China amid global uncertainty and a tense relationship between the two superpowers. Sullivan also noted that Harris shares Biden’s views on the US-China relationship and the need to “responsibly” manage it. With less than 70 days until the election, countries across the globe are grappling with what a potential Harris, or Trump, administration would look like. Remember: Harris briefly met Xi Jinping on the sidelines of APEC in 2022 but has never visited the country. Her running mate Tim Walz has been to China roughly 30 times beginning when he traveled there as a young man to teach English.  “She has had the opportunity to engage herself with President Xi, and with Premier Li. So she is known to both of the top leaders in China,” Sullivan noted.  After special counsel Jack Smith’s superseding indictment against Donald Trump, the former president’s team is holding a “legal messaging” call this morning for surrogates and allies, a source familiar told CNN. The call is led by legal adviser Boris Epshteyn and Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and John Lauro, the source said. The call comes as the campaign is trying to align surrogates and Trump allies on messaging as they have struggled to break through Vice President Kamala Harris’ momentum. Trump’s team has also been soliciting donations after the indictment. More on the indictment: Smith on Tuesday filed a reworked indictment in the federal election interference case against Trump. Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges that they initially brought against the former president.  However, the newly retooled indictment has carved out some of Trump’s alleged conduct, including allegations about the attempts to use the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud. Prosecutors are working to try to comply with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. CNN’s Brian Rokus contributed to this report. Here’s a brief overview of what to expect from today’s 2024 campaign schedule. Vice President Kamala Harris: The Democratic presidential nominee and her running mate, Tim Walz, will sit down in Savannah, Georgia, for an interview with CNN, which will air at 9 p.m. ET. Then she continues her series of campaign bus tour stops in South Georgia. Harris will deliver remarks at a campaign event in Savannah at 5:30 p.m. ET. Then, she returns to Washington, DC. Former President Donald Trump: Trump will deliver remarks at 3 p.m. ET on the economy, inflation, and manufacturing in Potterville, Michigan. The former president will then hold a town hall moderated by former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 7 p.m. ET in La Crosse, Wisconsin.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz: After his joint sit-down interview with CNN, the Minnesota governor will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a political event. Later, Walz will deliver remarks at a campaign reception. Ohio Sen. JD Vance: Trump’s running mate will deliver remarks at 12:30 p.m. ET at the International Association of Fire Fighters Convention in Boston, Massachusetts — a day after his Democratic opponent spoke to the key labor union. Dough Emhoff: The second gentleman will meet with voters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 11:15 a.m. ET and talk about Walz and Harris’ plans to create an Opportunity Economy. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will join him. Later, Emhoff will travel to Idaho and deliver remarks at a campaign reception in Ketchum. New polls in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina from Fox News show no clear leader in any of these critical swing states. Among registered voters, the surveys find Vice President Kamala Harris at 50% to former President Donald Trump’s 49% in Arizona in a head-to-head matchup, Harris at 50% to Trump’s 48% in both Georgia and Nevada, and Trump at 50% to Harris’s 49% in North Carolina. Each state poll has an error margin of plus or minus three points, meaning the poll shows no clear leader in any of these races. Keep in mind: In each state, Harris has improved on President Joe Biden’s showing against Trump overall and in terms of being trusted to handle key issues, when compared to previous Fox polling. But she still lags behind Trump across all four states by margins between six and nine points on being trusted to handle the economy. The economy is the top issue in the election for a plurality in each state. The picture is more mixed when voters are asked which candidate would do a better job at “fighting for people like you” or “bringing needed change.” Harris has the edge on fighting for people like you in Nevada (51% Harris to 46% Trump), Georgia (50% Harris to 46% Trump) and Arizona (51% Harris to 47% Trump), while the two are about even on that score in North Carolina (49% Harris to 48% Trump). And the two are near even in each state on who would better bring needed change (Harris 50% to Trump 47% in both Georgia and Nevada, Harris 50% to Trump 48% in Arizona, and Trump 49% to Harris 48% in North Carolina).  In both Arizona and Nevada, the polls find Democratic Senate candidates leading Republicans: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen tops Republican Sam Brown in Nevada 55% to 41%, and Democrat Ruben Gallego tops Republican Kari Lake in Arizona 56% to 41%.  The surveys were conducted from August 23 through 26 by telephone and online among roughly 1,000 voters in each state. Vice President Kamala Harris will continue her bus tour through south Georgia today with two stops at local small businesses, according to her campaign. Harris is expected to thank volunteers in Chatham County, which lies on Georgia’s shared border with South Carolina, has a large African American base in Savannah, and voted Democratic in 2020. Harris will be joined by Rep. Nikema Williams, who also joined the two tour stops yesterday at a local high school and barbeque restaurant. Before continuing the tour, Harris and Gov. Tim Walz will tape an exclusive joint interview conducted by CNN’s chief political correspondent and anchor Dana Bash, which will air at 9 p.m. ET. Following the taping, Walz is not expected to participate in the two stops on the bus tour. Instead, the Minnesota governor will depart for North Carolina for a local political event and campaign reception. Harris will wrap her day on the campaign trail with a rally at the Enmarket Arena, where she is expected to speak at 5:15p.m ET.  Additional speakers at the rally include State Sen. Derek Mallow, State Rep. Edna Jackson and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson. Harris will be introduced by a first-time voter, Katelyn Green, the student government president at Savannah State University — the oldest HBCU in the state. The engagement comes as the campaign launched a new initiative aimed at mobilizing young voters at campuses across key battleground states, focusing on public colleges and minority-serving institutions.  Vice President Kamala Harris faces the next test in her presidential bid today with her first unscripted interview with a major media outlet since becoming the Democratic nominee. Harris will be hoping to extend the momentum she’s conjured at the start of her campaign – and to avoid the types of unforced errors that plagued her first presidential bid in 2019, as well as her early days as vice president. It’s also a chance for the newly anointed candidate to heighten a contrast with Republican nominee Donald Trump, to connect with undecided voters and to highlight her credentials to lead in the Oval Office at a tense time for the United States at home and abroad. Harris will appear alongside her vice presidential pick, Tim Walz, in a CNN primetime special airing from Georgia, where she is on a bus tour designed to put a swing state the GOP thought it was close to securing in November back on the board. The interview has taken on elevated significance because of the compressed race Harris is running after she became her party’s candidate and the way it mushroomed into an issue between the feuding campaigns. Major television interviews like today’s have also played an outsized role – President Joe Biden agreed to several in an attempt to arrest his slide but only exacerbated concerns about his age. By not scheduling a major interview before now, Harris opened herself to complaints by Trump and some non-partisan observers that she is trying to dodge scrutiny. This raised the stakes for any potential gaffes, which would be seized upon by the Trump campaign. However, a strong performance would be another challenge for Trump. Read the full analysis. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said the reported altercation at Arlington National Cemetery, which he referred to as a “little disagreement,” is “the media creating a story” where he doesn’t think there is one.  Vance said the Trump campaign was invited by some of the families of the 13 Americans killed at the Kabul airport bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, adding that it is “not an insult to the memories of their loved ones. They wanted Donald Trump there.”  “Thank God that we have a president who stands with our veterans, instead of one who runs away from ‘em,” he said. Vance also said that Vice President Kamala Harris could “go to hell” in regards to the Afghanistan withdrawal — a statement he later doubled down on, saying it is an indication of his “frustration” despite previously condemning heightened political rhetoric in the wake of the assassination attempt against Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump appeared to suggest the incident in Arlington stemmed from his campaign’s use of photography, sharing a statement from the family members of the fallen soldiers expressing their approval. However, Arlington National Cemetery said in a statement, obtained by CNN, that federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries and that it “reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants” which includes “photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign.” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler weighed in on the Arlington incident in a statement, saying, “This episode is pretty sad when it’s all said and done. This is what we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump and his team. Donald Trump is a person who wants to make everything all about Donald Trump. He’s also someone who has a history of demeaning and degrading military servicemembers.” Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Gov. Tim Walz embarked on a bus tour of Georgia today, putting a spotlight on one of the top battleground states. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign stirred new controversy during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery that was intended to draw attention to the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, said a reported altercation was “the media creating a story.”  Here are other headlines you should know: Ads: Support efforts: Upcoming events: Trump assassination attempt probe: The day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris to become the Democratic presidential nominee, CNN reported that Beyoncé had given her sign-off for the vice president to use “Freedom” as her official campaign song. So, it was a seemingly antagonistic choice when the Republican nominee’s campaign played the same Beyoncé song as the backdrop of a recent social media video to showcase former President Donald Trump. From Celine Dion and Foo Fighters to Bruce Springsteen and Prince’s estate numerous artists over the years have objected to the use of their music by the Trump campaign. But depending on how and where their music is used, musicians may have grounds to take action beyond rebuking, according to legal experts. Beyoncé’s representatives did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. But last week, Rolling Stone reported her label threatened to send a cease-and-desist to the Trump campaign after they had used “Freedom” in the social media video, which was posted by Trump’s campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung. Shortly after Beyoncé’s team reportedly threatened legal action, the video was taken down. In a statement to CNN, Cheung said he used “Freedom” to provoke the opposing party. “The purpose of the post just proved the point that Democrats are all about banning things, including freedom. They fell for it hook, line, and sinker,” Cheung said. Licensing music and obtaining rights and clearances is an expensive, complicated and litigious business. Movie studios regularly pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to obtain the rights to a single song, while brands can pay millions to repeat a tune in commercials to help sell a product. Political campaigns are no exception.

Tim Walz, who did not travel with her, but instead met her at the airport.  They were greeted by several people on the tarmac, including Rep. Nikema Williams and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, and also met students from Savannah State University, the oldest public HBCU in Georgia. Here’s what happened on Wednesday: The first stop was the Liberty County High School in Hinesville where Harris and Walz offered words of encouragement to students while emphasizing the role their generation plays in shaping the future of the country. Harris told the marching band and athletes that the country is counting on them to propel the country forward. Walz briefly spoke briefly before, introducing Harris as “head coach” and the next president of the United States. He discussed being a former public school teacher and coach, while underscoring that “education is the key to the middle class.” Harris and Walz then visited Sandfly BBQ in Savannah, where they greeted the restaurant’s owner, employees, and several tables of diners as they walked around. They also posed for a few selfies.  Before the media pool was escorted out of the venue, Harris stopped at the front counter and spoke to two employees. “Congratulations on all of your success. I’ve been reading about all you’ve been doing,” Harris said. The tour wrapped for the day at around 7:40 p.m. ET when Harris and Walz arrived at their hotel. They both gave a quick wave before entering with staff. Special counsel Jack Smith had to take a hammer to some parts of his election subversion case against former President Donald Trump after the Supreme Court’s sweeping ruling that Trump had at least some presidential immunity in the prosecution. The high court’s 6-3 ruling said that Trump had at least presumed immunity for his official acts as president and that for some “core” acts, that immunity was absolute. But with the superseding indictment handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday, prosecutors also used a scalpel to reshape their allegations, making subtle edits, along with big changes. Here are some of the things that are different: The Supreme Court rejected prosecutors’ arguments that they could use evidence related to a president’s official acts to help prove their allegations about his unofficial conduct. That means any evidence stemming from conduct Trump arguably was engaged in his official capacity as president is unusable for prosecutors. Jeff Clark, the Justice Department official who tried to send a department letter seeking to interfere with the certification of Georgia’s election results, is no longer listed as a co-conspirator, and in several places, references to any DOJ-related activity are removed. In the timeline Smith has laid out for how the January 6 attack on Congress unfolded, now missing are the efforts by Trump’s advisers and others to convince the president that he needed to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol. Trump’s various responses to the requests are now also gone, including his mid-afternoon tweets that told the rioters to “remain peaceful” without explicitly asking them to leave. Prosecutors also removed from the indictment their description of the video message he filmed from the Rose Garden later that day. Perhaps the boldest decision Smith made in retooling his indictment was to keep his allegations about the Pence pressure campaign. The Supreme Court said that alleged conduct was “presumptively immune” and put the burden on prosecutors to prove that criminal liability for those acts wouldn’t intrude on a president’s Executive Branch authorities. In response, Smith tried to distinguish Trump’s January 6-related interactions with Pence from the role a vice president plays as a president’s close adviser and potential replacement. The new indictment repeatedly describes Trump’s conduct towards Pence as stemming from Pence’s position as his running mate and as the president of the Senate, who would preside over Congress’ certification of the election results – a process separate from the Executive Branch in which Trump had no involvement.

Fact-checking Harris’ CNN interview | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:30 PM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",2024-08-30T02:00:37.484Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/fact-checking-harris-cnn-interview/index.html,"Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN anchor Dana Bash on Thursday for the first formal interview of their campaign. Bash directed most of the questions to Harris. Here is a fact check of some of Harris’ responses, including a misleading statement and an exaggeration. Bash noted that Harris said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” When Bash asked if she still wants to ban fracking, Harris responded: “No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 – that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” When Bash again noted that Harris said in 2019 that she supported a ban on fracking, and asked Harris if she changed her mind during that campaign (which Harris ended in December 2019), Harris said, “In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024 and I’ve not changed that position, nor will I going forward.” Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate. Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Thursday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior. Harris touted the impact of the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill Biden signed into law in 2021, which included a temporary enhancement of the child tax credit. She referred to “when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit, so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%.” Facts First: The word “over,” which Harris said very quietly, makes this claim a slight exaggeration; the American Rescue Plan’s temporary expansion of the child tax credit helped reduce child poverty by 46%, by one key federal measure, between 2020 and 2021. In addition, it’s important to note that this steep improvement only lasted for the one year the temporary enhancement was in effect. The child poverty rate then spiked in 2022, the most recent year for which public data is currently available.  The American Rescue Plan increased the size of the child tax credit to up to $3,600 – from $2,000 – for eligible families. The law also enabled many more low-income parents to claim the credit and distributed half of the credit on a monthly basis. These changes helped send child poverty (as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau. But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. That was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began. Harris is now calling to restore the $3,600 credit as well as create a new $6,000 credit for newborns. Touting the Biden-Harris administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a major climate law for which Harris cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate, Harris spoke of “what we’ve already done, creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs.” Facts First: This needs context. While it’s clear that a significant number of new clean energy jobs were created as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, the “300,000” figure includes jobs that companies have promised to create but aren’t finalized. And other counts of new clean energy jobs have come up with smaller figures. The 300,000 estimate comes from a June tally by communications group Climate Power. It was compiled by adding up the jobs promised by companies in publicly announcing 585 clean energy projects after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed through May 2024, a total of 312,900 announced jobs. Not all of these jobs have already been created. Climate Power’s topline number also doesn’t distinguish between construction jobs building new factories and the long-term jobs at those factories – jobs building batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles, among other things. In addition, E2, another clean energy group that tracks Inflation Reduction Act-related investments and jobs, has counted over 109,000 new clean energy jobs created or announced from August 2022 to May 2024 – significantly lower than the Climate Power number. A recent report from the US Department of Energy found 142,000 new clean energy jobs were created in 2023. Different entities use different methodologies when analyzing data, so it is difficult to determine an exact figure. Regardless, there’s no question there’s a huge amount of clean energy investment, and a significant number of new jobs building EVs and renewables like wind and solar are being created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2024 Energy Department report showed clean energy jobs made up more than half of the total for new energy sector jobs and grew at a rate twice as large as the overall US economy. The report also acknowledged how the sudden growth in the clean energy sector from the Inflation Reduction Act has made it difficult to track all the jobs that are being created."
Takeaways from CNN’s interview with Harris and Walz | CNN Politics,"Published 10:24 PM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",2024-08-30T02:24:15.090Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/takeaways-harris-walz-interview/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris said she was “deeply touched” by a photo of her young grandniece, in pigtails, watching her speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week. Though Harris hasn’t emphasized it — she said she is running to be president for “all Americans” — the photo captured the potential of her candidacy to make history. “It’s very humbling. Very humbling in many ways,” she told CNN’s Dana Bash on Thursday. Her comments came during the first joint interview of Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. The Minnesota governor added that he’d seen video of his son Gus emotionally reacting to his convention speech. “Our politics can be better. It can be different. We can show some of these things, and we can have families involved in this,” he said. “I hope people felt that out there, and I hope that they hugged their kids a little tighter, because you never know. Life can be kind of hard.” In the interview, Harris explained how her positions on issues including fracking and border security have evolved since she first ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 — and offered a preview of how she’s going to explain those evolutions to voters when they come up in her debate with former President Donald Trump and at other moments as the race moves forward. “My values have not changed,” she said. She also sought to frame the 2024 race as one that offers the American people “a new way forward” after a political decade in which Trump — in office or out — was a central figure. Democrats have framed Harris’ 2024 campaign as one of joy — a turning of the page from a former president who has cast his political rivals, the media and others as enemies and frequently tapped into dark themes with dire warnings about the nation’s future. That approach will soon face its biggest test yet, with Harris and Trump both preparing for their September 10 debate on ABC. Here are six takeaways from the Democratic ticket’s interview with Bash: As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris opposed fracking — a position that could have proven politically damaging in Pennsylvania, where it’s a huge employer. Now, she says, she supports it. “As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking,” she said. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of breaking through dense shale to unlock natural gas. Progressives have opposed fracking due to concerns about climate change. However, under the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass in the Senate and President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, fracking has expanded in the United States, while also advancing clean energy efforts. Harris said she had already changed her position on fracking in 2020, when she said during the vice presidential debate that Biden “will not end fracking.” “I have not changed that position, nor will I going forward,” she told Bash, adding, “My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate.” She cited the Biden administration’s efforts to spur growth in clean energy, saying: “What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.” Asked if she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, Harris said, “Yes, I would.” The vice president wasn’t ready to name any specific names, or roles they might play. “No one in particular,” she said. “We have 68 days to go in this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse. But I would.” There is recent precedent for Cabinet selections that cross party lines. Former President Barack Obama appointed several Republicans to high-ranking positions — including former Illinois Rep. Ray LaHood as transportation secretary and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. For Harris, the pool of Republicans who vocally oppose Trump could be a pool of prospects. Several of them spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week. “I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion,” Harris said. “I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.” Harris largely sidestepped questions around Donald Trump’s claims about her racial and gender identity. Last month, Trump questioned Harris’ racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, suggesting she’d previously identified as South Asian but “happened to turn Black” for political purposes. Shaking her head, Harris said Trump’s remark is part of his “same old tired playbook.” “Next question, please,” she said. “That’s it?” Bash asked. “That’s it,” Harris responded with a smile. Her refusal to comment further is in line with her campaign’s strategy to avoid leaning into identity politics following Trump’s remarks. It could also indicate how Harris might handle future challenges to her race and gender during her first debate with the former president next month. Sunday, July 21, was a busy morning at the vice president’s residence. Harris said she was making breakfast for relatives visiting from out of town and had just sat down to do a puzzle with her nieces when the phone rang. “It was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do,” Harris said, in her most extensive remarks to date on how she learned the president was ending his reelection bid and endorsing her to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket. That phone called upended the 2024 presidential campaign and fundamentally changed Harris’ life and career. But in the moment, she said, she was more concerned about the impact the decision would have on Biden, who’d spent weeks weathering calls for his resignation after a halting performance at CNN’s first presidential debate caused Democrats to question his mental and physical health. “I asked him, ‘Are you sure?’ and he said ‘Yes,’” Harris recalled. “My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him.” Harris said she believes history will show Biden’s presidency was “transformative” and view his decision to withdraw from the race as one that is reflective of his character. She described the president as someone who is “quite selfless and puts the American people first.” She went on to defend the Biden administration’s record, touting their investments in infrastructure, as well as efforts to lower drug costs and renew relationships with allies abroad. “I am so proud to have served as Vice President to Joe Biden,” she said. “I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for president of the United States and to bring … what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward.” Trump has made attacking the Biden administration’s handling of the US-Mexico border a signature issue, but Harris said Trump bears much of the blame for the border security problems he bemoans. She pointed to his opposition to the bipartisan border security bill hashed out by a group of lawmakers that included Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a conservative Republican. “Because he believed that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, don’t put it forward. He killed the bill — a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more agents on the border,” she said. Asked if she would push that bill if she is elected president, Harris said: “Not only push it, I would make sure that it would come to my desk and I would sign it.” She also said she does not support decriminalizing illegally crossing the border into the United States, reversing another position she took during her 2019 presidential run. “We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences,” Harris said, arguing that she had prosecuted transnational criminal organizations as California attorney general. Walz was also pressed on false claims he’s made in the past, including a 2018 video in which he addresses gun violence and refers to “weapons of war, that I carried in war.” Though Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, he was never in a combat zone. He said he misspoke. “My wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar’s not always correct,” he said. Walz had also said in his convention speech that he and his wife used in vitro fertilization to conceive their children, but has since clarified it was a different kind of fertility treatment. “I certainly own my mistakes when I make them,” he said. “I won’t apologize for speaking passionately, whether it’s guns in schools or protection of reproductive rights,” he said. “The contrast could not be clearer … I think most Americans get it.” Walz said he would not insult Republicans, a comment that came the same day his GOP rival for the vice presidency, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said Harris could “go to hell” in regards to the Afghanistan withdrawal. Their drastically different approaches to the campaign will be on display when they meet for a debate hosted by CBS on October 1. The response that Harris’ policy proposals and promises of a new day in American politics have been met with from many Republicans has been: Why haven’t those things already happened in the three-and-a-half years she’s been vice president? The vice president said Thursday she is “talking about an era that started about a decade ago” — which is when Trump moved to the political forefront. In the Trump era, Harris said, “there is some suggestion — warped, I believe it to be — that the measure of the strength of a leader is who you beat down, instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.” “That’s what’s at stake, as much as any other detail that we could discuss, in this election,” she said."
"Analysis: Key lines from CNN’s interview with VP Kamala Harris, her first as the Democratic nominee | CNN Politics","Published 9:49 PM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",2024-08-30T01:49:53.792Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/key-lines-harris-interview-what-matters/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash for her first major TV interview since becoming Democrats’ presidential nominee. The interview was conducted in Savannah on the sidelines of a bus tour through the key Sun Belt state of Georgia and alongside her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Harris took in-depth questions on her policy evolution on key issues like fracking and defended her record on immigration and the Biden administration’s handling of the economy. Here are key lines from the interview: After a broad claim about focusing on the middle class, Harris made a larger point about moving on from Donald Trump. Pushed by Bash about her specific plans, Harris said she would focus on her “opportunity economy” plan to bring down the cost of everyday goods and give parents of newborns a $6,000 tax credit “to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib.” She also mentioned housing affordability and her plan to give first-time homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit to help with a down payment. There’s a lot in that answer, but one thing worth noting is that the expanded child tax credit she mentioned has since lapsed. Given that Harris as well as Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, both have said they support a more generous child tax credit, it’s fair to think an expansion is possible no matter who wins the election. When she ran unsuccessfully in a crowded Democratic primary in 2020, Harris at one point said she favored banning fracking. Harris later changed that position, and during the vice presidential debate said the administration would not ban fracking. Many climate activists oppose fracking, but it is a key issue in battleground states like Pennsylvania. Republicans have argued the administration should have acted much sooner to cut down on border crossings. While Harris did not answer the question specifically, she argued that earlier this year, before President Joe Biden used executive action to cut down on border crossings, Democrats worked with a few conservative Republicans on a border bill that Republicans ultimately turned against. She said those agents could have worked to stop fentanyl from coming into the US. If elected, Harris said she would try to revive the border bill. This is another throwback to a controversial position Harris took during the 2020 Democratic primary. Bash asked Harris how voters should view her policy evolutions, to which Harris repeated, like a mantra: “My values have not changed.” Harris did not express any policy differences from Biden, and she reiterated the balance she struck at the Democratic National Convention: acknowledging both Israel’s right to defend itself and the suffering of Palestinians, repeating that a ceasefire deal must get done. Vance, an Iraq War veteran, has accused Walz of misrepresenting his military service because one time Walz referred to carrying weapons of war “in war” even though he never deployed. The campaign has said Walz misspoke. Walz has also previously mischaracterized the infertility treatment his wife underwent in becoming pregnant with their children. It was not in vitro fertilization, which some Democrats have argued would be in danger if Trump wins the election. Trump denies that claim, and on Thursday even proposed making the government or insurance companies pay for IVF treatments. The Walz family used intrauterine insemination, IUI, as opposed to IVF. Separately, Walz’s congressional campaign in 2006 mischaracterized a 1995 drunk driving arrest for which charges were later dropped. Can voters trust what Walz says? He did not address the drunk driving arrest during the interview with Bash, but said, “I certainly own my mistakes when I make ‘em.” He went further on the IVF question. Cutting hairs? Perhaps he meant “splitting hairs.” She contrasted that with Trump, whose rise in politics has been part of a decade that “has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies.” She was spending time with her family and her young nieces. Bash asked about the video of Walz’s son, tearfully saying, “That’s my dad,” during the DNC. See the photo here."
Harris explains in exclusive CNN interview why she’s shifted her position on key issues since her first run for president | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:00 PM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",2024-08-29T20:00:27.999Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cnntv/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday offered her most expansive explanation to date on why she’s changed some of her positions on fracking and immigration, telling CNN’s Dana Bash her values haven’t shifted but that her time as vice president provided new perspective on some of the country’s most pressing issues. In the CNN exclusive sit-down interview, Harris also said she would name a Republican to serve in her Cabinet if elected. She described for the first time President Joe Biden’s telephone call informing her he was planning to abandon his bid for a second term after his disastrous debate performance. She stopped short of saying she would alter Biden’s policy toward arm sales to Israel. And she brushed off her rival’s questioning of her racial identity, dismissing Donald Trump’s suggestion she “happened to turn Black.” “Same old, tired playbook,” she said. “Next question, please.” In all, the joint interview in Savannah with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz – their first since becoming the Democratic presidential ticket – provided one of the clearest looks into Harris’ positions and her plans for the presidency. Asked to describe her day-one objectives should she win, Harris did not list any specific steps, like signing executive actions or orders. Instead, she reiterated her focus on strengthening the economy: “First and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class.” In the post-convention phase of the race, Harris is seeking to address scrutiny of her record and add substance to her pitch to American voters on how she would govern if elected president. Harris had been under pressure to explain her policy positions in greater detail during a sit-down interview. Her last-minute campaign has been fueled not by detailed proposals or policy papers but by Democrats energized by the newly competitive election. Pressed by Bash on her reversals on fracking and decriminalizing illegal border crossings, Harris sought to explain why her positions had changed. “How should voters look at some of the changes that you’ve made?” Bash asked Harris. “Is it because you have more experience now and you’ve learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you’re saying now is going to be your policy moving forward?” Harris said despite the shifts in position, her values had not changed. “I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,” she said. “You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed – and I have worked on it – that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.” Her campaign later said Harris does not continue to support the Green New Deal, a wide-ranging proposal to address climate change first introduced in 2019. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked if she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,” Harris said at the time. By the time she had become Biden’s running mate, she had moved away from that stance and even cast the tie breaking vote to expand fracking leases, as she noted to Bash. On Thursday, Harris pointed to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which provided record investments in combatting climate change, as an example of her climate record. “We have set goals for the United States of America and by extension, the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed,” she said. “What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking,” she added. And she pointed to her record as California attorney general, when she prosecuted gangs accused of cross border trafficking, as an indication of her values on immigration. “My values have not changed. So that is the reality of it. And four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the aspects, to your point, is traveling the country extensively,” she said, pointing to her 17 visits to Georgia since becoming vice president. “I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems.” Sitting for a joint interview has become a tradition for presidential tickets in the early weeks of the new partnership. Speaking alongside Harris, Walz said he was enthusiastic about “the idea of inspiring America to what can be.” He also defended himself against accusations he’s shaded the truth in various aspects of his resume and background, including his military service and in describing his family’s fertility struggles, saying he may have been imprecise in his language and “I certainly own my mistakes when I make them.” But he pushed back against Republican attacks he said were directed toward his family. “If it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it’s an attack on my dog. I’m not going to do that,” he said. For Democrats, the economy remains a political weakness. Polls show more voters trust Trump to handle the economy and tame inflation, though they have been narrowing since Harris entered the race. Harris laid out an economic policy plan earlier this month focused on bringing down costs on food, housing and childcare, in part by going harder after corporations. Her proposals included efforts to combat price gouging and ramp up construction of affordable housing. Her plans did not amount to a wholesale departure from policies Biden has pursued over the course of his term. But she has chosen to focus more centrally on discussing affordability as a messaging strategy rather than job creation or manufacturing gains, as Biden did. On Thursday, Bash pressed Harris to explain why those proposals hadn’t been executed during the three-and-a-half years of the Biden administration: “Why haven’t you done them already? “We had to recover as an economy, and we have done that,” she said, pointing to efforts on containing inflation, cutting costs for prescription drugs and cutting taxes for families. “There’s more to do, but that’s good work,” she said. Harris also did not expose any daylight between herself and Biden on the Middle East when asked directly if she would be doing anything differently, including limiting arm sales to Israel. “We have to get a deal done. This war must end, and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out,” she said. Harris voiced no regret in describing Biden as “extraordinarily strong” in the days following his disastrous performance at the CNN debate in Atlanta. “He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president,” she said. Describing the Sunday in July when Biden, after weeks of pressure, announced his decision to withdraw from the race, Harris said she was at home making pancakes and bacon for her nieces when the phone rang. “It was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, ‘Are you sure?’ And he said, ‘Yes,’” she recalled, adding: “My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him.” Embracing her vow to act as a president for “all Americans,” Harris said in the interview she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet if elected, though said she did not have a particular name in mind. It revives a tradition over the past several decades – not embraced by Trump or Biden – of presidents naming at least one member of the opposing party to their cabinet. “I’ve got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse,” she said. “But I would, I think. I think it’s really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.” Harris, who rarely discusses the barrier-breaking nature of her candidacy on the campaign trail, acknowledged in the interview there were moments she felt the weight of history – including upon seeing a photograph of one of her young grandnieces staring on as she delivered her address to the last week’s convention. “I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” she said. “But I did see that photograph, and I was deeply touched by it. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
"ABC presidential debate rules show microphones will be muted, but Harris camp is still pushing back | CNN Business","Published 1:50 PM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",2024-08-29T17:50:06.781Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/media/abc-presidential-debate-rules-harris-trump-microphones/index.html,"ABC News intends to mute the microphones of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris while their opponent speaks during an upcoming presidential debate, according to a copy of the formal rules obtained by CNN, but the Harris campaign is continuing to push back on the final sticking point. “Candidate microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, and muted when time belongs to another candidate,” ABC stated in the debate rules sent to the campaigns on Tuesday. While the Trump campaign has accepted the rules governing the Sep. 10 matchup, Harris’ campaign said it remains in ongoing discussions with the network about the microphone issue. “Our latest understanding is that even though Trump said Monday he would be fine with an unmuted mic, his handlers don’t trust him to spar live with VP Harris and are asking ABC to ignore Trump’s comments and keep the mics muted or else they will back out of the debate for a third time,” Harris campaign senior advisor Brian Fallon said in a post on X. “We have been asked to accede to Trump’s handlers’ wishes on this point for the sake of preserving the debate. We find the Trump’s team’s stance to be weak, and remain in discussions with ABC on the final rules.” Fallon added that the rules sent to the campaigns were “a draft” that both sides must still reach an agreement on. “We have not done so because we think both candidates have expressed a clear desire to have hot mics,” he said. “Not clear why Trump staff is overruling their principal, who should be capable of making up his own mind.” ABC News declined to comment. During an event in Virginia on Monday, Trump said of the microphones, “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.” But in a post on his Truth Social platform the next day, Trump added, “The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden.” ABC’s rules, which were first shared with the campaigns last week, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke, a rule the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change in recent days. But the issue over hot mics has become a sticking point as ABC News prepares for the high-stakes debate, which is set to take place next month in Philadelphia with moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. The Harris campaign has publicly pushed for the microphones to remain unmuted throughout the event, needling Trump over the issue in a statement earlier this week. “Both candidates have publicly made clear their willingness to debate with unmuted mics for the duration of the debate to fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates - but it appears Donald Trump is letting his handlers overrule him. Sad!” But behind the scenes, the Trump campaign continued to advocate for the rules they had already agreed to with ABC News. The formal list of debate rules was sent to the Trump campaign on Tuesday and was accepted by the campaign. According to a person familiar with matter, the Trump campaign expected ABC to publish the formal announcement that both candidates had accepted the debate rules earlier this week. In addition to the muted microphones, the 90-minute debate will not feature a live audience. ABC has agreed to allow other television networks to simulcast the event, which will include two commercial breaks. A coin flip will determine podium placement and order of closing statements. The candidates won’t be allowed to have any notes on stage with them or visit with campaign staff during breaks. There will be two minutes given for answers, and two minutes for rebuttals with one minute for follow ups. The candidates also cannot ask questions of one another."
Analysis: Harris’ CNN interview is the latest highly anticipated twist in wild presidential race | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:25 AM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",2024-08-29T04:00:19.709Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/kamala-harris-cnn-interview-analysis/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris faces the next test in her presidential bid on Thursday with her first unscripted interview with a major media outlet since becoming the Democratic nominee. Harris will be hoping to extend the momentum she’s conjured at the start of her campaign – and to avoid the types of unforced errors that plagued her first presidential bid in 2019, as well as her early days as vice president. It’s also a chance for the newly anointed candidate to heighten a contrast with Republican nominee Donald Trump, to connect with undecided voters and to highlight her credentials to lead in the Oval Office at a tense time for the United States at home and abroad. Harris will appear alongside her vice presidential pick, Tim Walz, in a CNN primetime special airing at 9 p.m. ET from Georgia, where she is on a bus tour designed to put a swing state the GOP thought it was close to securing in November back on the board. The interview is the most important chapter of the campaign between last week’s Democratic convention in Chicago and the presidential debate set for Philadelphia on September 10. The interview, with Dana Bash, has taken on elevated significance because of the compressed race Harris is running after she became her party’s candidate and because of the way it mushroomed into an issue between the feuding campaigns. It’s the latest highly anticipated moment in a wild race that has seen Trump become the first major party nominee to be convicted of a crime and the ex-president survive an assassination attempt. President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance in the CNN debate in Atlanta, meanwhile, set off a crisis that ended his reelection bid. Major television interviews like Thursday’s have also played an outsized role – the president agreed to several in an attempt to arrest his slide but only exacerbated concerns about his age and capacity to serve out a full second term. By not scheduling a major interview before now, Harris opened herself to complaints by Trump and some non-partisan observers that she is trying to dodge scrutiny. This raised the stakes for any potential gaffes will be seized upon by the Trump campaign. However, a strong performance by the vice president would be another challenge for Trump, who has struggled since Harris transformed the race by closing his leads in battlegrounds and raising half a billion dollars. While Harris sparked intense enthusiasm at last week’s star-studded Democratic convention in Chicago, as well as in joyful rallies among Democrats who were previously demoralized over Biden’s chances of reelection, she is yet to enter a forum where her answers and policies can be cross-examined. Her speeches have been packed with what she wants to do as president — from easing the economic burden on Americans, to unleashing a housebuilding boom to winning the geopolitical contest of the 21st Century against China. But the vice president has not been specific about exactly how she would enact some of those aspirations and how she would finance them in deeply divided Washington. The interview will be watched for whether Harris creates space on key issues with Biden as she bills herself as a change candidate despite serving as vice president in an unpopular administration. Already, Harris has gone further than her boss in pledging to combat the high grocery prices plaguing millions of Americans. This populist twist might be politically smart but it was panned by many economists. The interview has become a hurdle for the vice president because Trump aides have been goading her into it for weeks, apparently believing she’ll flunk difficult questions, will blank on policy details and that she lacks nimble political instincts. In a statement on Wednesday, Trump’s campaign mocked Harris, saying that she had “mustered up the courage to sit for a *joint* interview — after 39 days of hiding out from reporters.” While she has not sat for a major interview, Harris has taken some questions from reporters traveling with her. After years as a prosecutor, California’s attorney general and senator who excelled in high-profile hearings, Harris has often seemed more comfortable asking penetrating questions than answering them. She lacks the decades of policy experience that helped former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, for example, turn interviews into policy seminars. And unlike Trump, she doesn’t swamp interviewers with torrents of falsehoods, outrageous statements and bombast, which means he often is able to distract attention from what he actually says. Republican confidence that Harris could be exposed by a televised interview springs from a one-on-one she conducted with NBC’s Lester Holt early in her vice presidency that focused on her role as emissary to Latin American nations that represent the source of much of the undocumented migration to the US. Asked why she had not by that point visited the southern border as vice president, Harris pointed out that she hadn’t visited Europe either since taking the job. Her discomfort provided fuel for years of Republican attacks and the interview still hangs over her tenure as vice president. In that interview, Harris seemed ill prepared — a scenario that seems unlikely to be repeated considering she is deep into debate prep. In more recent interviews, for instance, on CBS’ “60 Minutes” last October and with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in late June when she defended Biden, she seemed far more at ease. Heading into Thursday’s interview, Republicans are also demanding answers on why Harris has dropped some positions she held in her short-lived 2020 presidential bid, including “Medicare for All.” Her campaign has also indicated that she no longer opposes fracking — an important issue in Pennsylvania where Trump is highlighting the commonwealth’s carbon energy industry. The Trump campaign and conservative media Wednesday portrayed the presence in the interview of Walz, the Minnesota governor, as a crutch for the vice president. It is not unusual however for presidential nominees to appear with their vice presidential picks. Trump sat with his vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in a friendly interview on Fox News last month that ended with a “questions from fans” segment. The former president also did a joint interview with his newly minted vice presidential nominee Mike Pence in his Trump Tower penthouse on “60 Minutes” in 2016. The future vice president tried to finesse the extreme positions of the man who picked him, while Trump kept interrupting. Harris had a joint interview with Biden in 2020 when she was vice presidential nominee and Democratic nominee Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did likewise in 2016. Partisan bickering over the interview aside, there are many reasons why it makes sense for presidential candidates to submit to tough interviews. Someone hoping to run the country ought to feel an obligation to explain what they plan to do — even if it might please their campaign managers to restrict appearances to low-risk partisan outlets and empathetic social media influencers. The more interviews a politician conducts, the more practiced they become. A more robust media plan might have helped Harris hone her skills before debating Trump. Successful presidencies are also built on political capital accrued on the campaign trail. The days might have passed when presidential campaigns were founded on weighty policy speeches and time is short in this compressed race for such events. Yet past presidential candidates proved their credibility by taking voters into their confidence on policy plans. In 1960, for instance, Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy laid out an agenda on the campaign trail on issues like civil rights, housing and foreign policy that became the basis for policy achievements in his presidency and Lyndon Johnson’s subsequent administration. Thursday’s interview comes as Democrats debate whether Harris should concentrate most on policy issues or drawing character contrasts with Trump, as she tells voters they have a “fleeting” chance to move on from his cacophony. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s former White House communications director, said Harris needed to use the occasion to make clear who she is fighting for, and her pledge to protect voters from what she sees as GOP attacks on their freedoms. “I think she needs to not get too wrapped up in the idea that this needs to be a Ph.D policy test of every potential plank of a Harris administration and really use it as a messaging opportunity,” Bedingfield, now a CNN commentator, said. But Leon Panetta, a former CIA director, defense secretary and White House chief of staff, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that candidates should discuss issues they believe in to show they can put the country on a better path. He added: “You better damn well know the answers to specific questions, because that will test whether or not you’re just talking in broad terms or whether you really have a specific policy that you want to put in place.”"

JD Vance posted a picture of a cat wearing a “Cats for Vance 2024” bandana, appearing to make light of the scrutiny surrounding his 2021 “childless cat ladies” comments. “I wonder if this cat knows…“ Vance posted on X. After being announced as Trump’s vice presidential pick, Vance faced scrutiny for previously saying the United States is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” CNN also reported Vance has a history of disparaging comments against those without children, including fundraising emails referring to the “radical childless leaders in this country.” Recently, Vance faced fresh scrutiny for resurfaced comments aimed at Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers.  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have contrasting views on the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Take a look at their positions here: Harris: The vice president has committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. She has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announced $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs and other aid for the war-torn country last month. At the Munich Security Conference this year, Harris said: “I will make clear President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine. In partnership with supportive, bipartisan majorities in both houses of the United States Congress, we will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs. And let me be clear: The failure to do so would be a gift to Vladimir Putin.” Trump: The former president previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. “Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him “no longer than one day” to settle the war if elected. Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the “never-ending wars” by vowing to remove “warmongers,” “frauds” and “failures in the senior ranks of our government,” and replacing them with national security officials who would defend America’s interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war.

Kirsten Gillibrand, for a Zoom call organized by the group “Swifties for Kamala” to mobilize fans of the pop superstar to vote for Kamala Harris. Swift has no affiliation with the group and was not involved in the call on Tuesday. “Swifties for Kamala” has amassed roughly a quarter of a million followers across multiple social media platforms and raised over $13,000 for the Harris-Walz campaign. More than 26,000 participants registered to join the call, which was attended by CNN and also featured remarks by Sen. Ed Markey, Rep. Chris Deluzio, Rep. Becca Balint and chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party Anderson Clayton. Irene Kim, the co-founder of “Swifties for Kamala,” had previously told CNN the group was hopeful Harris or her running mate, Tim Walz, might join the call, though neither was present. “Hello Swifties!” is how Warren, the first speaker of the night, greeted the group as heart, thumbs up and party emojis flowed through the stream. King sang her favorite Swift song, “Shake It Off,” telling those gathered not to be afraid of standing up and using their voice. Read the full story. Donald Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if “Marxist” prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender “our cities to violent criminals,” he “will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.” Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into “radical left” prosecutors’ offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore “law and order” and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings. Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the “Democrats’ war on police,” the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a “record investment” to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement “refuses to act.” The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use “proven common sense” measures such as stop-and-frisk.

Hefty debt loads, which hurt people’s ability to buy homes, get car loans, or start small businesses, are also an area of interest to Kamala Harris. In her economic plan, she pledged to work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign. Harris has been a leader in the White House’s efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, noting that those with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those who don’t have unpaid medical bills. As vice president, she has promoted the Biden administration’s initiatives on student debt, which have so far forgiven more than $168 billion for nearly 4.8 million borrowers. In July, Harris said that “nearly 950,000 public servants have benefitted” from student debt forgiveness, compared with only 7,000 when Biden was inaugurated. A potential Harris administration could keep that momentum going – though some of Joe Biden’s efforts have gotten tangled up in litigation, such as a program aimed at cutting monthly student loan payments for roughly 3 million borrowers enrolled in a repayment plan the administration implemented last year. Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. Donald Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send “all education and education work and needs back to the states.” “We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it,” he added. The former president has also promised to “put parents back in charge and give them the final say” in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and “favorable treatment” to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it.” Trump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to “teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.” The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing “Marxists” from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution’s Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen’s right to practice their own religion, he said. Trump has also promised to fund free online classes with funds seized from private university endowments. Read more about what Trump has said on other key issues. Ohio Sen. JD Vance previewed his message to a firefighters’ union convention in Boston on Thursday, pledging to work to improve wages of both union and non-union members while declining to say whether he supports right to work laws nationally or at the state level. During a Wednesday campaign event in De Pere, Wisconsin, Vance said he plans to tell workers at the International Association of Fire Fighters conference he wants workers to “have safe jobs” and livable wages “without being destroyed by our public leadership.” When asked by CNN whether he would support a bill similar to the House Republican bill proposed last year to implement a national right-to-work law, Vance noted he did not support the bill and indicated he would want states to implement their own laws individually if they choose. When asked by CNN if he supports Wisconsin’s right-to-work law or if he supports Michigan’s decision to repeal its right-to-work law last year, Vance said states should make their own decisions on the issue. Ohio Sen. JD Vance continued to defend the Trump campaign in response to an altercation between campaign aides and a staff member at Arlington National Cemetery during the former president’s visit earlier this week.  In response to a question about whether Vance feels Trump should have to abide by a federal law banning political campaigns from filming at military grave sites, Vance denied the campaign filming at the grave site amounted to “a gross violation of federal law.”   The comment comes after an incident during Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery in which an individual physically blocked Trump’s team from accompanying him during his visit on Monday. A cemetery spokesperson confirmed to CNN “there was an incident” and a “report was filed” but didn’t provide additional details. Donald Trump has promised to reduce energy prices by increasing domestic production. In several campaign appearances, he has laid out plans to end delays in federal drilling permits and leases. At a South Carolina rally in February, he pledged to remove limits on American natural gas exports. The Washington Post has also reported that Trump, during an April meeting at Mar-a-Lago, pledged to roll back some of President Joe Biden’s climate policies if oil executives raised $1 billion for his campaign. As for other energy sources, Trump has also changed his tune on the expansion of offshore wind farms, which he had touted at the start of his presidency as part of a broader push to “unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.” In May, Trump described wind farms as “horrible” and accused turbines of killing birds and whales, adding that he would “make sure that ends on day one.” Trump has also promoted US cryptocurrency mining, an industry that has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive; servers require enormous amounts of power to solve a complex series of algorithms to verify transactions. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!” he said on Truth Social. Read more about what Trump has said on other key issues. Kamala Harris has rolled out a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage. Parts of it build on proposals that Joe Biden has already unveiled. The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year. The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign. Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. Independent presidential candidate Cornel West acknowledged his affiliations with signature-collecting firms and ballot access operatives with ties to Republicans. But he denied he’s “being used” by Republicans to pull votes away from Vice President Kamala Harris in key battleground states. In an interview with CNN’s Laura Coates on Tuesday, West responded to attacks from Democrats who point to his use of Republican-aligned ballot access firms in battleground states to circulate petitions to get him on the ballot by saying it’s “very important” to work with lawyers and other staff who are working to expand ballot access in states even if they have a “Republican association.” West denied his campaign is being propped up by Republicans to give progressive Democrats an alternative in battleground states. West’s campaign has been linked with Republican-aligned ballot access firms in several battleground states, where his campaign has committed to focusing its ballot qualification efforts in recent weeks. When asked if he would consider suspending his campaign and endorsing Harris, West indicated he plans to stay in the race through Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arrived at their hotel this evening, walking off their tour bus at around 7:40 p.m. after making two stops in south Georgia. They both gave a quick wave before entering their hotel with staff. Donald Trump’s campaign is co-managed by the man who engineered the “swift boating” of John Kerry in 2004, so it should come as no surprise that 20 years later, military service and treatment of veterans are turning into uncomfortable political issues. Trump pivoted from a visit to Arlington National Cemetery earlier this week to an attack on President Joe Biden’s Afghanistan policy – a turn that apparently followed a dustup with an official at the cemetery over the campaign’s attempt to use cameras in Section 60, an area where American troops who were killed in recent wars are buried. The story was first reported by NPR, but both Trump’s campaign and the cemetery have since issued statements. The cemetery’s statement, according to CNN’s report, noted that federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries. Trump’s campaign noted that he was invited into Section 60 by Gold Star families. It’s notable that the summer is ending with controversy over Trump’s decision to visit Section 60 as a candidate, since the summer began with Biden’s look back at criticism of Trump’s decision as president not to visit a US military cemetery in France in 2018 and comments he reportedly made during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery’s Section 60 in 2017. At the CNN presidential debate in June that was the beginning of the end of Biden’s presidential campaign, the president recalled a 2020 report in The Atlantic that Trump refused to visit a cemetery near Paris honoring Americans who died in World War I because they were “losers.” Trump denied using that term, which came from a recounting of the incident by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff. Kelly later confirmed elements of the Atlantic story to CNN’s Jake Tapper and also discussed a Memorial Day ceremony in 2017 when the two were in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery. “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” Trump said at the time, according to Kelly’s recollection, which Trump denies. Read more. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz visited Sandfly BBQ — a local business in Savannah, Georgia — on Wednesday as they continue their bus tour through the southern region of the Peach State. The two greeted the restaurant’s owner, employees and several tables of diners as they walked around. They also posed for a few selfies.  Before the pool was escorted out of the venue, Harris stopped at the front counter and spoke to two employees.  “Congratulations on all of your success. I’ve been reading about all you’ve been doing,” Harris said. Former President Donald Trump has shared a flurry of posts on his social media website since Tuesday that called for retribution against his perceived political enemies. One post included an image that portrayed Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in orange prison jumpsuits. Trump’s dizzying array of attacks are both familiar and an escalation of the missives he has directed at Harris, Biden and other political foes as the race for the White House has become increasingly competitive for the former president. They come as some Republicans, including close allies, have publicly urged Trump to wage a less personal campaign against Harris — a suggestion the former president has roundly dismissed. In one post, Trump suggested that Harris is manufacturing her online support, an accusation that echoed a conspiracy he promoted last month that the vice president’s crowds were faked. Another included an image of Trump and former President Barack Obama with the words “All roads lead to Obama … retruth if you want public military tribunals.” Trump campaign spokeswoman Caroline Sunshine said in a statement that the posts were “highlighting the fact that Kamala Harris is a coward and a fraud – in addition to being weak, failed and dangerously liberal.” She added that coverage of Trump should focus on his policy speeches and not “a few social media posts.” The Harris campaign said Trump was “out of his mind” in a statement. “If a family member posted what Donald Trump is sharing today, Americans would rightly be concerned. But this is what Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda offer America: prosecuting political opponents, using dangerous conspiracy theories to justify harmful policies, and dividing Americans against each other,” campaign spokesperson James Singer said. This post has been updated with a statement from the Harris campaign. CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed reporting to this post. Ohio Sen. JD Vance said he would be against putting American troops on the ground in Israel if they were to ask a potential Trump-Vance administration for that kind of support. “I don’t want to put American troops on the ground for anybody’s wars but ourselves,” the Republican vice presidential nominee told reporters at an event in Pennsylvania. “That’s a very important principle.” As CNN reported, Israel launched large-scale raids in multiple parts of the occupied West Bank, an offensive they say is their most expansive in years. New polls in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina from Fox News show no clear leader in any of these critical swing states. Among registered voters, the surveys find Vice President Kamala Harris at 50% to former President Donald Trump’s 49% in Arizona in a head-to-head matchup, Harris at 50% to Trump’s 48% in both Georgia and Nevada, and Trump at 50% to Harris’s 49% in North Carolina. Each state poll has an error margin of plus or minus three points, meaning the poll shows no clear leader in any of these races. The picture is more mixed when voters are asked which candidate would do a better job at “fighting for people like you” or “bringing needed change.” Harris has the edge on fighting for people like you in Nevada (51% Harris to 46% Trump), Georgia (50% Harris to 46% Trump) and Arizona (51% Harris to 47% Trump), while the two are about even on that score in North Carolina (49% Harris to 48% Trump). And the two are near even in each state on who would better bring needed change (Harris 50% to Trump 47% in both Georgia and Nevada, Harris 50% to Trump 48% in Arizona, and Trump 49% to Harris 48% in North Carolina).  In both Arizona and Nevada, the polls find Democratic Senate candidates leading Republicans: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen tops Republican Sam Brown in Nevada 55% to 41%, and Democrat Ruben Gallego tops Republican Kari Lake in Arizona 56% to 41%.  The surveys were conducted from August 23 through 26 by telephone and online among roughly 1,000 voters in each state. Donald Trump’s campaign posted a video on TikTok of the former president’s Monday visit to Arlington National Cemetery. The video shows images of Trump laying a wreath to honor the 13 US military service members who were killed at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate, along with images of him at Section 60, the area where American troops who were killed in recent wars are buried.  Trump’s voice along with a guitar is heard over the clips, criticizing the Biden administration over the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The campaign video follows a report from NPR about a “verbal and physical altercation” after a cemetery official attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in Section 60.  In a statement addressing the controversy, Arlington National Cemetery said it “reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants” which includes “photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign.” Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz stopped by a local high school in south Georgia during the first stop of their bus tour where they offered words of encouragement to students while emphasizing the role their generation plays in shaping the future of the country. Harris told students — including the marching band and athletes at Liberty County High School in Hinesville, Georgia — that she’s been “hearing about you incredible young leaders,” adding that the country is counting on them to propel the country forward. Walz briefly spoke briefly before, introducing Harris as “head coach” and the next president of the United States. He discussed being a former public school teacher and coach, while underscoring that “education is the key to the middle class.” Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Republican vice presidential candidate, said that he and former President Donald Trump discussed during a phone call what they called Vice President Kamala Harris’ “copycat campaign.” “I said: ‘Mr. President, I think I figured out what’s going on. She wants my job,’” Vance said, speaking at Team Hardinger, a trucking and warehousing company in Erie, Pennsylvania. “She’s realizing that they don’t have any chance. She’s going to ditch Tim Walz, and she wants to run alongside Donald Trump. She’s pretending she agrees with you on everything.”  As Harris and Walz sit down for their first joint interview with CNN tomorrow, Vance said he must remind Americans of Harris’ “real record.”  Also, in response to a question about how he is debate prepping, Vance said “we don’t need to prepare for a debate with Tim Walz.” “We need to get out there and talk to the American people,” Vance said. “That’s the biggest way that we’re going to prepare for that debate on October the first.” In February, former President Donald Trump pledged to impose “stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.” “It’s called you screw us, and we screw you,” Trump said at a South Carolina rally. It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs. As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called “America First” trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, as well as stopping China from buying up America and stopping the investment of US companies in China. Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he’s reelected. In a meeting with GOP congressional lawmakers in June, Trump also suggested replacing federal income taxes with high tariffs, according to a report from Reuters. The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. “Economic security is national security,” he said.

Tim Walz embarked on a bus tour of Georgia today, putting a spotlight on one of the top battleground states. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign stirred new controversy during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery that was intended to draw attention to the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, said a reported altercation was “the media creating a story.”  Here are other headlines you should know: Ads: Support efforts: Upcoming events: Trump assassination attempt probe: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said the reported altercation at Arlington National Cemetery, which he referred to as a “little disagreement,” is “the media creating a story” where he doesn’t think there is one.  Vance said the Trump campaign was invited by some of the families of the 13 Americans killed at the Kabul airport bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, adding that it is “not an insult to the memories of their loved ones. They wanted Donald Trump there.”  “Thank God that we have a president who stands with our veterans, instead of one who runs away from ‘em,” he said. Vance also said that Vice President Kamala Harris could “go to hell” in regards to the Afghanistan withdrawal — a statement he later doubled down on, saying it is an indication of his “frustration” despite previously condemning heightened political rhetoric in the wake of the assassination attempt against Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump appeared to suggest the incident in Arlington stemmed from his campaign’s use of photography, sharing a statement from the family members of the fallen soldiers expressing their approval. However, Arlington National Cemetery said in a statement, obtained by CNN, that federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries and that it “reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants” which includes “photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign.” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler weighed in on the Arlington incident in a statement, saying, “This episode is pretty sad when it’s all said and done. This is what we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump and his team. Donald Trump is a person who wants to make everything all about Donald Trump. He’s also someone who has a history of demeaning and degrading military servicemembers.” This post was updated with additional remarks from JD Vance. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance denied that he was the “peace broker” between Brian Kemp and former President Donald Trump after having a phone call with the Georgia governor last Thursday.  He said on that call he and the governor talked about “the need to have a unified Republican team.” Vance said Kemp and Trump have “some personal disagreements,” but “they’re both big enough to put the country over personal interests.” Some background: In the 2020 election, Trump lost the state of Georgia to President Joe Biden by more than 11,000 votes. Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since former President Bill Clinton in 1992. Kemp has clashed with Trump after he refused to call a special legislative session to help Trump as he sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Trump was so furious with Kemp, he pledged to end his political career and backed a primary challenger in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary. The move failed spectacularly and Kemp beat David Perdue by over 50 points. But the two have seemed to reconciled recently, with Trump praising Kemp in a post on Truth Social last week. The same night Kemp told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that, “We’re going to put Georgia back in the red column for the presidential race, unlike we did in 2020.” A source similar with the matter told CNN that Kemp with help fundraise for Trump on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris landed at the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport this afternoon and deplaned Air Force Two alongside Gov. Tim Walz, who did not travel with her, but instead met her at the airport.  They were greeted by several people on the tarmac, including Rep. Nikema Williams and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson. The Democrats also met students from Savannah State University, the oldest public HBCU in Georgia. Before boarding the red, white and blue Harris-Walz tour bus at 3:56 p.m. ET, they met a group of supporters and participated in group photos, along with a few selfies.  The bus tour is expected to include a series of campaign stops in south Georgia. Special counsel Jack Smith had to take a hammer to some parts of his election subversion case against former President Donald Trump after the Supreme Court’s sweeping ruling that Trump had at least some presidential immunity in the prosecution. The high court’s 6-3 ruling said that Trump had at least presumed immunity for his official acts as president and that for some “core” acts, that immunity was absolute. But with the superseding indictment handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday, prosecutors also used a scalpel to reshape their allegations, making subtle edits, along with big changes. Here are some of the things that are different: The Supreme Court rejected prosecutors’ arguments that they could use evidence related to a president’s official acts to help prove their allegations about his unofficial conduct. That means any evidence stemming from conduct Trump arguably was engaged in his official capacity as president is unusable for prosecutors. Jeff Clark, the Justice Department official who tried to send a department letter seeking to interfere with the certification of Georgia’s election results, is no longer listed as a co-conspirator, and in several places, references to any DOJ-related activity are removed. In the timeline Smith has laid out for how the January 6 attack on Congress unfolded, now missing are the efforts by Trump’s advisers and others to convince the president that he needed to tell the rioters to leave the Capitol. Trump’s various responses to the requests are now also gone, including his mid-afternoon tweets that told the rioters to “remain peaceful” without explicitly asking them to leave. Prosecutors also removed from the indictment their description of the video message he filmed from the Rose Garden later that day. Perhaps the boldest decision Smith made in retooling his indictment was to keep his allegations about the Pence pressure campaign. The Supreme Court said that alleged conduct was “presumptively immune” and put the burden on prosecutors to prove that criminal liability for those acts wouldn’t intrude on a president’s Executive Branch authorities. In response, Smith tried to distinguish Trump’s January 6-related interactions with Pence from the role a vice president plays as a president’s close adviser and potential replacement. The new indictment repeatedly describes Trump’s conduct towards Pence as stemming from Pence’s position as his running mate and as the president of the Senate, who would preside over Congress’ certification of the election results – a process separate from the Executive Branch in which Trump had no involvement. Read more about what was edited in the new indictment against Trump Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record and outlined her policies. Here’s a look at what Trump has proposed on the topic: Here’s a look at where Harris stands on the topic: Read more about the candidates’ policy views.  President Joe Biden will travel to the battleground state of Wisconsin next Thursday, the White House announced. In Wisconsin, the president is expected to tout his “Investing in America agenda.”  It will be the second battleground state the president is expected to travel to after he returns from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he is currently. The president is expected to appear with Vice President Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh on Monday to mark Labor Day.  Though the president is no longer running for reelection, his visit to the battleground state signals an uptick in his travels as the 2024 election looms large. The president has spent the past 9 days out of the public eye in both Santa Ynez, California, and Rehoboth Beach. Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes will be critical to the election. President Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes in 2020. Former President Trump won the state by about 22,700 votes in 2016.  Harris last appeared in Wisconsin for a campaign rally in Milwaukee during the Democratic National Convention. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is yet again drawing scrutiny for past comments surrounding Democratic leaders without children — this time aimed at Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers.  Vance was answering a question about how to “fix the crisis” in American schools, following former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s comment during the Virginia gubernatorial debate in 2021 that parents shouldn’t tell schools what to teach.  The Harris campaign’s rapid response team, @KamalaHQ, posted audio of Vance’s comments on Tuesday. Weingarten yesterday posted on X: “Gross! JD Vance’s comments are sad and insulting to millions of modern families, and school teachers including Catholic nuns, none of whom should be targeted for their family decisions.” In a statement, Weingarten said “it sure seems like Vance lacks an empathy gene.” In response, Vance campaign spokesperson Taylor VanKirk said in a statement to CNN:  “There is no bigger threat to American children than the left wing indoctrination being forced on our schools by elites like Randi Weingarten, with the support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.” Vance himself on Wednesday denied that he criticized Weingarten for not having children. “I didn’t criticize Randy Weingarten for not having kids. I criticized her for wanting to brainwash mine,” he said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. “If she wants to brainwash anybody’s kids, she ought to have her own and leave mine alone,” Vance added. After being announced as Trump’s vice presidential pick, the Ohio senator has faced scrutiny for previously saying the US is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” CNN’s KFile also reported Vance has a history of disparaging comments against those without children, including fundraising emails referring to the “radical childless leaders in this country.” This post has been updated with more comments JD Vance. Take a look at the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country that has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October. Harris: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, the vice president gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed President Joe Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.” The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention last week. Trump: The former presidenthas not specified how he would approach the Israel-Hamas war if reelected to the White House and how his policies would differ from Biden’s. Trump, who has been asked many times during his third presidential run about what actions he would take, only offers vague commentary while criticizing Biden and arguing the October 7 attack would not have happened if he were president. He has defended comments he made in an interview with Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, in which he said Israel needed to “finish up” its war with Hamas and that the country was “losing a lot of support” among the world. Trump — who often claims he was the most pro-Israel president in modern history — argued the country had an issue with its public messaging, saying that “Israel is absolutely losing the PR war.” Shortly after the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence services for being caught unprepared by the attack. The former president has held personal animosity toward Netanyahu ever since the prime minister publicly acknowledged Biden won the 2020 presidential election. The two men met for the first time since Trump left the White House following Netanyahu’s remarks to Congress. The former president said he asked Netanyahu during their meeting how a Jewish person can vote for the Democratic Party. Read more about the candidates’ policy views.  The FBI on Wednesday laid out how Donald Trump’s would-be assassin had researched campaign events for the former president as well as President Joe Biden, but then became “hyper-focused” on the Pennsylvania rally just 40 minutes from the shooter’s home.  The FBI released new photos of the gun used to shoot Trump during the July rally, as well as pictures of his backpack and explosives the shooter had in his car.  Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, detailed how the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, saw the Trump rally as a “target of opportunity.” Officials have not yet identified a motive and said that Crooks expressed “no definitive ideology.” Those searches, Rojek said, also show the detailed searches Crooks made regarding the rally location, including the building where Crooks shot Trump.  On July 6, nearly a week before the rally, Crooks searched online “where Will Trump speak from at Butler Farm Show” as well as “Butler Farm Show podium” and “Butler farm show photos,” according to Rojek.  Two days later, Crooks searched “AGR International,” the company that owned the buildings Crooks climbed before opening fire. On July 9, Crooks searched “ballistic calculator” and the next day, he searched “weather” and “Butler.”   On Crooks’ motive, Bobby Wells, executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch, said investigators have as a “clearer idea of mindset” but that “at this time, the FBI has not identified a motive, nor any co-conspirators or associates of Crooks with advanced knowledge of the attack.”  Rojek said “we see no definitive ideology associated with our subject, either left-leaning or right-leaning.” High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a period of steep inflation. Many voters give President Joe Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Vice President Kamala Harris may also face their frustration. What’s in Harris’ economic agenda What’s in Harris’ tax plan What’s in Donald Trump’s tax and economic plan: Read more about the candidates’ policy views.  If 2024 is anything like 2020 or 2016, the presidential election will be decided by relatively small margins in a handful of states. That means some local battles scattered across the country could have national importance. Here are some of those instances to keep an eye on: Kamala Harris and Tim Walz kick off their bus tour Wednesday in Savannah, Georgia, as they look to broaden Democrats’ reach in the state beyond the metro Atlanta area. Coinciding with the swing, Harris’ campaign is pouring money into advertising in the Savannah media market. According to AdImpact data, Harris’ campaign has spent a total of about $1.7 million in advertising there over the last three weeks and including reservations into this weekend. That ranks 20th among all media markets nationwide in ad spending by the Harris campaign so far, and second in Georgia behind Atlanta, where the Harris campaign has spent about $9.7 million, including bookings through this weekend.  In Savannah, the Harris campaign has put the most money behind a pair of ads, one highlighting her background and “middle-class” upbringing, the other promoting her record as a former prosecutor and touting her toughness as the campaign looks to blunt sharp criticism from the Trump campaign on the issues of immigration and crime. Statewide: Georgia voters, in a premier battleground state, are seeing fierce ad wars play out across their screens, as both sides lob sharp attacks and deliver urgent pitches. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign and its allies have also spent millions toggling between several lines of attack, alternately focusing on the economy, immigration, and crime. Remember, Harris and Walz will sit with CNN for their first joint interview on Thursday as the candidates campaign in the battleground state. The day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris to become the Democratic presidential nominee, CNN reported that Beyoncé had given her sign-off for the vice president to use “Freedom” as her official campaign song. So, it was a seemingly antagonistic choice when the Republican nominee’s campaign played the same Beyoncé song as the backdrop of a recent social media video to showcase former President Donald Trump. From Celine Dion and Foo Fighters to Bruce Springsteen and Prince’s estate numerous artists over the years have objected to the use of their music by the Trump campaign. But depending on how and where their music is used, musicians may have grounds to take action beyond rebuking, according to legal experts. Beyoncé’s representatives did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. But last week, Rolling Stone reported her label threatened to send a cease-and-desist to the Trump campaign after they had used “Freedom” in the social media video, which was posted by Trump’s campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung. Shortly after Beyoncé’s team reportedly threatened legal action, the video was taken down. In a statement to CNN, Cheung said he used “Freedom” to provoke the opposing party. Licensing music and obtaining rights and clearances is an expensive, complicated and litigious business. Movie studios regularly pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to obtain the rights to a single song, while brands can pay millions to repeat a tune in commercials to help sell a product. Political campaigns are no exception. Keep reading about the ins and outs of music rights on the campaign trail. Many congressional Democrats are arguing that Vice President Kamala Harris does not need to focus on laying out a detailed policy agenda as election day looms and should instead highlight the contrast in values between herself and former President Donald Trump. Voters will be more focused on the character and values of the candidates than on policy specifics, more than a dozen Democrats have said in recent weeks in public statements and comments to CNN. “If it turns on character, this election is over. That’s what people are looking for,” Kildee said. Kildee is not running for reelection, but Michigan is set to be a key battleground state this election cycle. While Democrats are hoping to retain the White House, control of Congress is also at stake in the upcoming November elections, and Democrats are on guard to protect their vulnerable members in moderate and more conservative districts. A push to make the presidential election a referendum on values and character would mean that vulnerable Democrats will have more leeway on policy specifics. Read up on how Harris’ allies want her to tweak her campaign ahead of November. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz courted the support of the International Association of Fire Fighters, one of the largest labor unions in the country that has yet to endorse a presidential candidate, in remarks at the union’s annual convention in Boston on Wednesday. Walz made the case for Vice President Kamala Harris as a pro-union candidate, laying out her work protecting union pensions during her time as California attorney general and casting the deciding vote as vice president to pass the 2021 Covid stimulus package that “helped keep workers on the job.” Walz also noted that Harris’ brother-in-law is a retired firefighter and IAFF union member. “When unions are strong, America is strong,” he continued.  Walz sought to rally the firefighters to engage in the presidential race, stressing for those in the audience who are “really not that into politics” that “politics is into you,” while using a baseball metaphor to underscore the impact the union’s support could have on the Harris campaign. “Sisters and brothers in labor, it’s time for you to step up to the plate. We’ve got 69 days to win this thing, 69 days to protect labor rights,” he added. Walz’s remarks were received warmly by the crowd as the Harris and Trump campaigns compete for the union’s endorsement in a bid to earn support from working-class workers around the country. GOP vice presidential candidate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is scheduled to address the union in Boston tomorrow. A group of Democratic strategists is launching a new super PAC geared toward supporting state parties and allied groups in addressing legal challenges surrounding the election, according to officials with the newly formed PAC.  Democracy Defenders PAC will focus on pushing back against “an unprecedented assault from Donald Trump and his allies who seek to undermine the American people’s fundamental right to vote, and confidence their vote will be fairly counted,” a PAC official said.  Former President Barack Obama campaign veteran Jim Messina will be the chair of the group, and Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, an ally of former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams and attorney who worked on the Bush v. Gore case in 2000, will serve as the chief legal adviser. TJ Ducklo, who worked on President Joe Biden’s 2020 and 2024 bids, is departing Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to serve as the group’s chief strategist. Brookings Institute senior fellow and CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen will be an outside counsel to the group.  The group will start with $10 million to offer legal and messaging support to state parties and allied groups, as well as focus on certain battleground states and down-ballot races, officials said. They will continue to raise funds for the efforts in the coming months.   PAC officials also said they will help confront “bad actors” trying to sow doubt about election results after voting in November is complete. Special counsel Jack Smith provided the latest twist in the 2020 election subversion case against former President Donald Trump, filing a retooled indictment Tuesday that he hopes comports with the US Supreme Court’s controversial immunity ruling and will let the case move forward. The slimmed-down indictment clocks in at 36 pages, down from the original 45 pages. The special counsel did not drop any of the four counts against Trump, but he was forced by the conservative Supreme Court justices to refashion the allegations underlying the charges. The Republican presidential nominee previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, which stem from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election after he lost to Joe Biden resulting in the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. The new indictment was filed mere weeks before voters begin casting ballots in the 2024 presidential election, but a trial isn’t expected to happen anytime soon. What happens next: Although the charges haven’t changed, Trump must enter a new plea to the superseding indictment. Prosecutors on Tuesday indicated they would waive a requirement for the former president to appear in court. Meanwhile, expect Trump to continue his strategy of challenging every aspect of the case, especially since the Supreme Court left aspects of the case unresolved. “Trump still can litigate and then appeal the immunity issue before trial,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. “There’s no chance this trial happens before the election.” Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Gov. Tim Walz are set to embark on a bus tour of Georgia today, putting a spotlight on one of the top presidential battlegrounds this election. In the wake of President Joe Biden’s narrow 2020 victory there, both parties are fiercely contesting the state. Georgia ranks third in total presidential ad buys, at $174.5 million, including spending by campaigns and outside groups from both parties since the start of 2023, and including their future bookings through Election Day. That trails only Pennsylvania, a behemoth at $356.8 million in total presidential ad buys, and Michigan, at $196.9 million, according to AdImpact data. And Atlanta ranks second among media markets with the most presidential ad buys, at $118.7 million total, behind only Philadelphia, at $152.7 million.  Where things stand: Excluding future reservations — counting only what has already aired, from the start of 2023 through today — Georgia has seen $102.7 million in presidential ad spending so far, and Democrats have outspent Republicans there by about $57.1 million to $44.7 million. In the period since Biden dropped out and upended the race on July 21, through today, Georgia has seen a flood of ad spending, $59.6 million total, also ranking third overall, also behind Pennsylvania ($112.9 million) and Michigan ($78 million). Republicans have outspent Democrats in Georgia by about $34.3 million to $23.7 million during that stretch, since Biden withdrew through today. But going forward, in the post-Labor Day sprint to Election Day, Democrats are poised to outspend Republicans in Georgia by about $37.9 million to $26.4 million, according to future bookings currently recorded by AdImpact.  With a total of $64.4 million in future bookings, Georgia ranks second among states projected to see the most presidential ad spending through Election Day, behind only Pennsylvania, with $133.7 million in total future bookings remaining. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance will speak at the International Association of Firefighters Convention on Thursday — a day after his opponent Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is speaking — according to a source familiar.  Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, the International Association of Fire Fighters became the first major labor group to officially endorse a candidate in the 2020 campaign, throwing its support behind Joe Biden. The union has yet to endorse a candidate this cycle. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN that “both candidates here have agreed to the exact same rules” in favor of unmuted microphones during the upcoming September 10 debate — despite former President Donald Trump saying he “reached an agreement” to participate with the same rules as the CNN debate in June, which included muted microphones. “The question you have to ask is to Donald Trump and his team,” he said, while affirming that “we fully intend to debate” even if the microphones are muted while candidates are not speaking. Luna, a self-described 32-year-old “MAGA Trump supporter” from the battleground state of Wisconsin, has gained a huge following since she joined X, formerly Twitter, in March. Her timeline has become a digital bullhorn for the “Make America Great Again” movement, praising former President Donald Trump’s reelection bid, promoting conspiracy theories about his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, and touting Republican talking points to nearly 30,000 followers, who she addresses as “patriots.” But Luna isn’t real. The photos of the smiling brunette posted periodically on @Luna_2K24’s timeline are of Debbie Nederlof, a German fashion influencer who lives across the Atlantic and won’t be voting in the US presidential election in November. When CNN reached out to the 32-year-old, a trained optician and single mother who is working two jobs, at a marketing firm and as a model to raise money for her child, she was angry and frustrated that her face was being used to push pro-Trump propaganda on X. Nederlof is one of 17 real European women — fashion and beauty influencers from the Netherlands, Denmark and as far away as Russia — whose online photos have been stolen by unknown actors to promote Trump and his pick as running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, on X, a CNN investigation in collaboration with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) has found. CIR is an independent, nonprofit social enterprise that describes itself as dedicated to exposing human rights abuses. It receives funding for individual projects from governments, nongovernmental organizations and individuals. Keep reading about the influencers who have become the face of fake MAGA accounts against their will. Inflation has cooled so much over the past year that even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is pleased with the progress. But, in poll after poll, Americans have sent a clear message: They aren’t. That has created a prime opportunity for Vice President Kamala Harris to take a populist approach to how she’ll handle the economy if elected president. “[A]s president, I will bring together labor and workers and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries,” she said. Harris continued by attempting to contrast herself with former President Donald Trump, who she claimed has only elite interests top of mind. Her approach may jive well with some voters, but there’s an open question as to whether the economic policies she has proposed — which thus far have been only vaguely outlined in speeches and fact sheets shared with reporters and aren’t on her campaign site — will benefit them in the long run, if at all. (The Harris campaign declined to comment.) Read the full analysis of Harris’ economic proposals. Ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz’s bus tour in southern Georgia, Democratic strategists and organizers see a real opportunity to reach voters in the rural pockets of the state.  Butler said the voters Harris encounters on the tour will primarily want to hear about how the Harris-Walz ticket will work to improve their lives from an economic standpoint.  This means a message grounded in reducing inflation and advancing affordable health care, Butler said.  Democratic strategist Fred Hicks says Democrats can’t afford to overlook any part of the state.  “In order to make Georgia truly competitive and give yourself any kind of breathing room, they’re going to need to get votes, drive up Democratic votes outside of Metro Atlanta,” Hicks said. The veteran strategist says he’s watching how Walz, in particular, connects with voters in the rural South.  A conservative outside group launched an ad Wednesday slamming Kamala Harris over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, aimed to coincide with its third anniversary this week. The new ad, from the group Veterans On Duty, features a clip of Vice President Harris in a 2021 interview with CNN, discussing her role in the administration’s handling of the withdrawal. “This is the true cost of Kamala Harris’s failed leadership. Tell Vice President Harris it’s time to protect our national security,” the ad warns. The ad began airing on cable news stations in the Washington, DC, media market – not targeting battleground voters, but rather elected officials, media members and influencers in the nation’s capital, likely aimed at shaping the conversation around the heavily criticized withdrawal’s third anniversary this week. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign stirred new controversy this week during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery that was intended to draw attention to the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. A person physically blocked Trump’s team from accompanying him during the Monday visit, two Trump campaign officials said. A cemetery spokesperson confirmed to CNN “there was an incident” and a “report was filed” but didn’t provide further details. Trump was visiting the cemetery following a wreath laying to honor 13 US military service members who were killed at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate. Monday marked three years since the tragedy. In a post on Truth Social, Trump appeared to suggest the incident stemmed from his campaign’s use of photography, sharing a statement from the family members of the fallen soldiers expressing their approval. “We had given our approval for President Trump’s official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured and so we can cherish these memories forever,” the families said.  But according to a statement from Arlington National Cemetery obtained by CNN, federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries. Trump’s post came after a report from NPR about a “verbal and physical altercation.” A source with knowledge of the incident told the outlet that a cemetery official attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. In response, Trump campaign staff “verbally abused and pushed the official aside,” according to NPR. Read more about the reported incident at Arlington National Cemetery here. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a new ad focused on Project 2025, the policy blueprint crafted by conservative allies of former President Donald Trump, to warn of the consequences of a second Trump administration. The ad will run in the days leading up to the September 10 presidential debate. The new ad, which will air on TV and digital as part of the campaign’s previous $370 million advertising commitment, reiterates Democrats’ framing of the plan — published by the think tank Heritage Foundation — as a “922-page blueprint to make Donald Trump the most powerful president ever.” “Donald Trump may try to deny it, but those are Donald Trump’s plans,” it continues. The ad is the latest effort by Democrats to frame Project 2025 as the outline for the next Trump administration. Harris references the document regularly in campaign speeches. In her remarks accepting the Democratic nomination at the party’s convention last week, Harris pointed to Project 2025 as evidence that “we know what a second Trump term would look like,” arguing “its sum total is to pull our country back to the past.” What Trump says about Project 2025: Trump and his campaign have repeatedly denied any direct links between the campaign and the conservative groups behind the proposal. But at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found. CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report. #Trump## Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will campaign together in Georgia for the first time this week, targeting the southeastern portion of the state and providing a window into their strategy in the crucial battleground ahead of November. Few states will be more closely watched than Georgia for signs of how voters are responding to campaign outreach and the newly minted ticket, making it a fitting kickoff for Harris and Walz on the heels of the Democratic National Convention. Four years ago, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992, winning it by fewer than 12,000 votes. When Harris and Walz launch their bus tour in the Peach State Wednesday, they’ll be making a rare trip through southern Georgia, a region that typically leans Republican but where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock had success in the 2022 Senate runoff. Read more about the Harris campaign bus tour in Georgia here. Special counsel Jack Smith defiantly re-injected the question of Donald Trump’s bid to steal the 2020 election into the intensifying end game of this year’s White House race. By trying to rescue his case after his initial indictment was gutted by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, Smith signaled that he is determined to bring the former president to justice — even though there will be no trial before Election Day. His move underscored the huge personal investment Trump has in winning the presidency in November: He not only would return to the nation’s top office, but would also gain the authority to halt this and another federal case against him and head off any sentences that could include jail time if he is convicted. The conservative majority’s ruling earlier this summer that Trump could be covered by immunity from criminal prosecution for some of his actions as president represented one of the most consequential moments in Supreme Court history and has massive implications for the US system of government. Read the full analysis. Two years before Iranian hackers breached Donald Trump’s campaign this summer, they used a similar ploy to target a former administration official and onetime confidant of John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser and prominent Iran critic. After infiltrating the person’s email account, the hackers sent what seemed like a harmless request to a group of fellow US-based Iran hawks, asking them to review a supposed book the person was writing about Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs. The email encouraged the half-dozen recipients to click a link that promised to take them to the supposed manuscript. Instead, it contained malicious code that would have granted the hackers unfettered access to the targets’ computers. Not long after the email was sent, the person notified the FBI and warned colleagues in a subsequent email of a “pretty sophisticated hack” that was impersonating them. A CNN review of the hacking group, which experts believe works on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, reveals previously unreported details of the hackers’ multiyear operation, including how they have targeted former members of both the Trump and Biden administrations. The quiet but relentless Iranian effort to hack current and former US officials across multiple administrations has attracted fresh attention from US intelligence agencies in recent weeks, as Iran has emerged as one of the most aggressive foreign powers trying to sow discord ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Read the full story. Former President Barack Obama offered a note of caution to Democrats buzzing over Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign, telling donors on Martha’s Vineyard on Monday night that the party needs to ramp up its focus — and spending — on down-ballot races across the country. The NDRC told CNN the fundraiser brought in $1.7 million.  Obama said Republicans have been trying to “redraw maps and manipulate the rules” — which are backed up by courts “that are willing to uphold unfair maps and unfair rules.” This is an obstacle for Democrats, he said, policies aside. “Politics in America is and always has been, not simply a matter of rhetoric and joy and excitement. It is also nuts and bolts exercises of power,” Obama said, adding that Democrats need to address these “nuts and bolts” to help Harris. Democrats lost more than a thousand seats in state legislatures during Obama’s presidency, while also suffering a string of defeats at the gubernatorial level and in the US Congress. Meantime, Republicans won a 2010 House landslide before taking control of the Senate in 2014. The damage at the state level, though, has been the most difficult for Democrats to unwind, in part due to gerrymandering by state GOP leaders. Former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have both been added to Donald Trump’s transition team. They endorsed the GOP presidential nominee in recent days. Gabbard, who now identifies as an independent, endorsed Trump on Monday at a National Guard conference in Detroit. Kennedy praised Trump as he joined the former president on stage at an Arizona rally on Friday, hours after suspending his own campaign. Former President Donald Trump praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after earning his endorsement but didn’t explicitly say whether he would have a role in a potential second Trump administration. CNN reported Tuesday that Kennedy was added to the Trump transition team. Trump said Kennedy’s support can help his campaign “build up the margins” and said the election – which several polls suggest will be a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris – could be a “landslide” for Republicans.  Trump agreed when Dr. Phil said there are many things Kennedy could offer in a potential Trump administration, suggesting something environmental or attorney general.  “That’s true,” Trump said. Weeks before the 2022 midterms, a stranger showed up at the Denver headquarters of Dominion Voting Systems. He didn’t have an appointment, so the front desk asked him to leave. But staffers noticed him lingering outside, and one Dominion executive spotted a rifle case and scope in his vehicle. A week later, the man returned, rambling about supposed problems with election security. He then said he had a pistol in his car. Alarmed, Dominion staff involved the police and obtained a restraining order. The episode, described in court filings and by a senior Dominion official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, is part of the continued fallout from 2020 election lies. The impact has been acutely felt at Dominion, the voting technology company that became the poster child for baseless right-wing voter fraud claims in 2020. The avalanche of disinformation forced voting companies and election officials to overhaul their approach for 2024, according to interviews with nearly a dozen people involved in running the election. They’ve ramped up investments in physical security, found new ways to combat false claims, and cracked down on employees’ political postings. Yet, more than one year after Fox News paid Dominion $787 million, the largest known defamation settlement in US media history, former President Donald Trump and his allies are still flooding right-wing media with the lie that voting machine companies rigged the 2020 election — and that the 2024 election might be stolen too. Even as they adapt for 2024, some involved in administering elections still fear for their lives. There has been an exodus of election workers who have quit or retired. Read the full story. Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of the social media company Meta, is handing Republicans political victories ahead of the 2024 presidential election, acquiescing to years of GOP grievances over his company’s policies. In recent days, the Meta chief executive has made newsworthy public statements implicitly supporting right-wing “censorship” narratives and offered praise for Donald Trump as “badass” – even as he claimed he wanted to appear “neutral” and nonpartisan. On Monday, Zuckerberg sent a letter to the powerful House Judiciary Committee, stating that the Biden administration had “pressured” Meta to “censor” content during the pandemic. The Meta chief added that the pressure he felt was “wrong” and he came to “regret” that his company, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, was not more outspoken. The letter was immediately weaponized by Trump, who used it to once again promote the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee also welcomed Zuckerberg’s letter, posting a copy Monday on s﻿ocial media and using it to attack President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now running as the Democratic nominee for president.  The letter was sent amid a two-year investigation by House Republicans into the content moderation policies of major social media networks. Read more here. Former President Donald Trump is soliciting donations after Tuesday afternoon’s superseding indictment. He said in an email, “I WAS JUST INDICTED AGAIN!” and called it “Another Jack Smith HOAX!” Trump also slammed the superseding indictment in a series of posts on Truth Social. What happened: Special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday filed a reworked indictment in the federal election interference case against Trump. Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges that they initially brought against the former president. However, the newly retooled indictment has carved out some of Trump’s alleged conduct, including allegations about the attempts to use the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud. Prosecutors are working to try to comply with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling."
The right-wing activist riding a wave of opposition to DEI in corporate America | CNN Business,"Updated 1:02 PM EDT, Wed August 28, 2024",2024-08-28T09:00:20.903Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/business/dei-john-deere-harley-davidson-robby-starbuck/index.html,"Robby Starbuck, a former Hollywood music video director turned conservative activist, has caught fire campaigning online against some major American brands’ diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI), support for gay Pride marches and LGBTQ events, strategies to slow climate change and other social policies. Starbuck is both riding a wave of right-wing hostility to DEI programs and corporate advocacy on issues like climate change and LGBTQ rights and advancing the opposition himself. He has channeled energy on the right to target specific brands popular with politically conservative customers — Harley-Davidson, Tractor Supply Co. and John Deere — and relentlessly drawn attention online to their past publicly-stated policies. Starbuck has also claimed credit for Brown-Forman and Lowe’s internal announcements in recent weeks to scale back some of their diversity and inclusion programs. Starbuck has selected brands whose programs on some of these issues were only implemented in recent years and may be less likely to resist pressure. The full impact of his activism is not entirely clear, but companies are rethinking their programs amid a changing political environment and online pressure. Starbuck told CNN in a phone interview last month that he is “exposing” companies. But more than anything, Starbuck is showing how “haphazard” many companies’ support for diversity, inclusion and climate programs were to start, said Shaun Harper, a professor of education and business at the University of Southern California and founder and executive director of its Race and Equity Center. “The larger takeaway is about the fragility of corporate DEI initiatives. If one person can take to Twitter and ultimately inflame a campaign to dismantle DEI in large companies, it means those things were not strong to begin with,” Harper said. “Most companies and the people who lead them were not committed to this in the first place.” Starbuck, 35, whose legal name is Robert Starbuck, lives outside of Nashville with his wife, Landon, and their three school-age kids. Landon Starbuck has been a leading advocate in Tennessee for right-wing causes like banning both transgender-affirming medical care for minors and drag shows with children present. Starbuck’s X account has more than a half-million followers. His posts and videos on the companies have been amplified by both customers and prominent right-wing leaders like Elon Musk. Starbuck told CNN that corporate DEI programs — generally a mix of employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices to encourage representation among people of different races, genders, classes and other identities— are “evil” and a “Trojan horse for pushing leftism.” Corporate policies to slow down the effects of human-caused climate change do “nothing positive for society,” he said. The climate has “always changed,” Starbuck said, and human beings have “very little control” over it. (This is false. It is the overwhelming consensus of scientists that human-generated fossil fuel pollution – what comes from burning coal, gas and oil – is the primary cause of global warming.) And gay pride parades and LBGTQ events, which are held to celebrate gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, who until 2020 were legally allowed to be fired from their jobs because of their sexual orientation, promote sex to children, Starbuck said, so companies should stop sponsoring them. (Eric Bloem, the vice president of programs and corporate advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, said that “Pride has always been about celebrating, affirming, and uplifting LGBTQ+ people” and rejecting “intimidation and fear from those who try to silence us.”) Starbuck said he has two employees who help him research companies’ policies and executives’ backgrounds. He said he is not receiving outside funding and is self-funding his efforts. He also relies on $5 monthly payments from subscribers on X, although he declined to share how many people subscribed. Starbuck also promotes miscellaneous products such as t-shirts, books, supplements and other products on his Linktree website. He told CNN that he wants corporate America to stay out of social issues and is only interested in pushing a “neutral” stance. “It’s corporate accountability for companies that depend on conservative consumers,” he said. But Starbuck, who was endorsed by Republican Sen. Rand Paul and right-wing activists like Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens when he ran unsuccessfully as a write-in candidate in a 2022 Republican congressional primary, is not promoting a neutral agenda, said Brayden King, a professor of management and organizations at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “The phrase ‘neutrality’ is often used by activists who are pushing a non-neutral agenda. It’s a clever frame used by activists to get them to do what activists want,” King said. Businesses are also not taking measures on diversity and climate because they want to advance a left-wing political agenda, he said. “These companies are not taking measures because they have an ideological bias,” he said. “Most companies are trying to navigate without creating controversy.” Starbuck, who said his mother and grandparents fled Cuba during the 1960s to escape the Castro regime, began his career in Hollywood and started a production company. He worked on commercials, films and music videos for artists like Akon and the Smashing Pumpkins. In 2015, he said he endorsed Donald Trump for president, believing Trump would disrupt politics. Three years later, Starbuck and his wife moved to Franklin, Tennessee, a wealthy suburb outside Nashville, and became politically active. During the pandemic, Starbuck campaigned against Covid-19 mask and vaccine mandates. (Hundreds of millions of people have received Covid-19 vaccines, which are safe and effective, according to the CDC. Adverse events after the Covid-19 vaccines are rare, the CDC says.) Starbuck and Landon also became vocal supporters of bills in Tennessee banning gender-affirming medical care for minors and criminalizing drag shows on public property or in areas where they could be viewed by a minor. The Human Rights Campaign said in a press release that Tennessee is the “state with the most anti-equality laws enacted in modern times.” Earlier this year, before Starbuck’s campaign against corporations began, the couple released a film on X baselessly arguing that companies, LGBTQ performers and liberal Americans are indoctrinating and sexualizing children. The film, “The War on Children,”  was promoted by other right-wing personalities such Musk, Donald Trump Jr. and Republican leaders. But Rolling Stone reported that Starbuck and his production team misled interview subjects about the subject of the film and Starbuck’s involvement in it. Producers, the magazine reported, told one drag show performer she was contributing to a documentary exploring the challenges faced by transgender children and the impact of gender-affirming care bans. (Starbuck rejects the characterization that the performer was misled.) In 2020, corporate DEI initiatives picked up after a wave of protests for racial justice in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd. That year, Companies spent an estimated $7.5 billion on DEI-related efforts, such as employee resource groups, according to a McKinsey study. But companies have become ripe targets for activism from the political right in recent years. Republican leaders like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and right-wing commentators like Matt Walsh and others have pressured brands like Bud Light, Disney and Nike to roll back their inclusivity efforts. Last year, Bud Light’s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a months-long boycott of the beer brand. The boycott and the company’s subsequent tepid response likely lost parent company  Anheuser-Busch InBe v as much as $1.4 billion in sales, according to the company. In June, Starbuck began advocating against brands’ policies, starting with Tractor Supply, known for selling animal feed, pet food and lawn and garden equipment in suburban and rural areas. “I thought, as a customer, I don’t want to spend my money there,” Starbuck said. “I don’t want money I spend there turned around and used on policies or activism that I wholly disagree with.” “It’s time to expose Tractor Supply,” he first posted June 6, drawing attention to corporate components like “LGBTQIA+ events at work” and “a DEI council.” Other conservative political candidates, activists and customers began criticizing the company on social media and said they would stop shopping at the chain. “We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,” Tractor Supply said in a statement on June 27 . “We have taken this feedback to heart.” The company announced it was eliminating jobs and goals focused on diversity, equity and inclusion; withdrawing its carbon emission reduction goals; and ending sponsorships for Pride festivals and voting campaigns. In July, following weeks of Starbuck’s campaigning against John Deere, the company announced it will no longer sponsor “social or cultural awareness” events and will audit all its training materials. Harley-Davidson pulled back on DEI policies after Starbuck campaigned against the brand. On August 19, Harley-Davidson said it ended its DEI “function” in April after an internal review of its policies, and it will no longer have goals to increase spending with diverse suppliers as a result of a review initiated earlier this year. The company also said it would end its relationship with the Human Rights Campaign. “We are saddened by the negativity on social media over the last few weeks, designed to divide the Harley-Davidson community,” the company wrote in a statement posted on X. “It is our responsibility to respond with clarity, action and facts.” Harley Davidson said it was still committed to DEI. Brown-Forman, the owner of Jack Daniels, also said Thursday in an internal memo that  it will end its push for more diverse suppliers, stop linking executive compensation to diversity and stop working with the Human Rights Campaign’s Rights Corporate Equality Index survey. Starbuck said on X that he was set to launch a public campaign against Brown-Forman and had been gathering information on the company. Brown-Forman had no additional comment to CNN. Lowe’s said in a recent note to employees that it will no longer participate in surveys for the Human Rights Campaign and will combine its individual business resource groups representing diverse sections of its employees into one umbrella organization. The company will no longer sponsor or participate in events outside of these areas, such as “festivals, parades and fairs.” The company said it began reviewing its policies more than a year ago. Starbuck claimed credit for Lowe’s move. He said on X that he had messaged Lowe’s executives last week. Lowe’s spokesperson Steve Salazar told CNN that Starbuck’s outreach to the company came after the company “already announced changes that had long been in process.” Although Tractor Supply, Deere and Harley Davidson warned investors that a failure to meet climate and diversity goals could hurt business, Starbuck says these policies were a mistake to begin with. “Was it a good thing that they got more racial diversity as a byproduct of focusing on DEI? No,” Starbuck said. “What makes it bad is that they looked at it through the lens of race. This should have never been a consideration in any metric.” Companies should avoid climate change activism and developing their own policies to combat climate change because it’s a divisive issue, he said. Instead, he said, if companies are focused on the environment, they should identify unifying issues like water conservation efforts. “I don’t think (climate change activism) does anything to help anybody. I think doing it might make somebody in HR feel better about themselves because they got their company to say the words climate change,” he said. Tractor Supply said that although it’s ending carbon emissions reduction efforts, it plans to focus on land and water conservation efforts. King from Northwestern said that while land and water conservation are admirable, they won’t do anything to slow climate change or the economic risks that businesses face from climate change. “Companies have to consider that the political climate will change again, and when it does, they will be judged differently than they are now for dropping their climate and emissions goal,” he said. “The consequences for climate change are going to be more visible and more serious with each year.” But Starbuck plans to keep putting pressure on companies. He has his next few companies picked out, although he did not disclose which. “We’re making change happen,” he said. If Starbuck achieves his goal of eliminating DEI initiatives, companies are likely to recruit and hire from a narrower pool of candidates, say experts on corporate management and strategy. Companies with DEI teams tend to have a higher share of Asian, Black and Hispanic employees than companies without DEI teams , according to a study by Revelio Labs, which tracks hiring trends. Companies’ carbon emissions will also continue to grow, worsening the effects of climate change, these experts say. And company bottom lines may also take a hit. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives can boost  profits, reduce employee attrition and increase employee motivation, according to Boston Consulting Group research based on data from more than 27,000 employees in 16 countries. These companies are “backing themselves into a couple of traps,” said Alvin Tillery Jr., a professor of political science and director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University. Tillery consults with corporations and governments on diversity programs. “If you get tagged with a reputation for not being open as a company, the damage that can accrue to you is really problematic.” Tillery noted that Harley-Davidson and John Deere both have older customer bases, and their decisions may alienate customers and workers their businesses will need to rely on in the future. Climate change also threatens industries from food to insurance and drives up costs for businesses and consumers. Tractor Supply, John Deere and Harley-Davidson have warned investors in securities filings that climate change poses significant risks to their businesses. “Many of the controversial social issues like climate change are also critical business issues. It is the same for talent management (and hiring),” said Cynthia Clark, a professor of corporate governance at Bentley University. “Both affect the company in the short and long term.” Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify Robby Starbuck’s legal name."
Congressional Democrats urge Harris to focus on character over policy on campaign trail | CNN Politics,"Published 12:02 PM EDT, Wed August 28, 2024",2024-08-28T16:02:28.118Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/politics/congressional-democrats-harris-campaign-values-policy/index.html,"Many congressional Democrats are arguing that Vice President Kamala Harris does not need to focus on laying out a detailed policy agenda as election day looms and should instead highlight the contrast in values between herself and former President Donald Trump. Voters will be more focused on the character and values of the candidates than on policy specifics, more than a dozen Democrats have said in recent weeks in public statements and comments to CNN. “I actually think the way the American people think about this choice is less about the minutiae of policy and more about the direction of the country, number one, and secondly, about the person. Character it does matter,” Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee told CNN while in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention. “If it turns on character, this election is over. That’s what people are looking for,” Kildee said. Kildee is not running for reelection, but Michigan is set to be a key battleground state this election cycle. While Democrats are hoping to retain the White House, control of Congress is also at stake in the upcoming November elections, and Democrats are on guard to protect their vulnerable members in moderate and more conservative districts. A push to make the presidential election a referendum on values and character would mean that vulnerable Democrats will have more leeway on policy specifics. Chairwoman of the centrist New Democrat Coalition Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire suggested that there can be strength in keeping the details vague, for now. “She doesn’t need to negotiate against herself. You know, we’ve got the biggest possible tent right now,” she said of Harris. “I don’t think there’s a real, strong reason for her to try and weed out any points of view right now.” Harris has outlined some early policy proposals, including a plan to provide tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans, and has voiced support for continuing many of President Joe Biden’s measures, such as lowering drug costs and eliminating so-called junk fees. But she has also pitched her campaign in terms of overall ideas and values, describing her vision as “an opportunity economy” that focuses on strengthening the middle class and punishes bad actors who try to unfairly raise costs. Now congressional Democrats are pushing to keep the focus on the big picture and values-based promises. CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. Republicans have broadly criticized Harris, arguing her policy agenda lacks substance and specifics. Trump has echoed that line of attack against Harris – accusing her of focusing more on him throughout her DNC speech than certain policy areas. On the heels of Harris’ Democratic convention speech, Trump’s running mate GOP Sen. JD Vance said in a radio appearance that Democrats are running a race “completely divorced from details or policy,” and while Harris is trying to “make herself the change agent,” American voters aren’t going to buy it in November. “What I’m hearing from voters is they’re looking for that candidate to bring us together. I haven’t heard from many voters looking for white papers and policy papers,” Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams said. Williams, the chair of the state Democratic Party of Georgia, which is a critical battleground state, also said “Harris is for thinking, looking towards the future and moving us out of the hatred and division of Donald Trump’s politics.” Ahead of the Democratic National Convention 36% of registered voters said Harris had not made it clear what she stood for, according to a CBS poll. Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, who is running for his ninth term in Congress, insisted Americans don’t vote on policy prescriptions and instead “they want to see who you are. What’s your character? Can you relate? Can you lead? Are you competent?” Democrats are hoping to capitalize on momentum from the DNC, and say they have the energy on their side. “This election will clearly be won or lost on vibes and Democrats right now are winning in the vibes department after the DNC,” a Democratic aide told CNN. “We don’t need to focus on the nitty gritty. Right now we just need to focus on winning.” Kuster also said the focus should be on candidate character and comparing “our values to the values of the chaos and drama of the Trump-Vance ticket. And so that’s where I think you’ll have people focused is, ‘do they reflect our values? Compassion, caring,’ you know, this sense that we are rebuilding America, that we’re providing jobs and opportunity and bringing down costs for hardworking American families,” she said. “Those are the values that drive us, and there will be plenty of time, and certainly, in the transition, we’ll all be involved in getting deep into policy positions.” Democratic Senator Brian Schatz, who is a member of Senate Democratic leadership, argued that Harris should tell voters what broader issues she wants to focus on if she is elected president, and can then work with the legislature to hammer out the details next Congress. “We’re actually in the final stages of a campaign. We’re both at the beginning and at the final stages, and so policy papers are for spring,” he said. “And voters want to know what direction you’re going, but I honestly, I truly think it’s more honest with the voters to say ‘here are the 10 things that I’m going to work on’ than to engage in false precision and post a 700-page document with leg text all done.” Schatz continued, “The job of the chief executive is to set national priorities, to work with the legislature and figure out what the market will bear. This idea that we’re supposed to post bills as if they are in final form is for 12 people who run podcasts.” Another Democratic aide noted it’s all in the presentation and there can be a way to hit home big ideas on that trail. “You can articulate what policies you support, you can articulate what you want to get done, but it doesn’t have to be legislative text and it can still be substantive.” Connolly pointed to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s failed presidential bid in 2020 as an example. “Elizabeth Warren had a policy for every issue you could imagine. Remember, I got a policy for that. And how did she do?” Connolly said at this juncture Harris must persuade people she is “someone I trust and have confidence in.” CNN’s Kit Maher, Ebony Davis and Sheden Tesfaldet contributed"
Harris’ economic plan is a response to voters’ frustrations. Appeasing them carries steep costs | CNN Business,"Published 8:52 AM EDT, Wed August 28, 2024",2024-08-28T12:52:23.857Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/economy/harris-economic-policy-populism/index.html,"Inflation has cooled so much over the past year that even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is pleased with the progress. But, in poll after poll, Americans have sent a clear message: They aren’t. That has created a prime opportunity for Vice President Kamala Harris to take a populist approach to how she’ll handle the economy if elected president. “We will create what I call an opportunity economy … where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed,” Harris said in her speech at last week’s Democratic National Convention, where she formally accepted the party’s nomination for president. “[A]s president, I will bring together labor and workers and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries,” she said. Harris continued by attempting to contrast herself with former President Donald Trump, who she claimed has only elite interests top of mind. Her approach may jive well with some voters, but there’s an open question as to whether the economic policies she has proposed — which thus far have been only vaguely outlined in speeches and fact sheets shared with reporters and aren’t on her campaign site — will benefit them in the long run, if at all. (The Harris campaign declined to comment.) One of Harris’ key economic agenda items involves providing up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time home buyers. This, along with several of Harris’ other economic proposals, would require congressional approval. Her down-payment assistance proposition comes as home prices are at a record high — a likely reason why the share of Americans who plan to purchase a home in the next six months is at the lowest level in over a decade, according to new data from the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence July survey released Tuesday. On the surface, it may sound like a good idea to provide financial assistance to Americans to help them cover what’s become an even heftier down payment. But Jaret Seiberg, policy analyst at TD Ameritrade, sees a few issues. He said it would benefit “homeowners at the expense of home buyers.” That’s because, by itself, the plan would “boost demand without increasing the supply of available homes. More bidders mean higher prices,” he said in a note earlier this month after Harris delivered a campaign speech in North Carolina that unveiled parts of her economic policy. “Such programs also produce little benefit despite costing a lot of money,” he added. In total, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the first-time home buyer credit Harris is proposing — which would be in effect for four years and applicable to 4 million home buyers, according to campaign figures — would raise the federal deficit by at least $100 billion over 10 years. Harris also proposed a plan to stop food companies from allegedly gouging consumers. She would introduce new laws that would limit food manufacturers’ and grocers’ ability to raise prices. This comes as grocery costs have risen by more than 20% since she took office alongside President Joe Biden. But food price pressures have been fading, with costs up 1.1% for the 12 months ended in July, down from their 2022 peak of over 13%. Harris’ plan would involve “new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules,” she said in an August 16 campaign speech. Many economists, including Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration, have spoken out against this policy, arguing it could create more problems than it solves. For starters, it could lead to shortages of goods if businesses, as a result, put fewer products on the market if the profit margins they could earn are lower or if people buy more than they otherwise would have, absent any price controls. “This is not sensible policy, and I think the biggest hope is that it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality,” Furman told The New York Times earlier this month. “There’s no upside here, and there is some downside.” At the same time, he said in a CNBC interview this week that “there’s too much populism in both political parities” and there’s “too little recognition” of the positive contributions businesses have had on the economy. In a play to win over voters who work in the service and hospitality industries, a disproportionate share of whom live in Nevada, a key swing state, Trump vowed to eliminate taxes on their tips. Two months after he floated it, Harris made a similar campaign promise. “This is good politics, but bad policy,” Erica York, senior economist and research director at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, told CNN. She expressed concern that eliminating taxes on tips would be overly complicated and unfair to workers other than the “tiny slice” who would benefit. Removing federal taxes on tips also has big implications for the federal budget deficit, though the amount would depend on what provisions the legislation contains. But just excluding tips from federal income taxes could reduce revenues by at least $107 billion over 10 years, according to the Tax Foundation. Like Harris, Trump has also leaned in to populism despite mountains of criticism from economists. For instance, in addition to eliminating taxes on tips, he’s advocating for ending taxes on Social Security for seniors. If enacted, that could deplete trust funds for Social Security and Medicare sooner and leave seniors worse off. He’s also proposed enacting sweeping tariffs, including a 60% levy on imports from China, in an attempt to boost the American workforce. Economists have warned that such steep tariffs could fuel higher inflation — or even worse, put the economy in a recession. Despite criticizing Trump, Harris hasn’t shared many details on what she would do regarding tariffs. Biden has left in place some of the tariffs on Chinese imports Trump enacted and has floated introducing new tariffs."
"Carole King, Elizabeth Warren and others join ‘Swifties for Kamala’ call: ‘As single cat ladies…we are part of this campaign’ | CNN","Updated 8:49 AM EDT, Wed August 28, 2024",2024-08-28T04:00:19.756Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/entertainment/carole-king-elizabeth-warren-swifties-for-kamala/index.html,"Left-leaning Taylor Swift fans joined artists like Carole King and politicians, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, for a Zoom call organized by the group “Swifties for Kamala” in an effort to mobilize fans of the pop superstar to vote for Kamala Harris. Swift herself has no affiliation with the group and was not involved in the call on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to Swift’s representative for comment on the event. “Swifties for Kamala” has amassed roughly a quarter of a million followers across multiple social media platforms since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek a second term and endorsed Vice President Harris. More than 26,000 participants registered to join the Tuesday evening call, which raised It raised more than $138,000 for the campaign and featured remarks by Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), Rep. Becca Balint (D-VT) and chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party Anderson Clayton. Irene Kim, the co-founder of “Swifties for Kamala,” had previously told CNN the group was hopeful Harris or her running mate, Tim Walz, might join the call, though neither were present. “Hello Swifties!” is how Warren, the first speaker of the night, greeted the group as heart, thumbs up and party emojis flowed through the Zoom stream. “You are resilient, and you know how to take on bullies and you know how to be your most authentic, most joyful selves,” Warren said. “You come together hand-in-hand, friendship bracelets on your wrist, and you overcome pretty much anything that life throws at you. And that is what the Kamala Harris campaign is all about. It’s about standing up for what is right in the face of bullies, like Donald Trump.” King sang her favorite Swift song, “Shake It Off,” on the call, telling those gathered not to be afraid of standing up and using their voice in the lead-up to the election. “I’ve been a political activist for years, I’ve been a volunteer, I’ve been doorknocker, even as a famous person,” King said. “I am a Swiftie, and Taylor and I are actually friends,” the music legend also said. “We’ve had conversations backstage, and I see her as sort of my musical and songwriting granddaughter, and we have a lovely relationship and I’m so proud of her.” King added, “I’m so excited about Kamala because so many people are excited about Kamala.” Gillibrand told a few Swiftie jokes (“Karma is a relaxing thought, but for Donald Trump, it’s not” and “Kamala is saying, look what you made me do”) and also referenced the now-infamous cat lady remarks made by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance. “I think it’s important that we, as single cat ladies, as independent women, as women who know every lyric that Taylor Swift has ever written, that we are part of this campaign and part of this election,” Gillibrand said. “I think she can be a voice for this generation that is really profound, as someone who values women’s words, who values women, who values our independence.” Markey spoke about climate change when alluding to Swift’s Rhode Island summer home. “Climate change is threatening our favorite phenomena,” Markey said. “The waters on the shores of Taylor’s holiday house in New England are some of the fastest warming waters in the world, outside of the Arctic. Right now, Kamala is running against the climate-denier-in-chief.” In the chat, organizers called for action in Swift-appropriate fashion: by asking for donations in the amount of $13 or $19.89 – numbers that have meaning for the singer – or $47, in reference to the next president."
Harris and Walz target battleground Georgia in post-Democratic National Convention swing | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Wed August 28, 2024",2024-08-28T09:00:19.679Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/politics/harris-walz-bus-tour-georgia/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will campaign together in Georgia for the first time this week, targeting the southeast portion of the state and providing a window into their strategy in the crucial battleground ahead of November. Few states will be more closely watched than Georgia for signs of how voters are responding to campaign outreach and the newly minted ticket, making it a fitting kickoff for Harris and Walz on the heels of the Democratic National Convention. Four years ago, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992, winning it by fewer than 12,000 votes. When Harris and Walz launch their bus tour in the Peach State Wednesday, they’ll be making a rare trip through south Georgia, a region that typically leans Republican but where Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock had success in the 2022 Senate runoff. “It’s a diverse coalition of voters, including rural, suburban and urban Georgians, and there is a large population of African American voters that live there,” Harris deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told CNN, pointing to the campaign’s infrastructure in the state. The campaign boasts 24 Georgia field offices, including 7 in the southern part of the state with 50 full-time staffers, according to a memo from Harris campaign Georgia state director Porsha White. Fulks, who managed Warnock’s campaign, argued that Harris, like Warnock, has an advantage in appealing to broader groups of voters, including those in the rural areas, heading into November, with former President Donald Trump as her opponent and anticipated higher turnout in a presidential election year. “We also see Donald Trump giving us the ability to do the exact same thing that we did when I was campaigning and managing for Sen. Warnock of peeling off Republican voters,” he added. Harris campaign officials have repeatedly stressed that the presidential election will be a close race and that holds true in Georgia, where recent polling from The New York Times and Siena College showed Trump leading among registered voters in Georgia, 51% to 44%. But Democratic strategists in the state similarly see an opening. “This is hugely significant because rural Georgia is not a place where Democrats have typically played and it’s a place where Democrats have really suffered in the polls,” said Fred Hicks, a Democratic strategist based in Georgia. “In 2022, we saw a new opportunity emerge for Democrats.” The Biden-turned-Harris campaign has focused some of its organization efforts on curtailing Trump’s advantage in rural areas, battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters last week. “We have to cut margins a little bit in rural America and not assume that we can’t talk to these voters – because that assumption has been a bad one for us in the past, and all of a sudden you lose counties 80-20 instead of 60-40. So we have to show up in those places,” Kanninen said at an event hosted by Bloomberg. He added, “We’re kind of everywhere with the intention of being able to have a permission structure that cleave votes wherever we can.” Howard Franklin, another Democratic strategist in the state, echoed that, saying: “A big part of winning in the state is not just exceedingly winning in metro Atlanta but driving down the margins by which Republicans win in the rural counties.” Harris held a rally in Atlanta with thousands of attendees in the first week of her presidential campaign. White, the Georgia state director, pointed to the “rapidly shifting” outer metro Atlanta-area Forsyth and Fayette counties as places with opportunity for Harris to gain ground, citing recent turnout at a Forsyth County “Weekend of Action” event in the county that Trump won in 2020. CNN previously reported that the Trump campaign has grown increasingly concerned about the state since Harris took over at the top of the Democratic ticket. Trump recently tried to put to rest a long-running feud with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a popular Republican, after publicly bashing him at a rally. Georgia was also at the center of Trump’s attempt to overturn the election with claims of widespread voter fraud, though none was found. On Monday, Democrats, with the backing of Harris’ presidential campaign, sued to block controversial new election rules in Georgia that they warned could lead to post-election “chaos” in the presidential battleground state in November. Harris’ and Walz’s swing through southeast Georgia, which includes a mix of rural and urban stops, is expected to focus on the kitchen-table issues following a spate of economy-related ads this week. The bus tour will conclude with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to the campaign. Walz will not attend the rally. “On the bus tour, the Vice President and Governor Walz will meet directly with voters in their communities, much like their western Pennsylvania bus tour which included stops at a local campaign field office and a high school football practice,” the campaign said in a release, describing campaigning in Georgia as “critical” in their effort to reach a diverse coalition of voters. Harris and Walz will also participate in a highly anticipated exclusive joint interview with CNN’s Dana Bash while in Georgia Thursday, marking Harris’ first in-depth, on-the-record conversation with a journalist since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket. The bus tour also offers an opportunity to introduce Walz, according to Democratic strategists who cited his upbringing in rural America, military background and his days as a football coach as especially relatable in south Georgia. “If it moves the meter, you have a new play for Georgia,” Hicks said."
Analysis: Trump’s new indictment rocks his newly reshaped race against Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 AM EDT, Wed August 28, 2024",2024-08-28T04:00:20.678Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/28/politics/trump-indictment-jack-smith-election-analysis/index.html,"Special counsel Jack Smith defiantly re-injected the question of Donald Trump’s bid to steal the 2020 election into the intensifying end game of this year’s White House race. By trying to rescue his case after his initial indictment was gutted by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, Smith signaled that he is determined to bring the former president to justice — even though there will be no trial before Election Day. “I think this is basically Jack Smith saying, ‘I still got this’” former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a CNN legal and national security commentator, said after the special counsel on Tuesday filed a modified indictment endorsed by a new grand jury. His move underscored the huge personal investment Trump has in winning the presidency in November: He not only would return to the nation’s top office, but would also gain the authority to halt this and another federal case against him and head off any sentences that could include jail time if he is convicted. “This is a very big year, it is a very important election,” former federal prosecutor Ankush Khardori told CNN’s Alex Marquardt on Tuesday. “This case is at stake in the election, because if Trump wins, it is going away. If Trump loses to Harris, this case is going to proceed to some sort of conclusion.” The conservative majority’s ruling earlier this summer that Trump could be covered by immunity from criminal prosecution for some of his actions as president represented one of the most consequential moments in Supreme Court history and has massive implications for the US system of government. Many mainstream scholars blasted the decision as contrary to the spirit of the country’s founders in that it appeared to hand significant unchecked powers to the presidency. The decision also sent shockwaves through an already tumultuous presidential race, since it appeared to offer an ex-president who already believed he was all powerful the chance to pursue strongman rule if he wins November’s election. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris criticized the decision in her convention speech last week: “Consider, the power he will have … Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States.” Smith’s move also creates other profound political, legal, and constitutional overtones at a critical national moment, 10 weeks from an election that could profoundly reshape the country and that may again test its institutions to the limit. The facts and the evidence of Smith’s case haven’t changed. The indictment still charges Trump with conspiracies to defraud the government system that counts election votes and to corrupt and obstruct the process of certifying Joe Biden’s victory. It also accuses him of hatching a conspiracy against the bedrock right of citizens to cast a vote and have it counted. But in deference to the Supreme Court ruling, Smith removed language that alleges that Trump used the Justice Department to promote his claims of electoral fraud. And he attempted to style much of the remaining alleged conduct as that of a “candidate” rather than a president acting in his official capacity, to get around the issue at the center of the court’s ruling. But his case still faces huge obstacles. Presiding District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan must now interpret the high court’s ruling to decide which evidence remains admissible. And the ex-president’s legal team will fight Smith at every turn and use every appellate option available. The Trump legal and campaign team may accuse him of infringing Justice Department custom to avoid proceedings against key political figures so close to an election. Of course, the reason the original version of the case did not go to trial long before the election was partly because of the successful delaying tactics of Trump’s legal team. “If Donald Trump doesn’t like how late this is happening, he should not have been delaying and postponing for many, many months,” Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat who sat on the House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.” “Jack Smith is playing the cards he’s been dealt by Donald Trump and by Trump’s supporters on the Roberts Court who have made this go as slow as possible. And I think there’s something quietly heroic about Jack Smith insisting on going forward to make sure that this plot comes to light.” For all its success in delaying the initial January 6 federal case, the ex-president’s camp was unable to prevent Trump’s conviction in a hush money case related to the 2016 election and a massive fraud judgement against him, his firm and his adult sons in New York. Trump was also found liable for defamation in another case over sexual assault allegations by writer E. Jean Carroll. But a Trump-appointed judge in Florida recently dismissed Smith’s classified documents case against Trump (the special counsel is appealing). And another election meddling case, in Georgia, has been beset by multiple delays. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges in all cases. The political significance of Smith’s fresh attempt to force Trump to face unaccustomed accountability for his actions adds another dimension to the ex-president’s new face-off with the replacement Democratic nominee, Harris. The revised indictment will freshen the issue of Trump’s alleged criminality and autocratic ambitions in the minds of voters, after his mountain of legal woes faded as a driving force in the campaign in the furor over Biden’s disastrous debate performance, his subsequent withdrawal from the race and Harris’ storming start to her own campaign. Although there’s no chance the case could come to trial before the election, any attempt by Smith to hold evidentiary hearings in the coming weeks could create a new wave of news coverage about Trump’s alleged criminality as early in-person and absentee voting begins. Being indicted, yet again, in the middle of a presidential campaign would be a disqualifying badge of shame for most candidates. Yet Trump has used his criminal problems to revive his campaign before – especially during the Republican primary contest. His new indictment came almost exactly a year after he showed up to be booked in an Atlanta jail and submitted to a mug shot that his campaign turned into a defiant emblem. Trump has struggled in recent weeks to find traction for his campaign against a new Democratic nominee. And the issue of the ex-president’s legal woes had not been a central focus of the election race in recent months. But no sooner had the new Smith charges been filed, the muscle memory of his team returned, as he revived the core narrative of his bid for a second term — a false claim that he’s a victim of election interference by a weaponized Biden Justice Department. The ex-president accused Smith of trying to “resurrect a ‘dead’ Witch Hunt in Washington, D.C., in an act of desperation.” He also claimed the new indictment was a new attempt at election interference to distract from the “catastrophes Kamala Harris has inflicted on our Nation.” It also did not take long for a new fundraising appeal based on the case to hit email inboxes. The return of Trump’s legal quagmire to center stage presents new challenges for Harris. She has focused the early weeks of her White House bid on the pain Americans have faced from high grocery prices to mitigate one political weakness and is seeking to portray herself as a candidate of generational change as compared to Trump. The vice president hasn’t been quite so overt as Biden in rooting her campaign in a battle for the nation’s soul. But she last week cited Trump’s legal nightmares to portray him as an “unserious man” who would trigger “extremely serious” consequences if he returned to the Oval Office. Many Harris supporters like the contrast of the vice president, a former prosecutor, and Trump, a convicted felon and indicted suspect — a dynamic certain to play out on the debate stage on September 10. The latest Trump indictment also bolsters the Harris theme that Americans have a “precious, fleeting opportunity”  to move past the bitterness, cynicism and chaos of the Trump years and into a more optimistic future. Still, her campaign must have some concerns that some moderate, swing voters might view yet another indictment of the former president as overkill. Aside from the immediate political and electoral implications of the new indictment, Smith’s latest filing was a reminder of the surreal reality that a once-and-possibly-future president is being prosecuted for an attempt to ignore the will of voters and stay in power after losing an election. Biden’s departure from the campaign and the pomp of the conventions have made Trump’s threat to democracy somewhat of an afterthought in recent weeks but the question of how a president who tried to overthrow American democracy avoided accountability and was able to run again for the White House — and potentially win it — is certain to preoccupy future historians."
"August 27, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-27T12:07:11.661Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-08-27-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after earning his endorsement but didn’t explicitly say whether he would have a role in a potential second Trump administration. CNN reported Tuesday that Kennedy was added to the Trump transition team. Trump said Kennedy’s support can help his campaign “build up the margins” and said the election – which several polls suggest will be a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris – could be a “landslide” for Republicans.  Trump agreed when Dr. Phil said there are many things Kennedy could offer in a potential Trump administration, suggesting something environmental or attorney general.  “That’s true,” Trump said. Ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz’s bus tour in southern Georgia, Democratic strategists and organizers see a real opportunity to reach voters in the rural pockets of the state.  Butler said the voters Harris encounters on the tour will primarily want to hear about how the Harris-Walz ticket will work to improve their lives from an economic standpoint.  This means a message grounded in reducing inflation and advancing affordable health care, Butler said.  Democratic strategist Fred Hicks says Democrats can’t afford to overlook any part of the state.  “In order to make Georgia truly competitive and give yourself any kind of breathing room, they’re going to need to get votes, drive up Democratic votes outside of Metro Atlanta,” Hicks said. The veteran strategist says he’s watching how Walz, in particular, connects with voters in the rural South.  Former president Donald Trump said mail-in voting “shouldn’t be allowed” and that Republicans must gain control of the government so they can change the rules. Asked if Republicans should play by the rules, Trump said: “It shouldn’t be allowed. It’s a whole different mindset.” Trump claimed that vote counting in Democratic California is dishonest. Asked, again, if Republicans should play hard under the rules, Trump said: Trump’s campaign and the RNC are encouraging their supporters to vote by mail. Today, they rolled out a GOTV tool, where Pennsylvania voters can request a mail-in ballot directly through SwampTheVoteUSA.com.  Read CNN’s fact checks on Trump’s claims of mail fraud. In the second part of his interview with Dr. Phil, which was taped Friday, former President Donald Trump spoke about his assassination attempt. Trump said that “being president is a dangerous job.” Trump also said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are to blame for the assassination attempt to a “certain extent” because they “weaponized” the government against him. There is no evidence that either Biden or Harris were involved in Trump’s assassination attempt. Trump also said that Democratic rhetoric could have contributed to the assassination attempt against him – particularly calling him a threat to democracy, which he says he is “just the opposite.” “That was a standard line, just keep saying it,” Trump said. “That can get assassins or potential assassins going.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will attend a fundraiser for Donald Trump in Atlanta on Thursday where former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is the headliner, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. ABC News first reported the fundraiser. Kemp refused to support Trump’s questioning of the 2020 election, but the two have seemingly reconciled recently. That same night, Kemp told Sean Hannity: “we’re going to put Georgia back in the red column for the presidential race, unlike we did in 2020.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. won’t appear on the Nevada ballot after he reached an agreement with Democratic challengers who argued he was ineligible to appear on the ballot as an independent candidate.   While the deadline for candidates to withdraw from the ballot has already passed in Nevada, the existing legal challenge to Kennedy’s candidacy gave him an avenue to have his name removed.   Last week Kennedy suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel Wednesday to Savannah, Georgia, before beginning her bus tour with running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, according to her office. This marks her seventh visit to the Peach State this year. The vice president’s office is not releasing the specific stops on her tour. Few battlegrounds will be more closely watched than Georgia — where President Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago — for signs of how voters respond to campaign outreach. Kamala Harris has committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. She has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announced $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs, and other aid for the war-torn country last month. At the Munich Security Conference this year, Harris said: “More broadly, NATO is central to our approach to global security. For President Biden and me, our sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad. And I do believe, as I have said before, NATO is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.” Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. Donald Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if “Marxist” prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender “our cities to violent criminals,” he “will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.” Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into “radical left” prosecutors’ offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore “law and order” and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings. Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the “Democrats’ war on police,” the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a “record investment” to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement “refuses to act.” The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use “proven common sense” measures such as stop-and-frisk. Read more about Trump’s stances on other key issues. Former President Donald Trump on Friday dodged when asked by CNN how he plans to pay for his economic plan, which includes tax cuts that would add to the federal deficit. Sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists sent a stark warning in a letter in June that Trump’s agenda would not only “reignite inflation” but would have “a negative impact on the US’ economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the US’ domestic economy.” Trump has also opposed any changes to entitlement programs like Medicare or Social Security to help offset some of the costs of his cuts. What he said: Trump has promised to extend the cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, notably the TCJA’s individual income tax breaks. The former president has also talked about reducing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%. Trump has also pledged to repeal Biden’s tax hikes, “immediately tackle” inflation and end what he called Biden’s “war” on American energy production. During a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Trump also pledged to end taxes on tips, a move targeted to appeal to hundreds of thousands of people working in the city. High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give President Joe Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Vice President Kamala Harris may also face their wrath. As part of her economic agenda, Harris wants to counter the increase in food costs, which she argues stems in part from some big grocery chains that are keeping prices high even though their production costs have leveled off. To do so, she is calling for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries. She would also secure new authority for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and penalize companies that unfairly exploit consumers in the quest for excessive profits on food and groceries. Harris has echoed many of the same economic themes as Biden in campaign speeches, saying she wants to give Americans more opportunities to get ahead. She promised in a July rally to continue the Biden administration’s drive to eliminate so-called junk fees and to fully disclose all charges, such as for events, lodging and car rentals. “On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits,” she said. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. Kamala Harris has rolled out a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage. Parts of it build on proposals that Joe Biden has already unveiled. The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year. The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign. Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send “all education and education work and needs back to the states.” “We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it,” he added. The former president has also promised to “put parents back in charge and give them the final say” in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and “favorable treatment” to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it.” Trump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to “teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.” The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing “Marxists” from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution’s Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen’s right to practice their own religion, he said. Trump has also promised to fund free online classes with funds seized from private university endowments. Read more about what Trump has said on other key issues. Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of the social media company Meta, is handing Republicans political victories ahead of the 2024 presidential election, acquiescing to years of GOP grievances over his company’s policies. In recent days, the Meta chief executive has made newsworthy public statements implicitly supporting right-wing “censorship” narratives and offered praise for Donald Trump as “badass” – even as he claimed he wanted to appear “neutral” and nonpartisan. On Monday, Zuckerberg sent a letter to the powerful House Judiciary Committee, stating that the Biden administration had “pressured” Meta to “censor” content during the pandemic. The Meta chief added that the pressure he felt was “wrong” and he came to “regret” that his company, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, was not more outspoken. The letter was immediately weaponized by Trump, who used it to once again promote the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee also welcomed Zuckerberg’s letter, posting a copy Monday on s﻿ocial media and using it to attack President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now running as the Democratic nominee for president.  The letter was sent amid a two-year investigation by House Republicans into the content moderation policies of major social media networks. Read more here. If 2024 is anything like 2020 or 2016, the presidential election will be decided by relatively small margins in a handful of states. That means some local battles scattered across the country could have national importance. Here are some of those instances to keep an eye on: Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, accused special counsel Jack Smith of filing “lawsuits” against former President Donald Trump in order to influence the 2024 election, as he filed a superseding indictment in the election interference case Tuesday. While Vance said he didn’t read the entire document, he said: “It looks like Jack Smith doing more what he does, which is filing these lawsuits in an effort to influence the election.” The superseding indictment states on page 3: “The Defendant tried-but failed-to enlist the Vice President, who was also the Defendant’s running mate and, by virtue of the Constitution, the President of the Senate who plays a ceremonial role in the January 6 certification proceeding.”  As CNN reported, prosecutors are arguing that Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence fell outside the scope of his official duties. “I don’t think that it changes anything legally,” Vance said. “It’s clearly an effort to try to do more election interference from Jack Smith. He should be ashamed of himself, and it’s one of the reasons why we have to win, because he should not be anywhere near power.” Vance said the Supreme Court was “actually pretty sensible” in their immunity ruling, which granted Trump partial immunity from the election subversion case. While former President Donald Trump campaigns in two “blue wall” states this week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will visit another key battleground. On Wednesday, the Democrats will kick off a bus tour in Georgia, concluding with a rally in the Savannah area Thursday, according to their campaign. They also will sit down with CNN for their first joint interview on Thursday. Trump, the Republican candidate, will deliver remarks on the economy in Potterville, Michigan, on Thursday, according to his campaign. The former president will also host a town hall that evening in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Here are other headlines you should know: Superseding indictment: Endorsements: Ads and initiatives: Attacks: Upcoming events: RFK Jr.: Former President Donald Trump is soliciting donations after this afternoon’s superseding indictment. He said in an email, “I WAS JUST INDICTED AGAIN!” and called it “Another Jack Smith HOAX!” Trump also slammed the superseding indictment in a series of posts on Truth Social. What happened: Special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday filed a reworked indictment in the federal election interference case against Trump. Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges that they initially brought against the former president. However, the newly retooled indictment has carved out some of Trump’s alleged conduct, including allegations about the attempts to use the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud. Prosecutors are working to try to comply with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. This post has been updated with Trump’s Truth Social posts. Former President Barack Obama offered a note of caution to Democrats buzzing over Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign, telling donors on Martha’s Vineyard on Monday night that the party needs to ramp up its focus — and spending — on down-ballot races across the country. The NDRC told CNN the fundraiser brought in $1.7 million.  Obama said Republicans have been trying to “redraw maps and manipulate the rules” — which are backed up by courts “that are willing to uphold unfair maps and unfair rules.” This is an obstacle for Democrats, he said, policies aside. “Politics in America is and always has been, not simply a matter of rhetoric and joy and excitement. It is also nuts and bolts exercises of power,” Obama said, adding that Democrats need to address these “nuts and bolts” to help Harris. Democrats lost more than a thousand seats in state legislatures during Obama’s presidency, while also suffering a string of defeats at the gubernatorial level and in the US Congress. Meantime, Republicans won a 2010 House landslide before taking control of the Senate in 2014. The damage at the state level, though, has been the most difficult for Democrats to unwind, in part due to gerrymandering by state GOP leaders. Donald Trump will once again need to enter an official plea in court after special counsel prosecutors reworked the indictment against him in the federal election interference case. Although Trump was charged with the same offenses as the original case, prosecutors narrowed the allegations and altered the language to try to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity earlier this summer. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the case, has not yet set a date for that proceeding. It’s unclear if she will require the former president to appear in person for a re-arraignment, as prosecutors have indicated they don’t object to her waiving his appearance. Trump’s case was already set to return to Chutkan’s court next week for a hearing about the case’s schedule.  According to a source familiar with the matter, the Trump defense team expected a rewriting of the indictment to set up the next phase of the case after the Supreme Court ruling. But this coming so soon was a surprise — and the special counsel’s office didn’t give Trump’s team a head’s up before the new grand jury approved this indictment, the source said.  What changed: Notably, special counsel Jack Smith’s team said that Trump made repeated false claims on a Twitter account that he “regularly used for personal purposes,” and described his January 6, 2021, rally at the Ellipse as a “privately-funded, privately organized political rally.”  In addition, prosecutors removed language about Trump’s conversations with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows from their allegations. They did, however, add details about other conversations in the indictment — including in one section that recounts a meeting Trump had with Michigan lawmakers. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will sit with CNN for their first joint interview on Thursday as Democrats work to broaden their base’s excitement from last week’s Democratic National Convention.  The interview, conducted by CNN’s chief political correspondent and anchor Dana Bash, will air at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday. It occurs as the candidates embark on a bus tour through the battleground state of Georgia and marks the first time Harris has sat with a journalist for an in-depth, on-the-record conversation since President Joe Biden dropped his bid for a second term and endorsed her on July 21. The 37 days since her candidacy began have generated a swell of enthusiasm and momentum for Harris, including at last week’s convention in Chicago. But her lack of a formal news conference or interview has generated criticism from her Republican rivals. Thursday’s interview fulfills a vow she made earlier in August to schedule a sit-down before the end of the month. Read more Special counsel prosecutors reworked the indictment against Donald Trump to narrow the allegations to try to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity earlier this summer.  Prosecutors did this in two ways – by cutting language about the former president’s interactions with senior Justice Department officials, and by adding language describing when Trump was acting as a candidate and not the president. Prosecutors noted several times that Trump didn’t have any constitutionally-assigned presidential duties regarding the post-election transition of power. The Supreme Court ruling granted immunity to some of Trump’s conduct that falls within his official powers. Smith’s team also emphasized their contention that Vice President Mike Pence was acting in a “ceremonial role” as president of the Senate when he presided over the Electoral College certification proceedings on January 6, 2021. The distinction is important because prosecutors are arguing that Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence was outside the scope of his official duties.  In addition, prosecutors cut references to Co-Conspirator 4. CNN has identified that person as then-Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who allegedly sought to use his position to aid Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will campaign together on Labor Day in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the White House announced.  It will mark the first time the president and vice president are appearing jointly in a battleground state since Harris moved to the top of the Democratic ticket. Biden and Harris appeared together in Maryland earlier this month at a White House event touting efforts to lower prescription drug costs and on stage at the Democratic National Convention last week. Harris is set to travel to Detroit, Michigan, on Monday before meeting Biden in Pittsburgh as part of the campaign’s push to appeal to working-class voters, a campaign official said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife Gwen Walz will spend Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend a Labor Day event in Newport News, Virginia. While the details of Biden and Harris’ joint appearance were not immediately clear, the campaign is planning events across the country that will include community Labor Day parades and local union organizing events, the official said. What Biden has been doing: Biden’s aides have said he will maintain a robust schedule in his final months in office, including hitting the campaign trail for Harris and events reinforcing the legacy pieces of his single term in office. The president is expected to be a frequent fixture in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state where he lived as a child.  “I promise I’ll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz … have ever seen,” Biden said at the Democratic National Convention last week. The president spent last week on vacation in Santa Ynez, California, and is currently at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Aside from a quick outing to church on Saturday, he stayed largely out of the public eye as the convention played out in Chicago. Special counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment in the election interference case against former President Donald Trump, slimming down the allegations against the 2024 presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. “Today, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned a superseding indictment,” a spokesperson for Smith’s office, Peter Carr, said in a statement Tuesday, “charging the defendant with the same criminal offenses that were charged in the original indictment.” Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges they initially brought against the former president. However, the newly retooled indictment carved out some of the alleged conduct, including allegations about the attempts to use the Justice Department to promote Trump’s false claims of election fraud. It also adjusts how prosecutors describe the allegations regarding Trump’s election subversion schemes. This is one of four cases Trump is facing while running again for president. This post has been updated with more details from the indictment. CNN’s Holmes Lybrand and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed reporting. Former President Donald Trump keeps lying that “everybody,” including Democrats, wanted the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country since 1973. “Every Democrat, every Republican, everybody wanted Roe v. Wade terminated and brought back to the states,” Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said on Fox News on Thursday morning. “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States,” he wrote on social media on Thursday night. Trump, facing criticism for appointing three of the justices who overturned Roe in 2022, has been delivering versions of this “everybody” claim for months. But the claim is an up-is-down reversal of reality, especially the part about the views of Democrats. The numbers debunk Trump’s lie: The specific numbers vary poll by poll, but numerous polls before and after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe have arrived at broadly similar findings: strong overall support for Roe and even stronger Democratic support for Roe. For example, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in January 2022, roughly five months before the Supreme Court ruling, found that 69% of adults and 86% of Democrats were opposed to completely overturning Roe. In CNN polling going back to 1989, adults’ support for completely overturning Roe had never exceeded 36%. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll in May 2022, after a draft of the court’s opinion overturning Roe was leaked, found that 64% of adults and 93% of Democrats opposed overturning Roe. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in late June and early July 2022, days after the Supreme Court ruling, found that 57% of adults and 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents disapproved of the ruling. An NBC News poll conducted in June 2023, roughly a year after the ruling, found that 61% of registered voters and 92% of Democratic registered voters opposed the ruling. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April 2024 found that 65% of adults and 87% of Democrats disapproved of the Supreme Court ruling. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request to explain why he is still making such comments. Donald Trump has promised to reduce energy prices by increasing domestic production. In several campaign appearances, he has laid out plans to end delays in federal drilling permits and leases. At a South Carolina rally in February, he pledged to remove limits on American natural gas exports.The Washington Post has also reported that Trump, during an April meeting at Mar-a-Lago, pledged to roll back some of President Joe Biden’s climate policies if oil executives raised $1 billion for his campaign. As for other energy sources, Trump has also changed his tune on the expansion of offshore wind farms, which he had touted at the start of his presidency as part of a broader push to “unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.” In May, Trump described wind farms as “horrible” and accused turbines of killing birds and whales, adding that he would “make sure that ends on day one.” Trump has also promoted US cryptocurrency mining, an industry that has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive; servers require enormous amounts of power to solve a complex series of algorithms to verify transactions. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!” he said on Truth Social. Read more about what Trump has said on other key issues. Former President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he has “reached an agreement” to participate in a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia on ABC News. Trump noted that “the rules will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone.” This announcement follows a period of negotiations between the Trump and Harris campaigns, which had reached a stalemate over specific debate protocols, particularly regarding the muting of microphones when candidates are not speaking.  CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. The latest on the mics: The rules for the debate will largely mirror the terms used by CNN for its June debate, including that microphones will be muted as the other candidate speaks and no studio audience will be present, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. But later Tuesday, the Harris campaign said that discussions are ongoing with ABC over whether microphones will remain on, according to a source familiar.  This post has been updated with remarks from the Harris campaign. CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed to this post. The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Tuesday ruled that former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will remain on the ballot for the November general election. Wisconsin Elections Commissioner chairwoman Ann Jacobs said that Kennedy requested to be withdrawn – but Wisconsin law states that once a candidate files nomination papers, “the name of that person shall appear upon the ballot except in case of death of the person.” The commission voted 5-1 in favor of keeping him on the ballot.   The commission also voted to allow Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and independent presidential candidate Cornel West to be on the ballot.  Last week, Kennedy suspended his campaign and backed former President Donald Trump, appearing with the former president at a rally in Arizona.  Kamala Harris has proposed using tax credits to provide relief to middle class and lower-income Americans. Her plan revives or extends temporary measures that Joe Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of the president’s term. Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021. Her plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only for 2021. Plus, the proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. And Harris has also promised to end federal income taxes on tips, sparking Trump’s ire that she is copying his campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. This November, voters in several states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access , after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion — and some aimed at restricting it. Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion. Ten states have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot: Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, including Ohio, Michigan and Kansas. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed. Here’s a look at how abortion access has changed since the Dobbs decision: Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he would like to see Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advising former President Donald Trump on who could serve in a potential second administration, especially when it comes to health issues facing Americans. CNN reported earlier today that Kennedy, who suspended his independent campaign Friday and endorsed Trump — along with former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard — have been added to the former president’s transition team. Vance said it is “a little premature to talk about specific roles” for Kennedy in a Trump administration, but they would cross that bridge if they get to it.  Vance on Tuesday also accused Vice President Kamala Harris of copying former Trump and not having strong policy convictions of her own, as the pair prepare to face off in a debate next month. “Kamala has decided that the American people don’t like her policies, and she’s exactly right about that,” he said, blaming Harris for promoting a “wide-open southern border” through the Biden administration’s immigration policies. Harris recently adopted a policy to eliminate taxes on tips, two months after Trump announced his support for the same policy in Nevada, where both candidates are vying for support from service industry workers. Vance said Harris sounded like a “vice principal” when she warned at the Democratic National Convention about the consequences of reelecting Trump. “First of all, that is not a very presidential thing to say. Is she the vice president or the vice principal?” Trump’s running mate said. Vance also criticized Harris on “the substance” of her remarks and her “tone” at the DNC. Vance’s mother, Beverly Aikins, joined him on the campaign trail on Tuesday. As he often does, Vance highlighted his personal story, including his mother’s struggle with addiction, to connect with voters in rural America. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told CNN that he still believes the State Election Board “is a mess.”  But speaking to a handful of media in Forsyth, Georgia, during a statewide election training seminar, the Republican secretary of state said he is not concerned that county election officials will delay certification of November’s results.   Some background: Earlier this month, Georgia’s Republican-controlled State Election Board approved an ambiguous new rule saying that counties will now have the opportunity for a “reasonable inquiry” to ensure tabulation and canvassing of the election are complete and accurate before local election officials certify the results. Certification is a mandatory part of the voting process as a final check to verify the results with the secretary of state’s office. Last week, during an interview with CNN-affiliate WSB, Raffensperger voiced concern with the actions of the board. He has previously called the board “a mess.” Democrats, with the backing of Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, on Monday sued to block controversial new election rules they warned could lead to post-election “chaos” in the presidential battleground state. The lawsuit marks a significant escalation of a controversy that has been brewing for weeks over the action of three Republican members of the state elections board, who recently won praise from former President Donald Trump for their moves. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign launched a “Back-to-School” initiative on Tuesday geared toward young voters in key battleground states.  The initiative will target college students across 150 campuses throughout the fall semester and will include visits from surrogates, as well as targeted ads and social media outreach, in addition to the campaign doubling its campus organizing staff. The campaign formally kicked off the effort with campus visits from Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson at the University of Pittsburgh and from Florida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost, the first Gen Z member of Congress, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Bennett College in Greensboro. The campaign believes this push will build off of Harris’ month-long college tour that she launched last year under the Biden administration, where she traveled to several states to galvanize young voters on issues including women’s reproductive rights, gun safety and climate change. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend fundraisers this week in Idaho, California and Colorado, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign announced on Tuesday.  Emhoff will visit Ketchum, Idaho, on Thursday, followed by stops in San Francisco and Aspen, Colorado, on Friday. Harris and her running mate Gov. Tim Walz are getting ready to kick off a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday. They will conclude with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to their campaign. The race to Election Day in November is on. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have picked their running mates and held nominating conventions to rally their parties. They have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. There will be unexpected developments between now and Election Day on November 5, but here are some dates we know are coming up next: Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News she is “concerned” about the court’s divisive decision to grant sweeping immunity to former President Donald Trump because it treats one person differently than others in the criminal justice system. Jackson’s remarks, which come as she promotes a new memoir to be published next week, were in response to a question about the court’s decision on July 1 to grant broad immunity to the former president. A 6-3 majority of the court ruled that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of his official actions. Jackson, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, dissented from that decision. The reverberations of the ruling are still being felt in the criminal cases pending against Trump. The Supreme Court’s decision has delayed special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal case against the GOP presidential nominee for attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Trump, the Supreme Court ruled, could still be prosecuted for unofficial actions. A District Court in Washington, DC, will hold a hearing on next steps in that case next week. Read more about the interview here. The dramatic change at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket unleashed a flood of donations to the campaign account Kamala Harris inherited from Joe Biden, swamping even Donald Trump’s strongest fundraising days, a CNN analysis of newly filed campaign reports shows. Over the three-day period in July that covered Biden’s withdrawal from the White House race and the rapid consolidation of Democratic support for his vice president, Harris’ principal campaign committee took in more than double what Trump’s campaign account reported collecting in the three days surrounding his felony conviction in New York, according to the review of contributions that total more than $200 this cycle. The donor enthusiasm for Harris’ surprise candidacy has quickly eroded the cash advantage Trump once held. The Harris campaign had previously announced collecting a whopping $310 million in July through its joint fundraising efforts with aligned Democratic Party committees – far exceeding the nearly $139 million that the Trump political operation said it had brought in last month. The CNN review examined sums raised by each candidate’s main campaign committee – a valuable resource in politics because those committees by law must receive discounts on television advertising, giving candidate-controlled money a greater impact than donations to parties and outside groups. Harris’ campaign said Sunday that it had raised $540 million since she launched her presidential bid just over a month ago. Read more on the newly filed campaign reports here. While former President Donald Trump campaigns in two “blue wall” states this week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will visit another key battleground. On Wednesday, Harris and Walz will kick off a bus tour in Georgia, concluding with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to their campaign. Few battlegrounds will be more closely watched than Georgia — where President Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago — for signs of how voters respond to campaign outreach. Trump will deliver remarks on the economy in Potterville, Michigan, on Thursday, according to his campaign. The former president will also host a town hall that evening in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Trump “will meet with Wisconsinites to listen to their concerns and share his promising agenda: to make America affordable again,” his campaign said. Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. Meanwhile, Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record and outlined her policies. Here’s a look at what Trump has proposed on the topic: Here’s a look at where Harris stands on the topic: Vice President Kamala Harris will schedule a sit-down interview by the end of the month, according to a senior campaign adviser. “The vice president’s been taking questions from reporters who are covering her on the campaign trail,” Ian Sams also told CNN. This comes amid mounting pressure and criticism against Harris for not participating in a sit-down interview or news conference since being named the Democratic nominee. Harris campaign officials have previously said that she would participate in an interview by the end of August. On the September ABC debate, Sams said that as far as the Harris campaign is concerned the disagreement over the microphones is essentially “over.” This comes after former President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would rather have the microphones always on for both candidates during the debate, despite his campaign pushing to keep the same rules as the last presidential debate. While Kamala Harris has improved on President Joe Biden’s standing in many states, the shape of the crucial Senate races that will determine the majority is the same. Democrats are facing an incredibly unfavorable map this year, defending seats in places that former President Donald Trump won by comfortable margins and presidential battlegrounds that he narrowly lost in 2020. Here’s a snapshot of where the race for the Senate stands now: West Virginia: West Virginia would have been tough to hold even with Joe Manchin, but without the Democrat-turned-independent senator running for reelection, Republican Gov. Jim Justice is poised to be the next senator from a state Trump is expected to carry by double digits. Montana: Sen. Jon Tester remains the most endangered Democrat running for reelection. This is the first time he’s on the ballot at the same time as Trump. A new wild card: Montana will now also have an abortion measure on the November ballot. Ohio: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is vulnerable because he, too, is running for reelection in a Trump state. Brown is up against Republican businessman Bernie Moreno, whom Democrats boosted in the GOP primary because they thought he’d be the weakest opponent. The car dealership owner trailed Brown even when Biden was atop the ticket. That doesn’t mean that Brown is safe. Michigan: The race is to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, making it an open seat, which is typically harder to defend. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a three-term congresswoman, is running statewide for the first time. She’ll face a challenging race against Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers. Arizona: Another open-seat race Democrats are trying to defend where the border is front and center. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s departure from the race gave way to a two-way matchup between Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Marine veteran, and Republican Kari Lake, a Trump ally who hasn’t let go of claims that she won the 2022 gubernatorial election. Nevada: Sen. Jacky Rosen is running for a second term and the Harris-led ticket has strengthened her position. It’s still tough terrain for Democrats, with a transient population and demographics that may be moving away from the party. But abortion is also on the ballot in Nevada, a state where Democrats believe reproductive rights are particularly salient. Keep reading about other key Senate races here. Former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have both been added to Donald Trump’s transition team. They endorsed the GOP presidential nominee in recent days. Gabbard, who now identifies as an independent, endorsed Trump on Monday at a National Guard conference in Detroit. Kennedy praised Trump as he joined the former president on stage at an Arizona rally on Friday, hours after suspending his own campaign. Democrats, with the backing of Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, on Monday sued to block controversial new election rules in Georgia that they warned could lead to post-election “chaos” in the presidential battleground state in November. The lawsuit, filed in Georgia state court by the Democratic National Committee, the Georgia Democratic Party and Democratic members of several county election boards, takes aim at two rules passed recently by the Georgia State Election Board that allow election officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying election results and permit members of county election boards to investigate ballot counts. The lawsuit marks a significant escalation of a controversy that has been brewing for weeks over the action of three Republican members of the state elections board, who recently won praise from former President Donald Trump for their moves. Trump lost Georgia by just over 10,000 votes in 2020, and it was at the center of his attempt to overturn the election with claims of voter fraud, though none was found. Democrats are seeking a court ruling that makes clear that election superintendents do not have the discretion to delay the certification of election results or to refuse to certify the results altogether. Read more about the lawsuit to block new rules adopted by Georgia’s State Election Board. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is up with another ad promoting her proposals to lower housing costs, the second new ad from the campaign that began airing today as part of a concerted effort to highlight the issue. “My childhood, we were renters. My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. I was a teenager when that day finally came and I can remember so well, how excited she was. I know what home ownership means,” Harris says in the ad. “Sadly, right now it is out of reach for far too many American families.” Harris also touts her record as a prosecutor, saying that she “took on the big banks who exploited people in the housing market,” vowing to “fight for a law that cracks down” on abusive practices. Harris promises to build 3 million new homes and rentals, saying, “We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home.” It’s the second ad that the Harris campaign has launched today emphasizing high costs of living. Earlier, the campaign went up with another minute-long ad detailing her plans. And a third ad from the Harris campaign, produced earlier this week, also raises the issue of housing costs. “We must create an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to get a car loan, buy a home, start a business,” Harris says in a clip featured in the ad. Read more about the economic policy proposals from both Harris and Trump. Therecent US Supreme Court decision changing voter registration rules in Arizona has voting rights advocates anxious about how the justices will approach emergency election appeals in the runup to the November election. Not only was the Arizona ruling a missed opportunity for the justices to explain when they will engage in election and voting cases, experts say it has also heightened concern that the court is unevenly applying a murky legal principle intended to reduce chaos rather than add to it. That lack of clarity – and what critics see as an inconsistent application of the doctrine – could be a critical factor in this year’s election. Why this matters: As in past years, the Supreme Court is almost certain to be asked to take up a series of down-to-the-wire election-year lawsuits ahead of the November election. Some of those cases are already percolating in lower courts, and some are likely to appear without much warning. Read more about how the Supreme Court may be creating uncertainty in how it will handle election disputes this fall. Weeks before the 2022 midterms, a stranger showed up at the Denver headquarters of Dominion Voting Systems. He didn’t have an appointment, so the front desk asked him to leave. But staffers noticed him lingering outside, and one Dominion executive spotted a rifle case and scope in his vehicle. A week later, the man returned, rambling about supposed problems with election security. He then said he had a pistol in his car. Alarmed, Dominion staff involved the police and obtained a restraining order. The episode, described in court filings and by a senior Dominion official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, is part of the continued fallout from 2020 election lies. The impact has been acutely felt at Dominion, the voting technology company that became the poster child for baseless right-wing voter fraud claims in 2020. The avalanche of disinformation forced voting companies and election officials to overhaul their approach for 2024, according to interviews with nearly a dozen people involved in running the election. They’ve ramped up investments in physical security, found new ways to combat false claims, and cracked down on employees’ political postings. Yet, more than one year after Fox News paid Dominion $787 million, the largest known defamation settlement in US media history, former President Donald Trump and his allies are still flooding right-wing media with the lie that voting machine companies rigged the 2020 election — and that the 2024 election might be stolen too. Even as they adapt for 2024, some involved in administering elections still fear for their lives. There has been an exodus of election workers who have quit or retired. Read the full story. More than 200 Republicans who previously worked for former Presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, former Sen. John McCain or Sen. Mitt Romney signed a letter backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.  USA Today first reported the letter. The letter, which echoes the pledge of support from a similar group of Republicans for President Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election, seeks to convince voters who backed previous Republican presidential nominees to support Harris and prevent former President Donald Trump from being reelected. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable,” the letter read. Among those who signed the letter are former George H.W. Bush chief of staff Jean Becker, former McCain chiefs of staff Mark Salter and Christopher Koch, and Olivia Troye, the former Homeland Security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. The letter marks another notch of support from former Republicans after several, including Troye and former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, spoke at the DNC last week in support of Harris. In her remarks at the convention, Harris made a direct appeal to independent and Republican-leaning voters, assuring them she’d serve as a president “for all Americans.” Donald Trump’s campaign launched a new ad Tuesday claiming that Kamala Harris’ immigration policies will cause cuts to Social Security benefits, pointedly aimed at senior voters and mixing several key attack lines. “Attention seniors,” the ad opens. “Kamala Harris has promised amnesty for the 10 million illegals she allowed in as borders czar, making them eligible for Social Security. Studies warn this will lead to cuts in your social security benefits.” It continues, “President Trump opposes amnesty and any cuts to your benefits and will eliminate taxes on Social Security because he’s on your side.” The new ad from the Trump campaign references a 2020 paper from a far-right organization, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, highlighting the line, “adding more migrants will doom Social Security.” Key context: Non-US citizens typically do not qualify for social welfare programs like Social Security and unemployment insurance. At the same time, migrants who are legally authorized to work in the US make contributions to the programs via payroll deductions. Vice President Harris has not promised amnesty or Social Security benefits to undocumented immigrants, and has gone on an offensive on the issue since becoming the Democratic nominee, while the Biden administration has embraced some Trump administration policies in an effort to secure the southern border. In her speech accepting the Democratic nomination last week, Harris said that “we can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. And as immigration has become a major point of attack from the Trump campaign and its allies, the Harris campaign has spent more than $10 million airing an ad looking to blunt that criticism, touting her record in law enforcement, vowing that “she will hire thousands more border agents and crack down on fentanyl and human trafficking.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he’s been asked to serve on former President Donald Trump’s transition team following his endorsement of the Republican nominee.  In an interview with conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson released Monday, Kennedy reiterated that he’s going to campaign on behalf of Trump, and said he’s involved in conversations about “policy issues” with Trump’s team, including conversations about potential staff for his next administration.   CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. The comment is the latest detail revealed about the conversations between Kennedy leading up to and following his endorsement of Trump. Prior to suspending his presidential campaign, Kennedy and Trump spoke on multiple occasions, and discussed the possibility of Kennedy dropping out of the race in exchange for a role in his administration. After he dropped out, both Kennedy and Trump suggested Kennedy would play oversee a health-related portfolio in the next Trump administration.  Since Tim Walz’s rise to Democratic VP nominee, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has been bashing her governing neighbor as a “radical” who criticized her efforts to maintain “freedom” during the height of the Covid pandemic. But just a decade ago, Walz and Noem, then colleagues in the House of Representatives, had a far different rapport, cosponsoring legislation, taking selfies and kindly speaking of the other. Over a decade ago, as they taped a short video together touting a prairie lands bill, they were more than just a little gracious with each other. “It’s a smart bill and I’m grateful to the Congresswoman both as we share similar geography out there, and while our producers are great stewards of the land, we share that land with our sportsmen and making sure that we have those resources available,” Walz, then a congressman at the time, said as he sat on a couch with Noem. “I love working with Tim just because he’s got such a commonsense approach, which I like too,” Noem said. Compare that to Noem’s words about Walz in recent weeks. “Walz is no leader. He’s a radical. I served with him in Congress. He pretended to be moderate, then showed his true extremist colors as soon as he became governor,” Noem wrote on X. In broadcast interviews, Noem went further. She said on NewsMax that Harris had “chosen a radical leftist governor who truly believes that socialism is the future for America and put him on the ticket with her.” And in an interview with Fox News, Noem piled on, saying that during the protests following the death of George Floyd in 2020, Walz “didn’t take decisive action, didn’t support his cops.” Walz has refrained from responding to Noem’s more recent comments. In a statement, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann said Walz was eager to work with Republicans to help farmers and veterans. CNN’s Owen Dahlkamp contributed to this story. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign today launched another new ad focused on economic messaging, the latest spot touting her proposals to lower housing costs and cut taxes. The new ad includes clips of Harris speaking at campaign events, voicing concerns about the high cost of living and emphasizing housing and tax cuts. The ad also features clips of Harris drawing a contrast with former President Donald Trump, saying, “If you wanna know who someone cares about, look who they fight for. Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations. I will fight to give money back to working and middle class America.” Harris’ campaign has leaned into economic messaging in its most recent ads. Over the weekend, the campaign went up with another new spot containing similar themes, including an emphasis on the cost of living and tax cuts. The newest ad began airing this morning in Pennsylvania, the premier battleground state this cycle, and will likely hit airwaves across all key battlegrounds: Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina. Find out more about the economic policy proposals from both Harris and Trump. “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking.” Kamala Harris’ most stinging line in an otherwise unmemorable debate with then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2020 perfectly explains the latest twist in her showdown with Donald Trump. Most Democrats have heard more than enough from the Republican nominee. But Harris wants to let him have the chance to say exactly what he wants, when he wants in their scheduled debate clash on ABC News on September 10. The vice president’s camp is trying to reverse a rule that President Joe Biden’s team secured for their fateful debate with Trump that ensured that a candidate’s microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak. The restriction was seen as an attempt to prevent a repeat of Trump’s constant interruptions in their debates in 2020, which drove Biden to warn at one point: “Will you shut up, man?” The Harris campaign hopes to give Trump a chance to sabotage himself with an insulting interruption or his overbearing personality. Trump’s camp is pushing back, although the ex-president on Monday undermined the position of his own team, saying he’d be quite happy to lose the mute button. The spat underscores the huge potential importance of the confrontation in defining the narrative for the rest of the campaign, following the most consequential presidential debate ever – on CNN in late June – that knocked Biden out of the race. It’s especially key for Trump, who has struggled to adapt to his new foe since the withdrawal of Biden. The meeting may be his best chance to slow Harris’ momentum coming out of her Chicago convention, especially since he and his campaign believe she’s not ready for the pressure of responding to policy questions and follow-ups from an opponent as feral as Trump. Read the full analysis. The Arizona Police Association, whose president appeared with former President Donald Trump at his campaign rally last week, on Monday endorsed Democratic Senate nominee Ruben Gallego over his Republican opponent Kari Lake.  Campaigning in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday, Trump invited Harris up on stage with him, turning over the mic to Harris so he could announce an endorsement of the former president’s reelection bid. After several minutes of Harris speaking, the crowd appeared to get restless and Trump could be heard telling Harris, “You gotta go.” At the conclusion of his remarks, Harris said the Arizona Police Association was proud to endorse Trump for president. With the presidential race entering its final stretch, Vice President Kamala Harris looking to build on the momentum of last week’s Democratic National Convention and former President Donald Trump honing his lines of attack. The two candidates are expected to go head-to-head at a debate later this month. Here’s the latest news from Monday:"
"Obama hails Harris, slams GOP election tactics in first post-DNC remarks | CNN Politics","Published 5:37 PM EDT, Tue August 27, 2024",2024-08-27T21:37:35.957Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/27/politics/obama-ndrc-speech/index.html,"Former President Barack Obama offered a note of caution to Democrats buzzing over Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, telling donors on Martha’s Vineyard Monday night that the party needs to ramp up its focus – and spending – on down-ballot races across the country. “Kamala’s (convention) speech showed her command, that she’s prepared to be president,” Obama said, according to a partial transcript provided by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a party-aligned group fighting for fairer state and congressional maps. “She was outstanding, and the theme was joy. And so, people were feeling great. And I want everybody to feel great, but I also want everybody to get a little bit of a reality check.” The NDRC told CNN the fundraiser brought in $1.7 million. Obama at the event described Republican efforts to “redraw maps and manipulate the rules,” backed up by courts “that are willing to uphold unfair maps and unfair rules,” as both a power play by a party “that’s basically decided we can’t win on the basis of ideas” and the chief obstacle facing many of the politically popular policies Democrats are campaigning on with new gusto since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the nominee. “Politics in America is and always has been, not simply a matter of rhetoric and joy and excitement. It is also nuts and bolts exercises of power,” Obama said. “If we elect Kamala, but we haven’t dealt with the nuts and bolts issues that NDRC is focused on, she will confront the same nonsense that I had to deal with, with (then Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell and (former House Speaker John) Boehner.” Democrats lost more than a thousand seats in state legislatures during Obama’s presidency, while also suffering a string of defeats at the gubernatorial level and in the US Congress, where Republicans won a 2010 House landslide before taking control of the Senate in 2014. The damage at the state level has been the most difficult for Democrats to unwind, in part due to gerrymandering by state GOP leaders. “Underlying those efforts,” Obama said, “is obviously a longstanding philosophy that says there are certain people that aren’t real Americans, and so they really shouldn’t be represented anyway.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who was appointed by Obama and led the Justice Department from 2009 to 2015, has led the NDRC since its formation in the months after former President Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Since then, the NDRC and allies like the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state-level campaign arm, have slowly turned back the tide. The group says the current maps are on track to be the “fairest” in a generation. Obama also credited the NDRC’s work for Democrats’ better-than-expected showing in the 2022 midterms, when the predicted “red wave” never crashed and Republicans failed to wrest control of the Senate and won only a narrow, fractious majority in the House. “What a lot of people didn’t mention (after the election) was because of the work that Eric and NDRC and others had done, we just had a better map,” Obama said. “And that’s part of the reason that we did not see a red wave. It was that maps were fairer and, as a consequence, better reflected the will of the people.” In his own remarks, Holder touted the NDRC’s work since it began operating in 2017 – a time, he said, when what “seemed like intractable gerrymanders in a whole bunch of different states” had locked Democrats out of power in state legislatures, courts and US congressional races. Holder told the audience that the group is now focused on its “10-year” plan to assure that the “redistricting that we do in 2031 will be even better than the one that happened in this cycle.” Still, he insisted, the nature of modern Republican politics and candidates – who, he said, “have made peace with the notion of being a minority party” – meant that battles over the rules governing elections were as important as Democrats’ messaging and ability to grow their political base. “They won’t have the majority of the American people, but they want majority power nevertheless. It’s almost like political apartheid, and they’ve made peace with that,” Holder said. “And they’ve used gerrymandering, voter suppression.”"
Harris and Walz to sit with CNN for exclusive first joint interview since campaign began | CNN Politics,"Published 5:01 PM EDT, Tue August 27, 2024",2024-08-27T21:01:11.400Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/27/politics/kamala-harris-cnn-interview/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will sit with CNN for their first joint interview on Thursday as Democrats work to broaden their base’s excitement from last week’s Democratic National Convention.  The interview, conducted by CNN’s chief political correspondent and anchor Dana Bash, will air at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday. It occurs as the candidates embark on a bus tour through the battleground state of Georgia and marks the first time Harris has sat with a journalist for an in-depth, on-the-record conversation since President Joe Biden dropped his bid for a second term and endorsed her on July 21. The 37 days since her candidacy began have generated a swell of enthusiasm and momentum for Harris, including at last week’s convention in Chicago. But her lack of a formal news conference or interview has generated criticism from her Republican rivals. Thursday’s interview fulfils a vow she made earlier in August to schedule a sit-down before the end of the month. With the interview, Harris’ extraordinarily truncated campaign is entering a new, post-convention phase. Her team is anticipating more scrutiny as she and Walz enter the final weeks before early voting begins. Harris has also been preparing for a September 10 debate with her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump. Over the past several weeks, Harris has responded to some shouted questions from reporters as she campaigns in battleground states. She also sat for three interviews with content creators and influencers during the DNC last week – an example of her campaign’s belief that voters, especially young voters, are getting their news from less traditional sources. That has done little to dampen criticism, issued most sharply by the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, for going more than a month as the Democratic Party’s standard bearer without facing the scrutiny that comes with a sit-down interview with a journalist. Vance and Trump have held numerous media availabilities during the same time.  “I think it’s really disgraceful, both for Kamala Harris but also for a lot of the American media that participates in this stuff, to have a person who has been the presumptive nominee of the Democrat Party for 17 days and refuses to take a single question from the American media,” Vance said in Wisconsin earlier this month. Some of Vance’s and Trump’s media interactions, however, have presented problems for both candidates – with Vance having to explain past statements he made about childless women and Trump questioning Harris’ racial identity and falsely accusing his biracial opponent of only recently presenting herself as Black. Those are exactly the kinds of unforced media errors the Harris campaign may have been seeking to avoid. The interview will present Harris with the first chance to elucidate her position on various domestic and foreign issues during a campaign that has so far been heavy on vibes but light on concrete policy. She will also have a chance – if she chooses – to explain how her positions might differ from Biden. Previous major interviews have presented a challenge for Harris. During a 2021 sit-down with NBC’s Lester Holt, Harris responded with annoyance when asked why she had not visited the US-Mexico border as part of her assignment to investigate root causes of migration from Central and South America. “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris said in the interview. “We’ve been to the border. So, this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.” Holt responded: “You haven’t been to the border.” “I, and I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t – I don’t understand the point that you’re making,” Harris said with a laugh. She added: “I’m not discounting the importance of the border.” More recent interviews have shown Harris on steadier ground. In the moments following the disastrous June 27 debate that would eventually torpedo Biden’s hopes for a second term, Harris sat for an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper and presented a strong defense of the president’s performance – being one of the very few Biden allies who publicly remained staunchly in his corner."
Analysis: Why Harris wants to unmute Trump | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:15 PM EDT, Tue August 27, 2024",2024-08-27T04:00:02.404Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/27/politics/harris-trump-debate-rules-analysis/index.html,"“Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking.” Kamala Harris’ most stinging line in an otherwise unmemorable debate with then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2020 perfectly explains the latest twist in her showdown with Donald Trump. Most Democrats have heard more than enough from the Republican nominee. But Harris wanted to let him have the chance to say exactly what he wants, when he wants in their scheduled debate clash on ABC News on September 10. The vice president’s camp tried to reverse a rule that President Joe Biden’s team secured for their fateful debate with Trump in June that ensured that a candidate’s microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak. The restriction was seen as an attempt to prevent a repeat of Trump’s constant interruptions in their debates in 2020 which drove Biden to warn at one point “Will you shut up man?” It was clear that the Harris campaign hoped to give Trump the chance to sabotage himself with an insulting interruption or his overbearing personality. Trump’s camp pushed back, although the ex-president on Monday suggested he’d be quite happy to lose the mute button. And on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said on social media that he’d reached an agreement with the Democrats to implement the original rules of the debate agreed upon with Biden before he pulled out of the race. That means silenced mics and no studio audience, according to a personal familiar with the matter. CNN has contacted the Harris campaign for comment. The spat underscores the huge potential importance of the confrontation in defining the narrative for the rest of the campaign, following the most consequential presidential debate ever – on CNN in late June – that knocked Biden out of the race. It’s especially key for Trump, who has struggled to adapt to his new foe since the withdrawal of Biden – whom Republicans were confident of beating in November. The meeting may be his best chance to slow Harris’ momentum coming out of her Chicago convention, especially since he and his campaign believe that she’s not ready for the pressure of responding to policy questions and follow-ups from an opponent as feral as Trump. “Trump needs to debate. Harris needs to debate,” said CNN political analyst Scott Jennings, a Republican. “They both have something to prove.” Monday’s bitter exchanges between the campaigns were another sign of how Harris has transformed the campaign. Her team is increasingly enjoying the chance to troll Trump – the ultimate political troll. It, for instance, released a web video featuring footage of the ex-president and the sound of a clucking chicken to suggest he might back out of the debate. And Harris aides suggested Trump’s “handlers” hadn’t dared to raise the mic question with their boss. An open mic would have tested the Republican nominee’s self-discipline in a debate with Harris, at a time when GOP strategists are pleading with him to stick to policy and quit his smash mouth politics for the good of his campaign. Visuals of Trump talking over and openly disrespecting the woman who has a chance to be the first Black woman president would speak for themselves. Harris would also have a chance to demonstrate strength in standing up to Trump by reprising her famous riposte in the Pence debate. Histrionics by Trump that came across as sexist or had racial overtones could alienate female, minority and suburban voters who could be vital in swing states in November. Imagery of Trump behaving obnoxiously would play into the wider conceit of the Harris campaign that she sharpened during the Democratic Convention last week — namely that Americans have a “fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past.” “The Vice President wants the American people to see an unfettered Donald Trump because that’s what we are going to get if he becomes president again,” Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams told CNN’s Alex Marquardt. “I think it is important that in this election and in this moment that the American people get to see the choice between the two candidates on stage.” Daring Trump to interrupt on an open mic would not be risk free for the vice president. In 2016, the ex-president repeatedly talked over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and disrupted the flow of her answers. While it appeared unflattering to the Republican nominee at the time, he went on to win the election, nevertheless. Maria Cardona, a CNN political commentator, suggested another reason why Harris might want an open mic. “By having the mics unmuted, it is going to give her the ability to control both what she says … as well as fact checking him on the spot,” Cardona, a Democrat, said. In her debate with Pence — conducted behind screens during the Covid-19 pandemic, Harris thwarted an attempt to interrupt her in an exchange on the pandemic by raising her hand and saying “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. … I’m speaking.” The comment, that felt like a prepared moment that candidates practice in mock debates, left the impression that Pence was mansplaining to Harris. The back-and-forth was lent extra resonance by the races and genders of the rivals. The then-California senator liked the phrase so much that she repeated it later in the debate, before telling Pence, “If you don’t mind letting me finish, we can then have a conversation.” At the time, Harris’ catchphrase went viral, leading to social media memes and memorabilia including mugs, tee-shirts and sweatshirts that helped build the vice president’s persona. The disagreement over the terms of the September 10 debate is revealing familiar fault lines in the Trump campaign. The candidate’s staff preferred microphones to be muted during the debate, according to a source familiar with the matter. Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller said in a statement that the ex-president accepted the ABC debate under the same terms as the CNN one with Biden. And he suggested that the change of tack on Harris’ part suggested her debate prep was in trouble. “Even their own campaign spokesman said the debate about debates was over. Clearly, they’re seeing something they don’t like,” Miller said. But as often happens, the former president appeared to undercut his own team’s stand. “It doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on but the agreement was everyone be the same as it was last time,” Trump said at a campaign stop in Virginia. “In that case, it was muted. I didn’t like it the last time, but it worked out fine.” He added a caveat: “We agreed to the same rules. Same rules, same specifications.  And I think that’s probably what it should be.” Harris’ team pounced, with Sam’s saying on CNN that the ex-president had resolved the question in favor of open mics. “We heard from the horse’s mouth,” he said."
These are the victims of the Boulder grocery store shooting | CNN,"Updated 8:52 AM EDT, Tue August 27, 2024",2021-03-24T17:58:42Z,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/us/victims-of-boulder-shooting-wednesday/index.html,"They are 10 people who went to the King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, on March 22, 2021, and never returned. They were victims of yet another mass shooting in the United States, whose lives arestillremembered by family and friends. Their names are: Boulder police Officer Eric Talley, 51; store manager Rikki Olds, 25; store employee Denny Stong, 20; store employee Teri Leiker, 51; Neven Stanisic, 23; Tralona “Lonna” Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. Here are there stories: Talley ran toward danger and was the first police officer to respond to a call “about a possible person with a patrol rifle,” the police chief said. “I have to tell you the heroic action of this officer when he responded to the scene,” former Chief Maris Herold said. Talley, 51, had been on the force since 2010, she said. The veteran officer is survived by his wife and seven children, his father, Homer Talley, told CNN affiliate KUSA. “He loved his family more than anything,” Homer Talley said. Talley’s bravery was obvious on his last day of duty, his family said. “Didn’t surprise me he was the first one there,” his father said. In honor of Talley, Boulder officers used his handcuffs to formally place the shooting suspect into custody, police said in a tweet. Olds was a vivacious strong, and independent young woman who worked as a front-end manager at a King Soopers grocery store. “She was so energetic and charismatic and she was a shining light in this dark world,” her uncle Bob Olds said. “There’s a hole in our family that won’t be filled,” the uncle said at a news conference after the shooting. Rikki Olds, 25, has a little brother, who is “taking it really tough,” Bob Olds said. Bob Olds said he will always remember his niece’s independence. “Rikki lived life on her own terms,” he said. “She didn’t care about if people judged her on her hair color or what kind of tattoos she had.” He added, “When Rikki showed up at the house, we never knew what color her hair was going to be. We never knew what new tattoos she may have.” Olds recalled his niece’s dreams and ambitions. The young woman “wanted to be a nurse, but that plan got altered, so Rikki had a backup plan,” Olds explained. “Rikki was pursuing her dream of being a store manager at King Soopers.” She had planned to come over to his house for a family gathering that week, he said. He can’t shake her last words to him: “See you Thursday.” That afternoon in 2021, as news of the shooting spread, her family panicked when they couldn’t reach her. “We had to wait and agonize over her fate for several hours,” Bob Olds said. “After calls to the police department and every local hospital and the coroner’s office, we finally received a call back from the coroner’s office.” Two other associates of the store – Denny Stong, 20, and Teri Leiker, 51 – were among the victims, according to Kroger, which owns King Soopers. Stong and Olds were graduates of the Boulder Valley School District, Superintendent Rob Anderson said in a statement. “Several of the other victims were parents of our graduates and given the fact that this is a close knit community, there will likely be many other connections to BVSD schools both amongst those who were killed and other victims,” Anderson said. “While we cannot fathom what would cause such an evil, we know that many in our community acted bravely when faced with unspeakable violence,” the superintendent said. Anderson pointed to the actions of first responders and of King Soopers employees who “acted courageously” in trying to get others to safety during the shooting. “We are eternally grateful for their quick thinking and bravery,” Anderson said. Leiker’s parents, Margie and Tom, her brother Kevin and sister-in-law RoxAnn and niece Rachael in a statement thanked “the community for the outpouring of love and support it has shown their family in response to the senseless death of their beloved Teri.” “She was their sweet, sweet girl,” the statement said. “Teri’s capacity for love was immense. They say she was the most joyful person to be around. Everyone loved her and she loved them back. She was known as a big hugger with a big smile, was sweet, caring, had a memorable laugh, and an incredible memory.” In times of floods and fires, the statement said, Leiker “would cry and be so sad for the people affected. She always wanted to donate to them. She loved watching Disney movies and comedy on television. She had a great sense of humor.” Leiker was born in Colorado and spent her life in Denver. “To say she loved this area would be an understatement,” the statement continued. “She loved admiring the ‘Flatirons’ and saw beauty in nature. At age three she was diagnosed with cognitive disabilities but that never stopped her. She was strong willed and was able to overcome any obstacle. Her positive spirit and determination to succeed led her to graduate from Longmont High School’s special education program.” Leiker was 21 when she began living independently, with assistance from Imagine Colorado, a non-profit. She started her first and only job at King Soopers on May 23, 1989. She was a “Courtesy Clerk (front end bagger), brought in buggies, and helped anywhere she was needed.” “She looked forward every year to her work anniversary,” the statement said. “She smiled at her customers and tried to share her happiness with them. She loved her job, customers and co-workers. In 31 years she was absent from work only due to minor health issues. She called her mom every day when she got home from work to let her know she was safe.” For 11 years, Leiker was active in the Best Buddies program at the University of Colorado, forging relationships between students and people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. In 2020, a King Soopers’ employee Leiker dated since the previous year moved in with her and “they were excitedly planning their future together with an upcoming trip and planting a small patch of garden,” the statement said. “While absolutely devastated by her death, her family is thankful she didn’t have to live with the horrible memories of that day, to see what happened to her customers and co-workers – it would have been very overwhelming for her,” the statement said. Stong graduated from Fairview High School in 2019, and Olds graduated from Centaurus High School in 2013, he said. One coworker described Stong as a “wise young man.” “Denny was like an annoying little brother to me. I loved him, we picked on each other but respected each other,” said 20-year-old Logan Ezra Smith, who worked with Stong at King Soopers. “I want people to remember Denny as wise young man, me and him were both big Second Amendment supporters and would go shooting on the weekends, every weekends was a highlight. “I will miss his smile and his laugh but as well as his honesty. He put you in your place.” Another friend, Bianca Porter, said she wasn’t surprised to hear reports that Stong tried to protect others during the shooting. “I had no doubt that he lost his life trying to save other people,” she said. “That’s who he was.” Stong dreamed of becoming a pilot, she said. “He was really passionate. Denny had a work ethic like no one else that I’ve ever met,” Porter said. His job was not the most interesting, “but he looked forward to doing it. Never once did I ever hear him complain about having to go into work late or something,” Porter said. “He just really did what he could and had no complaints.” Fountain, 59, was the sort of person who made those who met her feel they “already knew her,” friend Helen Forster told CNN’s Erin Burnett. If you were having a bad day, Fountain’s smile would cheer you up, said Forster, who had known Fountain since the late 1980s. “She just would light up the room, and she was a bright light,” Forster said. “It’s a terrible loss of an incredible human being.” Fountain, an actress who had performed with the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, worked for a nonprofit financial education program, signing seniors up for Medicare, according to Forster. “All her life really she was about doing service, helping others,” Forster said. “All you had to do is be around her or her give you a hug, and everything was better.” Martha Harmon Pardee, an actress, told CNNin 2021 that she met Fountain on stage more than 30 years ago while performing in a show. “I loved her immediately,” Pardee said. “That’s just what happened when people met her. She was a bright light, a peace lover, a strong feminist.” Pardee said she and Fountain acted together only twice – “but I never missed a show she was in because I loved to watch her, always learned something.” “It was a joy and an honor to work with her onstage because she was so connected, and so present and so generous,” she said. After the bloodshed, flowers, photos, balloons and messages formed a memorial for Bartkowiak, 49, outside Umba, the Boulder yoga and accessories shop she managed. Matisse Molina, a friend who worked at Bartkowiak’s store, described her as “the most amazing person I ever met in my life.” Molina said “she would rather make friends than sell stuff from her store.” “There aren’t any words that could describe her to who she really was, because she was so amazing,” Molina said. “She touched so many lives, I can’t even tell you. She has brought people from very dark places up to their highest points. She helped me as a person grow tremendously,” Molina added. Bartkowiak, known as Lonna, had beenengaged, a friend told CNN’s Kyung Lah. Her cousin, who went only by David, told CNN affiliate KCAL that his family watched hours of footage covering the shooting when they found out her car was parked in the King Soopers parking lot that day. Then, at 3:30 the following morning, her mother called to say Bartkowiak – who lived in the same home in which David grew up – was among those killed. “She helped raise me, she was always there for me,” he said. “She was the most loving person I’ve ever met in my whole life.” Neven Stanisic’s family said in a statement that his funeral service would be “open only to family members, parishioners and those close to the family.” “The Stanisic family wishes to express its gratitude for all the support and kindness extended by friends, neighbors and the family’s church, as well as by local authorities, including the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office,” the statement said. “They also thank the broader Serbian community across the country and beyond for reaching out to them in this time of need.” The statement added, “We express our deepest condolences to other families of the innocent victims.” Stanisic was working to fix the espresso machine at the store’s Starbuckswhen Logan Ezra Smith arrived for work as a barista. “Me and him immediately clicked and were talking the whole time,” said Smith, who has worked at the store about a year. “I got to know a good part of his life in just a short period of time.” Smith said he and Stanisic, 23, were about the same age and had a lot in common. “He seemed like a person I would want to hang out with outside of work,” Smith said. The pair spoke for more than two hours while the young man worked on the coffee machine. “He had one of the strongest work ethics of any young person I’ve ever met,” Smith said. “He loved what he did. He loved his friends. He loved his family. He was a great man, even knowing him for three hours total.” The Rev. Radovan Petrovic said Stanisic and his family left Bosnia as Serbian refugees and settled in Lakewood, Colorado. Petrovic met the family in 2006 when they started attending Saint John the Baptist Serbian Orthodox Church. The family is filled with hard workers, he said, and Stanisic was no exception. “They always carry a profound memory from the old country but love it here as well,” he said. “To them, it’s beyond comprehension that they fled war and were forced out of their homes and came here for a better life and then have this tragedy happen.” Petrovic described Stanisic as a “really good boy” who was brought up to respect others. He loved snowboarding and basketball, which he played with church members. When Stanisic graduated from high school, he decided it was best for him and his family if he joined the work force. He was a technician who worked on coffee and juice machines. Petrovic said the family is trying to understand why their son’s life was cut short, but to describe in detail how they’re feeling is difficult. “You have to be there to see the agony and the sadness that they have and carry with this tragic loss,” he said. “The cries and the screams – that can’t be described. They can’t stop wondering why. And why their son – as probably all the other victims are wondering the same.” John Mackenzie used “magical” to describe his wife of 25 years to CNN affiliate KCNC. Murray was fulfilling an Instacart grocery order at King Soopers, which is just down the street from their house, when she was shot and killed, her daughter Olivia Mackenzie told KCNC. “She was amazing, just the best, most beautiful person in the world,” Olivia Mackenzie said. “She didn’t deserve to die like that.” She said on a GoFundMe the family created that they wish they could have her back, love her more than anything and are encouraging people to share a memory or a story about her on the page because it brings them happiness. Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta told CNN in a statement her team is working with law enforcement and King Soopers to assist “in any way we can.” “We’ve reached out to the shopper’s family to offer our support and resources during this unimaginably difficult time,” Mehta’s statement read. “For those members of our community who were shopping in the Boulder area, we’re also ensuring they’re able to take the time they need to grieve and recover from yesterday’s tragic events.” When Waters, 65, looked at you with her green eyes, you could feel her love for you, her friend and colleague Stephanie Boyles told CNN’s John Berman. Waters worked with Boyles and her business partner, Scott Schaefer, at the leather boutique Embrazio. “She had this sense of design that we really valued and I think other people did as well,” Boyles said. “She had an ability to create spaces that just delighted people when they walked in.” When Schaefer got word that Waters was one of the 10 victims, he said they were in disbelief. “It’s interesting to see your own range of emotions evolve from shock and disbelief to deep sadness, and I think personally now I’m in reflection,” he said. Waters would always be looking for ways to “be her best self” so she would often share things she was doing to improve her life. “Jody was a problem-solver at her core, whether it was her career, her family or self-development, so I think she would want us to take this event and make it part of solving this repeating problem,” Schaefer said. In a statement, Waters’ family said: “It has been comforting and heartwarming to hear the impact that our mom had on so many people throughout her life. But it’s not surprising; she was extremely compassionate, humble, empathetic, and a truly selfless person.” Waters owned clothing stores in Boulder and Denver for more than 23 years, the family said. “She was a task master, creative, led by example, and had an unmatched work ethic – yet she always had time for others,” the statement said. “Personal relationships were everything to her. She was the person who was always there when you needed help, support, or just a listening ear.” Mahoney, 61, walked his daughter, Erika, down the aisle the summer before the shooting. She told CNN’s Anderson Cooper her wedding photo captured who her father’s true character. “He is filled with so much love. I love the photograph because I’m looking up at him and you can tell how he’s so proud of me and proud of my husband who I was walking to and holding back tears,” Erika said. Erika is now pregnant with a girl. “She will know how much her grandfather loves her and she can tell even in the photographs and the stories that we’ll share how amazing he was,” Erika said. “I think she’ll have his spunky attitude and his love for the outdoors.” Mahoney was an outdoorsman who spent a lot of time hiking and was described by Erika as a neighborhood father. “He spent so much time outdoors with my younger brother and all of our friends. He would play with us for hours,” she said. He had volunteered for Meals on Wheels. Erika told CNN she was able to accompany him one afternoon to deliver some food. “It really just, I think, shows how my dad was to be able to go into someone’s home and be that caring, comforting person for someone in need who lives alone,” Erika said. Mahoney was married to his wife, Ellen, for 35 years. She told CNN spending time with her husband during the past year felt like they were newly weds all over. “This past year, during the pandemic was a blessing for us,” she said in 2021. “It gave us time to be together. It reminded me almost like the beginning of our marriage. We took a lot of walks, we cooked together, we watched TV together. I’m very grateful for this past year because we were both working together as a team under very difficult circumstances.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news or read through the posts below. With the presidential race entering its final stretch, Vice President Kamala Harris looking to build on the momentum of last week’s Democratic National Convention and former President Donald Trump honing his lines of attack. The two candidates are expected to go head-to-head at a debate later this month. Here’s the latest news from Monday: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he’s been asked to serve on former President Donald Trump’s transition team following his endorsement of the Republican nominee.  In an interview with conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson released Monday, Kennedy reiterated that he’s going to campaign on behalf of Trump, and said he’s involved in conversations about “policy issues” with Trump’s team, including conversations about potential staff for his next administration.   CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. The comment is the latest detail revealed about the conversations between Kennedy leading up to and following his endorsement of Trump. Prior to suspending his presidential campaign, Kennedy and Trump spoke on multiple occasions, and discussed the possibility of Kennedy dropping out of the race in exchange for a role in his administration. After he dropped out, both Kennedy and Trump suggested Kennedy would play oversee a health-related portfolio in the next Trump administration.  The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October. After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Kamala Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” The sympathy she expressed for Palestinians’ suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.” Harris emphasized the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. But when describing the potential ceasefire deal being negotiated, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.” Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in late July, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana. Read more about what Harris has said so far on other key issues. Donald Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally earlier this year, the former president said he would not abide by the alliance’s collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” if a member country didn’t meet spending guidelines. The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. “Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him “no longer than one day” to settle the war if elected. Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the “never-ending wars” by vowing to remove “warmongers,” “frauds” and “failures in the senior ranks of our government,” and replace them with national security officials who would defend America’s interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war. In addition, Trump has said he would restore his “wonderful” travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country” after Biden overturned the ban in 2021. Kamala Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. In January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic. On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. Donald Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing “radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.” “I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump said in June 2023 remarks. “I will totally obliterate the Deep State.” Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove “rogue” bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress. “I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” he said. To address what he labeled the “disturbing” relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data. Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from “colluding” to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in “censorship-supporting activities.” Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on Friday and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump, has a long history of criticizing the man he now supports, including calling Trump a “threat to democracy,” and, as recently as July, a “terrible president.” For years, Kennedy has repeatedly condemned Trump, referring to him as a “bully,” who appealed to “bigotry,” “hatred,” “xenophobia” and “prejudice.” Among the chief attacks Kennedy has leveled at Trump through the 2024 campaign is to accuse him of corruption for turning his administration over to corporate lobbyists and special interests and failing to “drain the swamp” as he’d promised. But on Friday, Kennedy was full of praise for Trump, saying that while he and the former president “don’t agree on everything,” they do share similar isolationist views on US foreign policy, government censorship, and the need to address chronic disease in America. “Don’t you want a president who’s gonna protect America’s freedom? And is gonna protect us from totalitarianism?” Kennedy said at a Trump campaign event in Glendale, Arizona, as part of his endorsement. For his part, Trump has a history of disparaging Kennedy, calling him “the dumbest member of the Kennedy clan” and “Democratic plant” and “radical left liberal,” in posts on Truth Social. But on Friday, Trump had only nice things to say about Kennedy, calling him “an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share.” Never one to forget a slight though, Trump did note on Friday that Kennedy “also went after me a couple of times, I didn’t like it.” A Kennedy campaign spokesperson did not return CNN’s request for comment. Read more about RFK Jr.’s history of attacking Trump Vice President Kamala Harris will schedule a sit-down interview by the end of the month, according to a senior campaign adviser. “The vice president’s been taking questions from reporters who are covering her on the campaign trail,” Ian Sams also told CNN. This comes amid mounting pressure and criticism against Harris for not participating in a sit-down interview or news conference since being named the Democratic nominee. Harris campaign officials have previously said that she would participate in an interview by the end of August. On the September ABC debate, Sams said that as far as the Harris campaign is concerned the disagreement over the microphones is essentially “over.” This comes after former President Donald Trump said earlier today that he would rather have the microphones always on for both candidates during the debate despite his campaign pushing to keep the same rules as the last presidential debate. Kamala Harris’ campaign on Monday launched a new ad focused on the economy as the vice president continues to make her pitch to voters that bringing down costs will be a top priority if elected. The ad, titled “Everyday,” highlights Harris’ economic agenda, which she unveiled earlier this month in North Carolina, including her plans for affordable housing and tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans. The ad is part of a $150 million August paid media buy and will run on national cable TV and locally across battleground states. This is the second economic-focused ad the campaign released in the days following the Democratic National Convention. On Friday, the campaign unveiled “Opportunity,” in which Harris called for “an opportunity economy” to enable all Americans to have a chance to get a car loan, buy a home and start a business. Former President Donald Trump keeps displaying a chart that includes a significant lie. And he keeps citing that deceptive chart to deliver his own lie about immigration trends in his last year in office. The chart – the one Trump had fortunately turned his head to look at when a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in July – is a bar chart about the monthly number of official encounters with migrants at the southern border. It features a large red arrow pointing to a month with a particularly small bar. And it says in red text beside that arrow: “TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE. LOWEST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN RECORDED HISTORY!” The monthly bars get bigger right after that, insinuating that illegal immigration suddenly began rising from a Trump record low when President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in. And on numerous occasions, including in his recent public conversation with billionaire supporter Elon Musk, Trump has declared that the chart shows that the record low was set in his very last week in office. “You see the arrow on the bottom, the red arrow on the bottom, that’s the lowest point. That was the week I left office. Look what happened after I left office. Look at that,” Trump said at a rally earlier this month in Montana. “If you look at the arrow on the bottom, that’s the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow – that’s the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history, right there, right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest,” Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention in July. But that’s not true. Read more of our fact check on Trump’s chart Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will deliver remarks at the International Association of Fire Fighters convention in Boston on Wednesday, addressing a major labor group with close ties to President Joe Biden that has yet to make an endorsement in this year’s presidential election. Walz will speak Wednesday morning, his second solo campaign event after he addressed the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union’s convention in Los Angeles earlier this month, as part of the campaign’s effort to use Walz, a former public school teacher and union member, to appeal to labor groups.  IAFF was the first major labor organization to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2020 presidential cycle when it endorsed Biden in 2019. But the union has not officially made an endorsement in this election. The Arizona Police Association, whose president appeared with former President Donald Trump at his campaign rally last week, on Monday endorsed Democratic Senate nominee Ruben Gallego over his Republican opponent Kari Lake.  Campaigning in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday, Trump invited Harris up on stage with him, turning over the mic to Harris so he could announce an endorsement of the former president’s reelection bid. After several minutes of Harris speaking, the crowd appeared to get restless and Trump could be heard telling Harris, “You gotta go.” At the conclusion of his remarks, Harris said the Arizona Police Association was proud to endorse Trump for president. As politicians mark the third anniversary of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the service members killed, the White House said nothing will ever be enough to repay families for the sacrifice and loss.  Former President Donald Trump laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris released paper statements on Monday. He continued: “And that’s why the president, the vice president, the first lady, the second gentleman have been working so hard their entire time in office to make sure that we meet, as President (Joe) Biden said, that sacred obligation to our troops, our veterans and their families.” Kirby also defended the president against criticism from some, including the families, over his handling of the crisis. “I don’t think you’re ever going to find a commander in chief of the United States of America and our military who doesn’t — who better understands what grief is like, what mourning is like, what sorrow is like, what frustration is like, than Joe Biden,” Kirby said.  Former President Donald Trump said in an interview aired Monday that the target NATO has set that each member country should spend a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense is “too little.”  Some context: Trump has long complained about the amount other countries in NATO spend on defense compared with the United States. Earlier this year, Trump drew backlash when he said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense. It was a stunning admission that if reelected, Trump would not abide by the collective defense clause that is at the heart of the alliance. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in June that 20 of the alliance’s 32 members are expected to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense this year. Former President Donald Trump on Monday marked the three-year anniversary of the killing of 13 service members during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan by vowing to demand the resignations of all officials involved if he is reelected. The comments came as the Republican nominee worked to draw contrasts between how he and Vice President Kamala Harris would serve as commander-in-chief. “They took the soldiers out first and they had a field day at our expense and our reputation. We will never forget those brave warriors who made the supreme sacrifice for our country,” he said, lamenting the tragedy at an event for the National Guard Association in Michigan. Trump said if he’s elected he’ll ask for the resignations of “every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan calamity” to be on his desk by noon on Inauguration Day.  Trump’s running mate Sen. JD Vance also promised accountability during a call held by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee to mark the anniversary of the 2021 suicide attack outside the Kabul airport. “I aim to be the kind of vice president that honors the sacrifice of the people who wear the uniform, and I know that when President Trump is back in the Oval Office, we are going to get to the bottom of this, and the people who screwed this up are going to suffer some consequences,” Vance said.  Speaking directly to the families of some of the service members who died joined the call, Vance said the administration “will make the people who did this face some accountability, face some firings. And we are going to learn why this happened.” The dramatic change at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket unleashed a flood of donations to the campaign account Kamala Harris inherited from Joe Biden, swamping even Donald Trump’s strongest fundraising days, a CNN analysis of newly filed campaign reports shows. Over the three-day period in July that covered Biden’s withdrawal from the White House race and the rapid consolidation of Democratic support for his vice president, Harris’ principal campaign committee took in more than double what Trump’s campaign account reported collecting in the three days surrounding his felony conviction in New York, according to the review of contributions that total more than $200 this cycle. The donor enthusiasm for Harris’ surprise candidacy has quickly eroded the cash advantage Trump once held. The Harris campaign had previously announced collecting a whopping $310 million in July through its joint fundraising efforts with aligned Democratic Party committees – far exceeding the nearly $139 million that the Trump political operation said it had brought in last month. The CNN review examined sums raised by each candidate’s main campaign committee – a valuable resource in politics because those committees by law must receive discounts on television advertising, giving candidate-controlled money a greater impact than donations to parties and outside groups. Harris’ campaign said Sunday that it had raised $540 million since she launched her presidential bid just over a month ago. Read more on the newly filed campaign reports here. Georgia Democrats and voting rights advocates are calling on the governor to investigate three Republicans on the state election board after they used their partisan majority to pass a series of controversial election rules changes ahead of the general election in November. Critics say the new rules could be used to delay certifying the results of the upcoming presidential election.  Speaking from the state capitol on Monday, Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath repeated calls made by other Georgia lawmakers for Gov. Brian Kemp to take disciplinary action against the board. McBath called the latest rules changes “restrictions on ballot access,” claiming it would make it harder for communities of color to vote. Last week, Democratic state Sen. Nabilah Islam-Parkesfiled a formal state ethics complaint alleging election board members Janelle King, Rick Jeffares and Dr. Janice Johnston broke state law in pushing the rules changes so close to the general election. Some background: Earlier this month, Georgia’s State Election Board approved an ambiguous new rule saying that counties will now have the opportunity for a “reasonable inquiry” to ensure tabulation and canvassing of the election are complete and accurate before local election officials certify the results. Certification is the official confirmation of voting results. It is a mandatory part of the voting process as a final check to verify the results with the secretary of state’s office. Typically, the five-member state election board is tasked with ministerial duties ahead of the election, but recently arrived partisan appointees have pushed the limits of the board’s power.  One of the board’s staunchest critics, Georgia state Rep. Sam Park, argued that Georgia law grants Kemp the authority to investigate and remove election board members if they violated the law. It was not immediately clear if Kemp had the authority to remove members. The board’s chair, Independent John Fervier, was appointed to lead the board by Kemp earlier this year. CNN reached out to a spokesman for Kemp but has not heard back. The Justice Department is arguing to revive its classified documents case against former President Donald Trump with a vigorous defense of special prosecutors, in the first formal filing since Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the criminal case last month. The new brief, which special counsel Jack Smith’s team filed Monday to the 11th Circuit US Court of Appeals in Atlanta, argues that Cannon’s decision to end the Trump case, because she believed the prosecutors’ office lacked Constitutional authority, was “novel” and “lack[ed] merit.” In her ruling, Cannon decided the Justice Department didn’t have the ability to appoint or fund special prosecutors like Smith. Smith’s team also cast the decision from Cannon as not just affecting other special counsel prosecutions – of which there are several ongoing in other courts, against Trump and others — but also as potentially affecting the power of leaders across the federal government. “The district court’s rationale would likewise raise questions about hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch, including in the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, and Labor,” the prosecutors added. More on the case: Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against Trump the same day the Republican National Convention opened on July 15. Cannon said the appointment of Smith violated the Constitution. She did not rule on whether Trump’s behavior was legal. Trump was indicted in June 2023 by a federal grand jury in Miami for taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. Both Trump and his aide Walt Nauta have pleaded not guilty. This is one of four criminal cases Trump faces while running again president. Former President Donald Trump vowed on Monday to create a Space National Guard if reelected, expanding on his signature achievement of creating the United States Space Force during his first term. He told the service members, “I agree with your leadership. You want this very badly, but I agree that the time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force,” saying he would sign “historic legislation” to establish the unit In December 2019, Trump signed national defense legislation that designated the US Air Force Space Command as the US Space Force, the first new service since the US Air Force came into being in 1947. He said the Space Force has been “very, very important” to the country’s defense, saying, “We were getting just destroyed in space, and now we’re leading.” “Russia and China were killing us because we had, we didn’t really have a focus on it, and once you did that, we have a focus. And now we’re leading in space throughout the armed forces,” he said. Trump said the US will make a “historic investment in building a US military for the 21st century, investing heavily in drones, robotics, artificial intelligence, hypersonics.” Former President Donald Trump said on Monday he would rather have the microphones always on for both candidates during the presidential debate, despite his campaign pushing to keep the same rules as the last presidential debate, when mics were muted except when it was the candidate’s turn to speak. At an event in Michigan, Trump again touched on the debate, suggesting there was still some uncertainty about whether it would take place. The former president said the Texas National Guard members he visited with during a trip to the southern border last Thanksgiving were doing the job Harris “refused to do.” What the Harris campaign is saying: The Harris campaign believes the debate issue is “resolved” following Trump’s comments, a spokesperson said Monday. Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said during an appearance on MSNBC that the former president “doesn’t care — doesn’t matter to him whether or not the mics are hot, and frankly, that he would prefer if they were hot. So I think this issue is resolved.” Tyler offered a caveat: “Unless Donald Trump allows his handlers to overrule him, we’ll have a fulsome debate between the two candidates with live microphones, where both candidates will be able to lay out their vision for where they want to take this country.” CNN previously reported that Trump’s campaign was casting fresh doubt on whether a September 10 debate will take place on ABC amid a dispute over the rules. This post has been updated with comments from Trump about the southern border. CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo and Ali Main contributed to this report. Former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, who now identifies as an independent, endorsed former President Donald Trump on Monday. She told service members at the National Guard Association of the United States’ 146th General Conference & Exhibition that Trump “understands the grave responsibility that a president and commander in chief bears for every single one of our lives.” Gabbard said she believes Trump’s first task in office will be to “walk us back from the brink of war.” Gabbard, who is a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserve, served in the Hawaii Army National Guard for 17 years. She said she also joined Trump earlier today at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the attack at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate that killed 13 US military service members.  The former Hawaii congresswoman has been helping Trump with debate prep ahead of the planned face-off with Harris on September 10. As the congressional task force investigating the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump is on scene in Butler, Pennsylvania, for a fact-finding visit, a group of conservative congressmen held a counterprogramming event on their efforts to investigate the assassination attempt.  Mills pushed for serious consequences — including criminal charges — against those they deem to be responsible for the assassination attempt.  “This is not an ‘I’m sorry, I’ll resign, I’m finished,’” he said. “This is a get accountability to pursue either purposeful intent or criminal gross negligence.”  In addition to the lawmakers, participants also include Dan Bongino, Former United States Secret Service Special Agent, Erik Prince, Former United States Navy SEAL Officer, and Ben Shaffer, Washington Regional SWAT Operator. Donald Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. Meanwhile, Harris has quickly started to try to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record and outlined her policies. Here’s a look at what Trump has proposed on the topic: Here’s a look at where Harris stands on the topic: While Kamala Harris has improved on President Joe Biden’s standing in many states, the shape of the crucial Senate races that will determine the majority is the same. Democrats are facing an incredibly unfavorable map this year, defending seats in places that former President Donald Trump won by comfortable margins and presidential battlegrounds that he narrowly lost in 2020. Here’s a snapshot of where the race for the Senate stands now: West Virginia: West Virginia would have been tough to hold even with Joe Manchin, but without the Democrat-turned-independent senator running for reelection, Republican Gov. Jim Justice is poised to be the next senator from a state Trump is expected to carry by double digits. Montana: Sen. Jon Tester remains the most endangered Democrat running for reelection. This is the first time he’s on the ballot at the same time as Trump. A new wild card: Montana will now also have an abortion measure on the November ballot. Ohio: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is vulnerable because he, too, is running for reelection in a Trump state. Brown is up against Republican businessman Bernie Moreno, whom Democrats boosted in the GOP primary because they thought he’d be the weakest opponent. The car dealership owner trailed Brown even when Biden was atop the ticket. That doesn’t mean that Brown is safe. Michigan: The race is to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, making it an open seat, which is typically harder to defend. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a three-term congresswoman, is running statewide for the first time. She’ll face a challenging race against Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers. Arizona: Another open-seat race Democrats are trying to defend where the border is front and center. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s departure from the race gave way to a two-way matchup between Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Marine veteran, and Republican Kari Lake, a Trump ally who hasn’t let go of claims that she won the 2022 gubernatorial election. Nevada: Sen. Jacky Rosen is running for a second term and the Harris-led ticket has strengthened her position. It’s still tough terrain for Democrats, with a transient population and demographics that may be moving away from the party. But abortion is also on the ballot in Nevada, a state where Democrats believe reproductive rights are particularly salient. Keep reading about other key Senate races here. An Arizona judge has set a trial date of January 5, 2026, for allies of former President Donald Trump charged for a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. At a hearing Monday, several defendants, including conservative attorney John Eastman and multiple Arizona Republicans who served as fake electors, are present in the courtroom. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Christina Bobb, who serves as the top lawyer for the RNC on election integrity, have joined the hearing virtually. This is the first high-stakes hearing since a grand jury handed up criminal charges against the fake electors from Arizona. Trump himself was not charged. Lawyers for the Trump allies will argue that prosecutors are seeking an overly harsh punishment to coerce defendants to cooperate. Some more background: Arizona’s attorney general has charged the Trump allies with committing multiple felonies on the same occasion — a designation under state law that means a conviction would likely carry prison sentences rather than a lesser penalty afforded to first-time offenders. Arizona Superior Court Judge Bruce Cohen, who was appointed in 2005 by then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, acknowledged that the trial date is a “moving target.” The pivotal hearing comes just days after Trump, who has not been charged in the Arizona case but is described in court documents as “unindicted co-conspirator 1,” held a rally in the key swing state as part of his 2024 presidential campaign. Trump has avoided having to stand trial in either of the two criminal cases where he was charged for attempting to overturn the 2020 election, but Monday’s hearing in Arizona underscores how many of those who sought to help the former president remain in power still face significant legal exposure as a result. Listen more below about the significance of the hearing: Former President Donald Trump said on Monday he was “not spending a lot of time” preparing for the upcoming presidential debate that is scheduled for next month against Vice President Kamala Harris.  The former president added, “You basically, you have to be real. You know, you can’t cram knowledge into your head, thirty years of knowledge in one week, so, you know, there’s a little debate prep but I’ve always done it more or less the same way and you have to know your subject and I think I know my subject, I think I know it better than anybody.”  Trump and Harris are scheduled to face off during a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, but Trump and his campaign have been casting doubt on whether the debate will take place amid a dispute over the rules.  Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance will attend a fundraiser in Los Angeles next month hosted by billionaire tech investor David Sacks and his wife Jacqueline, according to a source familiar. The September 8 fundraiser is also hosted by former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her husband Jeff Sprecher. The reception is $3,300 per person with a roundtable opportunity available for giving or raising $25,000 and a photo opportunity for giving or raising $15,000. This comes as the Trump campaign looks to ramp up fundraising after the dramatic change at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket unleashed a flood of donations to the campaign account Vice President Kamala Harris inherited from President Joe Biden. Harris’ campaign said Sunday that it had raised $540 million since she launched her presidential bid just over a month ago. That’s a record for any campaign in history for this time span, according to Harris’ team.  The campaign saw a surge of grassroots donations during last week’s Democratic National Convention, raking in $82 million. The hour following Harris’ speech on the final night of the convention was the campaign’s best fundraising hour since launch day. Harris’ supercharged Democratic fundraising in July helped erase what had been an emerging cash advantage for Trump, federal filings from last week showed. CNN’s Ebony Davis contributed reporting to this post.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suspended his presidential campaign with a confusing message to voters: He will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie. In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump. Could Kennedy feature in a “contingent election?” No. He could not participate unless he won electoral votes, which does not seem mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking. With two presidential candidates fighting over 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It’s surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. That tie resulted from a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation’s first “contingent election,” decided in the House of Representatives. Could a tie happen this year? Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election: If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269. The website 270 to Win also has more tied-election scenarios. Visualize your own 269-269 scenario with CNN’s interactive election map. What happens if there’s a tie? A “contingent election.” According to the 12th Amendment, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president. Read more about how a contingent election would work On the third anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, posted a message on X honoring of the memories 13 American service members who died in the 2021 suicide attack outside the Kabul airport. Vance has been fiercely critical of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal. “President Joe Biden got us out of Afghanistan in the most disgraceful way, and of course, Kamala Harris was right there every step of the way,” Vance said earlier this month at a VFW in Pennsylvania. “Because they tried to shut the airport before they got everybody out – one of the most catastrophic mistakes in the history of the US military, totally unforced error from Kamala Harris and a total failure of leadership – we lost 13 brave service members that we didn’t need to lose.” Earlier this morning, former President Donald Trump participated in a wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia to honor the fallen service members. Eight years of insults, incitement and affronts to the rule of law have proved that Donald Trump won’t be tamed. Yet some of his supporters are still pleading for the criminally convicted and twice-impeached ex-president to rein in his wildest impulses or risk losing the 2024 election. Hoping to sharpen Trump’s focus, his campaign is setting him up with a new menu of policy speeches, town halls and rallies in battleground states as he struggles to find traction in the transformed race against Kamala Harris, CNN has reported. This week, Trump will swing through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the critical “blue wall” states that hold the key to November’s election. The adjusted strategy follows the success of the Democratic National Convention last week and Harris’ disciplined start to her optimistic campaign, which threatens Trump’s White House comeback bidmore than the one President Joe Biden shelved amid concerns about his age.  Trump’s stepped-up pace reflects the new urgency of the compressed sprint until November’s election and is designed to reposition the ex-president before his debate showdown with Harris on September 10. Read the full analysis. The economy is the focus of a wave of new campaign ads hitting airwaves in the presidential race this week, as the Trump and Harris campaigns and their allies deliver contrasting messaging about warning signs and opportunities.  One of the new ads from the Trump campaign, which began airing this morning in Arizona, stitches together clips of Vice President Kamala Harris voicing concerns about rising prices, juxtaposed with clips of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working” — a biting spot aimed at linking Harris to voter disapproval of Biden’s handling of the economy. “Everyday prices are too high food, rent, gas back to school clothes,” Harris says in the opening clips. “That is called: Bidenomics,” Harris says in a subsequent clip. The Harris campaign, meanwhile, also began airing a new ad over the weekend, first in Georgia, that similarly focused on economic messaging, echoing Harris’ pitch for an “opportunity economy.” “Here’s a few things. I believe middle class families like the one I grew up in, they want common sense solutions. You want lower prices and lower taxes. I believe you want to just not get by, but you want to get ahead. We must create an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to get a car loan, buy a home, start a business,” Harris says, speaking straight to camera. And at the end of the ad, Harris says, “But most of all, that instead of being focused on the politics of the past, we need to be thinking about the future” — a message that Harris and her allies have increasingly featured in their ads, as they look to capitalize on voters’ desire for change and avoid any disadvantages of incumbency. Former President Donald Trump on Monday participated in a wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on the third anniversary of the attack at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate that killed 13 US military service members.  Trump was joined by some family members of the fallen service members. The former president regularly attacks the Biden administration — and now specifically Vice President Kamala Harris — over the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.  Trump on Monday also visited a Vietnamese shopping center with Virginia Senate GOP nominee Hung Cao, who would be the first Vietnamese American senator if elected. Trump praised Cao and said he thinks the Republican nominee has “got a very good chance of winning the Senate.” CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with more reporting on Trump’s events in Virginia. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are commemorating three years since a terrorist bomb killed 13 American service members outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. “These 13 Americans—and the many more that were wounded—were patriots in the highest sense. Some were born the year the war in Afghanistan started,” Biden said in a statement after listing the fallen service members’ names.  Harris also named the 13 American service members killed outside the Kabul airport in a statement, calling them “heroes” and “devoted patriots” as she reiterated her support for Biden’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. Biden, she said, “made the courageous and right decision to end America’s longest war.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump will be at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia this morning to commemorate the date, a source familiar tells CNN. The withdrawal has become one of his key talking points against the current administration. More context: Biden has faced criticism for his handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Family members of the fallen spoke at the Republican National Convention earlier this summer, criticizing Biden for never publicly naming their loved ones. In Harris’ statement, she also previewed her own presidential message: “I will never hesitate to take whatever action necessary to counter terrorist threats and protect the American people and the homeland.” What Trump is saying: The former president criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal, which he has also done previously. “This is the third anniversary of the BOTCHED Afghanistan withdrawal, the most EMBARRASSING moment in the history of our Country. Gross Incompetence - 13 DEAD American soldiers, hundreds of people wounded and dead, AMERICANS and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT LEFT BEHIND. You don’t take our soldiers out first, you take them out LAST, when all else is successfully done,” Trump posted on Truth Social. A judge in Arizona will hear arguments on Monday that may determine whether several allies of former President Donald Trump could likely face prison sentences if they are convicted for participating in a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. This will be the first high-stakes hearing since a grand jury handed up criminal charges against the fake electors from Arizona and several Trump allies — including the former president’s onetime attorney Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Christina Bobb, who currently serves as the Republican National Committee’s top lawyer on election integrity — earlier this year. Lawyers for the Trump allies will argue that prosecutors are seeking an overly harsh punishment to coerce defendants to cooperate. The charges: Arizona’s attorney general has charged the Trump allies with committing multiple felonies on the same occasion — a designation under state law that means a conviction would likely carry prison sentences rather than a lesser penalty afforded to first-time offenders. The judge: Arizona Superior Court Judge Bruce Cohen, who was appointed in 2005 by then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, will hear arguments from both sides during Monday’s hearing and his decision will ultimately define the stakes of the case going forward. More on the case: Prosecutors will also push back on claims that they failed to provide sufficient evidence connecting some of the defendants to an alleged conspiracy during secret grand jury proceedings. The pivotal hearing comes just days after Trump, who has not been charged in the Arizona case but is described in court documents as “unindicted co-conspirator 1,” held a rally in the key swing state as part of his 2024 presidential campaign. Read more about today’s hearing in Arizona. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have picked their running mates and held nominating conventions to rally their parties. They have limited time to convince the few undecided voters and make sure everyone in key battleground states gets to the polls. While we don’t know specifically what will happen between now andElection Day — or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going — but we do have some idea of what to expect: The campaigns of former President Donald Trump, and Vice President Kamala Harris have reached somewhat of an impasse over debate rules ahead of the September 10 debate on ABC, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. Trump’s team, according to the source, would like for the microphones to be muted while the other is not supposed to be speaking, as was the case during the first debate with President Joe Biden. The Harris campaign is requesting that ABC and other networks seeking to host a potential October debate keep microphones on, according to a senior campaign official, marking a change from the June debate when the then-Biden campaign wanted microphones muted except when it was a candidate’s turn to speak. “We have told ABC and other networks seeking to host a possible October debate that we believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast,” Brian Fallon, the Harris campaign’s senior adviser for communications, said in a statement. Trump’s campaign has argued that when they agreed to the ABC debate with Harris at the top of the ticket, they were agreeing to the same guidelines of the previous debate. The Harris campaign maintains that the muted mics are the only remaining dispute, and while they wouldn’t mind opening statements, they have not insisted on it. In a social media post Sunday night, Trump questioned whether or not he should participate in the ABC debate, criticizing the network’s coverage including what he called a “Panel of Trump Haters,” asking, “why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?” The microphone rules dispute was first reported by Politico. Until now, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has held his fire about his stint in the Trump White House. McMaster served with distinction in key American conflicts of the past decades: the Gulf War, the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan, but as McMaster recounts in his new book, “At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,” in some ways, his most challenging tour as a soldier was his last one: serving as the national security adviser to a notoriously mercurial president. In his blistering, insightful account of his time in the Trump White House, McMaster describes meetings in the Oval Office as “exercises in competitive sycophancy” during which Donald Trump’s advisers would flatter the president by saying stuff like, “Your instincts are always right” or, “No one has ever been treated so badly by the press.” Meanwhile, Trump would say “outlandish” things like, “Why don’t we just bomb the drugs?” in Mexico or, “Why don’t we take out the whole North Korean Army during one of their parades?” McMaster wasn’t going to make the same mistake after Trump tapped him to be his national security adviser in February 2017. He writes, “I knew that to fulfill my duty, I would have to tell Trump what he didn’t want to hear.” This helps explain why McMaster lasted just over a year in the job. (Disclosure: I have known McMaster professionally since 2010, when he ran an anti-corruption task force in Afghanistan.) McMaster’s book, which focuses on Trump’s tenure as commander in chief, comes at a particularly timely moment, just as many Americans start to really consider whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris would make a better commander in chief. McMaster provides unique detail on Trump’s approach to foreign policy and — similarly to his successor in the national security adviser role, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who wrote scathingly about the former president in a book published in 2020 — his account is likely to do little to reassure US allies about the prospects of a second Trump term. Read more about McMaster’s thoughts on Trump here. Former President Donald Trump will be at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia this morning to commemorate the third anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal, a source familiar tells CNN.  The withdrawal has become one of his key talking points against the current administration. He is expected to be joined by some members of the families of the fallen soldiers.  Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat, is expected to formally endorse former President Donald Trump’s third presidential bid today at his event in Detroit, Michigan, a source with knowledge of the matter tells CNN. The endorsement is not surprising given that Gabbard, now an independent, has been helping Trump with debate prep ahead of the September 10 face-off with Vice President Kamala Harris. While former President Donald Trump campaigns in two “blue wall” states this week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will visit another key battleground. Trump will deliver remarks on the economy in Potterville, Michigan, on Thursday, according to his campaign. The former president will also host a town hall that evening in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Trump “will meet with Wisconsinites to listen to their concerns and share his promising agenda: to make America affordable again,” his campaign said. On Wednesday, Harris and Walz will kick off a bus tour in Georgia, concluding with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to their campaign. Few battlegrounds will be more closely watched than Georgia — where President Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago — for signs of how voters respond to campaign outreach. Fresh off a week of daily counterprogramming events and an effort to steal the spotlight from his new opponent, Donald Trump and his campaign are seeking to harness that pace in the lead-up to November — with plans to aggressively ramp up the former president’s schedule, hone his debate skills and cultivate a new ground-game strategy tied to the early voting states, sources familiar with the strategy shift told CNN. Through November, Trump is expected to hold “several events each week, if not daily,” one adviser said, while another predicted the former president will regularly visit two states in a day. While Trump was always expected to escalate his campaign activity after the conventions, the heightened pace goes well beyond previous preparations and is a direct response to the enthusiasm spike from Democrats since Harris replaced Biden atop their ticket, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Trump’s schedule this week is a clear example. On Monday, the former president will address the National Guard Association’s conference in Detroit; on Thursday, he will travel to Michigan for a speech on the economy before participating in a town hall in Wisconsin that evening. On Friday, he will hold a rally in Pennsylvania, then head to Washington, DC, to speak atthe “Joyful Warriors” summit, held by the conservative Moms for Liberty group. Trump’s accelerated schedule also follows a trying stretch of his campaign. The former president’s erratic response to the change in opponent set off a wave of discussions about the strategy for the new reality. Close allies cautioned Trump to focus on policy over personal attacks and urged him to get in front of voters more often. Moving forward, Trump will focus on battlegrounds where mail-in ballots will soon go out and early voting locations will first open, including in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, as well as states tilting toward one party or the other, such as Minnesota and Florida. The Trump campaign also plans to bolster its teams on the ground in those states, as well as to deploy surrogates to hold get-out-the-vote events. Read more here Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are looking to maintain their momentum as they prepare to hit the campaign trail again following an excitement-filled Democratic National Convention last week. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump — bracing for more unfavorable polling news — is seeking to curb Harris’ stride while also on the trail this week with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who took swings at their rivals Sunday. Here’s the latest campaign news: Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said Sunday that it had raised $540 million since she launched her presidential bid just over a month ago. That’s a record for any campaign in history for this time span, according to Harris’ team.  The campaign saw a surge of grassroots donations during last week’s Democratic National Convention, raking in $82 million. The hour following Harris’ speech on the final night of the convention was the campaign’s best fundraising hour since launch day. Harris’ team said a third of last week’s donations were from first-time contributors, two-thirds of whom were women. Teaching and nursing continue to be among the most common occupations for donors, the campaign said. The campaign also had its biggest week of organizing, with nearly 200,000 volunteers signing up for shifts since Monday.   Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will kick off a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday, their first time campaigning in the state together, underscoring the campaign’s focus on the key battleground. The vice president is also set to host a rally in Savannah on Thursday to “speak directly to Georgians about the stakes of this election.”"
Trump appears to undercut his campaign’s efforts over microphone rules at debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:35 PM EDT, Mon August 26, 2024",2024-08-26T11:35:36.631Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/26/politics/trump-harris-september-debate/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump appeared to undercut his campaign’s efforts to keep the same rules in place for his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris next month. Trump’s team, according to a source familiar with the matter, would like for the microphones to be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, as was the case during the first debate with President Joe Biden. But while Trump took aim at what he called the “biased” network Sunday evening – complaining about reporter Jonathan Karl and a panel of “Trump Haters” on his Truth Social platform – he said Monday that he would prefer the mics to stay on. “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time,” Trump said when asked by a reporter if he wanted the microphones muted during the debate when the candidate is not speaking. Trump also again cast doubt on whether he would participate in the debate. “When I looked at the hostility of that, I said, ‘Why am I doing it? Let’s do it with another network.’ I want to do it,” Trump said The Harris campaign, for its part, is requesting that ABC and other networks seeking to host a potential October debate keep microphones on, according to a senior campaign official, marking a change from the June debate when the then-Biden campaign wanted microphones muted except when it was a candidate’s turn to speak. A top Harris spokesman said Monday that the campaign considered the mic issue “resolved” after Trump’s comments. Trump “doesn’t care – doesn’t matter to him whether or not the mics are hot, and frankly, that he would prefer if they were hot. So I think this issue is resolved,” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said during an appearance on MSNBC. Tyler did offer a caveat: “Unless Donald Trump allows his handlers to overrule him, we’ll have a fulsome debate between the two candidates with live microphones, where both candidates will be able to lay out their vision for where they want to take this country.” Earlier Monday, Trump’s campaign argued that when they agreed to the ABC debate with Harris at the top of the ticket, they were agreeing to the same guidelines of the previous debate. “Enough with the games. We accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate,” Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement. “The Harris camp, after having already agreed to the CNN rules, asked for a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements. We said no changes to the agreed upon rules.” Miller added, “Interesting that this is only coming up now that the Harris campaign has started their debate prep. Even their own campaign spokesman said the debate about debates was over. Clearly they’re seeing something they don’t like.” The Harris campaign pushed back on Miller’s claim that it was seeking for the candidates to be seated with access to notes. The microphone rules dispute was first reported by Politico. The ABC debate was officially agreed upon earlier this month, though Trump has repeatedly called for a revised setting, including a “full arena audience” debate hosted by Fox News. Still, both candidates have been engaged in practice debate sessions. Harris is set to visit Georgia this week, aides said, along with a limited number of campaign stops as she focuses on debate preparations. Trump, for his part, has enlisted one of Harris’ former 2020 Democratic primary rivals, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Harris and Gabbard had several notable exchanges during the Democratic primary debates, where Harris criticized Gabbard for her foreign policy views while Gabbard challenged Harris’ record on criminal justice. The former president said Monday that he was “not spending a lot of time” preparing for the debate. “I’m not,” Trump said when asked by a reporter how he was preparing. “I’m not spending a lot of time on it, I think my whole life I’ve been preparing for a debate.” “… You basically, you have to be real,” he said. “You know, you can’t cram knowledge into your head, thirty years of knowledge in one week, so, you know, there’s a little debate prep but I’ve always done it more or less the same way and you have to know your subject and I think I know my subject, I think I know it better than anybody.” This story has been updated with additional information."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are looking to maintain their momentum as they prepare to hit the campaign trail again following an excitement-filled Democratic National Convention last week. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump — bracing for more unfavorable polling news — is seeking to curb Harris’ stride while also on the trail this week with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who took swings at their rivals Sunday. Catch up on today’s campaign news: House Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday sharply criticized Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as he works to expand the slim Republican majority in the House and make the case for former President Donald Trump. Speaking in Minneapolis alongside Joe Teirab, who is looking to flip the House seat held by Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, Johnson used the backdrop of the Police Department’s Third Precinct to criticize Walz’s handling of the protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. The Third Precinct was burned during the protests. Trump and his allies have frequently cited the Minneapolis protests in their criticism of Walz. The former president has claimed that it was he who deployed the Minnesota National Guard in response to the protests. Walz, not Trump, sent the National Guard to Minneapolis — and Walz first deployed the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to do so. Johnson also said he expected the Democratic “sugar high” to subside in the presidential polls after Labor Day. “I mean, obviously, the Democrats are on a sugar high. Everybody’s acknowledged that. And I think that that gets real after Labor Day,” the Louisiana Republican said, adding, “I think that Kamala Harris is about to be put to the real test.” Johnson also defended the GOP for tanking the bipartisan immigration bill supported by the Biden administration. The bill has been a key target for Democrats trying to change the narrative on border security. Until now, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has held his fire about his stint in the Trump White House. McMaster served with distinction in key American conflicts of the past decades: the Gulf War, the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan, but as McMaster recounts in his new book, “At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House,” in some ways, his most challenging tour as a soldier was his last one: serving as the national security adviser to a notoriously mercurial president. In his blistering, insightful account of his time in the Trump White House, McMaster describes meetings in the Oval Office as “exercises in competitive sycophancy” during which Donald Trump’s advisers would flatter the president by saying stuff like, “Your instincts are always right” or, “No one has ever been treated so badly by the press.” Meanwhile, Trump would say “outlandish” things like, “Why don’t we just bomb the drugs?” in Mexico or, “Why don’t we take out the whole North Korean Army during one of their parades?” McMaster wasn’t going to make the same mistake after Trump tapped him to be his national security adviser in February 2017. He writes, “I knew that to fulfill my duty, I would have to tell Trump what he didn’t want to hear.” This helps explain why McMaster lasted just over a year in the job. (Disclosure: I have known McMaster professionally since 2010, when he ran an anti-corruption task force in Afghanistan.) McMaster’s book, which focuses on Trump’s tenure as commander in chief, comes at a particularly timely moment, just as many Americans start to really consider whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris would make a better commander in chief. McMaster provides unique detail on Trump’s approach to foreign policy and — similarly to his successor in the national security adviser role, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who wrote scathingly about the former president in a book published in 2020 — his account is likely to do little to reassure US allies about the prospects of a second Trump term. Read more about McMaster’s thoughts on Trump here. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign accused Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance of “ducking and dodging” multiple questions about Donald Trump’s potential immigration policy during his interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday. In the interview, Vance wouldn’t say exactly whether Trump’s plan for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants would separate children from their families.  “I think that families are currently being separated, and you’re certainly going to have to deport some people in this country,” the Ohio senator said. Asked whether that means yes, Vance said, “No, I think it’s you start with the most violent criminals in our country. Those people need to be deported. That’s where you focus federal resources.”  “Kamala Harris cannot claim that she doesn’t know that her policies are leading to family separation. They are, and everybody knows it, and she has to take responsibility for that,” Vance said. A 2023 report showed US Border Patrol separated some migrant children from their parents while the families were in custody amid overcrowding in facilities. Those separations, which took place under the Biden administration, were different from those that occurred under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, when families remained separated and, in some cases, parents were deported without their children. In the rare instances in which children are separated from a parent in custody now, they are reunited and released together, said a CBP official, who called separation a “last resort.” CNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this post. Rock band Foo Fighters did not give Donald Trump’s campaign permission to play one of their songs at a recent campaign rally, a representative for the band said, and they plan to donate any royalties from the unauthorized use to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. On Friday, Foo Fighters’ song “My Hero” was played at a campaign rally for Trump in Arizona, according to video taken at the event and shared to social media. A spokesperson for the band, however, said in a statement to CNN on Sunday that the group didn’t give Trump’s campaign the green light to use their hit 1997 rock anthem. “Foo Fighters were not asked permission, and if they were they would not have granted it,” the statement from the representative said, adding that any royalties the band received “as a result of this use will be donated to the Harris/Walz campaign.” Read more about the Trump campaign’s history with musical disputes here. With each party trying to one-up the other on its family friendliness, the popular child tax credit has become a major point of rivalry in this year’s presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has made boosting the child tax credit a central piece of her recently released four-part platform to lower costs for American families, which also included measures to make housing, groceries and prescription drugs more affordable. She wants to restore the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act’s enhanced credit of up to $3,600 per child, which was only in effect for one year, as well as create a $6,000 credit for newborns. Meanwhile, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the GOP vice presidential pick who has repeatedly claimed Democrats are anti-family, told CBS News earlier this month that he’d like to see the child tax credit beefed up to $5,000 per child — though he’d have to see how “viable” that would be in Congress. Former President Donald Trump, who is at the top of the ticket and whose daughter Ivanka successfully pushed to expand the credit during his first term, indicated in a separate CBS News interview this month that he supports a generous child tax credit. Vance and Democrats have also traded barbs over the credit, with the GOP vice presidential nominee falsely claiming that Harris wants to end the benefit, and Democrats attacking him for missing a recent vote that would have temporarily broadened the credit. Whoever wins the White House will have to deal with the child tax credit next year, since it is scheduled to revert back to a maximum of $1,000 in 2026, down from the current ceiling of $2,000 put in place by the Republicans’ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The credit is one of many individual income tax provisions in the law that lapse at the end of next year. Read more on what you need to know about the child tax credit here. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspending his presidential campaign has not yet put an end to the anecdotes about his personal life. The latest story, originally shared by Kennedy’s daughter Kathleen “Kick” Kennedy in a recently resurfaced 2012 interview with Town & Country Magazine, details how Kennedy once used a chainsaw to cut off the head of a dead whale carcass that had washed up on the shores of their family’s home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He then drove the whale’s head back to their home in New York on the roof of the family’s minivan, according to the interview.   The interview has seen renewed attention following tabloid reports romantically linking Kick Kennedy with actor Ben Affleck.  Kennedy suspended his independent White House bid and endorsed former President Donald Trump on Friday after he failed to make gains on Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris in recent weeks. In recent months, his campaign was beset by a string of reports about his personal life that drew national headlines.  In May, he said that in 2010 a parasitic worm had crawled into his brain and died, causing health problems. Weeks later, Vanity Fair published an article featuring a former part-time babysitter accusing him of sexual assault. The same article also featured a photo he sent to a friend which he implied depicted him eating a dog. Earlier this month, he said he placed a bear carcass in New York’s Central Park in 2014, an incident that drew international media attention at the time.  A Michigan judge on Saturday overruled the state elections office’s decision to block independent presidential candidate Cornel West from appearing on the state’s ballot in November, forcing the state to continue its review of his petition. The Michigan Bureau of Elections had declared West ineligible for the state’s ballot following an objection from Clear Choice PAC, a Democratic-aligned group combatting third-party candidates, because his affidavit of identity was not properly notarized.  But on Saturday, Michigan Court of Claims Judge James Robert Redford ruled that West was not required by state law to submit an affidavit to qualify for the state’s presidential ballot and said the state’s elections office “misapplied the law in finding otherwise.” Redford ruled the Michigan Bureau of Elections must qualify West for the ballot if he is determined to have submitted enough valid signatures. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee said not allowing a Palestinian-American or a member of the Uncommitted Movement take the stage at the Democratic National Convention was a missed opportunity to give people feeling marginalized space to speak in the Democratic Party.  The Pennsylvania Democrat said that while defeating former President Donald Trump was a “top concern,” the party could have also allowed these “marginalized” voices space to speak. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker on Sunday defended the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, saying the administration is doing “an extraordinary job,” as it continues to be the subject of public criticism from progressives within the Democratic Party.  The Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week saw a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallying against US support for Israel in its war against Hamas. When asked about the lack of a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention, Booker defended the DNC saying it did a “good job” of addressing the conflict.   “I think that the convention did a good job of bringing up this conflict over and over again, from Vice President Harris herself to my friend Raphael Warnock, to even past Presidents – all spoke to the urgency for us to end this conflict and bring about a ceasefire, end Palestinian suffering, get the hostages released, which includes American hostages,” he said.  Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said he does not have any hesitation about accepting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s endorsement of Donald Trump despite his history of conspiratorial comments. “We’re going to disagree on issues, right?” Vance said of Kennedy, who has linked certain vaccines to autism, blamed antidepressants for mass shootings and said he wouldn’t “take sides” on the September 11 terrorist attacks. “There are things that Robert Kennedy has said that I disagree with. … I think what his endorsement represents is that Donald J. Trump’s Republican Party is a big-tent party,” Vance said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Asked specifically about Kennedy’s 9/11 comments, Vance said, “Of course, I don’t agree with that.” Kennedy had posted on X in July, “My take on 9/11: It’s hard to tell what is a conspiracy theory and what isn’t. But conspiracy theories flourish when the government routinely lies to the public. As President I won’t take sides on 9/11 or any of the other debates. But I can promise is that I will open the files and usher in a new era of transparency.” Vance said Sunday, “Now, to be clear, I don’t know what RFK actually said there. Maybe there was additional context, of course, you actually have to see what people say before you agree or disagree with it.” Some House Democrats are urging Vice President Kamala Harris to visit the US southern border as former President Donald Trump seeks to paint Harris as responsible for spikes in border crossings. Michigan Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee told CNN’s Manu Raju in Chicago on Thursday that it “would be helpful” for Harris to to make the trip. If elected, Harris said she would “bring back the bipartisan border security bill” tanked by Trump and “sign it into law.” Harris made her first and only visit to US border operations in El Paso, Texas, in June 2021. Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly agreed that a border visit would make sense. Sen. Lindsey Graham once again insisted former president Donald Trump should focus on policy and not personal attacks, despite Trump dismissing his advice to stay away from such insults. This is a reiteration of previous comments, including one made earlier in August where he said, “Donald Trump, the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election” while saying the former president should avoid personal attacks. Trump succinctly dismissed the advice, saying, “I like Lindsey. I don’t care what he says” while insisting Graham, a senator in the middle of his fourth term, only won his last election because of Trump’s endorsement. Despite the dismissal of his advice, Graham said of his relationship with Trump, “Me and him are good. We’re going to be together. I’m going to Georgia with him. We’re going to try to have a unity event in Georgia to bring this whole party together. I will be by his side in this election.” Graham also criticized Democrats, calling the Democratic National Convention “a hate fest full of insults.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he will be “campaigning actively” for former President Donald Trump after Kennedy suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed the Republican nominee on Friday. The endorsement comes after Kennedy and Trump met multiple times to discuss the possibility in exchange for a role in a potential future Trump administration. Kennedy denied Trump had made any “commitments.” Kennedy again said he plans to withdraw his name from the ballot in “10 swing states” while remaining on the ballot in others where he wouldn’t be a “spoiler.” Kennedy said he and Trump had discussed which states he would withdraw from. Kennedy said his family’s continued opposition to his campaign and their condemnation of his endorsement of Trump has not affected him. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday he’s hopeful Vice President Kamala Harris will eventually show some daylight between her and President Joe Biden on whether the US should continue to supply weapons to Israel. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has been vocal about his opposition to the US continuing to provide weapons to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. When asked about the exchange in rocket fire overnight between Israel and Hezbollah amid ongoing ceasefire and hostage release negotiations, Sanders said he’s hopeful that a deal can be reached. “Clearly we have a very volatile situation in the Middle East. We have had that for a long time now. The good news is that it appears that both Hezbollah and Israel are trying to de-escalate. I hope that happens, and I hope we reach a ceasefire with Hamas – Israel and Hamas as soon as possible.” When pressed on other issues where Sanders and Harris may not see eye to eye, like immigration, the military or healthcare, the Vermont Senator defended the vice president and noted he believes she is a far better choice than the alternative – former president Donald Trump. “When you look at her positions versus Trump, the issue is clearly day and night. Her positions are far, far more superior,” Sanders said. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said former President Donald Trump would veto a federal abortion ban as president if such a bill were passed by Congress. In an interview that will air on Sunday at 9 a.m. ET, the Ohio senator told NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” that it is Trump’s view that the legalization of abortion should be left up to the individual states.  “We don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue,” Vance added.  Trump said in April he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected to the White House again, reversing a promise the former president made as a candidate in 2016 and stood by during his first term in office. Trump, who has changed his public stance on the topic numerous times, also expressed support for abortion being a state-by-state issue during the CNN Presidential Debate in late June, saying “the states control it. That’s the vote of the people.”   Vance himself has also shifted his tones on abortion. CNN previously reported that Vance argued in 2022 that people seeking abortions often travel from states where abortion is banned to states with liberal abortion laws, necessitating federal action.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said Sunday that it has raised $540 million since she launched her presidential bid just over a month ago. The total marks a record for any campaign in history for this time span, according to Harris’ team.  The campaign saw a surge of grassroots donations during last week’s Democratic National Convention, raking in $82 million, according to a memo by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon. The hour following Harris’ speech on the final night of the convention also marked the campaign’s best fundraising hour since launch day. Harris’ team said a third of last week’s donations were from first-time contributors, two-thirds of whom were women. Teaching and nursing continue to be among the most common occupations for donors, the campaign said. In addition to hauling in a hefty amount of donations, the campaign said it marked its biggest week of organizing, with nearly 200,000 volunteers signing up for shifts since Monday.   Harris’ camp called the DNC a “galvanizing moment” that energized and mobilized volunteers and grassroots supporters alike, but added the campaign isn’t slowing down as the race enters its final stretch to Election Day. Heading into Labor Day, the campaign plans to build on momentum by “taking no voters for granted and communicating relentlessly with battleground voters every single day between now and Election Day – all the while Trump is focused on very little beyond online tantrums and attacking the voters critical to winning 270 electoral votes.” Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will kick off a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday, marking their first time campaigning in the state together and underscoring the campaign’s focus on the key battleground. The vice president is also set to host a rally in Savannah on Thursday to “speak directly to Georgians about the stakes of this election.” While former President Donald Trump campaigns in two “blue wall” states this week, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will visit another key battleground. Trump will deliver remarks on the economy in Potterville, Michigan, Thursday afternoon, according to his campaign. The former president is also set to host a town hall that evening in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Trump “will meet with Wisconsinites to listen to their concerns and share his promising agenda: to make America affordable again,” the campaign said in a statement. Meanwhile, Harris and Walz will kick off a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday, concluding with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to their campaign. Few battlegrounds will be more closely watched than Georgia — where President Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago — for signs of how voters are responding to campaign outreach. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is bracing for more unfavorable polling news in the days to come. A memo from Trump pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Travis Tunis sent out by the Trump campaign Saturday predicts a convention bump in polls after the Democratic National Convention for Vice President Kamala Harris.  In July, Fabrizio wrote he expected a “honeymoon” period for Harris after she replaced President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket – a prediction that has certainly come to pass. Before ending his re-election campaign, Biden’s support in CNN Poll of Polls registered at 45%, behind Trump at 49%. Heading into the convention, the race had shifted, with Harris at 50% and Trump at 48%, the CNN Poll of Polls found.  Fabrizio now anticipates the honeymoon for Harris extending, blaming it largely on favorable media coverage of the vice president.  The memo went on to caution against reading too much into national polls that may show Harris pulling ahead. A new presidential candidate, a slew of celebrities and slick programming helped propel Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris to a ratings win at this week’s Democratic National Convention, surpassing the television viewership of last month’s Republican gathering. Viewership of the four-day festivities in Chicago drew an average of 21.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen data, eclipsing the audience of the Republican National Convention by nearly 15%. On the final evening this week, Harris’ acceptance address was watched by 28.9 million viewers, narrowly outdrawing former President Donald Trump’s speech in Milwaukee, which drew 28.4 million viewers across 15 television networks. Trump’s more than 90-minute address, the longest convention acceptance speech in recent history, came just days after he survived an assassination attempt. Harris’ viewership victory amounted to a blow for Trump, who is famously obsessed with television ratings and the size of his crowds. Excitement over her candidacy — as well as high-profile speeches by former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former first lady Michelle Obama — helped fuel viewership. So did appearances by a host of celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Pink, Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling. Viewership was also likely boosted by a non-appearance: Speculation ran wild online that music superstar Beyoncé would make a surprise performance on the final night. The singer had previously given the Harris campaign permission to use her 2016 hit “Freedom,” which played Thursday night as she took the stage. The DNC turned normally staid moments into slickly produced spectacles, including a raucous take on the ceremonial roll call that featured music from each state, as well as a surprise performance by rapper Lil Jon.

Kamala Harris is tapping into the Black Joy movement | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:30 AM EDT, Sun August 25, 2024",2024-08-25T10:00:02.517Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/25/politics/kamala-harris-black-joy-movement-cec/index.html,"It’s been called “Kamalamania,” “Kamalmentum,” and “Kamelot.” Others dismiss it as “irrational exuberance,” or a political sugar high led by a “ding dong.” In the five weeks since Kamala Harris upended the 2024 presidential race, the commentariat has used all kinds of phrases to describe Democrats’ euphoria about her sudden White House run. But there is another electoral force propelling Harris’ candidacy that has barely been noticed: “Black Joy.” Harris isn’t just “campaigning on joy,” as so many commentators have recently noted. She is also tapping into something called the “Black Joy”  movement. Led by Black artists, authors, activists and others, the movement declares that Black people’s humanity will not be defined by trauma or oppression but by something else: “A joy that no White man can steal.” That’s how the author Tracey Michae’l Lewis-Giggetts describes the movement’s essence in her book, “Black Joy.” Black Joy is hard to define but easy to see and feel. It’s the annual Black Joy Parade, festive Juneteenth celebrations and loud Black family reunions with plenty of, yes, fried chicken while Earth, Wind & Fire’s feel-good anthem “September” plays from a portable speaker nearby. It’s the recent viral image from the Paris Olympics when two Black American gymnasts — Simon Biles and Jordan Chiles — bowed in appreciation to a beaming Brazilian gold medal winner because, as Biles would say later, “it was an all-Black podium.” It’s the Black Joy on display at this week’s Democratic National Convention. It’s rapper Lil Jon grabbing a microphone and acting as the Georgia’s delegation’s “hype man” during an electric, state-by-state roll call. It’s Black delegates shedding tears while listening to former President Barack Obama. It’s former first lady Michelle Obama sending the crowd into a frenzy when, referring to Trump, she said, “Who is going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?” This summer marks the first time in years that so many Black Americans feel hopeful. “I haven’t felt this way since 2008 when a skinny kid with a funny name decided to run for president,” says Kimberly Coleman, an actor who lives in the swing state of Arizona, in a reference to Barack Obama. Coleman says she’s hopped on recent Zoom calls with Black women and Black preachers to raise money and drum up support for Harris’ campaign against former President Donald Trump. “The enthusiasm that everyone has, and the joy, is contagious,” she says. Nothing will temper joy like the quickly changing fortunes of a presidential campaign, however. Consider that only recently, Trump’s momentum seemed unstoppable after he survived an assassination attempt and surged ahead of President Joe Biden in many polls. Still, Harris is doing more than surfing the Black joy wave. She’s turned some of its core beliefs into a political strategy in at least two ways: Can an election turn on how one presidential candidate laughs and the other one doesn’t? That’s one of the quirks that commentators have noticed about this election: Harris laughs a lot, while Trump laughs not so much, if at all. One CNN analyst noted that Harris will “laugh at herself in the midst of a speech, or in the midst of a press conference or during a ‘60 Minutes’ interview — otherwise serious moments when another politician might try to keep a straight face throughout.” But there is a racial history behind Harris’ laughter that’s easy to miss. Black laughter was used as a weapon against Black people long before Trump wielded it against Harris by dismissing her as “Laffin’ Kamala.” Slaveowners created the myth of the “happy-go-lucky darkie” to imply that Black people were happy being enslaved or being second-class citizens. To survive, many Black people played along by flashing a submissive, “just-happy-to-be-here, boss” laughter around White people. Yet other Black people chose to laugh when and how they wanted — even if White folks didn’t like it. Consider this quote by a Black man born into slavery as described in the book, “Black Joy.” “Others have said I laugh loudly and often. This too is true,” the man says. “I’ve found that my joy is the most irritating to those who are righteously indignant at my audacity to walk around like I’m free.” This is the kind of laughter that Harris evokes. Her laugh signals to Black supporters and White allies that she is free to do what she wants. It’s loud, raucous, and maybe a little strange, but it doesn’t appear to be curated for White sensibilities. “I have my mother’s laugh,” Harris said in one recent interview. And I grew up around a bunch of women in particular, who laughed from the belly. … They would sit around the kitchen and drinking their coffee, telling big stories with big laughs.” It’s the kind of laughter that women of all colors find liberating, wrote Robin Givhan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer with the Washington Post, in a recent essay. Givhan said Harris’ laughter enrages critics who attack her as a diversity hire. “There was a time when Black folks had to curtail their emotions in public. When women were considered ill-mannered if they chortled freely,” Givhan wrote. “Harris has the audacity to look unruffled by the characterization … Her laughter is edifying precisely because it leaves some folks enraged. Who does she think she is?” Harris’ Black Joy seems unruffled by something else: A White man’s attempt to define her racial identity. Harris claims both Black and South Asian heritage as the US-born daughter of a woman who emigrated to the US from India and a father who came from Jamaica. When Trump questioned Harris’ Black bona fides at a recent conference of Black journalists, it was widely seen as a clumsy attempt to cast her as a racial opportunist. “Now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said. By doing so, Trump evoked a ugly tradition in this country. White men have long decided who was Black or White in America. Under the notorious one-drop rule, for example, White people defined a person as Black even if they had a White parent. Any drop of Blackness was considered a taint to the perceived purity of Whiteness. Trump launched a similar attack against Obama by questioning the place of his birth. Questions about Obama’s heritage proved so insistent that he felt compelled to release his birth certificate. But Harris barely acknowledged Trump’s questioning of her racial identity. She called it “the same old show — the divisiveness and the disrespect…” at a rally and pressed on with her campaign. This, too, is a manifestation of Black joy — not letting White people’s perception of your Blackness rattle or define you. “It’s not what they call you, but what you answer to,” is how Lewis-Giggetts describes this attitude in her book, “Black Joy.” Harris’ reaction underscores a subtle difference between how she and Obama have regarded their biracial identity. Obama was open about wrestling with his identity as the son of a Black father and a White mother, and his search for a place to belong. But Harris does not seem to have grappled with a similar angst. She attended Howard University, a historically Black school, where she pledged a Black sorority. She doesn’t appear to invest a lot of energy into explaining her identity to others. Her public persona carries no hint of the “Tragic Mulatto” — a biracial, typically female stereotype who can’t find acceptance in Black or White worlds. When questioned about her Blackness during a 2019 interview, Harris said she was not going to spend a lot of energy “trying to educate people about who Black people are. “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. I was born Black. I will die Black,” she said. “I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.” What those who question Harris’ Blackness may miss is that many of the Black community’s most revered leaders and artists have had White parents. Reggae icon Bob Marley, civil rights activist Booker T. Washington, statesman Frederick Douglass, playwright August Wilson, author Malcom Gladwell — all are biracial. Harris’ racial identity makes her a quintessential American, according to Albert Murray, the Black author and cultural critic who has argued that American culture is “incontestably mulatto.” “No white American is fully and only white; no black American is fully and wholly black,” Murray wrote. “We have lived in another one another’s company too long and too intimately, shaped by the same forces of nature and culture alike.” One of the big questions of this election is how far Black Joy can carry Harris. Will it dissipate as soon as the inevitable setbacks occur? And are some afraid to embrace Black joy because they don’t want to be disappointed again? “I’m concerned but not scared,” Coleman, the actor, says about the prospect of a Harris letdown. Recent polling may alleviate some of Coleman’s concerns. While polls in the spring showed Trump making inroads among Black voters, a CNN/SSRS poll published last month — after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee — found her leading Trump among registered Black voters, 78% to 15%. That’s an improvement over CNN polling data from April and June, when the same voters favored Biden over Trump by 70% to 23%. Coleman says she’s not concerned that Black voters will abandon Harris because they’ve experienced the alternative: four years of relentless racial tension under Trump. The fear of another Trump presidential term is feeding into Black support of Harris, she says. Obama showed in 2008 and 2012 that enthusiasm among the Black electorate translates into actual votes. Harris may be poised to do the same. “There’s even more enthusiasm than there was for Obama,” Coleman says of Harris’ White House run. “We weren’t threatened by John McCain (Obama’s 2008 presidential opponent). He was just another Republican. We hadn’t seen anything that McCain had done so bad that it would be like, ‘Lord Jesus, let me go get my passport.’ But seriously now people are saying, ‘If Trump wins, we gotta go (out of the country).’ ” If Harris wins it will mark a dramatic change — not only for Democrats’ fortunes, but for the mood in Black America. The Black community has disproportionately suffered from the Covid-19 pandemic, a GOP-led backlash to the 2020 “racial reckoning” after George Floyd’s murder, and the never-ending videos of unarmed Black men and women being shot down or beaten to death by police officers. Harris offers something different. It’s not just joy; it’s Black Joy. And in an election that might be determined by Black voters in swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, Black Joy may turn out to be her most potent political asset.

"August 24, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-24T12:37:50.007Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-08-24-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is bracing for more unfavorable polling news in the days to come. A memo from Trump pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Travis Tunis sent out by the Trump campaign Saturday predicts a convention bump in polls after the Democratic National Convention for Vice President Kamala Harris.  In July, Fabrizio wrote he expected a “honeymoon” period for Harris after she replaced President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket – a prediction that has certainly come to pass. Before ending his re-election campaign, Biden’s support in CNN Poll of Polls registered at 45%, behind Trump at 49%. Heading into the convention, the race had shifted, with Harris at 50% and Trump at 48%, the CNN Poll of Polls found.  Fabrizio now anticipates the honeymoon for Harris extending, blaming it largely on favorable media coverage of the vice president.  The memo went on to caution against reading too much into national polls that may show Harris pulling ahead. A new presidential candidate, a slew of celebrities and slick programming helped propel Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris to a ratings win at this week’s Democratic National Convention, surpassing the television viewership of last month’s Republican gathering. Viewership of the four-day festivities in Chicago drew an average of 21.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen data, eclipsing the audience of the Republican National Convention by nearly 15%. On the final evening this week, Harris’ acceptance address was watched by 28.9 million viewers, narrowly outdrawing former President Donald Trump’s speech in Milwaukee, which drew 28.4 million viewers across 15 television networks. Trump’s more than 90-minute address, the longest convention acceptance speech in recent history, came just days after he survived an assassination attempt. Harris’ viewership victory amounted to a blow for Trump, who is famously obsessed with television ratings and the size of his crowds. Excitement over her candidacy — as well as high-profile speeches by former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former first lady Michelle Obama — helped fuel viewership. So did appearances by a host of celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Pink, Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling. Viewership was also likely boosted by a non-appearance: Speculation ran wild online that music superstar Beyoncé would make a surprise performance on the final night. The singer had previously given the Harris campaign permission to use her 2016 hit “Freedom,” which played Thursday night as she took the stage. The DNC turned normally staid moments into slickly produced spectacles, including a raucous take on the ceremonial roll call that featured music from each state, as well as a surprise performance by rapper Lil Jon. Read more here about the Democrats’ convention ratings win. Former President Donald Trump will deliver remarks on the economy in Potterville, Michigan, Thursday afternoon, according to his campaign. The former president is also set to host a town hall that evening in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Trump “will meet with Wisconsinites to listen to their concerns and share his promising agenda: to make America affordable again,” the campaign said in a statement. Reaching out to swing voters: While Trump campaigns in two of the “blue wall” states viewed as critical to Democrats, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be in another battleground state. The running mates are kicking off a bus tour in Georgia on Wednesday and will conclude with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to the campaign. Few battlegrounds will be more closely watched than Georgia — where President Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago — for signs of how voters are responding to campaign outreach. An Iranian hacker group targeted the WhatsApp accounts of individuals associated with the administrations of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, Meta announced Friday. Meta said their investigation linked the efforts to a group called “APT42,” known for using phishing tactics to steal credentials to people’s online accounts. Meta’s security team blocked a cluster of accounts posing as support agents for various tech companies. CNN has reached out to both the White House and Trump campaign for comment. This is just the latest case: The Meta incident adds to the growing number of reported attempts by Iranian-backed hackers to influence the 2024 US presidential election.   Just last week, Google said an alleged Iranian hacking operation aimed at US presidential campaigns is ongoing and wide-ranging. On Monday, US intelligence agencies officially linked Iran to an instance of a hack-and-leak operation targeting Trump’s campaign. The FBI pointed to a statement from Monday when asked about the purported latest hacking attempts by Iran. Read more on the reported hack here. When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way. Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but says he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie. In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump. Here’s what you should know: What’s a contingent election? If there’s a 269-269 tie in the contest for 538 Electoral College votes, or if a third-party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps both candidates from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is called a “contingent election.” According to the 12th Amendment, the new House of Representatives, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president. Could Kennedy actually feature in such an election? Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking. Could a tie actually happen this year? Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election: If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269. The website 270 to Win also has more tied-election scenarios. How would the process work? The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state’s voters preferred. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes — either a state, or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine — in order to be an option in a contingent election. There’s no chance of that happening at the moment. Read more about a contingent election here. Halfway through the final night of the Democratic National Convention, actress and celebrity host Kerry Washington noted there are some who still struggle — “or pretend to struggle” — with how to say Vice President Kamala Harris’ first name. “Confusion is understandable,” Washington said. “Disrespect is not.” In keeping with the convention themes of joy and an introduction to the Democratic nominee, Washington was joined onstage by Harris’ great-nieces Amara and Leela Ajagu, who led the crowd in a chant: “Comma,” like the punctuation mark, then “La,” like a sing-song la-la-la. It was a lighthearted approach to a darker theme running through this election: the ways race and gender have colored attacks leveled at Harris since she launched her presidential campaign. Former President Donald Trump has mocked Harris’ name and laugh in an echo of his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton, and has even made false claims about Harris’ racial identity. For many women of color, particularly those who have run for office and been in the political spotlight, it’s a familiar challenge. “When I have a job to do, you can call me every name in the book — that does not define me,” said Val Demings, a former Florida US congresswoman and 2022 Democratic nominee for Senate. “I am defined by the quality of work that I do for the people that I represent.” The end of the Democratic convention marks a new phase of the campaign, a 74-day sprint to Election Day and increased pressure on Harris to lay out her policies, including at next month’s debate. In interviews and convention speeches, Black women leaders said the Harris campaign should continue to avoid engaging directly with personal attacks. Read more here about the personal attacks on Harris. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Friday that he will be suspending — but not “terminating” — his presidential campaign and threw his support behind former President Donald Trump. Kennedy announced that he will withdraw his name from the ballot in “about 10 battleground states, where my presence would be a spoiler.”   But he added that he will remain on the ballot in several solidly red or blue states, where voters can vote for him without “harming or helping” Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, because the winner’s margins of victory are expected to be so significant. And in those states, he urged voters to vote for him, making the case that he “could conceivably still end up in the White House” if Trump and Harris each fail to secure 270 electoral votes.   Kennedy continued on to say that the causes that led him to “leave the Democratic Party and run as an independent” also “persuaded” to “throw my support to President Trump.” Trump thanked Kennedy for his “very nice endorsement.” CNN’s Aaron Pellish and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will kick off a bus tour in battleground Georgia next week, marking their first time campaigning in the state together and underscoring the Democrats’ focus on the Peach State. Few battlegrounds will be more closely watched than Georgia — where President Joe Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago — for signs of how voters are responding to campaign outreach, making the state a fitting kickoff for Harris and Walz on the heels of the Democratic National Convention. The swing through south Georgia will kick off Wednesday and conclude with a rally in the Savannah area on Thursday, according to the Harris-Walz campaign. Walz will not attend the rally. The campaign has already built a robust infrastructure in the state, with more than 170 staffers in 24 offices. The campaign on Friday also released a new TV ad in Georgia, among other swing states, focusing on Harris’ economic vision. Former President Donald Trump addressed supporters at a rally in Glendale, Arizona, Friday, where he was joined by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his own presidential campaign just hours earlier.   Trump criticized Harris’ convention speech: The former president slammed Vice President Kamala Harris for her repeated mentions and attacks on him, and claimed her speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night lacked any mention of policy issues, such as immigration and inflation. However, Harris did mention the border and criticized Trump’s role in tanking a bipartisan border bill earlier this year.  He previewed a new presidential commission: Trump said, if elected, he would create an independent commission to investigate assassination attempts that would release “all the remaining documents” related to former President John F. Kennedy’s assassination and would “conduct a rigorous review” of the assassination attempt against him last month.   RFK Jr. could be appointed to a health panel: When suspending his presidential campaign, Kennedy suggested that he could join a potential second Trump administration in a role that would oversee a health care portfolio.  Trump revealed Friday that if elected, he will ask Kennedy to work on a panel that would investigate “the decades-long increase in chronic health problems, including autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility, and many more.”  Kennedy praised Trump for sharing his views on “ending the chronic disease epidemic” and asked the crowd, “Don’t you want a president that’s going to make America healthy again?”  Kennedy has a long history of making false claims about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Several attendees were treated for heat-related illnesses: More than 100 people were treated for heat-related illnesses while waiting for the former president to take the stage as temperatures in Glendale, reached 106 degrees. CNN’s Aaron Pellish, Kate Sullivan, Kristen Holmes. Alejandra Jaramillo and Michelle Watson contributed to this post.  Democrats gave a king’s farewell to President Joe Biden as they rallied around their presidential nominee Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention this week.   The four-day convention featured remarks from Biden, former presidents, high-profile celebrities, and speeches from the vice president and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepting their nomination.  Here are some highlights from the DNC: Biden took a bow: He delivered a spirited message of support for Harris and Walz, and touted his legislative achievements, while also criticizing Trump.   Michelle Obama returned with another memorable message: Former first lady Michelle Obama, who received one of the loudest and longest applauses this week, made a personal appeal Tuesday for everyone to “do something” between now and Election Day. And she followed up on her iconic “When they go low, we go high” line from the 2016 convention with another powerful message: “Hope is making a comeback.”   Walz shared personal struggle as his family proudly watched: While discussing the fertility struggles he and his wife, Gwen Walz, faced as he accepted the nomination on the third night of the convention, Walz gave a shout out to his family.   Harris got personal: Harris has long struggled to open up about her personal story, but as she accepted the party’s presidential nomination, she shared how her father encouraged her to run free on the playground when her mother cautioned her to be careful and talked about the tight-knit community that helped raise her.   And to help share her story, the vice president had the Harris clan: her sister Maya Harris, stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, niece Meena Harris, goddaughter Helena Hudlin. In one of the most memorable moments, Harris’ grandnieces — Amara and Leela Ajagu — taught the crowd how to pronounce their grand-aunt’s first name: “Comma,” like the punctuation mark, then “La,” like the sing-song “la, la, la.”  For the better part of the past year, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. built and maintained a small but significant base of support for his quixotic White House bid, the two major parties wrestled with an increasingly pressing question: Whose presidential aspirations might be most damaged by an independent aligned with the conspiratorial right but bearing a famous Democratic name? Now, with Kennedy having suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump, both parties will be closely watching who his followers gravitate toward in the closing months before Election Day. Though his odds of victory were quickly diminishing – a recent CBS News poll measured his support at just 2% – Kennedy’s decision to bow out 74 days before the election nevertheless presents another twist to an unpredictable race. The former president’s operation hopes Kennedy’s endorsement could prove decisive if certain battlegrounds are decided by thousands of ballots, just as they were in 2020. It’s hardly certain what Kennedy’s backers will do. Whether many of them ever intended to vote for him or at all is difficult to gauge, and some may choose to sit the election out without an alternative on the ballot. Still, the Trump campaign has long worried that Kennedy’s campaign, built on conspiracies and anti-vaccine rhetoric, pulled directly from their side, especially in a handful of key states. Trump’s advisers now see an opening to court some of Kennedy’s voters. There is a presumption among Trump’s team and his allies that conservative-leaning mothers — a demographic the Republican nominee has struggled to win over — could also be swayed. While Democrats have aggressively attacked Kennedy, the Harris team extended an olive branch to the independent’s backers on Friday, saying “there’s a home for them” in her campaign if they are “looking for somebody who’s actually going to fight for their interests.” Read more here about RFK Jr.’s impact on the race."
A reenergized Democratic campaign draws convention ratings win over Republicans | CNN Business,"Updated 2:27 PM EDT, Sat August 24, 2024",2024-08-24T09:00:02.551Z,https://www.cnn.com/kamala-harris-dnc-ratings-trump-beyonce/index.html,"A new presidential candidate, a slew of celebrities and slick programming helped propel Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris to a ratings win at this week’s Democratic National Convention, surpassing the television viewership of last month’s Republican gathering. Viewership of the four-day festivities in Chicago drew an average of 21.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen data, eclipsing the audience of the Republican National Convention by nearly 15 percent. On the final evening this week, Harris’ acceptance address was watched by 28.9 million viewers, narrowly outdrawing former President Donald Trump’s speech in Milwaukee, which drew 28.4 million viewers across 15 television networks. Trump’s more than 90-minute address, the longest convention acceptance speech in recent history, came just days after the assassination attempt on his life. Harris’ viewership victory amounted to a blow for Trump, who is famously obsessed with television ratings and the size of his crowds. On Thursday night, as Harris delivered her address, Trump watched along, posting live reactions to his Truth Social account, then called into Fox News afterward to offer a meandering rebuttal. The final night of the convention was also a win for MSNBC, which attracted 6.5 million viewers, the highest DNC showing in the network’s nearly 30-year network history. The boost in viewership was also seen at ABC with 4.2 million viewers, and CNN with 3.9 million. And while Fox News typically outdraws cable news networks in the ratings race, including at last month’s RNC, the right-wing network fell to fifth place on Thursday night. While many more also tuned in to the conventions on digital platforms, viewership figures for streaming services such as YouTube or Twitch, and public access channels like C-SPAN, are not counted by Nielsen. Excitement over Harris’ candidacy, as well as soaring speeches by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former First Lady Michelle Obama, as well as appearances by a host of celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Pink, Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling helped fuel viewership. The DNC also turned normally staid moments into slickly produced spectacles, including a raucous take on the ceremonial roll call that featured music from each state, as well as a surprise performance by rapper Lil Jon. Last month’s Republican convention in Milwaukee took place just days after the assassination attempt on Trump. While it did not feature speeches from former presidents, celebrities such as Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock made high-profile appearances. At the time of the RNC, President Joe Biden was still the Democratic nominee and the party was in crisis mode following Biden’s disastrous performance at CNN’s June debate. As pressure mounted, Biden ended his campaign the weekend after the Republican convention. Viewership of the Democratic convention was also likely boosted by rampant speculation that music superstar Beyoncé would make a surprise performance on the final night. The singer had previously given the Harris campaign permission to use her 2016 hit “Freedom,” which played Thursday night as Harris took the stage. In the run up to Harris’ address, social media buzzed with rumors about a possible Beyoncé’s appearance. That speculation made its way to major media figures on social media and television, some of whom also suggested that Beyoncé could make a surprise appearance. Then, shortly before 8 p.m. ET, celebrity news site TMZ reported that Beyonce’s appearance was a certainty. But two hours later, at 10:01 p.m. ET, Beyoncé’s publicist told The Hollywood Reporter that Queen Bey would not be in attendance. She then confirmed that to CNN, saying, “She was never scheduled to be in Chicago.” A person familiar with the matter told CNN that campaign and convention officials had never confirmed Beyoncé would appear. TMZ, the person said, had not reached out to the campaign or convention for comment before publishing its report. TMZ did not respond to CNN requests for comment regarding its story. But before Beyoncé’s representative went on the record to deny that she was ever scheduled to attend, multiple people close to convention planners told CNN that they believed the star would in fact attend. The Beyoncé buzz, along with speculation over Taylor Swift, had been swirling for weeks prior to the convention, and was never formally shut down by Harris’ campaign or Beyonce’s camp until the last minute."
"With the conventions over, Harris and Trump begin the final sprint to Election Day | CNN Politics","Published 2:00 AM EDT, Sat August 24, 2024",2024-08-24T06:00:02.524Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/politics/harris-trump-2024-race/index.html,"An unsettled and unpredictable 2024 presidential race is entering its final stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris looking to build on the momentum of this week’s Democratic National Convention and former President Donald Trump honing his lines of attack. The former president’s early-summer polling and fundraising advantages were wiped out in an unprecedented five weeks that saw Trump survive an assassination attempt, President Joe Biden drop his reelection bid and Harris ascend to the top of the Democratic ticket and inject new enthusiasm into the party. Now Democrats are on offense, eyeing an expanded battleground map that could include new paths through the Sun Belt to 270 electoral college votes. Trump reclaimed the spotlight on Friday as he campaigned in Arizona alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The independent candidate had suspended his presidential campaign hours earlier and said he was pulling his name from the ballot in key swing states to avoid being a spoiler. “Don’t you want a president who’s going to get us out of the wars and who’s going to rebuild the middle class in this country?” Kennedy said of Trump in Glendale. Kennedy’s departure from the fringes completes the reset of the 2024 race as a two-person contest between Trump and Harris, eliminating one wild card. With the conventions over, the next race-defining moment on the calendar is their September 10 debate hosted by ABC. The campaigns have also both discussed participating in a second debate, but the details of where, when and who would host have not yet been settled. Unlike the June debate between Trump and Biden, when their 2020 showdowns offered a preview of what to expect, no one is sure how this fall’s debates will unfold. “I can’t picture it in my mind’s eye, if I’m being completely honest,” Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said Friday. “I think this match-up is so odd that it’s not obvious to me who’s got an advantage.” Harris and her allies used the four-day Democratic convention in Chicago to frame the election as Americans’ opportunity to move past the toxicity of Trump’s decade as a dominant political figure once and for all. “With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past,” she said in her Thursday night speech. Trump’s campaign, though, argues that Harris can’t credibly claim to offer a fresh start when she’s been vice president for more than three years. “Her argument and the argument of her surrogates, is, ‘We’re going to do things better when I get power.’ She’s had power for three-and-a-half years, and she’s made everything worse,” Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said Thursday while campaigning in Georgia. The former president has struggled to adapt to the change atop the Democratic ticket — but is testing new lines to brand Harris as too liberal. In recent days he has called her “Comrade Kamala.” At a rally in Nevada on Friday, Trump again mispronounced Harris’ first name and described her as a flip-flopper. At the center of Trump’s attacks was Harris’ failed bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Still a senator at the time, Harris dropped out of the race in 2019, before any votes had been cast. Harris took a number of liberal positions in that primary race, which was at times dominated by esoteric fights about progressive policies, that she has since abandoned. Trump claimed that “nobody ever heard of her before she lost” then. The former president also fumed about Biden winning this year’s Democratic primary but ending his campaign in July. “He got 14 million votes, and he’s sitting on a beach angry as hell, and she got no votes, and she’s running. So you explain that to me,” Trump said of Biden. And, at an event at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, Trump complained that Harris had “copied” his proposal to end taxes on tips. Harris called for ending taxes on tips while rolling out a series of populist economic proposals last week, echoing a policy Trump already supported. He accused Harris of “pretending” to endorse his policy, calling her a “copycat” and the “greatest flip-flopper in history” who “went from communism to capitalism in about two weeks.” Trump’s campaign on Friday also launched new ads that promote his proposals to end taxes on Social Security benefits and tipped wages for service industry workers. Later Friday, in Arizona, Trump mocked Harris for saying “thank you” repeatedly as Democrats gave her a standing ovation when she took the DNC stage Thursday night in Chicago. He also criticized Harris for attacking him on immigration. The vice president pointed to Trump’s opposition to a bipartisan border security and immigration bill, which turned Republicans against the measure. “I haven’t been there in four years,” Trump said. “You saw it, I had the safest border, the best border we’ve ever had. She blamed me for the border. They lied so much.” Harris views the march to November as a series of building blocks, advisers say, with a wave of momentum from the Chicago convention poised to carry her toward the September 10 debate. The vice president has made clear in conversations with her campaign team and in meetings with donors and supporters that she is under no illusion that the remainder of the campaign will be as smooth or soaring as her ascent to the top of the ticket. “Let’s know we’re underdogs and this is going to be rough and tough,” Harris told a small group of celebrating boosters she visited after her convention speech. “After tonight and a bit of partying, let’s get back to work and let’s see this through.” The roadmap for the general election is coming into sharper view, with battlegrounds that Democrats all but written off during the Biden campaign now suddenly competitive. North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia offer a pathway — and a potential insurance policy — beyond the blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Harris is set to visit Georgia next week, aides said, along with a limited number of campaign stops as she urgently turns her focus to debate preparations for the next two weeks. She spends at least part of every day familiarizing herself with Trump’s record — and statements — as she approaches September 10 with the diligence of a trial lawyer she once was. Additionally, practice sessions are already underway for next month’s debate, the first time she will be in the same room as Trump aside from his State of the Union addresses, when she was a California senator. Her team made a conscious decision not to wait until the week before to begin preparing, aware a mistake on the debate stage could shift the energy in the race in an instant. Trump has also begun preparing for the debate. He enlisted one of Harris’ former 2020 Democratic primary rivals, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The two had several notable exchanges during Democratic primary debates, where Harris criticized Gabbard for her foreign policy views while Gabbard challenged Harris’ record on criminal justice. Friends who have known Harris for years say they see a new sense of confidence in her. But the excitement and energy surrounding the ticket doesn’t change the fact that the race with Trump is almost certainly heading toward a bruising chapter unlike many others in American history. Harris is seeking to present herself as a change candidate, despite her incumbency as vice president and her record in the Biden administration. If the election can be seen as a choice between Harris and Trump, not a referendum on her, advisers believe she could be well positioned to try and win over independent voters and even some moderate Republicans, whom she referenced in her speech Thursday night. Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, told CNN that complacency among Democratic voters is among the things that keeps her up at night. The long shadow of the 2016 campaign, which sent Trump to the Oval Office, continues to haunt many Democrats. “This,” she said, “is going to be an extremely close race.” Harris advisers acknowledge they are writing the playbook for an extraordinarily truncated race in real-time, and say the decisions they will face over the coming months are likely to be made without ample precedent to rely upon. Her campaign has purchased nearly $400 million in advertising space through the fall, snapping up premium slots on sports and season premieres in a bid both to introduce their candidate and to deprive Trump of marquee opportunities for visibility. And, although Chicago’s convention was bursting with celebrities, there are other endorsers the Harris team is hoping will emerge in splashy fashion closer to the election as voters begin casting ballots. The Harris team has also begun thinking out how to deploy top surrogates, like the Obamas and Biden, in the months ahead of Election Day. Multiple Harris advisers also voiced trepidation this week at the prospect of an “October surprise” — an event in the world that could alter the race’s trajectory. As the sitting vice president, Harris’s response to an economic calamity or foreign crisis would be closely scrutinized. For Harris, the coming weeks will come with increasing pressure to lay out in more detail her plans to address the biggest problems facing the country, including immigration, climate change, gun violence and crime. She will undoubtedly be asked to articulate a foreign policy doctrine and for more specifics on how she might handle a range of foreign flash points. Her team, for now, does not appear in any rush to churn out policy white papers or schedule a slate of policy appearances. Deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Friday on MSNBC she would sit for one-on-one interviews “on her time and when she’s ready.” Instead, they seem intent on riding the enormous surge in momentum and energy for as long as it lasts. They are helped by Trump’s inability so far to settle on an effective line of attack, though her aides believe he will eventually land on something that sticks. On Friday, as confetti and deflated balloons were being swept from the United Center floor, Harris returned to Washington without any campaign events publicly announced. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also returned to his home state without anything made public about his plans moving forward. Yet it seemed certain their schedules wouldn’t remain empty for long. As they caught their breath following the convention, Democratic advance teams were put on alert to be ready for an intensive stretch of campaigning in the coming weeks. Harris has erased Trump’s polling lead in part by galvanizing young people who were disinterested in a Trump-versus-Biden matchup. At the Democratic convention, the party sought to use social media influencers and content creators as a conduit — granting them credentials in hopes of expanding the reach of a four-night event increasingly watched through phone screens, rather than televisions. “For any party that’s interested in trying to convince younger individuals and trying to get their attention, trying to inform them about the candidates, trying to inform them about the policies, and trying to motivate them to go out and vote, they have to meet them where they are,” said Pinar Yildirim, a marketing and economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Deja Foxx, a content creator and former Kamala Harris 2020 campaign staffer, who attended the DNC, told CNN that campaigning looks different every election cycle. “The days of Facebook and text and even photo-based platforms are behind us,” she said. “Young people are taking up a place at the table, young people who are uniquely situated because of our ability to use these platforms, emerging platforms, because of the ways that they feel natural and organic to us.” Harris’ campaign saw more than 10 times the number of Gen Z donors in July compared to June, before Biden dropped out of the race, and more than eight times the number of Millennial donors, according to a Harris campaign spokesperson. The spokesperson also said there have been more than 1,000 sign-ups for Students for Harris chapters across the country since the launch of Harris’ campaign. The former president is attempting to tamp down intra-party grudges that he has nursed for years — including one with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a popular Republican in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states. Kemp won reelection in 2022 after trouncing a Trump-backed primary challenger. The Georgia Republican has been a conservative governor, but refused to support Trump’s efforts to question the legitimacy of the 2020 election. “Thank you to #BrianKempGA for all of your help and support in Georgia, where a win is so important to the success of our Party and, most importantly, our Country,” Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. “I look forward to working with you, your team, and all of my friends in Georgia to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Vance, Trump’s running mate, said Thursday in Georgia he spoke “very briefly” with Kemp and guaranteed the governor is behind the GOP ticket, despite his history with Trump. “I read the headlines. Brian Kemp and Donald Trump have had some disagreements. I can 100% guarantee you that Brian Kemp is behind this ticket. He wants us to win, because he believes the policies of Kamala Harris are disastrous for this country,” Vance said. Kemp, in an interview with conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night, lambasted Harris on policy issues — signaling at least a tamping down of hostilities with the former president. “We’re going to put Georgia back in the red column for the presidential race, unlike we did in 2020,” Kemp said. Trump and Vance had one joint event in Asheboro during the Democratic convention — a Wednesday outdoor rally where Trump spoke from behind bulletproof glass. But their strategy appears to be to divide and conquer as they held several events in different cities and states. Vance continues to accuse Harris of hiding from the media, as she has yet to sit down for an interview with a major network. “Kamala Harris is going around asking people to be their president of the United States, but she won’t answer a single tough question, and she won’t interact with the American people unless there’s a teleprompter standing between them and her,” Vance said on Tuesday in Wisconsin. At events, Vance regularly takes reporters’ questions in front of attendees and does brief one-on-one interviews. He also speaks with traveling press on his campaign plane or under the wing before or after he boards. He is set to debate Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, on October 1. Vance said he is preparing by focusing on policy and answering the “American people’s questions on how we’re going to make their lives better, how we’re going to make their communities safer, how we’re going to bring back prosperity and low prices to the American economy.” He also quipped, “I found a good friend from back home who embellishes and lies a lot and have him stand in for Tim Walz.”"
A photo captures what Harris’ nomination could mean for young girls | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:00 PM EDT, Fri August 23, 2024",2024-08-23T21:36:53.890Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/kamala-harris-nomination-grand-niece-photo/index.html,"For Vice President Kamala Harris, her Thursday night speech accepting the Democratic nomination marked one of the most high-profile moments of a rapid rise to become the first Black and Asian American woman to lead a major party’s presidential ticket. One image, however, has captured what the moment could mean for young girls. Shot by New York Times staff photographer Todd Heisler, the photo features Amara Ajagu, one of the vice president’s young grandnieces, staring on as Harris delivered her address to the convention. More so than most little girls, Ajagu can say that Harris could be the first president who looks like her. Harris’ potential to be the first has been an undercurrent of her presidential runs since her first campaign in 2020. Though she opted for a dark suit Thursday, instead of the suffragette white worn by an overwhelming number of Democratic women in the Chicago convention center, the historic nature of the moment was top of mind for many throughout the week. Several speakers talked about those who ran before her, from former New York Rep. Shirley Chisholm — who in 1972 became the first Black woman to run for a major party nomination — to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The photo is also a reminder of the role Harris’ family played in the convention. Prior to the vice president’s speech, Amara and her younger sister, Leela, led the crowd in a lesson on how to pronounce their great-aunt’s first name: “Comma,” like the punctuation mark, then “La,” like the sing-song “la, la, la.” Heisler told CNN’s Abby Phillip Friday that he was positioned in a buffer area directly behind Harris’ family in front of the stage, and that he was working hard to get a photograph that would give people “something a little different that you don’t see on TV.” “I turned around and moved over a couple of feet to reposition and when I looked up, this is the angle that I saw, and I made that photograph. It just kind of presented itself to me,” he said on “NewsNight.” Asked what he thought of how the photo has resonated with people, Heisler said, “To be able to reach that many people with an image is just really powerful. It speaks to the power of photojournalism, you know, especially in a time of AI and people questioning reality … To have seasoned photographers in the room who understand the context and the historical significance of what’s happening, you know, in front of them, I think is really important.” This story has been updated with comments from Heisler."
"Cheryl Hines comments on husband RFK Jr.’s decision to drop out of race, does not mention his Trump endorsement | CNN","Updated 5:45 PM EDT, Fri August 23, 2024",2024-08-23T21:41:05.525Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/entertainment/cheryl-hines-rfk-jr-trump-endorsement/index.html,"“Curb Your Enthusiasm” star Cheryl Hines said her husband Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign has been an “eye-opening, transformative and endearing journey” in a statement shared on social media on Friday after Kennedy announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump. Hines did not mention her husband’s endorsement of the Republican presidential nominee in her statement. “I’d like to extend a sincere, deeply heartfelt thank you to every person who has worked so tirelessly and lovingly on his campaign. They have accomplished feats that were said to be impossible. They have gathered over a million signatures, more than any candidate in history, and have achieved ballot access across the country despite the roadblocks and lawsuits that have been brought against them for the sole purpose of keeping Bobby off of the ballots so no one would even have the opportunity to vote for him,” Hines posted on X. “I deeply respect the decision Bobby made to run on the principle of unity,” her statement continued. “Over the last year and a half, I have met some extraordinary people from all parties — Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. It’s been my experience that the vast majority of all parties are truly good people who want the best for our country and for each other. It has been an eye-opening, transformative, and endearing journey.” Independent presidential candidate Kennedy announced at a news conference in Phoenix on Friday that he was suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump. “In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path of electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control. So I cannot, in good conscience, ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours, or ask my donors to keep giving when I cannot honestly tell them that I have a real path to the White House,” he said. Kennedy then said he will now “throw my support to President Trump.” In January 2024, Hines and Kennedy joked about the impact of politics on their marriage. On the red carpet for the final season of “Curb,” the couple spoke to Variety when Kennedy was asked hypothetically if he wanted to be Trump’s running mate. “I don’t think that my marriage would survive it,” he responded, prompting Hines to quip, “I think he’s right.” Hines’ representative had no further comment when reached by CNN on Friday. CNN’s Aaron Pellish and Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this story."
"Ahead of final campaign sprint, Black women leaders urge Harris to stay focused in the face of personal attacks | CNN Politics","Published 1:04 PM EDT, Fri August 23, 2024",2024-08-23T17:04:43.898Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/black-women-harris-trump-attacks/index.html,"Halfway through the final night of the Democratic National Convention, actress and celebrity host Kerry Washington noted there are some who struggle – “or pretend to struggle” – with how to say Vice President Kamala Harris’ first name. “Confusion is understandable,” Washington said. “Disrespect is not.” In keeping with the convention themes of joy and an introduction to the Democratic nominee, Washington was joined onstage by Harris’ great-nieces Amara and Leela Ajagu, who led the crowd in a chant: Comma, like the punctuation mark. La, like a sing-song la-la-la. It was a lighthearted approach to a darker theme running through this election: the ways that race and gender have colored the attacks leveled at Harris since she launched her presidential campaign. For many woman of color, particularly those who have run for office and been in the political spotlight, it’s a familiar challenge. “When I have a job to do, you can call me every name in the book – that does not define me,” said Val Demings, a former Florida US congresswoman and 2022 Democratic nominee for Senate. “I am defined by the quality of work that I do for the people that I represent.” The end of the Democratic convention marks a new phase of the campaign, a 74-day sprint to Election Day and increased pressure on Harris to lay out her policies, including at next month’s debate. In interviews and convention speeches, Black women leaders said the Harris campaign should continue to avoid engaging directly with personal attacks. Former first lady Michelle Obama referenced those concerns in her Tuesday convention speech, when she drew comparisons between former President Donald Trump’s embrace of false conspiracy theories that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States. “We know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth. My husband and I, sadly, know a little something about this,” Obama said. “It’s his same old con, doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.” Republican allies have urged Trump to stay away from personal attacks. “Trump can say, ‘Look, I’m entitled to personal attacks.’ Nobody cares what you’re entitled to,” Gov. Chris Sununu, a New Hampshire Republican, said this month on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Do what you have to do to get the votes and win.” Asked to respond to criticisms that the former president has veered into racism and sexism in his attacks of Harris, his campaign said Democrats and the media are attempting to distract from Harris’ thin policy agenda, echoing calls from Republicans urging him to stick with policy. Last week, the vice president unveiled a detailed economic proposal that her campaign said will provide tax relief to more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans. But other concrete aspects of her policy vision are not listed on her campaign website. She also has not done a news conference or sat down for an in-depth interview since launching her campaign four weeks ago. “Contrary to the Harris campaign which continues to make this race about personality versus policy, President Trump has laid out a clear path to make America prosperous and safe again,” Janiyah Thomas, the Trump campaign’s Black media director, said in a statement. “Kamala Harris does not even have policies listed on her website. This is another attempt by the media and the Harris campaign to deflect from Kamala Harris’ lack of having a complete policy agenda for the American people.” The Harris campaign has chosen not to engage. A spokesperson referred CNN to remarks the vice president made last month, when she called Trump’s NABJ comments “the same old show — the divisiveness and the disrespect.” Other Black women who’ve run for higher office said they’ve taken similar approaches. “I love a good clap-back like anybody else,” said Georgia state Rep. Jasmine Clark. “But I do think that sometimes, as a candidate, you have to understand when someone is trying to get into your head.” A’shanti Gholar, the president of Emerge, which recruits and trains Democratic women running for office, said that when political opponents can’t land attacks on a woman of color’s policies or background, they resort to name calling and questioning her identity. Gholar said she’s “extremely honest” with Emerge candidates about those realities. “I can’t take the sexism, the racism, the misogyny, out of politics,” she said. “But what we can do is teach you how to be an effective candidate, a great elected official, and give you the network of support that’s going to help you with that.” Part of that includes role-playing to help candidates craft a message in response to potential attacks. They also stress that candidates should stay focused. Gholar pointed to Harris’ campaign as an example. “This isn’t the first time that she’s had her ethnicity questioned, her record questioned,” Gholar said. “But she is able to address it and say, ‘This is what I did, this is why I did it, and this is what I’m planning to do now.’” Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the majority leader of the New York Senate said Harris has captured the dreams and the longings of those who came before her, from late New York Rep. Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for president under a major party, to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “She’s staying focused, she’s hitting back as needed, but she’s been extremely measured,” Stewart-Cousins said. “She understands that she has one assignment, and that’s to get this done.”"
DNC live updates: Kamala Harris accepts her party’s historic nomination | CNN Politics,No Edits Made,2024-08-22T09:00:03.052Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/dnc-democratic-national-convention-08-22-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of the presidential race has moved here. Vice President Kamala Harris capped one of the most extraordinary months in modern political history Thursday night with a speech that rallied Democrats and cast Donald Trump as the enemy of classic American principles. Harris went directly at her Republican rival, offering a clean break from the uncertainty and upheaval during his years in the White House. She laid out the former president’s legal troubles. She blamed him for the horrors some women have faced amid the implementation of strict state-level abortion laws. Here are the takeaways from the fourth night of the DNC: Fight for “freedom” and a question of government interference: Harris has talked at great length about “freedom,” seeking to reframe issues such as reproductive rights as a question of government interference. Harris gets personal: The vice president didn’t explicitly compare her upbringing with the former president’s, but other speakers this week have made a more direct contrast between her childhood and Trump’s life as the son of a real estate mogul. Allies back up Harris’ resume: Each night, speakers have highlighted her work fighting transnational gangs, sexual abusers and corporate bad actors. Meet the Harris clan: Trump and many other Republicans for years have made a show out of mispronouncing Harris’ first name. On Thursday night, Harris’ two young grandnieces appeared onstage with actress Kerry Washington to send a message: It’s so easy that children can do it. Harris’ niece, Meena Harris, appeared with Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff and her goddaughter, Helena Hudlin. Later, Maya Harris, the vice president’s sister, talked about their mother, who died in 2009. Gun violence testimonies: The convention highlighted the personal stories of people affected by gun violence. Speakers shared their experiences of loss, including Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath whose son was murdered in 2012; mothers who lost their children in the mass shootings at the Sandy Hook and Uvalde school shootings; Melody McFadden, who lost her mother to domestic violence; and Edgar Vilchez, who lost a classmate. Former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting at a campaign event in 2011, closed out the segment. ‘Central Park Five’ member: Trump has a long history of weaponizing racial resentments for political gain, but the first instance of Trump utilizing that brand of politics was when the “Central Park Five” — five Black and Latino teenage boys — were wrongfully arrested in 1989 and eventually convicted of raping and assaulting a woman jogging in New York City. Trump, then a New York real estate developer, took out and signed full-page newspaper ads calling for the boys to be executed. Those boys were later exonerated. On Thursday night, four of the five appeared on stage at the DNC. Gaza war opponents denied speaking spot: The DNC denied speaking time to “Uncommitted” delegates elected by primary protest votes against the Biden administration’s Israel policy. Harris pledged to support and defend Israel and condemned the atrocities of Hamas’ October 7 attacks. She then said “what has happened in Gaza over the last 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again.” Celebrities make their mark: The DNC has seen several stars this week, from Lil Jon’s surprise appearance during the star-studded roll call to Oprah Winfrey’s speech Wednesday. Mindy Kaling, Tony Goldwyn, Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Sheila E. Pink, Mickey Guyton, Maren Morris and Jason Isbell also got stage time. After publicly bashing him at a recent rally in Georgia, former President Donald Trump appears to be extending an olive branch to Gov. Brian Kemp.  The post comes after allies expressed frustration with Trump for his ongoing public criticism of the popular Georgia governor. Georgia is widely considered one of the most critical battleground states and one in which the Trump campaign has grown increasingly concerned since Kamala Harris took over at the top of the Democratic ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris made history Thursday night as she formally accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Harris announced her candidacy last month after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid and endorsed her to succeed him. The party has moved quickly to coalesce behind Harris following Biden’s unprecedented exit. Harris’ speech closed out the fourth and final day of the convention, which was held at the United Center in Chicago. See more pictures from the 2024 Democratic National Convention. In her keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris said that, if elected, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and support the Jewish state’s ability to defend itself. She also acknowledged the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza as Israel’s war destroys the enclave. Why this stands out: Harris’ remarks are largely in line with the Biden administration’s position, though this was the most she has publicly said on the issue and her most fulsome comments in support of Palestinian self-determination since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have expressed support for a two-state solution. What the Uncommitted National Movement was doing: The group had led a sit-in outside the convention after the Harris campaign denied their request to address the gathering. On Thursday, the uncommitted delegates entered the venue for Harris’ speech, effectively ending the sit-in. The delegates issued another demand to the Harris campaign, though: Come to Michigan and other swing states and talk to Palestinian American families by September 15. The group’s leaders criticized the DNC and the Harris campaign for rejecting what they perceived as a modest or symbolic request in denying a speaking slot for a Palestinian American at the convention. Still, Elabed said the delegates had no plans to disrupt the proceedings ahead of or during Harris’s acceptance speech. Eight residents of Allentown, Pennsylvania, all previously undecided voters, told CNN’s Gary Tuchman how they felt Kamala Harris performed at the Democratic National Convention. Six of the eight said they were now ready to vote for Harris. One resident will vote for Donald Trump, and one is not planning to vote. Harris’ speech, during which she accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, received three As, three B+’s, one B and one C, from the group. Multiple group members said they wanted Harris to go more “in depth” during her speech. Scott, who gave her a B+, said she looked “very confident” and liked her message of unity. He didn’t give her an A because “she needed to go into a little more detail” about her plans. Brian, who gave her the C, said “she wasn’t clear enough on the policies” and said that while he liked that she shared more of her background, “I still don’t feel like she’s ready.” Kamala Harris promised Americans a future that neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden could deliver, showing how profoundly she has changed the 2024 election. The first Black woman to claim a major party nomination on Thursday styled her “unlikely journey” to the Democratic nod as the springboard to lift the country to a new place after years of being torn apart by its bitter divides. The vice president offered voters a clear choice in a steady and patriotic Democratic National Convention address. Americans can take the road of “chaos and calamity” in a new term under Trump, whom she called “an unserious man” who nevertheless poses a “serious threat” to democracy and basic American freedoms. Or, Harris said, the country can recommit to values she evoked in detailing her upbringing as a daughter of immigrants nurtured by a loving California community of unofficial aunts, epitomized by “Freedom. Opportunity. Compassion. Dignity. Fairness. And endless possibilities.” Instead of Trump’s American carnage and threats of retribution, Harris is presenting herself as the catalyst for America’s quintessential capacity to renew itself. She leveraged her past as a prosecutor, pledging to always be “for the people” while accusing the Republican nominee of serving “the only client he has ever had: Himself.” Read the full analysis. Vice President Kamala Harris said Thursday that if Donald Trump were to become president again, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion; enact a nationwide abortion ban; force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions “with or without Congress”; and create a national anti-abortion coordinator. Facts First: Harris is making a prediction that we cannot definitively fact check, but Trump himself has not, during this campaign, endorsed these policies she said he would implement as president. Many of the policies are proposed in Project 2025, a conservative think tank’s set of policy preferences for a Republican administration.  Over the past couple of decades, Trump’s position has shifted several times on abortion restrictions.  Trump regularly boasts about how he appointed the justices to the US Supreme Court that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed pregnant people the right to an abortion in the United States.   Even in this latest campaign, Trump has repeatedly ducked direct questions about his support for a federal ban, and polls show that the majority of Americans are not in favor of a federal abortion ban. Polls also show Republicans and Democrats largely believe that access to birth control should be widely available. Possibly reflecting those sentiments, in April, Trump said directly that he would not sign a national abortion ban if reelected to the White House. Trump also said the decision to ban abortion should be left up to the states. In July, the Republican National Committee softened language on abortion that better reflected those views.  Trump’s current position on abortion reversed what he said in 2016 when he was first running for the presidency and was the opposite of statements he made throughout his time in office.  Some scholars are concerned that conservative advisers to Trump have encouraged him to ban abortions by enforcing the 1873 Comstock Act. By enforcing this Victorian-era anti-vice law that is still on the books, but is not currently enforced, he could create a national ban and bypass the need for legislation.   The Comstock law specifically bans the mailing of “obscene” materials used to produce an abortion. Some scholars believe Trump could use the Justice Department to enforce a ban that would not just restrict people from sending the medication currently used in the majority of abortions through the mail, but would ban any materials used to produce any kind of abortion. The Comstock law has also been used to ban birth control.   Trump has not officially endorsed the enforcement of the Comstock Act, but it is a strategy some of his advisers have outlined, including former advisers who created Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s plan for the next Republican administration. Trump has not endorsed Project 2025.   In an interview with CBS on Monday, when asked if he would enforce the Comstock Act, Trump said that “specifics” remained to be determined, but that he “generally” wouldn’t enforce the act’s prohibition against pills used for an abortion. Trump has not elaborated on what “generally” means, but he did add that “the federal government should have nothing to do with this issue.”  Vice President Kamala Harris thanked supporters and donors gathered at Queenie’s Supper Club following her speech in the United Center at the Democratic National Convention. Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff expressed gratitude and optimism for their campaign. Emhoff acknowledged their 10th wedding anniversary and said her speech this evening “exceeded expectations.”  “We have been talking all week about you setting this moment up, and you, honey, exceeded the highest expectation. And for these past four weeks, we have seen you become the leader we all know you to be,” he said. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said former President Donald Trump fights for the wealthy, not the middle class.  Facts First: Harris is referring to Trump’s vow to extend the provisions of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that expire next year. Her claim is mostly true, though extending the provisions would also help Americans who are not wealthy.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of Trump’s key achievements in office, reduced taxes for most people, though the rich benefited far more than others. If the expiring provisions are made permanent, the highest-income households would receive more than 45% of the benefits, according to a July analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.  If the law’s provisions are made permanent, households making at least $450,000 – roughly the top 5% – would be the biggest winners, the analysis found. They would see their after-tax income increase by 3.2%. For those in the top 1%, who make at least $1 million, that boost equates to a tax cut of about $70,000, on average, in 2027.  Middle-income households earning between roughly $65,000 and $116,000, on the other hand, would receive a tax cut of about $1,000, or 1.3% of their income, the analysis found.  Overall, extending the 2017 tax law provisions would reduce taxes for about three-quarters of households but hike them by about 10%, according to the analysis.  As for the impact on the national debt, extending the individual income and estate tax cuts, extending or maintaining some of the law’s corporate tax changes, and taking interest into account would increase the deficit by more than $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.   On the fourth and final day of the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination for president in a much-anticipated speech. She presented herself as the underdog in the race and attacked former President Donald Trump while outlining her key policy proposals and telling voters about her background. While accepting the nomination, she promised to “be a president for all Americans.” Here are some of her key quotes: Star-studded appearances: The Chicks performed the National Anthem and pop star Pink performed her hit “What About Us” with her daughter, Willow. Kerry Washington hosted part of the night and brought out her “Scandal” co-star Tony Goldwyn. The past four days have been a jubilant celebration for Democrats in Chicago, culminating in Kamala Harris’ acceptance tonight of her party’s nomination for president. But even as confetti and balloons showered down inside the United Center, the vice president remains “clear-eyed” about what could come next, a top Democrat who spoke with Harris in recent days told CNN.  This person said they’ve not heard the vice president or senior Harris campaign officials use the word “honeymoon” to describe the period between President Joe Biden dropping out of the race and now.  But, they said, the vice president herself and others on down have made clear that they anticipate the momentum and enthusiasm of the past few weeks could wane — for reasons that may or may not be under Harris’ control.  In her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris said former President Donald Trump has an “explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents and anyone he sees as the enemy.”  Facts First: Harris’ claim is correct. Trump has previously expressed support for imprisoning journalists and political opponents.   Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies.   In several videos and speeches, the former president has also laid out plans to appoint a special prosecutor to go after President Joe Biden and his family.   Trump has also reportedly called for reporters to be jailed. In 2017, the New York Times reported that Trump urged then-FBI Director James Comey to consider jailing journalists who publish classified information before asking him to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In 2023, months after Politico published a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade, Trump said the journalists behind the story should be jailed if they did not reveal their source.  Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz are heading to meet with top Democratic donors and supporters here at the convention hall, aides said, thanking some of the party’s biggest benefactors. A friends and family party will get underway downtown a bit later tonight, as Harris and Doug Emhoff celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. John Legend is scheduled to perform at the private event for Harris and Emhoff, aides said. Harris wished her husband a happy anniversary at the top of her remarks at the Democratic National Convention earlier this evening. Donald Trump said Kamala Harris is “not having success, I’m having success” in an interview Thursday night following Harris’ speech at the Democratic convention. Fox News host Martha McCallum said: “There’s been a huge appeal and momentum for women voters. She’s trying to pull that, the youth vote, the Hispanic vote, the Black vote back in her direction. Polls show that she’s having some success in that at this point, so what are you going to do? What’s your strategy to rebuild the momentum that you had with those voters?” Trump later added, “No, it’s only in your eyes that they have that, Martha.” An Arizona man who is accused of making threats against former President Donald Trump was booked on two counts of threatening and a felony warrant, the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office said in an updated Facebook post Thursday.  The sheriff’s office said they were made aware of a threatening message posted on social media directed at Trump on Tuesday, which they later learned was posted by Ronald Syvrud, who has “multiple outstanding warrants.” With this information, the sheriff’s office released a wanted person flyer to locate Syvrud in order to allow charging of the warrants and to investigate the threats, the post said. A second social media post with threats against Trump was found Wednesday, they said. The sheriff’s office said “locating this subject was a priority” due to Trump’s visit in the area, and they deployed multiple units to a possible location.  At 2:16 p.m. local time, authorities observed Syvrud “traveling outside of the identified location” and he was taken into custody “without further incident at approximately 2:30 p.m. local time, the post said.  He was booked on two counts of threatening related to the social media posts and a felony warrant from a neighboring county for failure to register as a sex offender, the sheriff’s office said.  “The successful conclusion of this incident without injury to our communities or public safety personnel is a testament to the strong working relationship and coordination between local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies,” their post said.  Syvrud is in custody “pending further court adjudication,” the post said. CNN could not immediately identify an attorney for Syvrud. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said it was possible he would be meeting with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Friday — the same day Kennedy is expected to suspend his presidential bid.  Trump is going to be joined by a “special guest” at his rally in Arizona on Thursday, according to his campaign. Kennedy is expected to end his presidential bid earlier in the day at an event in Phoenix. CNN previously reported there were talks between Trump’s team and Kennedy’s orbit for the independent candidate to endorse the former president and appear at Trump’s Phoenix area rally that same night. Vice President Kamala Harris claimed in her speech at the Democratic National Convention that former President Donald Trump’s proposed policies would raise prices for American families. Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House.   Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.  Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank.  If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP.  Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households.   Chasten Buttigieg, husband of Transportion Secretary Pete Buttigieg, said he “cannot wait” to see Kamala Harris win the election and thought about “the fact that the first president that our daughter is going to come to know is a woman who looks like her.” Buttigieg pointed to Harris making a case for families dealing with medical bills and worrying about their children going to school amid fears of mass shootings. “As a teacher, as a dad, I’m so proud of her,” he said. Pete Buttigieg said he believed if Trump loses it’ll be the “beginning of the end of Trumpism and the beginning of having a normal Republican Party in the future.” He added that a lot of Republicans are “quietly looking forward to” seeing Donald Trump lose the election. Former President Donald Trump reacted to Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention in real-time on Truth Social.  “IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” Trump posted.  The former president posted in rapid succession, criticizing Harris’ speech, saying “A lot of talk about childhood,” and “Too many ‘Thank yous,’ too rapidly said.” Trump repeatedly questioned why Harris hadn’t already accomplished the policy proposals she’s put forward as part of her reelection campaign while serving as vice president. “She said, ‘Chart a new way forward,’ but she’s had three and a half years, and has done nothing but HARM!” Trump wrote.  He also pushed back on Harris’ characterization of Project 2025, which he has repeatedly tried to distance himself from. “LYING AGAIN ABOUT PROJECT 2025, WHICH SHE KNOWS, AND SO DO ALL DEMOCRATS, THAT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH!” Trump posted. 100,000 red, white, and blue balloons are falling from the ceiling of the United Center in celebration of Vice President Kamala Harris’ nomination – the culmination of a massive planning feat by an army of staff and volunteers.  Inflation was a key issue at the Democratic National Convention – balloon inflation. The process to get them from their packages and into the rafters happened here on site with 75 volunteers, 30 staff members, and “a dozen or so Local 2 Stagehands” working with a specialized system developed in 1988, according to a convention official. There is a “range of expertise” involved – from creative decisions on shape and size, volunteer management, and “coordination with union stagehands and riggers (to ensure) every balloon is positioned perfectly for maximum impact,” according to the official. The balloons began to inflate last Wednesday, the official said, but planning began months ago. For the past four days, the balloons – 9- and 24-inch sized – have been suspended in anticipation of this moment. Vice President Kamala Harris argued that the country is not as divided as her opponent says it is, pitching for its unity in her Democratic National Convention speech on Thursday. She said Americans “have so much more in common than what separates us” and that “none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed.” She said former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance are “denigrating America” and “talking about how terrible everything is” on the campaign trail. Kamala Harris made a pledge at the Democratic National Convention that if elected, she would “bring back the bipartisan border security bill” tanked by Donald Trump and “sign it into law.” Remember: Earlier this year, Trump lobbied Republicans, both in private conversations and in public statements on social media, to oppose the border compromise being delicately hashed out in the Senate, according to GOP sources familiar with the conversations – in part because he wanted to campaign on the issue this November and didn’t want President Joe Biden to score a victory in an area where he is politically vulnerable. Harris, in her DNC speech, underscored that the Democrats and Republicans wrote the bill together and Border Patrol endorsed it, but Trump tanked the bill. She offered herself in contrast. Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself — but added the bloodshed in Gaza is “devastating” and “heartbreaking.” “With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And let me be clear: I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7, including unspeakable sexual violence, and the massacre of young people at a music festival.” She continued: “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination.” “And know this. I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists,” she added. Kamala Harris looked to pin Donald Trump to unpopular reproductive rights issues in her speech to the Democratic National Convention Thursday night. Nearly two dozen states have enacted abortion limits since the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe. The aftermath has led to a wave of political activity that has boosted Democrats, who had a better-than-expected showing in the midterm elections. This year, Democrats hope that enduring anger over bans, as well as abortion rights ballot initiatives in a handful of key battleground states, will help 2024 candidates. “This is what is happening in our country, because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, than medication abortion and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress,” she said. Trump in April said he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected to the White House again, reversing a promise the former president made as a candidate in 2016 and stood by during his first term in office. CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report.  The United Center, home of both the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks, has a capacity of over 20,000 people. Vice President Kamala Harris outlined her plans for a “new way forward” if she’s elected to be the 47th president of the United States. Harris said her plans to protect the middle class are personal because “the middle class is where I come from.” She called for creating an “opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed.” Harris also promised to end the country’s housing shortage and protect social security and Medicare. Her plans, she said, differ from Donald Trump and she accused the former president of fighting “for himself and his billionaire friends.” Beyoncé will not be performing at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, according to her representative.  Asked if she would be performing at the DNC on Thursday evening, Beyoncé’s representative Yvette Noel-Schure told CNN in a statement, “She was never scheduled to be in Chicago.”  Throughout the day on Thursday, speculation that Beyoncé would make a surprise appearance at the final night of the convention reached a fever pitch.  Multiple sources close to convention planners told CNN earlier in the evening they believed Beyoncé would in fact come. However, later in the evening, Beyoncé’s representative went on the record for the first time with The Hollywood Reporter to deny she was ever scheduled to attend. Vice President Kamala Harris has incorporated Beyoncé’s 2016 song “Freedom” in her campaign rallies and in her ads. CNN previously reported that Harris and her team got approval from Beyoncé to use the song throughout her presidential campaign, according to a source close to the vice president. On Thursday, when Harris walked out for her speech onstage, she walked out to “Freedom.” Beyoncé has appeared at numerous Democratic events in the past. In 2008, the Grammy-winner sang Etta James’ “At Last” at former President Barack Obama’s presidential Inaugural Ball, and sang the National Anthem at Obama’s second presidential Inauguration in 2013. In 2016, Beyoncé and her husband, rapper Jay-Z, headlined a pre-election concert in Ohio for Hillary Clinton, using the stage to voice their support for the then-presidential candidate. And in 2020, Beyoncé endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket when she encouraged her followers to vote in a post on her Instagram page. In her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned the Supreme Court’s July decision on presidential immunity while warning about the “consequences” of giving former President Donald Trump another term.  “Consider the power he will have – especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution,” Harris said. “Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.”   The court ruled that a former president has “absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority” and is “entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts” – but also ruled that “there is no immunity for unofficial acts.”   It’s fair for Harris to frame the ruling as an expansion of presidential power. But the ruling did not kill the ongoing criminal prosecutions against Trump, let alone prohibit any future criminal prosecutions against him.   A federal prosecution over Trump’s attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 election is back in the hands of a district court judge, who must decide which of the alleged Trump acts at issue are official and which are unofficial. And a state-level election subversion prosecution against Trump is also alive in Georgia, though it is on hold amid a battle over whether the district attorney leading the case should be disqualified.   In May, before the Supreme Court ruling, Trump was found guilty of felony falsification of business records in a state-level prosecution in New York. The presiding judge is now considering how the ruling applies to that case, in which Trump is awaiting sentencing.  Vice President Kamala Harris warned that former President Donald Trump would take the country back down a road of dangerous policies if he is elected to the White House for another term, pointing to a ruling from the US Supreme Court earlier this year that said Trump can claim limited immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken in office. “Just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails,” Harris said at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. She worked to tie all Trump policies to Project 2025 — the 920-page document that serves as a blueprint for a second Trump term. She said the document shows what a second Trump term would look like. Project 2025, which Harris’ campaign has frequently attacked, was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration. Trump has tried to publicly distance himself from the initiative. The goal of Project 2025 and Trump, Harris said, is to “pull our country back to the past.” “But America, we are not going back,” she said. Vice President Kamala Harris laid out the consequences of electing former President Donald Trump to a second term. She spoke about the “chaos and calamity” of his years in the Oval Office and also pointed to him questioning election results in 2020 when he lost his reelection bid. “Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames,” she said. Harris also highlighted that Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in a hush money case and that a federal jury in his civil defamation trial found that the former president had sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll. “He was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans, and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse,” she said. Kamala Harris laid bare what she described as the stark stakes of the presidential election this year after accepting her nomination at the Democratic National Convention. After discussing her previous political experience and the tough elections that put her in her current position, Harris said: “We never gave up because the future is always worth fighting for.” “And that is the fight we are in right now,” the vice president said, “a fight for America’s future.” Kamala Harris’ path from prosecutor to politician has been defined by many firsts: She was the nation’s first Indian American senator and California’s first female and South Asian attorney general.   Harris is the first woman to become vice president, as well as the first Black or Asian American person to hold the office.  And tonight, as she takes the stage, Harris will explain why each of these experiences helped shape her into the woman, politician, and presidential candidate that she is today.   Read more about Kamala Harris’ background and follow our instant analysis here.   Kamala Harris issued a direct appeal to Republicans questioning whether to vote for her, vowing to be a president for all Americans. “I know there are people of various political views watching tonight,” she said after accepting the nomination. “And I want you to know: I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self.” Harris continued: In her speech to the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris recounted how a childhood friend being sexually abused led her to become a prosecutor. After graduating from law school at the University of California Hastings, Harris spent three decades as a prosecutor, serving as a deputy district attorney for Oakland’s Alameda County before she was elected in 2004 to be district attorney of San Francisco. In 2011, Harris became the first Black American, first woman, and first Asian American elected to be the attorney general of California. CNN’s Chelsea Bailey contributed to this report. Kamala Harris accepted her party’s historic nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris shared what it was like being raised by her mother, Shyamala, who she described during her remarks at the Democratic National Convention as “a brilliant 5-foot tall brown woman with an accent.” In describing her “unexpected” ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris said Thursday that she is “no stranger to unlikely journeys.” Harris shared that her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, immigrated to the US from India alone at the age of 19 with “an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer.” The vice president added that her mother was set to return home to have an arranged marriage but met her father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica, and fell in love. But following the couple’s divorce when Harris was in elementary school, she was raised by a single mother in the “flatlands” of the Bay, Harris recalled, and highlighted the community spirit that helped shape her. Vice President Kamala Harris wished her husband, Doug Emhoff, a happy anniversary at the top of her remarks at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. Today, the final day of the convention and when Harris will accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president, is also the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary. Vice President Kamala Harris received a lengthy standing ovation from a crowd cheering “Kamala!” and “USA!” as she took the stage tonight at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago’s United Center. She calmed them down, saying “Let’s get to business!” Then she thanked her husband Doug Emhoff, and wished him a happy anniversary: “I love you so very much.” Today is the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary. To “Coach Tim Walz,” she said, “you are going to be an incredible vice president.” Her speech represents her most exacting test yet in a dizzying month that rocketed her to the threshold of what would be a historic presidency that could reshape American politics. Her party is calling on Harris to ascend to the next level of the political stratosphere after concerns about advanced age ended Biden’s reelection bid last month. No modern presidential nominee of any major party has faced such a tough assignment in so short a time. Her highest profile moment is historic. Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. This post has been updated with remarks from Harris. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper recounted working with Kamala Harris during their time as attorneys general of their respective states. He said Harris is “ready to fight for you.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. withdrew from the Arizona ballot Thursday, a spokesperson for the state’s secretary of state told CNN. The move comes ahead of a scheduled event in the state on Friday where Kennedy is expected to announce he’s suspending his campaign. CNN has reported that there are current talks between Kennedy’s orbit and Donald Trump’s team for the independent candidate to endorse the former president and appear at Trump’s Phoenix-area rally Friday. A strong focus of Vice President Kamala Harris, and her campaign’s approach to the path to 270 electoral votes in November, was on clear display on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. The primetime lineup was filled with key speakers from Arizona: Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, Sen. Mark Kelly and Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is running for the Senate. All of the Arizonans were scheduled within minutes of one another, showing how the party is prioritizing the state after taking it in 2020. President Joe Biden won by only 10,457 votes in the last election. Vice President Kamala Harris’ family has just entered the Democratic National Convention floor and is seated right in front of the stage. This includes Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and his children.  On the final night of the Democratic National Convention, Maya Harris, the sister of Vice President Kamala Harris, began her speech recounting the story of their mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who she described as a “civil rights activist, a scientist, a devoted mother to her little girls” and a “trailblazer who defied the odds and defined herself.” Maya Harris said her sister has devoted her life to fighting for people. Harris said that with her campaign, the vice president “has created so much electricity, so much optimism, so much joy throughout the nation and it is why we need her leadership in this historic moment.” She urged voters to elect “a leader who sees the potential in each of us, a leader who cares for all of us, a leader who fights for everyone of us — our Democratic nominee, my big sister, the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris!” This post has been updated with remarks from Maya Harris. In his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger told his fellow Republicans that Democrats “are as patriotic as us.” The former congressman from Illinois, who opted to not seek reelection in 2022, was one of two Republicans who served on the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. He also was one of 10 House Republicans to vote for former President Donald Trump’s impeachment for “incitement of an insurrection” over Trump’s role during the riot at the US Capitol. Kinzinger, a CNN contributor, has endorsed Kamala Harris, whose campaign has put forward several Republicans at the DNC to support her presidential run. And on Thursday, he again endorsed the Democratic candidate: This post has been updated with remarks from Kinzinger. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on Wednesday that Kamala Harris “gets us” while making the case to America’s women to elect her as president. Whitmer, who presides over a swing state, is one of several rising Democratic stars who having speaking slots at the convention. Actress Eva Longoria led the audience in a chant in honor of Kamala Harris, asking attendees at the Democratic National Convention to say “she se puede!” Longoria said the Latino community often rallies around the phrase “sí, se puede” or “yes, we can!” But this election season, the actress encouraged the audience to adapt the phrase for Harris to “yes, she can!” This post has been updated with quotes from Eva Longoria’s speech. Vice President Kamala Harris has arrived at the United Center in Chicago, according to a pool report. Arizona Rep. and former Marine Ruben Gallego emphasized the “duty to care for our patriots who serve our nation” during his remarks at the Democratic National Convention. Gallego detailed his history of service and highlighted other elected veterans who were featured onstage. Gallego said Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz “are fighting” for veteran rights, and slammed former President Donald Trump for his policies and comments on the issue.  This post has been updated with more comments from Gallego. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona slammed Donald Trump’s previous comments on foreign policy, including backing away from the United States’ commitment to The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He told the audience that Harris knows that “standing with our allies means standing up for Americans.” “The world laughs at Trump, literally,” Kelly said. “But folks, it is not funny. When he was president, that meant the world was laughing at us. The threats we face are too serious.” He argued that America’s standing in the world and the global alliances that took decades to build are at stake. Kelly, who represents the key battleground state of Arizona, said “the choice isn’t even close” between Harris and Trump — but acknowledged that in states like his, the race could be tight. President Joe Biden won Arizona by only 10,457 votes in 2020. But, Kelly, evoking his experience as an astronaut, told the crowd: “We’ll win in the same way we launched rockets into space and land fighter jets on an aircraft carrier as one team on one mission.” More context: His remarks came after a speech from his wife former Rep. Gabby Giffords who spoke about gun violence. Giffords was shot in the head in 2011 during an appearance in front of an Arizona supermarket. Kelly has been a longtime advocate for gun control. Recently, he was on the shortlist to become Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. This post was updated with remarks from Mark Kelly. Leon Panetta, former CIA director and secretary of defense during the Obama administration, drew contrast between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on foreign policy during the last night of the Democratic National Convention. “I’ve looked into the eyes of our warriors and deployed them into battle,” Panetta said, touting the killing of Osama bin Laden. “Nobody attacks our country and gets away with it — nobody,” He added: “Our warriors need a tough, cool-headed commander-in-chief to defend our democracy from tyrants and terrorists. We need Kamala Harris behind the Resolute Desk.” Panetta highlighted that Harris has worked with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to defend the country against Russia, adding, “She knows that protecting their democracy protects our democracy as well.” The former president, on the other hand, “does not understand the world and he does not understand the service and sacrifice of our military. Our fallen veterans are not suckers, they are not losers. They are our heroes,” Panetta said, referring to a 2020 reporting that Trump used those terms to refer to US service members, which the former president has denied. ” Pop star Pink performed her hit “What about us” at the Democratic National Convention on stage her daughter, Willow.  Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, recalling being shot and wounded in a mass shooting in 2011, threw her support tonight behind Vice President Kamala Harris as she spoke during a portion of the Democratic National Convention focused on gun violence. Following the shooting in an Arizona supermarket, Giffords went on to start the gun violence prevention non-profit, Giffords. Giffords was joined on stage by her husband Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who was on a shortlist of possible running mates for Kamala Harris. Before she took the stage, Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia — who lost her son in a shooting — spoke alongside others during an emotional segment about the gun violence that scarred Sandy Hook, Uvalde, Charleston, South Carolina, and Chicago. Abbey Clements, who was a teacher at Sandy Hook, talked about the moments when gunshots rang out. She sat with her second grade students, reading and singing with them, “trying to drown out the sounds of terror, crying, running — I carry that horrific day with me,” she said. Kim Rubio was at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde to watch her daughter receive an award for receiving all A’s. When her daughter, along with 18 other children and two teachers were killed by a gunman, “we were taken to a private room where police tell us she isn’t coming home. Uvalde is national news. Parents everywhere reach for their children. I reach out for the daughter I will never hold again.” This post has been updated with remarks from Giffords, Abbey Clements and Kim Rubio. Sheriff Chris Swanson of Genesee County, Michigan, told the Democratic National Convention that Kamala Harris represents the ethos he believes in as a law enforcement office — protect, serve and unify. Swanson, whose county includes the city of Flint, described how his officers and members of the community walked together in 2020 following the police murder of George Floyd. “We laid down our riot gear, we embraced our community, and instead of hate, we chose hope,” Swanson said. He’s one of several law enforcement officials who have spoken at the party’s convention. Comedian DL Hughley took to the stage Thursday night apologizing to Vice President Kamala Harris for his previous criticism of her record as California’s attorney general. Hughley said he previously made assumptions about Harris’ record and spoke about them on his platforms. In response, Hughley said Harris invited the comedian to her house. “She put her hand on my shoulder and she asked me to do some research. Something I had never done. Something a lot of people I know had never done before,” Hughley said. “Imagine attacking someone’s character without a single Google search.” Hughley said he learned Harris had “done for us exactly for us what she promised to do.” He then said believes his apology should be as loud his an accusation. Kamala Harris’ niece Meena Harris, stepdaughter Ella Emhoff and goddaughter Helena Hudlin delivered joint remarks during the last night of the Democratic National Convention, sharing personal stories to make the case that the vice president would be fit for office. Emhoff shared how Harris came into her life when she was 14 years old and recalled that, “No matter what, Kamala was there for me.” Hudlin shared that to her, Harris’ advice “means everything.” The titles of “Momala” — as Ella and Cole Emhoff refer to their stepmother — and “Auntie” are important to Harris, and she highlights them in the bio of both her personal and official X accounts.   And the remarks from the three women come as the vice president has recently been subject to sexist criticisms about her lack of biological children.   Second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, has defended Harris amid such attacks, telling CNN last month that “Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I.” President Joe Biden is planning to watch Vice President Kamala Harris’ Democratic National Convention speech tonight, a source familiar with the plans said, as his chosen successor faces her most high-profile moment yet to make the case for her candidacy. Thursday’s events at the DNC in Chicago are far different from what Biden and his family envisioned just a few weeks ago when they anticipated he would be addressing the convention as the party’s nominee this evening. Aides have said the president appreciates the momentum around Harris’ campaign and how quickly the party coalesced around her after he issued his own speedy endorsement of his White House partner. The president wrote on social media that he and first lady Jill Biden had spoken to Harris Thursday and said they couldn’t wait to watch her accept the party’s nomination. After speaking at the convention’s opening night on Monday, Biden decamped to Santa Ynez, California, where he’s stayed out of the public eye as the Chicago festivities have played out. This post has been updated with more from Joe Biden. Actress Kerry Washington echoed Michelle Obama’s message to Americans in her speech at the final night of the Democratic National Convention.  “Just like Michelle Obama told us — let’s do something,” she said, asking people to pull out their phones and make a video to post it on social media or text it to friends. Actor Tony Goldwyn brought out her phone and together they took a video, saying, “when we fight” and the crowd chanting back, “we win!” Then she brought out Kamala Harris’ nieces who taught everyone how to say Harris’ name — first say “comma” then say “la.” They moved the crowd to chant “Kamala!” Washington identified herself as a mother, daughter, union member, the granddaughter of immigrants and a Black woman. This post has been updated with remarks from Washington. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris’ recently announced plan to put in place anti-price gouging laws in an effort to lower the cost of food, saying Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, “Prices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up.”  Facts First: Casey’s remark lacks key context and overstates the role corporations have played in driving inflation, according to two papers published by regional Federal Reserve banks.   The papers published by the two banks suggest corporations contributed to the inflation Americans have experienced in recent years; however, their pricing actions weren’t the primary driver of inflation when it peaked at a four-decade high in 2022.  Research published by the Kansas City Fed last year found that corporate profits, which grew significantly in the first half of 2021 as firms raised prices at a faster pace than their costs were increasing, could have accounted for more than half the inflation Americans experienced that year. But by 2022, the rate at which corporations raised prices compared with their costs declined.   The researchers concluded that corporations likely raised prices in 2020 and the early part of 2021 in anticipation of rising future costs. But price hikes corporations put forth then were not the main source of inflation in 2022.  Research published by the San Francisco Fed earlier this year reached a similar conclusion: that alleged corporate price gouging was not a primary catalyst for the inflation surge that occurred in 2021 and 2022.  Ultimately, the inflation Americans have had to contend with over the past few years is the product of a confluence of events, including the war in Ukraine, government spending and pandemic-related disruptions across the economy. The unprecedented stress on supply chains in the thick of the pandemic, for example, contributed significantly to inflation’s rise in early 2021.  However, research from progressive think tanks, such as Groundwork Collaborative, suggests there’s a more direct link between corporations raising prices and higher inflation. The Chicks performed the National Anthem during the final night of the Democratic National Convention.   Ahead of their performance, Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas called The Chicks “our favorite country music rabble rousers,” a nod to the band’s history of speaking out about politics.   In 2003, at the height of their fame, The Chicks singer Natalie Maines criticized then-President George W. Bush and spoke out about the invasion of Iraq. The remark sparked a backlash but the band continued to use their music and platform to make political statements.   Read more about country music’s tangled history with politics here. Several people impacted by policies from President Joe Biden’s administration joined the brother of the late Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick to speak at the Democratic National Convention. Craig Sicknick was accompanied by a patient advocate heralding Biden’s efforts to cap insulin costs at $35, a small business owner and a father with his sons who have previously met and dined with Biden. Trump “incited the crowd while my brother and his fellow officers were putting their lives at risk,” Sicknick said. “We need a new leader, not an autocrat who’s stuck in the past,” he said. “Brian, we miss you every day.” Brian Sicknick suffered strokes and died of natural causes the day after the insurrection. This post was updated with remarks from Craig Sicknick. Golden State Warriors and US men’s basketball star Steph Curry said in a video played at the Democratic National Convention Thursday that Kamala Harris “as president can bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward.” Curry helped lead the US men’s basketball team to a gold medal at the Olympics earlier this month in a memorable performance against France, scoring four clutch 3-pointers over a stretch of 2 minutes and 13 seconds late in the fourth quarter. Harris is also an avid fan of the Warriors, which were previously located in her hometown of Oakland before moving to San Francisco. President Joe Biden welcomed the Golden State Warriors to the White House to celebrate their 2022 NBA championship, marking their return to the building for the first time since a high-profile clash with former President Donald Trump. The Warriors’ invitation to visit the White House to celebrate their 2017 championship was rescinded by Trump after Curry criticized him over his attacks on Black athletes protesting during the national anthem. Instead of visiting the White House, the Warriors toured the National Museum of African-American History and Culture with local Washington students. This post has been updated with remarks from Curry. John Russell, a content creator, advocated for working-class Americans during his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. Russell, who is a self-described “dirtbag journalist” in West Virginia, makes content across several social media platforms, much of it about American workers and class politics. In his speech, he talked about growing up in Appalachia and how people are “fighting for control over their government, their workplaces and their planet.” He said there is a history of a different kind of populism rooted in the Democratic Party — workers fighting for a living wage and their rights. That is the same thing workers are fighting for today, Russell said. “It is our choice to build on this progress,” he said. Some context: More than 200 content creators have been credentialed for the Chicago convention, with their own reserved platform space on the convention floor.  Their presence represents a recognition from the Harris campaign that reaching voters in the countdown to Election Day will require Democrats to go beyond a traditional media strategy and into new spaces — and target young voters. This post has been updated with remarks from John Russell. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who made history when she became the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, spoke at the final night of the Democratic National Convention about the need to address climate crisis. Harris and Tim Walz will “fight for our future where we all have clean air, clean water and healthy communities,” she added. This post has been updated with remarks from Haaland. Kamala Harris has been a champion of climate and environmental justice for decades. As California’s attorney general, she sued big oil companies such as BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. During her 2020 campaign, she enthusiastically supported a ban on fracking — but a Harris campaign official said in July that she no longer supports such a ban. Some background: Fracking is the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations – and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris said she would start “with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.” She walked that back later when she became Biden’s running mate. Biden has been the most pro-climate president in history, and climate advocates find Harris to be an exciting candidate in her own right. Democrats and climate activists plan to campaign on the stark contrasts between Harris and Trump, who vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments. If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the US would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement. Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost emphasized the importance of focusing on climate change at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He went on to say that “climate change can sometimes feel like an unstoppable force,” but “with our movement and with organizing and an administration that cares, we are making progress.” “Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have proven that tackling this crisis creates jobs, that investing in clean energy protects our health and that investing in mass public transit builds strong communities,” Frost said.  This post has been updated with more of Frost’s comments. As we prepare for Vice President Kamala Harris’ keynote address tonight at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, her campaign released excerpts of her speech. Harris plans to discuss her upbringing and her immigrant mother. She also plans to explain why she became prosecutor. Harris will say she’ll be a president for all Americans. And will warn what Donald Trump’s second term would look like. Harris will also explain the importance of a middle class. Courtney Baldwin, a youth organizer and human trafficking survivor, recalled over a decade ago how Kamala Harris, who was the California attorney general at the time, helped shut down the site that “let me and thousands of others be bought and sold.” CNN reported in 2016 that while Harris was California’s attorney general, authorities from her state and Texas said they found that adults and children had been forced into prostitution through escort ads on Backpage. Carl Ferrer was arrested in 2016 on a warrant from California, which charged him with pimping children and other counts. Baldwin said Harris “still gives me hope. She’s protected people like me her whole life and I know she’ll fight for us all as president.” This post has been updated with remarks from Baldwin. Amy Resner, a former prosecutor and friend of Kamala Harris, called the vice president “a remarkable prosecutor” and said “she will be a remarkable president.” Resner said that during Harris’ time as California’s attorney general, she protected vulnerable communities and gave “victims a voice.” In joint remarks alongside Resner, Karrie Delaney, director of federal affairs at the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, drew a contrast between Harris as a prosecutor and former President Donald Trump, who a civil jury found had sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll and then defamed her when he denied the allegations and disparaged her. Juries in two civil defamation trials have said that Trump should pay Carroll a total of nearly $90 million in damages. “As a legislator and lifetime advocate against sexual violence, I urge all of us to stand together, to support survivors, believe them and hold perpetrators accountable,” Delaney said. Lisa Madigan, the former attorney general of Illinois, said Harris “stood her ground and together, we prevailed” during her time as a prosecutor.  “For as long as I have known her, Kamala Harris has always taken principled positions and never wavered,” Madigan said.  Marc Morial, former mayor of New Orleans and civil rights leader, then applauded Harris’ housing policy, saying that she “is creating a future where every family — yes, every family — has a place to call home.” Nathan Hornes also praised Harris’ previous work, saying that she “stepped in” and “stuck up for students” when he attended Corinthian Colleges — a place he called “a predatory, for-profit chain.” “She prosecuted Corinthian, and as vice president she stuck with us,” Hornes said. “As we fought and we organized for debt relief, the Biden-Harris administration came in, canceled all Corinthian student debt and gave us back our futures” Tristan Snell, a prosecutor for Trump University, then contrasted Hornes’ testimony by detailing the negative impact that the scandal had on student’s lives. In 2018, a judge finalized a $25 million dollar settlement in a class action lawsuit where former students claim they were defrauded. This post has been updated with more of comments from the joint speakers. CNN’s Katie Lobosco, Doug Criss, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle and Kara Scannell contributed reporting.  The party is rocking on the floor of the convention hall, with guests dancing to music between cheering loudly for the speakers — but not everyone can get in. The floor has now been closed because capacity has been reached. That happens at every convention, but tonight it’s a little earlier than usual. A Democrat who drove here from Philadelphia just told me in the hallway that she was not allowed to go in. Joy has been a major theme of Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and this week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago.  But if the vice president has been buoyed by the burst of energy and enthusiasm that has been infused into the Democratic Party since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, there is another word that captures Harris’ mood this week, a senior adviser tells CNN: “serious.” Asked to describe the vice president’s headspace and frame of mind heading into tonight’s critical speech, the adviser said there is both excitement and seriousness. Harris, who has spent much of the past few days preparing for her keynote remarks tonight, is cognizant that few people understand the gravity of formally accepting a presidential nomination, the adviser said. She is “very cognizant of the fact that we have a whole race to run and to win and people we know, people we care about, people we’ll never know — their future is dependent on it,” this adviser told CNN. “She understands the seriousness of the moment.” Civil rights leader Al Sharpton spoke on behalf of his organization the National Action Network at the Democratic National Convention. While the organization doesn’t endorse candidates, Sharpton compared Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ records. Sharpton also referenced recent remarks that Trump made at the National Association of Black Journalists conference, saying Trump refused “to apologize for claims that migrants were taking ‘Black jobs.’ Well, in November, we gone show him when Blacks do they job!” Sharpton said Harris is continuing the legacy of Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for president. This post has been updated with quotes from Al Sharpton’s speech. Four of the “Central Park Five” were on stage during the final night of the Democratic National Convention. They include: Dr. Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise, Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson. The fifth person, Antron McCray, was not present. Salaam, who is now a member of the New York City Council, criticized Donald Trump, saying the former president wanted the five to be “unalive, he wanted us dead.” Criticizing Trump for maintaining that stance despite scientific evidence, Salaam said, Trump has “never changed and he never will.” He added: When America votes Harris into the White House, “we will say what I have said after seven long years of wrongful incarceration — free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty, we are free at last!” Who are the “Central Park Five”: The men came to be known as “Central Park Five” after they were arrested in 1989 — as teenagers — in connection with the rape and assault of a white female jogger, and eventually convicted. There were no witnesses to the attack. The victim had no memory of it, and DNA evidence was in its infancy and was not presented at the trial. The five youths were convicted almost exclusively on their confessions, which they testified were coerced by detectives. Each spent between six and 13-plus years in prison for charges including attempted murder, rape and assault. They were exonerated, and in 2014, New York paid them a $41 million settlement, after another man, a convicted rapist and murderer, confessed to the assault in 2002, and his DNA did match semen that was found on the victim. No DNA evidence has been found to tie any of the Central Park 5 to the crime. Trump features in the story: In one of the more ignominious chapters in his long public life, Donald Trump took out an expensive full-page advertisement in four New York City newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty for the teenagers. He stood by the ad then, and he has stood by it during his political career, including as president, long after the Central Park Five had been exonerated. CNN’s Zachary Wolf contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with remarks from Dr. Yusef Salaam. Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan discussed national security during the last night of the Democratic National Convention, warning attendees that “Trump wants to take us backwards.” She drew contrast between Trump — whom she described as admiring dictators and treating adversaries as friends — and Democrats’ vision. Slotkin is a vulnerable Democrat who is running for Senate to succeed Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow as the party looks to keep control of the chamber and win back the House majority. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado talked about his military service and slammed parts of Project 2025 — widely viewed by conservatives as a blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term transition — for its stance on foreign policy. “Real strength and security come from our people, from our allies,” he said, talking about his service as an Army Ranger. He argued Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention that Project 2025 would “abandon our troops, abandon our veterans, our allies and our principles.” He said the document says that Trump would no longer support Ukraine and back out of NATO commitments, for example. He also pointed to other parts of Project 2025 that outline how the Trump administration would replace current national security personnel with people more loyal to the former president. In contrast, Crow argued that Harris would be a leader who would support service members. He also discussed when he joined the military. Taking that oath, he said, men and women know “it comes with sacrifice, but we also know that it comes with a promise that America will have our back. Trump will break that promise.” Crow, who was an Army Ranger, helped comfort other lawmakers during the US Capitol insurrection and served as a Democratic manager for Trump’s first impeachment trial. Some background: Democrats have been attacking the 920-page document that was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Donald Trump’s administration. The former president has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.”   But, last month, Russell Vought, one of the key authors of Project 2025, was heard on video talking candidly about his behind-the-scenes work to prepare policy for Trump, his expansive views on presidential power, his plans to restrict pornography and immigration, and his complaints that the GOP was too focused on “religious liberty” instead of “Christian nation-ism.” CNN’s Curt Devine, Casey Tolan, Audrey Ash and Kyung Lah contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with remarks from Jason Crow. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a former 2020 primary rival of Kamala Harris, said the vice president will “take on right-wing extremists” during her speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. “She will take on the giant corporations who are squeezing American families,” said Warren, who received extended applause upon taking the stage and riffed on a theme that is familiar from her own 2020 run for president. “In fact, it’s something she’s done before.” “You know what I love about Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris can’t be bought, and she can’t be bossed around,” Warren said. “Kamala was protecting families as California’s attorney general, and Donald was scamming students at Trump University and trying to make money off people losing their homes,” she said. Meanwhile, Harris “stepped up, fought the giant banks, and delivered billions of dollars of help for families,” Warren said. “And that is the difference between a criminal and a prosecutor.” When Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention, she will be welcomed by a sea of white. At Chicago’s McCormick Place Convention Center on Thursday, many delegates are seen wearing white, the color of the suffragette movement: white jackets, white dresses, white pantsuits, white jumpsuits and white skirts.  The word spread organically across email and text groups, delegates in white told CNN Thursday.  Hundreds of women streamed out of a women’s caucus meeting Thursday morning, where a majority of attendees got the dress code memo. While most of those decked in white are women, there were some men in white in solidarity.  Female members of Congress have previously coordinated to wear white at State of the Union addresses. One of those members, Rep. Sara Jacobs of California, told CNN, “I think it’s only fitting today, as the party nominates a woman — the first Black woman, a South Asian woman – that we again continue that solidarity with all those who came before us that made it possible for today to happen.” The floor of the convention hall is packed with Democratic delegates, but the skyboxes here at the United Center are filled with an even more important feature of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign going forward: Democratic donors. The Harris campaign has raised about $500 million since she was elevated to the top of the Democratic ticket, aides told CNN, and believes tonight will be the single largest fundraising effort of the campaign so far. For donors, tonight’s convention is one of the hottest tickets in the party. A month ago, Democratic officials wondered whether they would fill the skyboxes inside the convention hall – now, there’s not room for all of the donors clamoring to get aboard the Harris campaign. Several big donors and supporters are watching the convention from downtown Chicago. Harris will meet with some of them after the convention tonight. The Harris campaign has a massive cash advantage over Trump for the last month. But with seven battleground states, the campaign is hoping to raise another half-billion dollars in the coming month to finance TV ads. “The goal is to turn momentum into money, so the vice president can be on the campaign trail, not out raising money,” a senior adviser said. Former President Donald Trump will be joined by a “special guest” at his rally in Arizona on Friday after independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to end his presidential campaign, according to a Trump campaign news release. Kennedy is expected to make the announcement about his campaign earlier in the day at an event in Phoenix.  CNN previously reported there were talks between Trump’s team and Kennedy’s orbit for the independent candidate to endorse the former president and appear at the rally. Kamala Harris has rolled out a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage. Parts of it build on proposals that Joe Biden has already unveiled. The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year. The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign. Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. Rep. Ted Lieu of California, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, recalled Vice President Kamala Harris’ accomplishments during her tenure as their state’s attorney general and previewed what a Harris presidency could mean for housing policy. He said that he’s seen her “continue to fight for affordable housing as vice president,” adding that if elected president, Harris will “cut red tape so we can build more houses, help new homeowners afford a down payment and take on corporations that unfairly hike up rent.” Lieu is a longtime supporter of the vice president. He shared in an endorsement of Harris this summer that he was the first member of Congress to endorse the then-senator’s 2020 presidential bid.   One of Vice President Kamala Harris’ line sisters from Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. said she knew Harris had what it took to become president 38 years ago when they first met at Howard University in Washington, DC. Kelch, who wore all white and sat alongside her line sisters in a section at the Democratic National Convention, said her sorority sisters are emotional and nostalgic about Harris’ historic nomination. “We know that she is the right person for this role and we cannot wait to be there on inauguration day,” Kelch said. Former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on housing during remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Fudge said the vice president “knows housing is a human right and a pathway to the middle class,” before moving to criticize former President Donald Trump’s approach to housing.  “Donald Trump has no idea how housing works for everyday Americans,” she said. “He doesn’t care.” She called on voters to “ensure we have an opportunity economy” by voting for Harris in November. Some background: Fudge left Joe Biden’s administration earlier this year. She trumpeted several accomplishments during her tenure as a Cabinet secretary, including removing barriers for people with student loan debt trying to buy homes with federal government-backed mortgages, helping more than 2 million families avoid foreclosure and ensuring that a person’s rental history is given greater weight when trying to obtain a home loan. CNN’s Nikki Carvajal and Michael Williams contributed reporting. This post was updated with more of Fudge’s comments. Vice President Kamala Harris will present herself tonight as the underdog in the race, imploring Democrats to not become complacent in the 75-day fight to stop Donald Trump from returning to the White House. “She believes it and wants all Democrats to believe it,” a senior adviser told CNN. It’s been a recurring theme at the convention here and one that campaign advisers say Harris will amplify from the podium tonight. She will call upon Democrats to channel their enthusiasm for the battle ahead, echoing the message Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and so many other speakers have delivered. Harris will not dwell on the historic nature of her candidacy, aside from presenting her biography and her American story. Sen. Alex Padilla of California leaned on his personal experience serving with Kamala Harris to share his support for the vice president during his speech to the Democratic National Convention Thursday night. “To show you how Kamala Harris will treat America’s kids as president, I’ll tell you how she treats mine,” the Democrat said, adding that when she sees his three children, “she greets them with kindness and respect. Literally meeting them on their level to speak to them and to listen.” The former California secretary of state was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to fill Harris’ Senate seat after she was elected vice president in 2020. He became the first Latino in state history to serve in the US Senate. “When Kamala became vice president, I was honored to fill her seat. But I knew that I had some big Chuck Taylors to fill,” he said, alluding to Harris’ sneakers of choice. This post has been updated with remarks from Padilla. Former President Donald Trump and his team are planning to watch Vice President Kamala Harris’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, a source close to Trump told CNN.  Earlier Thursday, Trump said he would do a “live play by play” on his social media platform of the speech, and potentially the speeches leading up to hers.  Trump has watched some of the coverage of the DNC live as well been shown portions of various speeches. Trump has expressed annoyance at some of the media attention, a source familiar with the matter said, as well as some of the attacks on him.  Wednesday, during a speech in Asheboro, NC, Trump lashed out at the Obamas’ criticism of his during their speeches the night before.  “Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night taking little shots? He was taking shots at your president and so was Michelle,” Trump said. “You know, they always say, ‘Sir, please stick to policy, don’t get personal,’ but they’re getting personal all night, these people. As the week has unfolded, both privately and publicly, Trump has routinely said how it is “unfair” that he now has to run against Harris, specifically saying that she did not receive any votes ahead of being placed at the top of the Democratic ticket.  Rep. Veronica Escobar said the energy at the Democratic National Convention has “inspired the nation” while opening the last night of the party’s meeting in Chicago. The fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention is now underway in Chicago. Vice President Kamala Harris will give what is undeniably the most important speech of her political life tonight as she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination. In her speech, she will tell the story of a middle-class upbringing and how that background fueled her decision to become a prosecutor, according to a campaign official. She is also expected to contrast her vision with Donald Trump’s and work to root that vision in patriotism. A video outlining Harris’ life and political career was played for the convention before the speakers took the stage. Here’s who will speak tonight: Performances to watch for: The Chicks will perform the National Anthem, multiple sources have told CNN. To close out the event, Pink will perform ahead of Harris taking the stage. There’s also been speculation about another surprise guest: Beyoncé. Delegates and even lawmakers have been joining in the guessing game on whether the superstar would make an appearance. Convention officials, many of whom don’t know themselves about the closely held guest list, declined to comment. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he wanted to propose new punishments for human smuggling, child trafficking and sex trafficking as he vowed to “impose tough new sentences on illegal alien criminals.” Trump added that he would impose “death penalty with a quicker trial” for “anyone killing our police, sheriffs, border patrol, ICE or law enforcement officials.” Trump continued to stoke fears about undocumented immigrants and attacked Vice President Kamala Harris over the Biden administration’s handling of illegal immigration as he delivered remarks next to a section of the border wall in Montezuma Pass. The former president spoke while standing alongside family members of victims of violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The trip to the Arizona border, in which Trump repeated many false claims about immigration and Harris, coincided with the final day of the Democratic convention. The vice president is scheduled to address the convention in Chicago Thursday night. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to publicly acknowledge he lost the 2020 election and said he came up “just a little bit short,” despite regularly lying about the last presidential election he lost and falsely claiming it was rigged.  “I got many millions more votes than I got the first time but didn’t quite make it — just a little bit short,” Trump said during a campaign event at the US-Mexico border in Arizona. He still called the election “horrible” and said the US needed to “clean up” its elections. Trump regularly falsely claims there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and spreads election conspiracy theories.  Remember: The 2020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; and there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state. Vice President Kamala Harris’ Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech on the final night of the Democratic National Convention will pay tribute to one man who will not be present at the United Center: President Joe Biden. In remarks accepting her party’s nomination for the presidency, the vice president will honor the president, two sources familiar said. The sources declined to detail how Harris would speak about the president. Contents of Harris’ speech — which was “done” as of Thursday afternoon, according to a source – have been kept closely under wraps.  But expressing gratitude to the president would be a fitting way for the vice president to launch the most important speech of her political career. Had Biden not ended his presidential campaign just over a month ago before quickly endorsing Harris, it is entirely unclear how this year’s convention in Chicago would have unfolded, amid the intense pressure on the president to drop out. Biden, who spoke on the opening night of the convention, is vacationing in southern California. In their first joint event after Biden left the race, Harris described Biden as the “most extraordinary human being, and American, and leader.” Harris’ remarks tonight will also honor her mother, sources said. The vice president often speaks about her mother’s profound influence on how she sees the world. “She never asked anyone for permission to pursue her dreams, and that is why within one generation, I write to you as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president,” Harris said in the campaign’s first fundraising appeal after securing the nomination. Harris tonight plans to “tell her story or being raised by a working mother in a middle class neighborhood,” a campaign official said. One Democratic influencer said young people have been highly engaged with the upcoming presidential election online and that Vice President Kamala Harris’ digital presence is resonating with his age group. Harry Sisson, an NYU student and content creator who has been at the Democratic National Convention this week, said he noticed that the energy of this young voting bloc “just entirely flipped” when President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek reelection. He said just a few months ago when the race was a rematch between Biden and Donald Trump, they didn’t really care. In the spirit of that excitement, Sisson said there have been viral moments in the last few weeks carrying on the momentum for young Democrats. One was when Gov. Tim Walz’s son, Gus, emotionally reacted to parts of his father’s speech Wednesday night. “The Republicans who are insulting it, I think they’re jealous, and that kind of ties into why young people are excited about (the campaign). People crave the authenticity that Gov. Tim Walz and his family is bringing to the ticket,” he said. The final night of the Democratic National Convention will end on a celebratory note. A DNC official said there are 100,000 balloons tied to the rafters in the United Center that will be released after Vice President Kamala Harris finishes speaking. Teams of people inflated the red, white and blue balloons on the second level of the arena, then placed them in giant nets before they were hoisted up. An Arizona man accused of making threats against former President Donald Trump is now in custody, Cochise County public information officer Carol Capas told CNN Thursday.  Ronald Syvrud was taken into custody a little after 2:30 p.m. PT in Cochise County, but no other details are immediately available, Capas said. Remember: Syvrud threatened to kill Trump in multiple social media posts over the past couple weeks, according to Capas. Trump’s team was briefed about the search for the man by law enforcement before the former president arrived to the US-Mexico border for an event, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.  The 66-year-old is wanted on several outstanding warrants stemming from DUI charges, felony hit-and-run, and failing to register as a sex offender, a Thursday release from the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page states. Syvrud is a resident of Benson, Arizona, the release said, a city about 50 miles southeast of Tucson. Trump said earlier Thursday that he was unaware that the Secret Service was investigating an Arizona man who allegedly threatened Trump. The former president said he was “not that surprised” but that “I also have a job to do.” In an interview on the convention floor this afternoon, actress and poltiical activist Rosario Dawson told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins that she co-founded Voto Latino 20 years ago to encourage politicians to engage with Latino voters. Now, she said she hopes the Harris-Walz campaign — and potential presidency — will leverage the “unprecedented power” of the Latino vote. Dawson’s Voto Latino co-founder, Maria Teresa Kumar, spoke during the third night of the Democratic National Convention and coined the phrase: “When Latinos Vote, Democrats win.” Kamala Harris has proposed using tax credits to provide relief to middle class and lower-income Americans. Her plan revives or extends temporary measures that Joe Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of the president’s term. Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021. Her plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only for 2021. Plus, the proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. And Harris has also promised to end federal income taxes on tips, sparking Trump’s ire that she is copying his campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. The third night of the Democratic National Convention drew 20.2 million television viewers, surpassing the audience of last month’s Republican National Convention for a third consecutive night, according to Nielsen. The third night of the DNC featured speeches from former President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi and vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz, and was broadcast on 12 television networks. It marked the third straight night the DNC had drawn more than 20 million viewers.  The viewership edged out the 17.97 million viewers who tuned into the third night of the 2024 Republican National Convention, which included an address from GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, as well as speeches from Donald Trump Jr., Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Wednesday night’s DNC broadcast also fell short of the 22.8 million viewers who watched the third night of the 2020 Democratic convention, according to Nielsen. Among those who watched on television Wednesday night, MSNBC had the largest audience with 5.3 million viewers, followed by CNN with 3.3 million, ABC with 3.2 million, NBC with 2.6 million, CBS with 2.1 million, and Fox News with 1.9 million.  “The 18-34 [age] demographic has seen steady growth over each night of the DNC, with Wednesday’s audience up 13.5% from Monday night,” Nielsen said. Vice President Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night will have three overarching objectives, according to a campaign official: Harris spent much of the last day focusing on final speech preparations at her hotel in downtown Chicago. Sources say prior to this week, the vice president also practiced her delivery at Howard University in Washington. In what is undeniably the most important speech of her political speech on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, Harris will tell the story of a middle-class upbringing and how that background fueled her decision to become a prosecutor “in order to protect others,” the campaign official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive speech preparations, said.  The vice president will also delve into “Project 2025,” the conservative blueprint for a Trump second term at the White House, which the former president has tried to distance himself from. Harris will argue that “unlike Trump, who talks down our country,” she is “driven by a deep sense of patriotism and a desire to be a President for all Americans.” Sylvia Villagran’s workspace inside the United Center is incredibly small – about the size of a decent-sized walk-in closet. But her voice travels far – it’s heard by thousands inside the arena and by millions more around the world. Villagran is the public address announcer of the Democratic National Convention – sometimes referred to as the “Voice of God.” All week, she has been reading off names of major celebrities and Democrats as they come on stage, from former first lady Michelle Obama to Oprah Winfrey. From her seat inside a production center just off the main concourse, she watches the program from a monitor and listens for cues from the production team before opening up her microphone. Even though she isn’t actually in the room, she said “at the live events, there is a palpable feeling that you get that feeds you.” The official run of show is tightly guarded, and last-minute changes may be communicated with less than an hour’s notice, according to a source familiar with the process. While she would not reveal if she would be the one announcing Harris’ big moment or if someone on stage would, CNN pressed her to imagine a hypothetical scenario where that was the case. Villagran, a Democrat, says she relates to Harris as a Latina woman who rose to the top of a traditionally male-dominated industry. She estimates she has announced roughly the same number of men as women this week, which she views as a milestone. “I think it’s equal. And that’s, that’s historic. It’s equal. And it’s about time.” CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed reporting. The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October. After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Kamala Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.” The sympathy she expressed for Palestinians’ suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.” Harris emphasized the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. But when describing the potential ceasefire deal being negotiated, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.” Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in late July, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana. Read more about what Harris has said so far on other key issues. Former President Donald Trump told CNN’s Kristen Holmes Thursday that no plans had been made for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who is expected to end his campaign Friday — to appear at Trump’s campaign rally in Arizona later that day.   CNN reported Wednesday that there are current talks between Trump’s team and Kennedy’s orbit for the independent candidate to endorse the former president and appear at Trump’s Phoenix area rally that same night.   Trump said today he hadn’t spoken to Kennedy recently.  The former president added that he has “a lot of respect for RFK Jr.” Kamala Harris’ health care platform builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs. She is calling to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January. The three major insulin manufacturers in the US offer price caps or savings programs that lower the cost of insulin to $35 for many patients – a move Joe Biden pushed for in his State of the Union address last year. Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration just announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. Kamala Harris’ campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said that the vice president will use her speech Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention to highlight her biography and background, recognizing that the American people don’t know much about Harris. Dillon said Harris has been able to tap into energy and excitement, but added, “We know that the American people don’t know that much about the vice president.” Asked about the path to 270 electoral votes, Dillon insisted that their map is “much wider” than former President Donald Trump’s and said they have a real opportunity “with expansion targets,” mentioning North Carolina and Georgia. She said that the Harris campaign is not going to negotiate any other debates until Trump shows up for the September debate but said the vice president is willing to participate in more. Dillon assured that Harris would answer questions from the press by the end of the month. House Democrats insist voters are focused on the character and values of the candidates and Vice President Kamala Harris does not need to focus heavily on laying out a policy agenda as election day nears.   Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly said Americans don’t vote on policy prescriptions. Connolly added that at this juncture Harris must persuade people she is “someone I trust and have confidence in.” Similarly, Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams told CNN that voters aren’t looking for policy documents. Williams painted a contrast between former President Donald Trump and Harris, saying that “Harris is for thinking, looking toward the future and moving us out of the hatred and division of Donald Trump’s politics.” She added that GOP policy proposals, specifically Project 2025, is “not what the majority of Americans and Georgians are interested in.” Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee echoed those sentiments, saying the election will not turn on policy but rather character and values, and added that the “driving distinction” between Trump and Harris is character.  Vice President Kamala Harris taped three interviews this week at the Democratic National Convention, but none were with any of the 15,000 credentialed journalists here in Chicago. Instead, they were with social media influencers. The Harris campaign has recognized that reaching voters in the countdown to Election Day will require Democrats to go beyond a traditional media strategy and into new spaces. One piece of this strategy is creating its own content, including on the popular @KamalaHQ account across platforms. The other – and arguably more significant – piece is to harness the power of influencers. There is a plan in place, officials say, to reach Americans – and particularly young voters. And that is increasingly on social media platforms. There are multiple “creator lounges” across the United Center, spaces with mirrors and ring lights and charging stations where the creators, many of whom are longtime followers of one another but have never met in person, are networking and collaborating. These creators represent a vast swath of the internet – and, thus, a vast swath of followers. Read more here. Vice President Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech that she will deliver tonight at the Democratic National Convention is “done,” a source familiar tells CNN.  Of course, final tweaks and edits are possible until final moments before delivery.  Authorities are seeking an Arizona man accused of making threats against former President Donald Trump, a Cochise County spokesperson told CNN. Ronald Syvrud threatened to kill Trump in multiple social media posts over the past couple weeks, according to public information officer Carol Capas. She declined to name which platform the threats were made on. Trump’s team was briefed about the search for the man by law enforcement before the former president arrived to the US-Mexico border for an event in the state, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.  The 66-year-old is wanted on several outstanding warrants stemming from DUI charges, felony hit-and-run, and failing to register as a sex offender, a Thursday release from the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page states. Syvrud is a resident of Benson, Arizona, the release said, a city about 50 miles southeast of Tucson. It is unclear if Syvrud is still in Cochise County, and the sheriff’s office is asking for the public’s help in locating him. Trump is in Cochise County delivering remarks at the border. CNN has reached out to local law enforcement for further details. US Secret Service spokesperson Alexandria Worley said the agency “investigates all threats against our protectees.” “As this is an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further at this time,” Worley added. The post was updated with more details about the investigation. The speculation about a surprise guest on the closing night of the Democratic National Convention reached a fever pitch, with lawmakers joining into guessing game of whether Beyoncé would join the ranks of celebrities descending on Chicago to rally behind Vice President Kamala Harris.  At a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee briefing for donors and lobbyists on Thursday, a central question was whether Beyoncé would perform right before Harris delivers her acceptance speech. Beyoncé’s sensation “Freedom” has become a soaring anthem for Harris — in music and message — in the opening month of her presidential candidacy as she has drawn audiences of tens of thousands of supporters. Pink is set to sing “What About Us,” two officials familiar with convention planning tell CNN, while The Chicks are scheduled to perform the national anthem. But even with the anticipation running high for those musical stars, speculation about Beyoncé didn’t diminish in the hours before delegates made their way to the convention floor.  Convention officials, many of whom don’t know themselves about the closely held guest list, declined to comment. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Thursday spoke “very briefly” with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who the Ohio senator said is “100 percent” behind the Trump-Vance ticket, despite any prior disagreements with former President Donald Trump surrounding the fallout of the 2020 election. Vance said he’s “glad to have the governor’s supporter,” adding, “We want anybody who believes in common sense to join the ‘Trump train.’” Kemp told CNN in June he didn’t vote for Trump in the Republican primary, though he would support the Republican presidential ticket. Meanwhile, former Georgia Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan spoke at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night urging Republicans and independent voters to “Dump Trump.” Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance took cracks at Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, during a campaign event Thursday ahead of the final night of the Democratic National Convention. Vance poked fun at the late start time of Walz’s speech Wednesday — which did not begin until 11:22 p.m. ET — and criticized Harris’ record on key issues. “If you weren’t asleep at the beginning of the speech, you were sure as hell asleep by the end of the speech,” Vance said. CNN previously reported that after running significantly behind schedule Monday night, DNC organizers moved up the program start time on Tuesday. Vance claimed Walz was unable to speak to Harris’ accomplishments on cost-of-living issues or making the US more “peaceful and secure” because of her role in the current administration. “He couldn’t say that, because Kamala Harris has caused the very policies that have made Americans’ lives worse over the last few years,” Vance told reporters. “Her argument, and the argument of her surrogates, is, ‘We’re going to do things better when I get power.’ She’s had power for three and a half years, and she’s made everything worse.” Tonight, when Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage, she will be the first Black and Asian woman in history to address the Democratic National Convention as her party’s nominee for president. Despite the pressure, Black women see tremendous opportunity in this moment as Harris’ rise has become a remarkable source of encouragement for women in politics, they say. Tamia Booker, a Democratic strategist, said, “I know I’m going to be filled with emotion.” Meanwhile, LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said she hopes to hear an “acknowledgement of how we got here.” Harris’ identity is resonating with others who are mixed-race with Hillary Holley, executive director of Care in Action, saying she loves “the diversity she represents as herself.” Derrick Johnson, NAACP president and CEO, says two sentiments come to mind ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech at Democratic National Convention: “forward looking” and “inclusive.” Johnson has been in Chicago for the DNC all week as various speakers have built toward Harris’ speech Thursday night. “What I have witnessed is the leadership of those who care about democracy in this country standing up in ways to say in this moment, she’s the right person. That’s inspiring,” he said. He said he will be sitting in the audience “listening to what her vision will be for this country.”  Post-convention, Johnson said the NAACP’s focus will primarily be on turnout, regardless of political affiliation. “We’re an organization that exists in 47 of the 50 states. We want voters all across the country to be able to engage and participate,” he added. The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to revive parts of a Republican-backed Arizona law that could have barred thousands of voters from casting a ballot in the November presidential contest or voting by mail. The court left in place a hold against part of the law that required voters to document their US citizenship to vote in this year’s presidential election, but allowed the state to enforce other proof-of-citizenship requirements that will make it harder for voters to register for state and local elections. Proof of citizenship will be required for new voters using a state voter registration form. The Supreme Court handed down the decision in a short order without explanation, which is common for emergency appeals. Three conservatives — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — said they would have allowed more of the state’s proof-of-citizenship requirements to take effect. Four others — liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson and conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett — would have kept the all the contested provisions of the law on hold. Keep reading. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would meet with family members of people who were attacked or murdered by undocumented immigrants during his visit to the US-Mexico border in Arizona.  Trump again stoked fears about undocumented immigrants coming into the US and said, under a Harris presidency, America “WILL BE THE MOST DANGEROUS COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.” Trump’s pledges on immigration: The former president has promised an immigration crackdown if elected, adding that he would aim to deport 15 million to 20 million people, perhaps by using the National Guard. Trump also vowed to use the “Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.” For context: The flow of migrants, along with a series of high-profile criminal cases involving them, have contributed to concerns about crime — though criminologists are skeptical about the connection. Trump has repeated false claims that many migrants are former prisoners or have been institutionalized in their home countries. CNN has reported there is no data to support the idea that a rise in immigrants drives a rise in crime. Most measures of violent crime in the US have actually been falling. Trump promised mass deportations in 2016, too. And his immigration plans would likely face serious legal challenges. Read more of Trump’s campaign promises on immigration. High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give President Joe Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Vice President Kamala Harris may also face their wrath. As part of her economic agenda, Harris wants to counter the increase in food costs, which she argues stems in part from some big grocery chains that are keeping prices high even though their production costs have leveled off. To do so, she is calling for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries. She would also secure new authority for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and penalize companies that unfairly exploit consumers in the quest for excessive profits on food and groceries. Harris has echoed many of the same economic themes as Biden in campaign speeches, saying she wants to give Americans more opportunities to get ahead. She promised in a July rally to continue the Biden administration’s drive to eliminate so-called junk fees and to fully disclose all charges, such as for events, lodging and car rentals. “On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits,” she said. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. Former President Donald Trump’s Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club will host an “awards gala” next month to recognize the men who contributed to the “Justice for All” song and who were incarcerated for their role riot on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.   Trump has been invited to the September 5 event, which will be hosted by a pro-Trump PAC NEW GEN 47 and Vote Your Vision, as a guest speaker. As of now, it is unclear whether Trump would attend the event, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, adding Trump had not accepted the invitation to speak.   Some background: Trump most recently said he would pardon January 6 rioters who were convicted in an interview last month at the National Association of Black Journalists conference. Trump has regularly referred to those jailed for their role in the riot on the Capitol on January 6 as “hostages.” At 95 years old, Angie Gialoretto is the oldest delegate at the Democratic National Convention, while Isaac Winkler, 17, is the youngest. For a 2024 election that has been defined in many ways by the issue of age, both Winkler and Gialoretto believe their party is working for their respective generations — and both are excited by the prospect of electing the first woman president.  Gialoretto, who is from Pennsylvania, says she is “inspired” by Winkler and his generation. “I just love politics,” she said. Gialoretto added that this election year is an exciting time for her. “I struggled with my generation, but today you have such young intelligent people,” she said. She said that she had wanted to attend a convention at Winkler’s age, but it “never” seemed possible. She first attended a DNC in 1976 for Jimmy Carter, when she was 47 years old.  Winkler, who is from Minnesota, said Harris “stands for everything that is good in this country, and it’s inspirational to be here at the convention supporting her.” It’s also inspirational, he added, to be in the presence of someone like Gialoretto. “Thanks to you, the youth can come to the convention and have a voice. I want to say thank you so much to all the work you’ve done,” he told Gialoretto.   One day after violent clashes between Chicago police officers and some pro-Palestinian protesters ended in dozens of arrests, the city’s top cop said there were no arrests or injuries during Democratic National Convention protests Wednesday. The superintendent said Wednesday’s protests were very different from an altercation outside the Israeli consulate Tuesday, when more than 50 people were arrested. “The individuals who showed up on Tuesday came here strictly to commit crimes, to fight with the police and cause destruction to the city,” Snelling said. “That was not the focus of the group yesterday. They just wanted to be heard. And we allowed that to happen.”  During the largest Wednesday protest, a march that began at Union Park, some protesters stopped at L train stations to wave a Palestinian flag, but Snelling said no one was detained. “We were able to bring that situation down, deescalate it, and those people were released and were moved back into the march,” he said. “The marchers were very instrumental in helping us do that.” Remember: Israel’s war on Hamas following the group’s October 7 attacks has led to demonstrations across the US calling for an immediate ceasefire. Activists have been angered by the US’ continued military support for Israel as it bombards Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the enclave’s health ministry. In anticipation of large protests, authorities set up significant security operations around the United Center in Chicago ahead of the DNC. It was the ultimate display of the “Minnesota Goodbye.” The state’s governor, Tim Walz, had long finished his vice presidential acceptance speech Wednesday night and the United Center was largely empty – with the exception of a raucous group of Minnesotans on the convention floor. For almost a half hour after the third night of the Democratic National Convention had come to an end, a scrum of several dozen people remained gathered around the seating area designated for the Minnesota delegation. Chanting things like “We want Tim!” “Harris Walz!” and “Sleep when you’re dead,” the group — waving cutouts of the governor’s face — could not be deterred from their loud celebration. As videos of the moment circulated on social media, some Minnesotans began to joke that it was the “Minnesota goodbye” on full display. One Minnesotan source offered CNN this definition of the phenomenon: It is “when Minnesotans go to leave a party, they spend so much time going around and saying goodbye to each other, it’s essentially another party.” Watch the moment: Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff both marked their 10-year wedding anniversary with social media posts on Thursday, the same day Harris will accept her party’s historic presidential nomination.  “Happy anniversary, Dougie. I wouldn’t want to be on this journey with anyone but you,” Harris posted on social media with a photo of the couple. Emhoff shared a 40-second-long video with photos and videos of the two, concluding with a photo of them on their wedding day.  In his speech Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, the second gentleman talked about their upcoming anniversary and how each year, the vice president plays the “rambling” voicemail he left her before their first date.   “This Thursday will be our 10th wedding anniversary, which I know, I know it means I’m about to hear that embarrassing voicemail again. However, that’s not all I’ll be hearing. That same night, I’ll be hearing my wife, Kamala Harris, accept your nomination for president of the United States,” he said Tuesday. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is firing back at former President Donald Trump for calling him a “highly overrated Jewish Governor” in a social media post. Trump’s post also criticized Shapiro’s Democratic National Convention remarks, which he called a “bad and poorly delivered speech.” Shapiro countered that Trump’s comments show that he is “going to continue to be the hateful, divisive person that he’s always been.”   Shapiro added: “I think given his track record, he’s setting himself up for another defeat.” On one corner in Chicago, near the Democratic National Convention, anti-abortion protesters and a mobile Planned Parenthood clinic stand near a 20-foot inflatable IUD (intrauterine device). The giant faux contraceptive and the debate playing out nearby come as Democrats have made reproductive health care access a central part of their pitch to voters. CNN’s Sara Sidner breaks down the story behind it: The Harris campaign says it is “absolutely not” taking the votes of Arab Americans for granted, despite not having the Uncommitted National Movement represented on the convention stage this week.  “We’re absolutely not taking their votes for granted; I think as it relates to uncommitted delegates at this convention, and we’re proud, glad that they are here,” campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters.  He pointed to engagement with Uncommitted movement representatives “throughout the convention,” including a panel conversation and a recent brief meeting in a photo line between Vice President Kamala Harris and two of the movement’s leaders.   Harris is “committed to ending the violence, ending the conflict,” Tyler said, mentioning her advocacy for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid for Gaza.  He added: “It does stand in stark contrast to our opponent, whose only North Star is what benefits him, does not care about national security, does not care about global security. He’s only interested in his own personal self-interest.” Michigan Democrats are preparing to support one of their own when she takes the stage on Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s political group is passing out purple “I’m with Big Gretch” T-shirts, as well as pink foam models of Michigan boasting “Gretchen Whitmer fights like hell,” to delegates at breakfast this morning in preparation for their governor’s remarks. Detroit rapper Gmac Cash released a track called “Big Gretch” in 2020 to laud the governor’s Covid-19 response. Whitmer, who has made pink attire and lipstick a signature part of her personal style as governor, is due to address the DNC in the program ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ formal acceptance of the party’s nomination.  The Michigan governor spoke during the DNC’s mostly virtual convention in 2020, and was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address earlier that year, just before the former president was acquitted by the Senate in his first impeachment trial. Three former members of the shortlist to be Harris’s running mate — Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker — addressed the Michigan delegation on Thursday morning, each heaping praise on Whitmer for her leadership of the blue wall state. Whitmer, who was vetted during President Joe Biden’s running mate selection process, repeatedly ruled herself out of contention to join the ticket with Harris, saying she intends to serve out her term as governor through 2026. She remains a co-chair of Harris’ campaign and has vowed to help deliver battleground states for the Democratic ticket. The Harris campaign is extending an olive branch to “disaffected” voters who were considering supporting the independent presidential bid of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is expected to end his campaign on Friday and is in talks to endorse former President Donald Trump. Harris communications director Michael Tyler directed his message directly at “undecided voters, many of whom found a home with him in the early stages of this campaign,” saying: Tyler said the campaign would “do all the work necessary to court those voters.”  The Democratic National Convention is entering its fourth and final day with a “future” theme and a highly anticipated keynote address from its nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, convention executive director Alex Hornbrook said Thursday.  In addition to Harris, Thursday evening’s lineup includes: In her keynote remarks, Harris will share her personal biography, campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters. She will also go after her GOP opponent, former President Donald Trump. “On that stage tonight, you’ll see a champion for working people all across the country, a defender of our fundamental freedoms and a prosecutor who will make the case against Donald Trump,” Tyler said. Gwen Walz, the wife of Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz, is a genuine and authentic person, a colleague told CNN on Thursday. Augsburg University President Paul Pribbenow hired Gwen Walz to work at the school in 2019, and he has known her for more than a decade. “Their family is their foundation,” Pribbenow said, noting that they do meet on a regular basis for work and spend half of the time during those meetings talking about their respective families. “It is just who they are.” Pribbenow also discussed Gwen Walz’s reluctance to take on the first lady moniker when her husband was elected governor of Minnesota. “It wasn’t that she didn’t understand the ceremonial aspects that were to go along with the role, but they had truly been partners,” Pribbenow said. Pribbenow also said that the Walzes are no stranger to the spotlight and are adept at handling rhetoric being thrown at them. “They know what it’s like to have those kind of attacks, and they keep their head up and they keep going,” he said. Kamala Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. In January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic. On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. The Harris campaign has launched a new account on another social media platform, adding Twitch to its arsenal. Twitch is a live video streaming platform that is popular with video gamers, and also popular among young political influencers and commentators. The @KamalaHarris account is expected to stream Thursday night’s Democratic National Convention programming, a campaign official tells CNN, including Vice President Kamala Harris’ nomination address this evening. The new account marks another data point for the campaign’s efforts to reach voters, particularly young voters, in new places as Americans turn to new ways to consume news. As of 11 a.m. ET, the @KamalaHarris account had 355 followers. Hasan Piker, who is among the creators attending the DNC this week, is one of the most influential American political streamers on Twitch broadcasting daily to his almost 3 million followers. A progressive, Piker is anti-Trump but is still not fully committed to the Harris-Walz ticket. Former President Donald Trump reiterated his opposition to a federal abortion ban after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in his remarks at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday that Republicans “will ban abortion across this country, with or without Congress.”   In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump responded to the claim by Walz in his speech by insisting “there will not be a federal ban” while touting his role in appointing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.   More context: Throughout this most recent campaign, Trump has repeatedly ducked direct questions about abortion access, but he said in April that he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected to the White House again. That statement reversed what he said in 2016 when he was first running for the presidency and stood by during his time in office. The Chicks will perform the National Anthem on Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention, multiple sources have told CNN. The country music group – formerly known as the Dixie Chicks – are set to take the stage on the closing night of the DNC, to kick off the evening when Vice President Kamala Harris will make her speech. The Chicks performing at the National Anthem is a notable booking for the convention – not just because of country music’s historically conservative-leaning fanbases – but because of the band’s past that has infamously intertwined with politics. In 2003, before the invasion of Iraq, the band’s lead singer Natalie Maines said at a concert that the group, which got its start in Dallas, did not endorse the war and were “ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.” Their remarks about then-President George W. Bush triggered boycotts and backlash from fans, resulting in country stations across the country pulling the group’s music from the radio. At the time, in March 2003, CNN reported that “station managers said their decisions were prompted by calls from irate listeners who thought criticism of the president was unpatriotic.” This will not be the first convention appearance for The Chicks, who also performed at the virtual 2020 DNC during the pandemic. Read more about The Chicks appearance here. Gov. Tim Walz is appearing at the Minnesota delegation’s breakfast meeting in Chicago on Thursday, a Harris campaign official told CNN.  Walz and his wife, Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, are stopping by the delegation breakfast “to thank delegates for their support of the Harris-Walz ticket.” The visit comes after Walz introduced himself to voters last night as he accepted the vice presidential nomination and made his case for why Americans should head to the polls to defeat former President Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stress an approach to immigration in her remarks Thursday that balances border security and addressing immigrants who already reside in the United States, while casting her Republican rival’s policies as extreme, according to a source familiar with the preparations. Immigration has featured prominently in the 2024 presidential election. Democrats, grappling with years of border crises, have tried to flip the script on Republicans after the GOP blocked a bipartisan border measure this year and as the issue remains a cornerstone of former President Donald Trump’s campaign.  On Thursday, Trump will return to the southern border to hammer the administration over border security and place the blame on Harris, falsely claiming that she was the border czar, only hours before Harris takes the stage in Chicago.  A balanced approach to immigration, while not a novel argument, is an especially welcome one for advocates who have raised alarm over the Democratic Party’s enforcement-heavy border messaging in recent months. The Democratic Party’s platform, released this week, revealed the shift that’s unfolded over the last year.  In 2020, the party platform stressed the US “should be a beacon of hope for those who are suffering violence and injustice” and underscored protecting and expanding the existing asylum system, with no mention of asylum limits.  Four years later, the platform calls for strengthening the asylum system, quickly removing those who don’t have a legal basis to remain in the US and embracing Biden’s asylum crackdown.  Since Harris assumed the top of the ticket, allies and immigrant advocates have pushed her team to address not only border security but also the millions of undocumented immigrants in the US. The Harris campaign quickly went on the offensive on immigration in late July, citing her work prosecuting transnational gang members and the failed bipartisan border measure. Vice President Kamala Harris announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president after President Joe Biden withdrew from the ticket and endorsed her on July 21. Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris, who is age 59, grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California’s Bay Area. As a US senator, Harris was known for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings with Trump administration officials and nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Past experience: Harris is the current vice president and the highest-ranking female political official in US history. She previously served as a US senator, California attorney general and the San Francisco district attorney. Key policy issues: Harris’ initial campaign speeches offer some insights into her priorities, including on the economy. Like Biden, she intends to contrast her vision for America with Trump’s. She said the path forward will focus on lifting up working and middle-class Americans, enabling them to join unions, retire with dignity, live without the fear of gun violence and obtain affordable health care. Read more about Harris’ life and read up on the promises she’s made so far in her campaign. Kamala Harris has quickly started trying to counter Donald Trump’s attacks on her immigration record. Her campaign released a video in July citing support for increasing the number of Border Patrol agents and Trump’s successful push to scuttle a bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory. In June, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing crossings at the US-Mexico border – a policy that Harris’ campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, indicated in July to CBS News would continue under a Harris administration. Trump’s attacks stem from Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. She has only occasionally talked about her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. But she put her own stamp on the administration’s efforts, engaging the private sector. Harris pulled together the Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with regional leaders. Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments. Read about the promises Harris has made so far in her campaign. It’s the fourth and final day of the Democratic National Convention, where presidential nominee Kamala Harris is expected to speak. Here’s what happened on the first three days: Day 1: Passing the torch President Joe Biden told America: “I gave my best to you,” summing up his decadeslong career. He also slammed Donald Trump as he made the case for the party’s new presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. Notable speakers: Hillary Clinton cast Harris in the lineage of female political firsts as she praised the vice president’s leadership. Other notables included union leader Shawn Fain and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Abortion rights: Democrats lambasted Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who helped undo Roe v. Wade’s protections for abortion rights. Three women told stories about the state of reproductive care in the country in support of abortion rights, which has been Democrats’ most potent issue at the ballot box. Spotlight on Project 2025: Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow stepped onstage with a prop: a book containing “Project 2025” so big that it barely fit on the podium. Democrats are eager to tie Trump to what McMorrow called “a Republican blueprint for a second Trump term.” Though the former president has disavowed it, Democrats have framed the playbook for a second Trump term as his agenda. Day 2: Emhoff and the Obamas make their case Former President Barack Obama made a forceful case for Harris as president. He made many references to his own campaigns — including the “Yes we can” chants once omnipresent at Obama rallies, now returning as “Yes she can.” He followed former first lady Michelle Obama, who declared that “hope is making a comeback” and delivered perhaps her most frank and public comments about the racism her family faced during their time in the White House — often perpetuated by Trump. She also made a personal appeal for everyone to “do something” between now and Election Day. Second gentleman: Doug Emhoff talked about his relationship with Harris as he praised her role as a stepmom to his children. Harris was not at the convention but symbolically accepted her historic presidential nomination in a video appearance from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she was campaigning. This came after a rollicking roll call in Chicago, in which DJ Cassidy played tracks for each state, and there was a surprise appearance from Lil Jon for Georgia as he performed “Turn Down for What” and “Get Low.” GOP speakers show up: Former Republicans made the case for Independents and Trump critics to vote for Harris, including Mayor John Giles of Mesa and Arizona, former Trump aide Stephanie Grisham. Day 3: Walz in the spotlight With plenty of football analogies, Walz highlighted his upbringing and his work in his address. He also talked about his wife’s fertility struggles. Walz outlined what a Harris presidency would look like, including cutting taxes for the middle class and making housing more affordable, and worked to tie the Republican ticket to Project 2025. Notable speakers: Former President Bill Clinton vouched for Harris and levied pointed attacks at Trump, saying “he mostly talks about himself. Oprah Winfrey called on fellow Independent and undecided voters to “choose common sense over nonsense” and vote based on values and character. House Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also spoke for Harris. Downplaying Israel’s war in Gaza: The conflict remains one of the most fraught US foreign policy issues. There had been barely any mention of it, except when Biden spoke about Gaza, showing sympathy for those killed. But on day three, the parents of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin spoke about their “anguish and misery.” Hours after their speech, the Uncommitted National Movement was told that their request for a speaking spot had been denied. Members reacted by staging a sit-in outside the United Center. Kamala Harris has helped America see joy and now she needs to make America see a president. Her speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night will represent her most exacting test yet in a dizzying month that rocketed her to the threshold of an historic presidency that could reshape American politics. The vice president will offer the country a new beginning and a chance to move to a different place — beyond the prolonged funk brewed by years of Donald Trump’s dark rhetoric and public exhaustion after a once-in-a-century pandemic and consequent and punishing high prices. More broadly, she’s proposing to restore the elusive lightness and optimism to American life and to reclaim the concept of “freedom” from conservatives, encompassing everything from reproductive rights to new economic relief for the working and middle classes, to access to health care and safety from mass shootings. Her party is calling on Harris to ascend to the next level of the political stratosphere after advanced age ended President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. No modern presidential nominee of any major party has faced such a tough assignment in so short a time. Read the full analysis. Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan – an Air Force veteran – called Republican criticisms of vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s military record “abhorrent.”  Houlahan told Kasie Hunt on CNN This Morning that she believed the GOP was “running scared … they don’t know what to do with themselves.”  “There is no there there,” she said. The congresswoman, who represents suburbs of Philadelphia in Chester County, explained that despite the fact her district is split between 40% Democrats, 40% Republicans and 20% Independents, she’s a Democrat who has succeeded in winning her races. Houlahan said her constituents embrace the “civility” and “joyfulness” she has tried to embody on the trail in the past and that has also been promoted at the Democratic National Convention. “We cannot take anything for granted,” she urged.  Taylor Swift didn’t endorse former President Donald Trump last weekend. Ryan Reynolds wasn’t photographed wearing a pro-Kamala Harris shirt. And the Communist Party USA never backed President Joe Biden’s now-defunct campaign.  But these false claims about the 2024 campaign, and dozens of other posts with similar fake endorsements, have exploded on social media in the run up to the election, according to researchers at the News Literacy Project, a nonpartisan education group that launched a new database Thursday chronicling more than 550 unique instances of election-related misinformation. The latest and most visible example these bogus claims emerged Sunday, when Trump shared a post on his Truth Social platform containing images created with the use of artificial intelligence that suggested a groundswell of support from Swift fans calling themselves “Swifties for Trump.” In response to the implied endorsement from the pop icon, Trump wrote, “I accept!” Swift, who previously assailed Trump as “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism” during his presidency, endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but has not yet backed a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. The News Literacy Project says it has launched its misinformation database Thursday to raise awareness of viral falsehoods that it believes pose an “existential threat to democracy” and are best examined through bulk analysis of hundreds of examples, instead of individual fact-checks.  Read more about how fake celebrity endorsements are becoming the latest weapon in misinformation wars. Tim Walz introduced his life and background to Americans on the third night of the Democratic National Convention after he accepted the party’s nomination for vice president. He started with his life, growing up in Butte, Nebraska, “a town of 400 people.” “I had 24 kids in my high school class, and none of them went to Yale,” he said in an apparent swipe at his Republican rival JD Vance, who is a Yale alumnus. Walz said he grew up learning to take care of his neighbors in Butte and looking out for them, which instilled in him a “responsibility to contribute.” “For me, it was serving in the Army National Guard. I joined up two days after my 17th birthday, and I proudly wore our nation’s uniform for 24 years,” he said. Walz shared that his dad, a Korean war veteran, died of lung cancer and left behind “a mountain of medical debt.” “Thank God for social security survivor benefits. And thank God for the G.I. Bill that allowed my dad, and me, to go to college, and millions of other Americans,” he said. He then traced his life to teaching and coaching football — ultimately winning a state championship. While she appeared briefly at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night and traveled to Milwaukee with running mate Tim Walz for a campaign event on the second night of the event, Kamala Harris’ team cleared her public schedule on Wednesday so she could focus on practicing and making final edits to her speech. In the final hours, her focus has largely been on perfecting the delivery of her speech, sources said, by trying to anticipate how the audience will receive and feel every line. This week also provided ample opportunity for Harris to spend time with her family – including members of her husband’s family – who have all descended on Chicago for this week’s political festivities. Some of those family members have provided input on her speech.  Even though Harris has been vice president for three-and-a-half years, she still views her Thursday night speech as “her introduction to America in her own voice,” advisers told CNN.  Something else she did Wednesday night: call Tim Walz before his speech to wish him good luck. Kamala Harris has committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. She has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announced $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs, and other aid for the war-torn country last month. At the Munich Security Conference this year, Harris said: “More broadly, NATO is central to our approach to global security. For President Biden and me, our sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad. And I do believe, as I have said before, NATO is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.” Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. Leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement began a sit-in outside the Democratic convention Wednesday night after being told by party officials that they would not get a speaking slot at the gathering. Co-founder Abbas Alawieh, whose group emerged during the Democratic presidential primary to marshal protest votes against the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza after the October 7 attacks, told reporters he received a call from a convention official Wednesday night, saying, “Abbas, the answer is no.” Alawieh, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan, then sat down on the concrete outside the United Center, with images of Kamala Harris shining out over him, and said he would not leave the spot until the vice president and convention organizers reversed their decision. He was quickly joined by other uncommitted delegates and, toward the end of the program, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar briefly joined the group. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also expressed support for the group on social media and urged the DNC to reverse its decision. Besides a speaking slot, movement leaders also had other asks, including for a US government arms embargo against Israel, that were rejected out of hand by Democratic leaders. Read the full story. Hefty debt loads, which hurt people’s ability to buy homes, get car loans, or start small businesses, are also an area of interest to Kamala Harris. In her economic plan, she pledged to work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign. Harris has been a leader in the White House’s efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, noting that those with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those who don’t have unpaid medical bills. As vice president, she has promoted the Biden administration’s initiatives on student debt, which have so far forgiven more than $168 billion for nearly 4.8 million borrowers. In July, Harris said that “nearly 950,000 public servants have benefitted” from student debt forgiveness, compared with only 7,000 when Biden was inaugurated. A potential Harris administration could keep that momentum going – though some of Joe Biden’s efforts have gotten tangled up in litigation, such as a program aimed at cutting monthly student loan payments for roughly 3 million borrowers enrolled in a repayment plan the administration implemented last year. Here’s what Harris has said about other key issues. At the party’s convention Wednesday night, Democrats displayed a “joy” strategy, portraying Vice President Kamala Harris as the candidate who can move the nation forward. Here are six takeaways from the night: Tim Walz, the happy warrior, introduces himself: Before his selection as Harris’ running mate, he’d never delivered a speech in front of a national audience or used a teleprompter. He introduced himself as a coach, a teacher, a hunter, and a neighbor as he made the case that Democrats are the party of freedom. Oprah portrays Harris as “the best of America”: Talk show legend Oprah Winfrey said Harris is poised to make history and that soon, Americans will teach their children how the child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father grew up to be a US president. “That is the best of America,” she said. “For the people” vs. “Me, myself and I”: Bill Clinton framed the election as a choice between Harris being “for the people” or Donald Trump being “about me, myself and I.” Clinton used his speech to cast Trump as self-obsessed and Harris as a clean break from the drama that encompasses the former president. Trump “mostly talks about himself,” Clinton said. Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow: Several of the party’s aging figures, including Clinton, acknowledged the twilight of their influence and urged voters to usher in new leaders. Clinton, 78, told the crowd that he’s been to every Democratic National Convention since 1972 and has “no idea how many more of these I’ll be able to come to.” Hostage’s parents share ‘agony on all sides’ of Israel-Hamas war: The parents of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, shared their “anguish and misery” in one of the night’s most poignant moments. The two also acknowledged the deaths of civilians in Gaza, saying “there is a surplus of agony on all sides” of the war. Hours after their speech, leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement, which has criticized Biden’s mishandling of Israel’s war in Gaza, were told that their request for a speaking spot had been denied. Members reacted by staging a sit-in outside the venue. Capitol police officer says Trump “betrayed us”: Defending democracy remains a key theme for the campaign, as highlighted by Aquilino Gonell, a former US Capitol Police sergeant, who said that Trump “summoned our attackers” who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Read more takeaways. Vice President Kamala Harris prepared for the highest-profile moment of her political life from a hotel suite in downtown Chicago, readying herself for an opportunity to turn the swell of momentum on which she arrived at the Democratic National Convention this week into a movement that propels her into the Oval Office. The enormous stakes are not lost on Harris, who has been thinking about her speech for several weeks. From nearly the moment President Joe Biden removed himself from the top of the Democratic ticket, she has been formulating the argument she hopes to make in her speech tonight. Harris has never been regarded as one of the party’s master speechmakers. Yet her prosecutorial elocution and distillation of policy into understandable terms has helped her galvanize massive crowds since launching her candidacy. Though Harris has been vice president for more than three years, advisers believe Americans are unaware of large parts of her biography. All week in Chicago, pieces of her background have been sprinkled into speeches, with her campaign hoping to help define her on its terms – as a prosecutor, a fighter, and a daughter of a single middle-class mother. According to several Democratic aides and others involved in her speech preparation, Harris has refined the text extensively, working in part from the stump speech she delivers, almost verbatim, at her campaign rallies. At the Park Hyatt Chicago, where she is staying this week, she has practiced extensively and consulted with aides and family members in refining a speech meant to act as a high-profile introduction to American voters. Read the full story. Pink has been tapped for a closing night performance by the Democratic National Convention, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. Pink will perform ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris taking the stage for the most significant speech of her political career. This will be the first major politically set performance for Pink, who has been outspoken about causes she is passionate about throughout her career. Pink has been a longtime advocate of the LGBTQ community and women’s rights and has supported organizations that align with Democratic issues, including Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign and more. In 2022, the pop superstar released a music video for her song “Irrelevant” that touched on racism and sexism in America. The video features images that reflect reproductive health care, civil rights and racial tensions. In the song, Pink sings: “Girls just wanna have rights. So, why do we have to fight?” Pink has made clear that she does believe artists should stay silent regarding their politics, even if it draws criticism. When Roe v. Wade was overturned, the best-selling artist spoke out on social media. In 2023, Pink teamed up with PEN America, a free expression advocacy organization, to give away thousands of banned books at her concerts in Florida, where she said free speech and LGBTQ rights were under attack. “I read banned books!” Pink said on an Instagram Live with the non-profit in November 2023. CNN has reached out to representatives for Pink. A spokesperson for the DNC did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz introduced himself to America on the biggest political stage of his career Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention. The speaker lineup also featured other well-known faces in the Democratic Party, including former President Bill Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The convention leaned into its “fight for our freedoms” theme, featuring speakers that highlighted the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and reproductive rights.

How the Biden-to-Harris switch turbocharged the presidential money race | CNN Politics,"Published 10:06 AM EDT, Fri August 23, 2024",2024-08-23T14:06:54.737Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/president-money-race-harris-trump/index.html,"The dramatic change at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket unleashed a flood of donations to the campaign account Kamala Harris inherited from Joe Biden, swamping even Donald Trump’s strongest fundraising days, a CNN analysis of newly filed campaign reports shows. Over the three-day period in July that covered Biden’s withdrawal from the White House race and the rapid consolidation of Democratic support for his vice president, Harris’ principal campaign committee took in more than double what Trump’s campaign account reported collecting in the three days surrounding his felony conviction in New York, according to the review of contributions that total more than $200 this cycle. The donor enthusiasm for Harris’ surprise candidacy has quickly eroded the cash advantage Trump once held. The Harris campaign had previously announced collecting a whopping $310 million in July through its joint fundraising efforts with aligned Democratic Party committees – far exceeding the nearly $139 million that the Trump political operation said it had brought in last month. A Harris campaign official said Tuesday the team expected to cross the $500 million mark in fundraising in the coming days. The CNN review examined sums raised by each candidate’s main campaign committee – a valuable resource in politics because those committees by law must receive discounts on television advertising, giving candidate-controlled money a greater impact than donations to parties and outside groups."
Analysis: Harris gives Americans the chance to make history | CNN Politics,"Published 1:43 AM EDT, Fri August 23, 2024",2024-08-23T05:43:09.387Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/kamala-harris-americans-history-analysis/index.html,"Kamala Harris promised Americans a future that neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden could deliver, showing how profoundly she has changed the 2024 election. The first Black woman to claim a major party nomination on Thursday styled her “unlikely journey” to the Democratic nod as the springboard to lift the country to a new place after years being torn apart by its bitter divides. The vice president, who no one thought would be the candidate even five weeks ago, offered voters a clear choice in a steady and patriotic Democratic National Convention address in Chicago. Americans can take the road of “chaos and calamity” in a new term under Trump, whom she called “an unserious man” who nevertheless poses a “serious threat” to democracy and basic American freedoms. Or, Harris said, the country can recommit to values that she evoked in detailing her upbringing as a daughter of immigrants nurtured by a loving California community of unofficial aunts, epitomized by “Freedom. Opportunity. Compassion. Dignity. Fairness. And endless possibilities.” Instead of Trump’s American carnage and threats of retribution, Harris is presenting herself as the catalyst for America’s quintessential capacity to renew itself. The vice president leveraged her past as a prosecutor, pledging to always be “for the people” while accusing the Republican nominee of serving “the only client he has ever had: Himself.” “With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past,” she said. “So, let’s get out there and let’s fight for it. Let’s get out there and let’s vote for it. And together, let’s write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.” But Harris, the sudden wildcard candidate now topping the Democratic ticket, is not just offering a break from Trump. She is also conjuring possibilities that were beyond Biden. Overtaken by the ravages of age at the CNN debate in Atlanta, the 81-year-old president could neither convincingly evoke the future nor present himself as the implementer of change that so many Americans crave. Harris, who is seeking to meet her moment despite a vice presidency that rarely soared, had not previously offered evidence that she could be a transformational political figure. But Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPac, a Black-led advocacy organization, explained that Harris was offering a chance for “America to become its best self” after years of discord. “What are our aspirations? Who do we believe ourselves to be? How do we understand the highest ideals of this country in terms of a multi-racial democracy?” “It’s been eight years of chaos, of destabilization, and Joe Biden became a transition point. And I think what we’re seeing right now (is) that people are saying, ‘We can be better than the worst version of ourselves,’ which they attribute to the Trump campaign and the Republican Party,” Shropshire said in an interview. Harris leaves her convention with an exuberant, united party behind her. Democrats are electrified by the metamorphosis of the ticket, backed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who has become America’s coach. Trump wrapped his own nominating party a month ago certain that his felony-defying White House comeback bid was on course. But Harris’ rise saddled him with huge problems, as he frets over her crowds and bemoans his vanished polling leads but won’t forsake insult politics for the issues that could win him back the White House. Yet all conventions are self-reinforcing bubbles. For Democrats, preaching joy and partying with celebrities is a risk with many people hurting after years of high prices, economic insecurity and as America’s foreign foes mock its power. Harris and Democrats offered hope, happiness and harmony, with promises of lower prices and more housing. Yet her convention was also a festival of style over substance. Harris, who has so far avoided one-on-one interviews and swing state town halls, hasn’t explained how she’d widen access to health care, prescription drugs, affordable housing, cheaper child care, quell corporate greed or save the environment. Voters now know more about second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s rambling voicemail before their blind date and Walz’s high school football plays than how Harris would counter China. That policy vacuum, as well as the contempt for Trump that radiated for four days, may offer a lifeline to the Republican campaign and the hopes of an ex-president who turned victimhood and a persecution complex into a potent political force. He’s seeking to portray Harris’ proposed use of government to forge social outcomes and to cap grocery store prices as Venezuela-style socialism. “That dark message really doesn’t gel at all with the idea that somehow the Democrats are the joyful party,” Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told CNN’s Jake Tapper Wednesday. “There’s a lot of attacks on Donald Trump, a lot of criticism of what he’s done and what he’s said. Not a whole lot of positive vision for how Kamala Harris is going to fix the problems that plague the country.” It’s important for campaigns to be honest about policy — not just so voters know what they are voting for, but to construct a foundation for the presidency that Harris hopes to lead once the euphoria of the campaign subsides. Yet elections are also won by emotion, poetry and candidates who offer themselves as inspirational vessels on which voters can imprint their aspirations. This year, a message that proffers voters a way to end Trump’s eight years of daily assaults on the national psyche may get Harris to the 50%-plus threshold needed to win the White House — a level the GOP nominee has never reached. Still, scratch the happiness rocking the United Center this week and fear of old defeats lurk, especially that of 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton to Trump. Party elders warned Democrats that joy doesn’t necessarily equate to votes. Former President Bill Clinton, clearly still haunted by the election that could have made his wife president, warned: “We’ve seen more than one election slip away from us when we thought it couldn’t happen.” And former President Barack Obama cautioned Democrats that as they lambast Trump, they should not disrespect his supporters, apparently seeking to avoid any repeat of the “deplorables” terminology used by the former secretary of state eight years ago. “If a parent or grandparent occasionally says something that makes us cringe, we don’t automatically assume they’re bad people,” Obama said Tuesday night. “We recognize that the world is moving fast, that they need time and maybe a little encouragement to catch up. Our fellow citizens deserve the same grace we hope they’ll extend to us.” Democratic leaders will view their convention as a success. For three days, the party’s former presidents, first ladies and its future stars sketched a character profile of Harris, who once flipped Big Macs while in college, as a champion of the working and middle classes. They painted a blend of joy and toughness of a nominee, who, along with her small-town Midwestern dad running mate Walz, gets ordinary Americans and feels their sticker shock when they fill their grocery carts. The convention also ushered Biden off the stage, avoiding damaging splits and completing a generational switch. While in vacation in California, he’s barely been heard from since — allowing Harris to emerge as a distinct political force and to run as a candidate of change even as an incumbent member of a battered administration. The scenes inside the hall didn’t just epitomize a party feeling political deliverance after Biden’s exit, they showcased its diverse, young and female rising leaders. This gave base voters whom Harris needs a reason to show up in November that many lacked with Biden topping the ticket. And by keeping pro-Palestinian demonstrations at a distance, Democrats dodged a sequel to the 1968 Chicago convention and avoided bolstering GOP narratives of a nation ripped apart. This convention’s tightly choreographed last three days also revealed critical new shifts in a turbulent campaign already marked by unprecedented courtroom dramas, an assassination attempt and the eclipse of a president. Democrats reengineered their case against Trump for the final stretch. While Biden preferred a lofty conceit that the GOP nominee’s anti-democratic impulses stain the “soul of the nation,” the Obamas and the Clintons savaged Trump with mockery, belittling him as a small and ridiculous man unworthy of a vote. Obama, demonstrating his undimmed hold on his party eight years after leaving power, dissed Trump’s grating societal impact as akin to an annoying neighboring constantly running his leaf blower. “From a neighbor, that’s exhausting. From a president, it’s just dangerous.” Former first lady Michelle Obama, meanwhile, cast Trump as a racist product of White billionaire affirmative action who didn’t understand that the presidency may be a “Black job.” And a venerable Bill Clinton, who celebrated his 78th birthday in Chicago, relished being younger than Trump, turning the tables in the age debate that powered Trump’s campaign when Biden was the nominee. The Chicago gathering also sharpened the party’s doctrine — countering Republican charges that it’s turning into a Venezuela-style socialist clone — by coopting conservative and libertarian language to redefine the concept of “freedom.” Democrats hear “freedom” and see rights on which conservatism encroached – reproductive and voting rights and the liberty to go to school without fear of being gunned down. One of the biggest impediments in recent years to a sense of freedom has been the punishing aftermath of the pandemic and high inflation fueled by some of the big-spending Biden administration emergency relief programs. In lambasting supermarket giants, Harris also cemented her populist reboot on economics. It’s a dual strategy intended to mitigate her biggest weakness — her association with high inflation during the Biden administration — and to court rural working-class voters and suburban voters who could decide swing state races. But the economy, like immigration, remains a vulnerability for Harris, which is one reason why despite Trump’s unpopularity, the election remains a toss-up Walz warned Wednesday night: “Team, it’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal. But we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball.” Now with the convention over, Harris must prove she can become a singular political figure worthy of the past four days of tributes who can drive her party to victory. The next test comes on September 10 at her critical first debate with Trump. In the words of the advertising slogan that epitomized Michael Jordan, the greatest athlete to peform in the arena where she spoke, it’s now time for Harris and her supporters to “Just do it.”"
"Harris says bloodshed in Gaza is devastating, emphasizes support for hostage and ceasefire deals | CNN Politics","Published 1:21 AM EDT, Fri August 23, 2024",2024-08-23T05:21:18.973Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/politics/gaza-israel-harris-convention-speech/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris called for the Palestinian people to be able to “realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination” while reiterating her support for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas during her remarks here Thursday at the Democratic National Convention. Harris said that as president, she would maintain the US alliance with Israel and “ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.” She condemned the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas but also acknowledged the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza amid Israel’s military operation in the enclave. “What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” More than 40,000 people have been killed Gaza since October 7, according to the local health ministry. Harris’ remarks Thursday are largely in line with what has been the Biden administration’s position on the conflict – though the vice president did not mention the United States’ role in arming Israel. Still, her remarks still represented the most that Harris has said on the issue in front of such a large audience and her most fulsome comments in support of Palestinian self-determination since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have expressed support for a two-state solution. Coming into Thursday, pro-Palestinian activists had repeatedly pushed for representatives of their cause to play a role in the convention’s proceedings as other protesters surrounded the streets of Chicago and marched on the convention throughout the week. Protests outside the United Center accused Harris and Democrats of not going far enough to attain a lasting ceasefire. Leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement, which emerged during the Democratic presidential primary to marshal protest votes against the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza, asked the Harris campaign to allow them a speaking spot at the convention, and the group led a sit-in outside the convention after the campaign turned those requests down. The uncommitted delegates entered the venue for Harris’ speech Thursday, effectively ending the sit-in, and her speech appeared to go off without interruption from pro-Palestinian protesters. The delegates issued another demand to the Harris campaign, though: Come to Michigan and other swing states and talk to Palestinian American families by September 15. “I think it would be disastrous to her campaign and disastrous to continue alienating the core base of her own constituents that she needs in November in order to combat fascism and authoritarian that are on the ballot,” said Uncommitted co-founder Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American and the sister of Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. The group’s leaders criticized the DNC and the Harris campaign for rejecting what they perceived as a modest or symbolic request in denying a speaking slot for a Palestinian American at the convention. Still, Elabed said the delegates had no plans to disrupt the proceedings ahead of or during Harris’s acceptance speech. Other activists gathered outside the convention argued that Democratic Party leaders had only hurt their own cause by denying Uncommitted leaders’ ask for a speaking slot. “I feel bad for them because they’re out of step with the majority of the Democratic base,” Uncommitted co-founder Abbas Alawieh said. “The majority of Democratic voters believe that Palestinian human rights are a priority alongside every other priority we have.”"
Influencers get prime DNC access as part of Harris’ campaign strategy | CNN Politics,"Published 3:47 PM EDT, Thu August 22, 2024",2024-08-22T19:47:15.779Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/22/politics/content-creators-influencers-dnc-harris/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris taped three interviews this week at the Democratic National Convention, but none were with any of the 15,000 credentialed journalists here in Chicago. Instead, they were with social media influencers, including Vidya Gopalan, a North Carolina mom known to her 3.4 million TikTok followers as @queencitytrends. Gopalan, who largely posts lifestyle content, asked Harris to reflect on their shared Indian heritage and her memories of spending time in India with her grandfather. The video, posted Tuesday, has more than 1.9 million views. That engagement represented a recognition from the Harris campaign that reaching voters in the countdown to Election Day will require Democrats to go beyond a traditional media strategy and into new spaces. One piece of this strategy is creating their own content, including on the popular @KamalaHQ account across platforms. The other – and arguably more significant – piece is to harness the power of influencers. There is a plan in place, officials say, to reach Americans – and particularly young voters. And that is increasingly on social media platforms. “You have to meet the voters’ eyeballs and ears where they are – and where they are is at their lunch, during their lunch breaks, scrolling through their phone. They are sitting on the subway, scrolling through their phone. They are on the couch with the TV on with CNN, maybe on mute, scrolling through their phone. They’re walking their dog, looking at their phone,” said Alex Pearlman, a self-described “ranting comedian” known on as @pearlmania500 TikTok, where he has 2.7 million followers. Pearlman is among the 200 content creators credentialed for the DNC this week, marking an unprecedented effort by Democrats to engage this community. There are multiple “creator lounges” across the United Center, spaces with mirrors and ring lights and charging stations where the creators, many of whom are longtime followers of one another but have never met in person, are networking and collaborating. They are on the convention floor on a special “creator platform,” prime real estate for viewing each night’s events. And they are meeting and interviewing top Democratic surrogates – including Harris herself. The creators represent a vast swath of the internet – and, thus, a vast swath of followers. Some of them have long been political, like Carlos Eduardo Espina, who posts immigration-focused content, or Olivia Julianna, who focuses on reproductive rights and other Democratic issues. But also on hand are cooking influencers, beauty experts, comedians and sports creators. “The DNC realizes if a bunch of people have millions of followers, if you bring 200 of them together, the reach is amplified,” said Nimay Ndolo, a current-events comic with 3.5 million followers across platforms. But it’s a mutually beneficial relationship. Keith Edwards, a Democratic strategist with a 550,000-strong following who interviewed Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this week, said, “Exclusivity is the name of the game. So us being here and getting access only helps us grow. It only helps them, and only helps us help them, being here,” predicting “exponential” growth for this type of engagement in future conventions. Having access to voices like Buttigieg, he said, “legitimizes me … and also helps him get eyeballs, and then also helps me expand my audience.” In conversations with more than a dozen content creators in Chicago this week, the influencers roundly praised the Harris campaign’s outreach as a model for Democrats. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising Democratic star who was on Harris’ vice presidential short list, has also been “really impressed” with the state of her digital organization. “The burden is not on the Pennsylvanian to find the Harris campaign. The burden is on the Harris campaign to find that voter. And they’re doing an exceptional job of that: knocking on doors and showing up on your ‘For You Pages,’” Shapiro told CNN. And for many Gen Z influencers, the week has offered an opportunity to instill some humanity in the political process. “Social media and speaking directly to the people humanizes them in a lot of ways that they don’t realize. We’re just kind of disillusioned with a lot of institutions. We’ve grown up, especially Gen Z, watching these institutions fail us in so many different ways,” Awa Sanneh, a 23-year-old with 503,000 followers who posts on a range of topics, from the Black Lives Matter movement to her outfit of the day. Beyond just influencers, the groundswell of support in the immediate days after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee brought with it something difficult to purchase or build: a coolness factor, from coconut tree memes to the ubiquity of the candidate on social media feeds. “It is really cool to talk about Kamala Harris on the internet right now,” deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a recent interview. “The volume of folks who are posting, who have lots and lots of followers, gives people who share content with their friends and family more coverage to do it themselves.” And in a sign of the energy and enthusiasm for the new candidate, multiple creators CNN spoke with said they would not have been as eager to attend a convention for President Joe Biden. “I don’t know that I have a definitive answer for you,” said Raven Schwam-Curtis, a Black and Jewish educator posting to 220,000 followers. “But I will say I’m very energized and excited, and it was a very easy yes to say yes to coming to this.” For Schwam-Curtis, though, the question remains whether the enthusiasm for Harris can translate into action at the ballot box. “It’s been cutesy and it’s been demure – but to what extent will the memeification of Kamala Harris get Gen Z to the polls?” Schwam-Curtis said."
Harris readies herself for biggest moment of her political life | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:54 PM EDT, Thu August 22, 2024",2024-08-22T08:00:02.448Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/22/politics/kamala-harris-dnc-speech/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris prepared for the highest-profile moment of her political life from a hotel suite in downtown Chicago, readying herself for an opportunity to turn the swell of momentum on which she arrived at the Democratic National Convention this week into a movement that propels her into the Oval Office. The enormous stakes are not lost on Harris, who has been thinking about her speech for several weeks. From nearly the moment President Joe Biden removed himself from the top of the Democratic ticket, she has been formulating in her mind the argument she hopes to make on the final night of the convention. Harris has never been regarded as one of the party’s master speechmakers. Yet her prosecutorial elocution and distillation of policy into understandable terms has helped her galvanize massive crowds since launching her candidacy less than a month ago. Harris has been vice president for more than three years, but advisers believe Americans are unaware of large parts of her biography. All week in Chicago, pieces of her background have been sprinkled into one speech after another, with her campaign hoping to help define her on its terms – as a prosecutor, a fighter, a daughter of a single middle-class mother and more. She is expected to hit those touch points and more in her address Thursday. According to several Democratic aides and others involved in her speech preparation, Harris has refined the text extensively, working in part from the stump speech she delivers, almost verbatim, at her campaign rallies. At the Park Hyatt Chicago, where she is staying this week, she has practiced at length and consulted with aides and family members in refining a speech meant to act as a high-profile introduction to American voters. Since arriving in Chicago on Sunday evening, Harris has spent the daytime hours behind closed doors, working with her team on the address. She emerged on Monday to attend the first night of the convention and Tuesday evening to fly to Milwaukee for a campaign rally. On Wednesday, she joined Biden on a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as negotiators in the Middle East worked to salvage talks toward a hostage and ceasefire deal – a reminder of the day job she must now balance as she formally assumes the Democratic nomination. But mostly, she has been consulting her team, which includes speechwriters but also senior advisers such as her chiefs of staff Lorraine Voles and Sheila Nix, as well as family members such as her husband, Doug Emhoff. Since the day Biden extinguished his presidential bid a month ago, Harris’ convention speech has been an almost daily focus, with time built into her schedule to lay out themes of the address to a small circle of advisers. Adam Frankel, who has worked since 2021 as an adviser to the vice president, has taken a leading role in writing her address. Frankel, 43, was on the speechwriting team for former President Barack Obama and spent years studying the historic speeches of John F. Kennedy while he worked as a researcher for Ted Sorensen, a longtime confidant and wordsmith for the late president. “This notion that eloquence has a real role in public life, that eloquence can mobilize people to bring about real change, is something that obviously is one of his great contributions and something we’re trying to live up to,” Frankel once told an audience at the Kennedy Library. A guidepost for Harris’ remarks can be found in several of her major speeches over the years, aides said, including her presidential announcement in 2019. She is not known to dwell on her own history-making potential but rather allow others to tread that ground for her. “If I have the honor of being your president, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect,” she told supporters back in January 2019. “But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will speak the truth.” In the final hours before Thursday’s prime-time speech, Harris’ focus has largely been on perfecting her delivery, sources said, by trying to anticipate how the audience will receive and feel each line. This week also provided ample opportunity for Harris to spend time with her family – including members of her husband’s family – who have descended on Chicago for the political festivities. Former Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a close adviser, said even Harris views her Thursday night speech as “her introduction to America in her own voice.” Asked what main message Harris would hope to deliver to Americans with her acceptance speech, Richmond said: “That she cares about them and that it’s not about her and it’s about them.” “Her main goal is to let the American people know she will wake up every day fighting for them,” he said. Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris’ campaign for California attorney general and has advised her for years, said he sees the vice president’s objective Thursday night as relatively straightforward. “Her task is to show the nation the Kamala Harris that many voters don’t yet know, and through her words, make clear as day the stark contrast between the positive, unifying Harris-Walz vision and the doom and gloom of the Trump -Vance ticket,” Brokaw said."
McDonald’s has become a powerful symbol for Democrats | CNN Business,"Published 12:32 PM EDT, Thu August 22, 2024",2024-08-22T16:32:21.912Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/22/business/harris-mcdonalds-democrats-nightcap/index.html,"If elected this fall, Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff will usher in many “firsts” in American history. Among them: The first White House couple to have worked at McDonald’s. With that line on their resumes, Harris and Emhoff share a link to 1 in 8 Americans who have worked at McDonald’s – 13% of the country – according to the company. Broadcasting that shared history, as they have this week at the Democratic National Convention, has become a powerful way for Democrats to burnish their working-class credentials and, without even mentioning their rivals’ names, aim to make former President Donald Trump and the Republican ticket appear elitist and out of touch. In several speeches and campaign ads, Democrats have been eager to remind voters that Harris, raised by a single mom in a middle class neighborhood, had a summer job slinging fries to help her pay for college. Former President Bill Clinton, whose own legendary McD’s habit became memorable fodder for “Saturday Night Live” in the 1990s, joked in his convention speech Wednesday night that he’ll be happy to see Harris elected because “at last, she’ll break my record as the president who has spent the most time at McDonald’s.” Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett was more direct in distinguishing Harris’s background from Trump’s, who got his start in real estate with what he has called a “small” $1 million loan from his father. “One candidate worked at McDonald’s … The other was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and helped his daddy in the family business: Housing discrimination,” Crockett said in her convention speech Tuesday. Also Tuesday, Emhoff, the second gentleman, highlighted his own working-class roots, telling the DNC that when he was in high school “money was tight, so I worked at McDonald’s,” where he was named employee of the month. “I still have the framed picture … and there was a ring, golden arches and all.” McDonald’s declined to comment for this story. The McDonald’s rhetoric is, of course, a carefully calculated strategy to make both Harris and Emhoff more relatable to voters, many of who are just getting to know the second couple. The “McDonald’s” nod is a rhetorical shorthand for having worked in food service — a notoriously low-paying, physically exhausting job that is nonetheless a point of pride for those who’ve done it. (Hi, former waitress and barista here, what can I get you?) And Democrats hope the millions of voters who worked in food service will be unable to imagine Trump, the real estate mogul and reality TV star, picking soggy scraps out of the slop sink drain, or being yelled at by customers whose order wasn’t right. That’s exactly what Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, was tapping into in a campaign speech earlier this month. “Can you simply picture Donald Trump working at a McDonald’s? … He couldn’t run that damn McFlurry machine if it cost him anything,” Walz said. Working in food service, like joining the military and becoming a public school teacher (in Walz’s case), fits into a broader populist, pro-worker narrative that Democrats have embraced, particularly under President Joe Biden, who has backed unions and last year joined a picket line during the massive autoworkers strike. Democrats appear to be betting on the strength of a growing labor movement in America. Shifting demographics and a changing global economy have led working-class White voters – once the backbone of support for Democrats – to form a voting bloc for the Republican Party. So it would have been hard to imagine, even a few years ago, that one of the stars of the 2024 DNC would be the head of the United Auto Workers union, clad in a “Trump is a scab” T-shirt on stage. And yet here we are. Perhaps no other major Democrat embraces that populist brand better than New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who just six years ago was working as a waitress in Manhattan. “Ever since I got elected, Republicans have attacked me by saying that I should go back to bartending,” she told the DNC on Monday. “But let me tell you, I’m happy to — any day of the week — because there is nothing wrong with working for a living. Imagine having leaders in the White House who understand that.”"
Analysis: It’s Harris’ time to convince voters that she can be the 47th president | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:43 AM EDT, Thu August 22, 2024",2024-08-22T05:56:18.389Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/22/politics/kamala-harris-pitch-to-america-analysis/index.html,"Kamala Harris has helped America see joy and now she needs to make America see a president. Her speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night will represent her most exacting test yet in a dizzying month that rocketed her to the threshold of an historic presidency that could reshape American politics. The vice president will offer the country a new beginning and a chance to move to a different place — beyond the prolonged funk brewed by years of Donald Trump’s dark rhetoric and public exhaustion after a once-in-a-century pandemic and consequent and punishing high prices. More broadly, she’s proposing to restore the elusive lightness and optimism to American life and to reclaim the concept of “freedom” from conservatives, encompassing everything from reproductive rights to new economic relief for the working and middle classes, to access to health care and safety from mass shootings. “In this election, we each face a question. And that question is, what kind of country do we want to live in?” Harris said at a packed rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday night as the convention partied in Chicago. “Do we want to live in a country of chaos, fear, and hate? Or a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law?” Her party is calling on Harris to ascend to the next level of the political stratosphere after advanced age ended President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. No modern presidential nominee of any major party has faced such a tough assignment in so short a time. She is the last obstacle to Trump’s return to power after he defied four criminal indictments, one conviction, and crushed his primary rivals as he eyes the most stunning presidential comeback in more than a century. But Harris’ vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, told the country on Wednesday night that she could “turn the page on Donald Trump” – in his plain speaking midwestern way that the campaign believes can appeal to White men in the heartland who may tire of the MAGA creed. “Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced. And Kamala Harris is ready,” Walz roared. And in another message to independent and undecided Americans, talk show icon and actress Oprah Winfrey led a parade of entertainers and stars in reinforcing a message that has resonated throughout this convention. “Let us choose common sense over nonsense, because that’s the best of America,” Winfrey said. “Let us choose the sweet promise of tomorrow over the bitter return to yesterday. We won’t go back. We won’t be set back, pushed back, bullied back, kicked back. We are not going back.” Most presidential nominees spent years on the campaign trail honing their politics and rhetorical appeals. Harris has been forced to build her campaign on the fly. — She must establish herself in the eyes of voters as a credible potential commander in chief. She has a lot of gaps to fill in. While she’s been a loyal supporter of Biden’s national security approach, how she’d deal with China, Russia, the war in Ukraine and Iran is largely a mystery. — Harris’ best bet to beat Trump is to offer herself as the agent of change that voters have told pollsters for many months that they want. It’s tough because she’s a key member of an unpopular administration. But in her most striking effort to separate herself from Biden, Harris has tried to take the party in a sharply populist direction, vowing to cut down on price gouging by supermarket giants. She’s likely to highlight this on Thursday to signal to voters she’s meeting them where they are. Former President Bill Clinton encapsulated this strategy in his convention speech Wednesday. “Every four years … people come up to candidates … and they say … ‘Now, here are our problems, solve them. Here are our opportunities, seize them. Here are our fears, ease them. Here are our dreams, help them come true.’” — Harris’ uneven performance as vice president raised doubts about her capacity to ascend to the top job. Her strong debut heading the new presidential ticket has eased some of these Democratic fears. But her capacity to survive the searing examination to come is still a question. Trump is trying to portray her as an extreme liberal outside the mainstream of American politics. Everything Harris says Thursday will be an attempt to neutralize attacks on her record on immigration, on her character and her fitness to lead in a restive world. An even bigger test looms with her debate against Trump on September 10. — The first month of the Harris campaign has unfolded in a surreal bubble as the Democratic Party has suddenly jumped back to life. But observers will be looking for evidence in her speech that she can turn the joy she’s conjured so far into a viable campaign machine to win millions of votes. — Harris must also disqualify Trump in the minds of enough voters to build her own majority. She’s been less explicit than Biden as framing this election as a battle for “the soul of the nation,” as key party leaders have shifted from warning about Trump’s existential threat to mocking and belittling him. But Harris is warning that a second Trump term could change the country beyond recognition. “This is not 2016 or 2020. And in particular, the stakes are higher for a lot of reasons, because we know what he does when he’s in office.” Ultimately, Harris must make Americans feel comfortable with the idea of her being president. In the most intimate portrait of the potential next commander in chief, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff sought to endear her to Americans with details of their romance. “She will lead with joy and toughness, with that laugh and that look, with compassion and conviction. She’ll lead from the belief that wherever we come from, whatever we look like, we’re strongest when we fight for what we believe in, not just against what we fear,” Emhoff said Tuesday night. “Kamala Harris was exactly the right person for me at an important moment in my life, and at this moment in our nation’s history, she is exactly the right president.” Although, she’s been vice president for four years, Harris remains unknown to many Americans. A recent CBS News poll found that only 64% of Americans knew what she stands for, compared to 86% who said the same of Trump. This is an opportunity for the vice president to present a new voice to the country. But it also explains the need for her to define herself before Trump does it for her. She’ll never have a better chance. While she has been deeply loyal to Biden, her vice presidency has not been brimming with successes — one reason why there was little pressure on the president to step aside at the beginning of this cycle. But now, a nominee who has never won a single vote for the presidency (her primary campaign ahead of the 2020 race folded long before the Iowa caucuses) is being asked to conjure victory in a snap election of the highest of stakes. When politicians secure a party nomination, they must prepare themselves to assume the even greater burdens of the presidency. In Harris’ case, it’s not a total leap into the unknown since she was on the ballot as vice president in 2020 and has been a heartbeat away from the top job ever since. The vice president’s deftness as her boss tried to hold on as the nominee and then bowed to his party’s desperation for him to step aside has gilded her reputation. It’s raised the possibility that a crisis nurtured the next Democratic Party giant. But she’s not alone. Former Democratic presidents, first ladies and members of Harris’ inner circle and family have this week united behind her in a stunning shift in a party that was in disarray after Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump. Biden poignantly handed Harris his legacy and the hopes of his party before flying off into lame duck status after his address to the convention on Monday night. But now only Harris can convince voters that she can be the 47th president. Harris would be the first Black woman and Indian American President. All week, the Democratic Party’s elders have highlighted her heritage, middle class upbringing and journey from a job flipping burgers at McDonald’s to putting violent criminals behind bars as California’s attorney general. They’ve argued that her rise to the vice presidency from humble roots epitomizes a life of service that makes her fit to lead the nation. That diverse biography may be the key to reassembling the kind of Democratic coalition rooted in women, minority and suburban voters that could lead Harris to the Oval Office. When Democrats arrived in Chicago, they were buzzing with euphoria after Harris and Walz delighted huge crowds at swing state rallies that left Trump grappling for traction — and suddenly saddled, at 78, with the unwelcome reality of being the old candidate in the race. But as the days passed, the reality of this year’s still-close election has started to intrude. It’s been fueled by warnings from the Democrats who know best what it takes to win power — former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — that this election is nowhere near done and that the joy of recent weeks is just a starting point."
Fact check: Trump falsely claims Harris met with Putin before Ukraine invasion | CNN Politics,"Published 7:13 PM EDT, Wed August 21, 2024",2024-08-21T23:13:54.061Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/fact-check-trump-harris-putin-meeting-ukraine/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his Democratic opponent in the presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin just days before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Trump said in a speech in North Carolina: “Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine. She met with Putin, and then three days later, he attacked. How did she do? Do you think she did a good job? She met with Putin to tell him, ‘Don’t do it.’ And three days later, he attacked; that’s when the attack started. Did you know that, General?” (Retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was at the North Carolina event.) Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference. “Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said last month, according to a state-owned Russian news agency. The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.” CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.” The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022."

She likes to see people do well but hates when they’re treated unfairly. She believes this work requires a basic curiosity and just how people are doing,” Emhoff told the Chicago audience. “Her empathy is her strength.” Emhoff, who married Harris 10 years ago, noted that their anniversary will fall on Thursday, the same day that the vice president will deliver her formal remarks accepting the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. The second gentleman also spoke about his own work in public service, including how he has taken up the case of combating antisemitism. “Kamala has fought against antisemitism and all forms of hate her whole career. She’s the one who encouraged me, as second gentleman, to take up that fight, which is so personal to me,” Emhoff said. Emhoff, the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, also spoke about his faith, noting that “over the past decade, Kamala has connected me more deeply to my faith, even though it’s not the same as hers.” In the VIP suite Tuesday night for the second gentleman’s speech were his parents, Barbara and Michael Emhoff, to whom the second gentleman shouted out during his remarks. At one point, he joked that his “mother is the only person in the whole world who thinks Kamala is the lucky one for marrying me.” The second gentleman also thanked his former wife, Kerstin Emhoff, who was in the VIP box in the United Center along with other members of the Emhoff and Harris families, and the vice president for their roles in creating a very modern blended family. He noted that his daughter ,Ella, who was seated next to Emhoff’s parents in the suite, calls them a “three-headed parenting machine.” Red “Doug” signs were passed out to convention attendees before Emhoff’s speech began, several of which could be seen in the VIP box with the second gentleman’s family members."
How Kamala Harris is winning over Wall Street | CNN Business,"Updated 10:01 AM EDT, Wed August 21, 2024",2024-08-21T11:00:03.923Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/investing/kamala-harris-wall-street-relationship/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is courting everyday Americans tired of the country’s affordability crisis. But she is winning over some key figures on Wall Street. Since the whirlwind launch of her presidential campaign after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, Harris has won the support of some prominent Wall Street figures. At times, big business clashed with Biden, whose progressive administration fought mergers and routinely blamed corporate greed for the inflation crisis. So Wall Street’s embrace of Harris, who supported Biden’s policies, was no guarantee. “Harris has a better relationship with Wall Street than even Joe Biden had,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN in a phone interview on Tuesday. Harris’ stances on Corporate America and Wall Street are a bit more of a blank slate than Biden. But as a California attorney general and senator, she had a generally more open approach than Biden had with Silicon Valley, where America’s biggest companies reside. And so far, Wall Street titans are opening their checkbooks, bringing her a sizeable pool of money from a part of the economy that in the past has favored Republican candidates. At the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night, former American Express CEO Ken Chenault strongly endorsed Harris, particularly contrasting her with Donald Trump. “She knows that a market-based economy needs a strong and effective government. Kamala Harris understands that we need help to turn good ideas into thriving companies, that we can create good-paying jobs by helping manufacturers expand,” he said. “Unlike her opponent, she knows the way not to build an advanced economy is a broad tariff that would only raise prices, hurt consumers and businesses and cost jobs.” But even before Harris revealed key details of her platform, Roger Altman, founder and senior chairman of Evercore, told CNBC last month that he supports Harris and that expects her campaign to be “very well financed.” Blackstone president Jonathan Gray contributed $413,000 to the Harris Action Fund at the end of July, a source familiar with his giving told CNN. Alex Soros, son of billionaire liberal donor George Soros, endorsed Harris in an X post last month. George Soros also supports Harris, his spokesperson told CNN. Avenue Capital Group CEO Marc Lasry donated $100K to the Harris Action Fund in March, according to Federal Election Commission data. Sonnenfeld, known as the “CEO Whisperer,” argued that Harris’ stronger relationship with Wall Street compared to Biden’s is because she toned down the “class warfare” rhetoric and had a track record as California attorney general acting fairly — even if not overly favorably — with businesses. “She went after abuses but didn’t see the scale of enterprise itself as misconduct. She knows that thriving businesses are good for the economy and the average American worker,” Sonnenfeld said. Of course, some Wall Street bigwigs have made their support for Trump clear. Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management, endorsed Trump as president in a July X post. Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said in March that he is backing the former president’s bid. Key Square Group founder Scott Bessent is a supporter of Trump and attended his rally in Asheville, North Carolina. Burns McKinney, managing director at NFJ Investment Group, says that some big investors might favor Trump’s promises of tax cuts and tariffs over Harris’ populist economic policies, since they could spur growth. But such tax cuts could lead to higher deficits, and US corporations would likely pass along those tariff costs to consumers by raising prices, he said — both factors that could push up inflation, an issue that until recently was top of mind for Wall Street. The Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates aggressively more than two years ago from near-zero levels during the Covid pandemic. Annual inflation was running at 9% at its peak in June 2022. Last month it fell below 3%, raising hopes among traders that the central bank could manage to bring inflation to target without triggering a recession. Harris’ policies could also be inflationary. Her proposed policies center around making big-ticket expenses from housing to groceries to childcare more affordable, largely through offering tax relief for the middle-class and lower-income Americans and challenging price gouging. While giving Americans more money to spend should be good news for consumers, that could also push up demand for goods and services and, in turn, prices. Harris’ campaign said Monday that she will fight to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21%, a reversal of Trump’s tax cuts, which lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35%, to help pay for her campaign promises. Some investors have criticized the proposed tax rate hike, arguing that it could weigh on US companies and crimp the economy. Of course, Trump has vowed to impose massive new tariffs on China and all trading partners, moves that could provoke a destabilizing global trade war. That would create massive uncertainty, something investors famously despise. Beyond trade policy, investors are bracing for a potential shift in governance style if Trump is returned to the White House. In particular, Sonnenfeld pointed to Trump’s history of attacking iconic American companies such as Harley-Davidson, Delta and Nike. “Wall Street hates Trump’s mercurial vindictiveness. Trump’s temperment creates havoc in financial markets,” Sonnenfeld said. Some institutional investors also say that a key issue for Wall Street when deciding who to back could be the candidates’ differing attitudes toward the Fed’s longstanding independence. Led by Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed functions as its own government institution and is overseen by Congress. Trump, who tried to pressure the Fed to lower rates during his presidency, has said that he believes the president should be able to directly influence monetary policy. On Monday, he attempted to soften his previous comments. Harris has vowed to keep her input out of the Fed’s decisions. The Fed’s autonomy is meant to prevent political agendas from swaying monetary policy. Some investors worry the central bank could lose its credibility, one of its most important tools for fulfilling its dual-mandate of price stability and maximum employment, if the US president were to have explicit influence over its actions. “That would be really problematic,” said Gerald Goldberg, chief executive of GYL Financial Synergies. Harris’ relationship with Wall Street titans has been tense at times, most notably when she was the California attorney general and took on big banks in the aftermath of the housing crisis. Harris pulled California out of discussions in 2011 with other state attorneys general to show that the still-forming deal needed to be tougher on banks. Her actions helped secure a roughly $20 billion settlement for Californians. Harris has formed relationships with businesspeople, including Lazard President Ray McGuire and Centerview Partners co-founder Blair Effron, and is expected to lean on her connections for advice, according to people familiar with the matter. Harris in July joined a conversation with supporters hosted by JPMorgan vice chairman Peter Scher at his home, a company spokesperson told CNN. A source previously told CNN that Harris hosted JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for lunch at the White House in recent months. But Dimon “never endorses a particular candidate,” a JPMorgan spokesperson told CNN."
Analysis: Walz under pressure to prove himself on national stage | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:46 AM EDT, Wed August 21, 2024",2024-08-21T06:08:32.934Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/walz-harris-dnc-analysis/index.html,"It’s time to turn joy into votes. Democratic Party Hall of Famers spent the first two days of their party’s convention doubling down on their 11th hour wager on their ebullient new presidential ticket. Now it’s all on Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. The vice president and the Minnesota governor are largely unknown to vast swaths of the country and have experienced nothing like the looming maelstrom of an election clash with Donald Trump. But they can’t have hoped for more help than the Democratic Party giants of the last 40 years. A president, Joe Biden, drew a curtain on a 50-year political career. An ex-president, Barack Obama, implored a polarized nation to renew what Abraham Lincoln called “our bonds of affection” and to unify behind Harris. Hillary Clinton, who came so close to breaking the male monopoly on the presidency, peered through the cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling and envisioned Harris taking the oath of office as the first woman president. And another former first lady, Michelle Obama, declared, “hope is making a comeback” while beseeching voters to “do something” to thwart a Trump restoration. But on the next two nights in Chicago, Harris and Walz must begin to answer whether their chummy double act can evolve into a serious electoral movement as their campaign enters a critical new stage. It begins on Wednesday, when Walz will be under pressure to make the leap to the national political stage. The next night, it’s Harris’ turn, as she seeks to match her transformation of the 2024 campaign with a reinvigoration of her own political reputation after a difficult vice presidency. Harris has largely erased Trump’s polling leads. She’s revived Democratic hopes of winning back the House and holding the Senate. And she’s conjured an optimistic path for America that veers away from the dystopian vision of a nation under the grip of strongman rule favored by the GOP nominee. She’s coined a mantra that her party, fearful of Trump’s return, is eagerly embracing: “We are not going back.” But that’s the easy part. Harris and Walz now need to turn the momentum, unity and fresh purpose rocking the Chicago convention hall into a campaign that can win a presidency. She’s under pressure to prove that after an unspectacular vice presidency and a fast-rising but swiftly expiring 2020 primary campaign, she can sustain a bitter, close contest with a ferocious GOP opponent. And her prime-time address on Thursday night is her best chance to convince the country that she looks like a president and has the steel to be commander in chief. The country on Wednesday will get to kick the tires on a Minnesota governor who’s a military veteran, a former teacher, a high school football coach, a hunter and a middle-class Midwestern dad. One Democratic operative, pointing to the multiple demographics that Walz can play into, described him privately as a “walking coalition” on Tuesday. But he will take the stage following an object lesson of what can happen when a vice presidential pick’s debut falls flat. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, delivered an underwhelming address at the Republican National Convention last month that turned into a rocky rollout and sent his approval ratings tumbling, contributing to the Trump campaign’s late summer funk. Vice presidential nominees don’t decide elections, but Walz, with his heartland aura, could act as a counterbalance to a Harris candidacy that might perturb some voters resistant to change. Walz also offers an example to middle class men that they have a political alternative to MAGA conservatism. Democratic strategists hope that he could be especially valuable to the ticket in courting rural voters who respond to his homely outlook in a way that could potentially drive down some margins in districts where Trump runs strongest. “Here’s a guy that can talk anywhere and people can connect with him as a human being, as a coach, as a former teacher,” former Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock — who was renowned for connecting with cultural conservative voters even as his party moved left – told CNN on Tuesday. “He will talk to people where they are. He will talk to them about issues that matter in their lives.” But Walz, despite being a former member of the House, comes into this test with far less time on the national political stage than some other vice presidential picks in recent years – including Biden, who was a longtime senator when he joined Obama in 2008, ex-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who teamed up with George W. Bush in 2000, and Sen. Al Gore, who was Bill Clinton’s pick in 1992. The Trump campaign recognizes the threat. It’s come down hard on Walz over the timing of his retirement from the Army National Guard shortly before his unit went to Iraq. (The Minnesota governor said he had no advance notice of the deployment.) Vance has attacked him over his erroneous implication he carried a gun in a war zone, which drew a clarification from the Harris campaign. And on Monday, the Ohio Republican – at the risk of further alienating female voters – accused Walz of being dishonest about his and his wife Gwen’s use of fertility treatments. The Trump team is also highlighting Walz’s liberal tenure as a governor, which threatens to complicate the Harris campaign’s attempt to highlight his wholesome temperament as a sign of moderation. Democratic Party elders have united on the same thematic strategy. As Walz and Harris sell optimism and hope after a grim decade featuring a global pandemic and Trump’s “American carnage” ideology, they’ve been anchored in an arc of progress, which party leaders see as the unifying rationale of their own careers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proved again she’s the party’s most astute power player by helping to nudge Biden aside and opening the way for a new generation to rise. Biden, initially reluctantly, but ultimately with grace, credited Harris with co-piloting his most important achievements, handed her his legacy on the convention’s opening night, and boarded Air Force One for a one-way trip to lame duck status. Clinton, with no trace of envy, looked ahead to the day when Harris could overcome the final barrier to women in politics. On Tuesday, during East Coast primetime, Sen. Bernie Sanders threw the progressive movement behind the evolving economic populism of the party’s new leader. The fierce urgency of the Obamas’ message was the most striking. The couple endured the pain of handing the White House to Trump in January 2017. Their speeches on Tuesday night showed the dread of the nightmare recurring. The former first lady – who eight years ago told Democrats they must always “go high” in taking on Trump – delivered the most searing denunciation of the ex-president in this convention so far, condemning his race-fueled rhetoric. “His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said, referring to herself and her husband. “Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs?’” she said. The 44th president argued, with the authority of someone who’s done the job, that Harris is deeply qualified to be president and framed Walz as utterly authentic. “I love this guy. Tim is the kind of person who should be in politics. Born in a small town, served his country, taught kids, coached football, took care of his neighbors — he knows who he is and he knows what’s important,” Obama said. But while evoking hope, this Mount Rushmore of recent Democratic heroes and heroines couldn’t shake the fear that their efforts might fall short. “For the next 78 days, we need to work harder than we ever have. We need to beat back the dangers that Trump and his allies pose to the rule of law and our way of life. Don’t get distracted or complacent,” Hillary Clinton said. Barack Obama added: “For all the incredible energy we’ve been able to generate over the last few weeks, for all the rallies and the memes — this will still be a tight race in a closely divided country.” But the stakes seemed most visceral for Michelle Obama, who warned, “This is up to us —all of us — to be the solution we seek. … It is up to all of us to be the antidote to all the darkness and division.” “Do something,” she cried, as the crowd picked up the chant. As the convention’s most critical business begins, her admonition now applies also to Harris and Walz."
"Harris erases Trump’s cash edge while RFK Jr. faces dwindling resources, new filings show | CNN Politics","Published 2:59 AM EDT, Wed August 21, 2024",2024-08-21T06:59:03.547Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/cash-advantage-harris-trump-rfk-filings/index.html,"Kamala Harris supercharged Democratic fundraising in July after taking over the top of the party’s presidential ticket, new federal filings show, helping erase what had been an emerging cash advantage for Republican nominee Donald Trump. The new filings also show independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. facing dwindling campaign resources and refunding contributions from his running mate, who said on a podcast posted Tuesday that the campaign is considering exiting the race and endorsing Trump. Meanwhile, prominent outside groups funded by top megadonors raked in millions amid the transformed presidential race, and spent millions more on recharged advertising campaigns. Here are takeaways from the latest round of monthly filings with the Federal Election Commission, which cover fundraising and spending activity for July, including the three weeks before Biden dropped out of the presidential race and backed Harris. Harris’ principal campaign committee reported about $220 million in cash on hand at the end of July, a massive jump from the nearly $96 million that the committee reported at the start of the month, when it was still under President Joe Biden’s control. Harris’ bank balance also bested the $151 million the Trump campaign reported in its principal account on July 31. It’s a dramatic reversal from the end of June, when Trump led Biden in cash on hand by more than $30 million ($128 million to $96 million). Both Harris and Trump raise most of their campaign funds through joint fundraising committees, which split proceeds between the presidential campaigns, national party committees and dozens of other allies. Including all of those allies, Harris announced earlier this month that she had raised a record-breaking $310 million in July, including $200 million in just her first week after stepping in for Biden. A Harris campaign official said the team expects to cross the $500 million mark in fundraising in the coming days. By comparison, Trump previously announced that his entire political operation had raised a total of $139 million in July. The new filings from each candidate’s principal campaign committee reflect that broader advantage. Harris reported that she brought in $204.5 million directly to her campaign account in July, including funds raised during the weeks when Biden was still in the race. By contrast, Trump’s campaign reported raising $47.5 million directly to his campaign account over the same stretch. His campaign was also dramatically outspent by Harris’ campaign over the course of the month, $81 million to $24 million. Amid the intensifying cash race, both national party committees also reported hauling in tens of millions, though the Republican National Committee grew its cash advantage with the Democratic National Committee spending heavily in July. The RNC raised nearly $31 million, spent $33.5 million, and entered August with about $99 million on hand. By comparison, the DNC also raised nearly $31 million but spent $43 million and ended the month with just under $66 million in cash. The new FEC filings show that, in July, megadonors from both parties plowed millions into prominent outside groups, which spent big in response to the changed presidential landscape. FF PAC, the leading super PAC backing Harris, raised nearly $30 million, including a $5 million contribution from investment executive Marc Stad on July 25, four days after Biden withdrew from the race. The super PAC spent more than $27 million in July, including more than $20 million on independent expenditures, mostly for paid media aimed at supporting Harris’ bid. MAGA Inc., a leading pro-Trump super PAC, had an even bigger month, raising nearly $55 million in July, and spending more than $43 million on independent expenditures aimed at boosting Trump. Nearly all of MAGA Inc.’s haul last month came from a single $50 million contribution on July 15 – before Biden dropped out – from reclusive billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a historic banking fortune who has now given the super PAC a total of $115 million so far this election cycle. This was Mellon’s second  $50 million donation to MAGA Inc. – after a contribution made in May of this year. The two donations represent the largest individual contributions reported to the FEC so far this year. Data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact illustrates how potent a force those outside groups have been in the early weeks of the upended race. In the four weeks following Biden’s decision to drop out, outside groups – led by FF PAC,  MAGA Inc., and the pro-Trump Preserve America – spent more than $180 million combined on ads amid a frantic scramble to define the new general election. Over that stretch, FF PAC has spent a total of nearly $70 million on ads, including putting more than $20 million behind a spot that features clips of Harris making her campaign pitch at a rally. “I’m running to fight for an America where the economy works for working people, where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, and where hard work is rewarded, where reproductive rights are not just protected by the Constitution of the United States, but guaranteed in every state,” Harris says in the ad. Countering those efforts, MAGA Inc. spent more than $50 million in ads over the same period. It put nearly $15 million behind an ad branding Harris “a dangerous San Francisco liberal” and slamming her record as a former district attorney and California attorney general. Outside groups are poised to play a decisive role in the closing months of the 2024 campaign. AdImpact data shows that Democratic groups, led by FF PAC, have more than $278 million in future ad reservations for the presidential race through Election Day, while Republicans have nearly $140 million booked. And those totals are likely to continue to grow as November approaches, with spending in the 2024 race projected to break records. The latest filings also raise questions about the future of Kennedy’s long-shot White House bid. The independent candidate has reportedly sought meetings with both Harris and Trump about potential roles in future administrations, and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said on a podcast posted Tuesday that the campaign is considering dropping out of the race and endorsing Trump. Kennedy’s campaign ended July with just $3.9 million on hand and reported nearly $3.5 million in outstanding debts to private security executive Gavin de Becker for several security-related expenditures. The filing showed that Kennedy’s campaign refunded nearly $1 million in July to Shanahan, an attorney and Silicon Valley executive whose personal fortune was seen as a potentially significant asset. Shanahan had given more than $13 million prior to the refund, crucial funds for a campaign lacking the support of any major-party infrastructure. Those limited resources will add further pressure on a campaign already facing the challenge of securing ballot access in several states, including New York – where earlier this month, a judge rejected Kennedy’s submission – while also navigating an electoral terrain significantly reshaped by Harris’ elevation to Democratic nominee."
Alsobrooks addresses Democrats in Chicago as she seeks to become Maryland’s first Black senator | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:48 PM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T21:12:04.857Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/angela-alsobrooks-kamala-harris/index.html,"Kamala Harris isn’t the only Black woman trying to make history this year. Angela Alsobrooks, who delivered a keynote address in Chicago on Tuesday night, is trying to become the first Black person Maryland sends to the US Senate. And though neither puts their history-making potential at the forefront of their public message, they’re riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm about what’s possible in November. “People like me, stories like mine, don’t usually make it to the United States Senate. But they should,” Alsobrooks, a mentee of Harris and fellow prosecutor, told the crowd. “When you look at elections in this country, make no mistake about it: women, but Black women in particular, have saved this country time and time again from itself,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told CNN on Tuesday before a meeting of the Maryland delegation in Chicago. “And now it’s time for us to elect them.” Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, is vying to become only the third Black woman elected to the Senate, along with Delaware’s Lisa Blunt Rochester. (The one Black woman currently serving — California’s Laphonza Butler — was appointed and isn’t running to stay beyond this year.) “The excitement is really, really, really big, especially with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket,” said Karen Darkes, the executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party. “It’s not lost on Marylanders that we have a moment, that we’re in an historic moment just in our state, and we have to double down on that by electing the (state’s) first Black woman senator.” Alsobrooks is up against Republican Larry Hogan, a popular former two-term governor, whose entrance into the race in February raised the stakes for Democrats – who were already on defense across the country – to hold retiring Sen. Ben Cardin’s seat. With Republicans poised to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia, the party only needs to pick up one more seat or win the White House to secure the majority. Alsobrooks’ prominent presence at the Chicago convention, where many Democrats in tough races aren’t eager to be seen, speaks to how unique her race is in this year’s Senate landscape. She’s running in a state Biden carried by more than 30 points, while most of this year’s competitive contests are taking place in states that former President Donald Trump either won or narrowly lost in 2020. Alsobrooks’ chance to make history was resonant in May’s Democratic primary, when she scored a stunning defeat over Rep. David Trone, the owner of Total Wine & More, who broke the record for self-funding a Senate primary campaign. Trone massively outspent her, but he and his allies had some slips (suggesting she’d need “training wheels” in the Senate, for example) that backfired. In the end, it wasn’t close – she beat Trone by more than 10 points. Alsobrooks’ lived experience as a Black woman — and her potential to break up the state’s all-male congressional delegation, most of whom had endorsed her — was on the minds of many of her primary supporters who spoke to CNN this spring and said they were looking for diverse representation and an authentic messenger on abortion rights. And now in the general election — when Democrats’ biggest argument is that Hogan would be a 51st vote for Republicans in the Senate — Black turnout will be key to their success. “Everyone knows that Black women determine who wins votes in Baltimore, and with my vice president, Kamala Harris, at the top of the ticket, and county executive Alsobrooks on the ticket, we know that they’re going to turn out, and they’re going to turn out in numbers,” Scott said. But it’s not just Baltimore. Wanika Fisher serves on the county council in Prince George’s County – home to one of the largest middle class Black populations in the country. “These are Black folks with money and degrees, and that level, with Kamala and Angela together from our state, is just Black girl magic,” she said. State Sen. Antonio Hayes also pointed to the significance of Harris and Alsobrooks being part of the Divine Nine. “Having two individuals from two different organizations represented in that way is a powerful moment,” he said. The two women know each other well and have campaigned for each other over the years. Alsobrooks touted Harris’ record as a prosecutor on Tuesday night — and the ways in which the California Democrat inspired her own run for public office as a prosecutor. “After reading about this super bad district attorney, I talked non-stop about her on the campaign trail. Two days after I won the election, my phone rings. It’s Kamala Harris calling to congratulate me and ask how she could help,” Alsobrooks said. “Getting justice for others isn’t a power trip for her, it’s a sacred calling,” the Maryland Democrat said. “And hear me, Kamala Harris knows how to keep criminals off the streets. And come November, with your help, she’ll keep one out of the Oval Office. Harris was in Prince George’s County just last week with President Joe Biden for an event on lowering drug costs, which Alsobrooks attended. “Their relationship that they already have established lends to the excitement that we have in our state,” said Darkes, who noted that while they’ve both led their campaigns with the issues, the possibility of electing Black women fires people up. There’s been no public polling of the race since the primary that meets CNN standards. But Alsobrooks has kept the money race competitive – she narrowly outraised Hogan in the second quarter, raking in $5.3 million to his $5.1 million, and ended up with more money in the bank. And in such a blue state, Democrats are working to tie Hogan to GOP leadership – a job made easier when Trump endorsed him. (Hogan has said he isn’t voting for Trump and has “no interest” in his backing.) Hogan was not on stage for the Republican convention in Milwaukee and has tried to distance himself from the national party – especially on abortion. He told The New York Times after he won the primary that he’d support federal legislation to codify Roe v. Wade – which Alsobrooks immediately criticized, citing his previous veto of a state law to expand abortion access. “Just because you don’t say anything offensive like Trump doesn’t mean your policies aren’t offensive,” said Fisher, who served as assistant majority leader in the House of Delegates when Hogan was governor. “And when you go to the halls of Congress, you’re there to express an idea and a value, you’re not executing anymore,” she said, drawing a distinction between the executive experience she said voters want from a governor and the representation they want in Washington. For Maryland delegates convening in Chicago this week, there’s palpable energy for who they want that representative to be — in the Senate and the White House. “The former president doesn’t know what a Black job is,” Scott said, “he’s about to find out very quickly.” This story has been updated with Alsobrooks’ remarks."
Maya Rudolph teases her return to ‘SNL’ to play Kamala Harris | CNN,"Published 9:57 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T13:57:30.224Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/entertainment/maya-rudolph-snl-kamala-harris/index.html,"It was initially news to Maya Rudolph when it was announced she would be returning to “Saturday Night Live” to play Vice President Kamala Harris. That’s according to Rudolph, who appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Monday, where guest host RuPaul asked her ,“Will we be seeing Kamala on ‘SNL’ anytime soon?” “Ok, interesting that you brought this up cause no one’s asked me,” Rudolph joked. Everyone has been wondering since Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president whether Rudolph, who has appeared as Harris on the late-night show in skits in recent years, would reprise her portrayal. Rudolph told RuPaul she has “never experienced anything like this before in any of the work I’ve ever done.” “This has been such a tremendous, exciting time for me, that feels so much bigger than me or anything I’ve ever done,” Rudolph said. “I played her on the show already, but the minute …it was announced that she was running, I think I was home watching [series] ‘The Bear,’ and it was announced that I had confirmed doing ‘SNL’ and I was like ‘I did whaaaa?’” “Everybody’s just ready for it,” Rudolph said, which she believes is “wonderful” and “cool.” “I would never have believed you if you had said ‘Hey, one. day you’re going to be playing the presidential candidate,’” she said. “For me to think that I have anything to do with this by association is mind blowing.” Rudolph explained she didn’t envision it because there has never been a presidential candidate who looked like her, until now. “Saturday Night Live” will celebrate its 50th season when it returns to NBC with new episodes on September 28."
A nod to Obama? Searching for symbolism in Kamala Harris’ tan suit | CNN,"Published 9:13 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T13:13:16.249Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/style/kamala-harris-tan-suit/index.html,"In American politics, a tan suit is no longer just a tan suit. So, when Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention wearing one on Monday evening, the country’s collective memory — or social media’s, at least — instantly recalled one of the shade’s defining moments: Tan-gate. A decade ago, almost to the day, President Barack Obama enraged a handful of conservative commentators by briefing the press in a light-colored suit. Critics felt his sartorial choice was out of keeping with the gravity of the topic being discussed (namely the US military’s response to a then-flourishing ISIS). At the time, New York Rep. Peter King told CNN that the suit was a metaphor for Obama’s “lack of seriousness.” Vociferous birtherist Lou Dobbs meanwhile, slammed the outfit as “un-presidential” on Fox News, suggesting on air that it may be transmitting some sort of hidden message, possibly to America’s enemies. Whether or not Harris intended to evoke a moment now associated with Republican-baiting is a matter of debate. Perhaps that was the point. But when the vice president entered the stage to Beyoncé’s “Freedom” wearing a tan pantsuit and laughing (another source of jibes from her opponents), she almost appeared to be daring critics to call her un-presidential. Posting to X, comedian John Fugelsang wrote that the outfit would “trigger all the right people.” Meanwhile, former spokesman for Jeb Bush and expert in opposition research Tim Miller suggested she was “baiting Fox (News) into an entire week of tan suit coverage.” Novelist Michael Marshall Smith described the wardrobe decision as “deep cut trolling.” A less confrontational explanation is that the suit, which Harris paired with a white lavalière blouse, was a fun allusion to an ultimately trivial piece of political history. In a slow August 2014 news week, media outlets embraced tan-gate with headlines like “Yes We Tan!” and “The Audacity of Taupe” (playing on Obama’s slogan and memoir, respectively) and digging up old images of Republican President Ronald Reagan wearing a similar shade. Indeed, if this DNC had been a week later, Harris could have hit the 10-year anniversary on the nose and really set social media ablaze. Such a nod would be in keeping with a presidential campaign that has thus far benefited from seemingly intentional, meme-able cultural references — from Harris’ embrace of Charli XCX’s “Brat” green to campaign hats that appeared to resemble those produced by pop star Chappell Roan. Of course, the choice of shade may have been purely coincidental. It was not even the only time Harris wore a tan suit in the past week, having done so in Maryland last Thursday when she appeared alongside President Joe Biden for the first time since he announced he will not stand for re-election (though, that time, she paired the two-piece with a black top a chunky gold necklace). Several online commentators also argued that her DNC outfit was darker than Obama’s, and was in fact camel, not tan. French label Chloé, whose creative director Chemena Kamali custom-designed the wool two-piece, simply described the shade as “brown.” Color aside, there was plenty else to be read into Harris’ choice of outfit. For one, it marks what appears to be her blossoming relationship with Chloé and Kamali, who in May dressed the vice president in a custom floor-length gown and matching jacket cape for a White House state dinner. The emerging partnership may be mutually beneficial. Chloé is having something of a cultural moment, with Kamali garnering praise for reinterpreting the codes of modern womenswear since taking the helm in October. In many ways, Harris is her ideal model: A powerful woman of color aiming to dress for an office that has, until now, only known menswear. For Harris, meanwhile, associating with the French label may help subtly rebut her reputation for unadventurous dressing. Since taking office in 2020, she has sported many variations of the same pantsuit, in various muted colors and for all manner of occasions. But while her DNC suit was still broadly a signature Harris cut in a safe, inoffensive shade, Chloé’s wide lapels and gently flared, floor-length pants made it feel somehow less corporate. This may be as far as Harris pushes the envelope. And perhaps for good reason. Hillary Clinton, who took to the DNC stage on Monday wearing a not-too-dissimilar shade of cream, wrote in her 2017 memoir: “As a woman running for president, I liked the visual cue that I was different from the men but also familiar. A uniform was also an anti-distraction technique: since there wasn’t much to say or report on what I wore, maybe people would focus on what I was saying instead.” With Harris set to deliver her keynote convention speech on Thursday, she may, similarly, be hoping her early tan-suited cameo satisfies style commentators and leaves her politics to do the talking."
Analysis: Biden tells America ‘I gave my best to you’ as he places his legacy in Harris’ hands | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:22 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T06:19:31.335Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/biden-speech-analysis/index.html,"Awash in his party’s love, President Joe Biden finally did become that bridge to a new generation of leaders. He movingly performed the most profound act a politician in a democracy can undertake — willingly handing over power — as he ceded the leadership of the party to Kamala Harris Monday at the Democratic National Convention. He capped a half-century long career, as a senator, a vice president and finally president, by citing a verse of a song called “American Anthem” that he said was important to his family. “What shall our legacy be, what will our children say, let me know in my heart when my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you,” he said. In a valedictory speech in Chicago that stretched past midnight on the east coast, Biden, 81, also placed that legacy — and what he sees as the fate of American democracy — in the hands of the woman he referred to as “vice president soon-to-be-president Kamala Harris.” “She’s tough, she’s experienced and she has enormous integrity,” he said. “Her story represents the best American story,” Biden said. “She’ll be a president our children can look up to. She’ll be a president respected by world leaders. … She will be a president we can all be proud of. She will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America’s future.” Biden’s gesture was especially poignant as he became the first sitting president to shelve a reelection race in more than five-and-a-half decades. He wanted deeply to win the second term that all presidents crave, but ultimately, under fierce pressure from colleagues he once considered loyalists, decided that his party and the country would be better off with someone younger. His self-sacrifice highlighted the exact opposite choice made by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who did everything he could to cling to power in defiance of voters’ will in 2020 and is now running again for a term he’s promised to dedicate to “retribution.” Hours earlier, Trump had echoed the language that drove America into its worst constitutional crisis of the modern era four years ago. He implied he’d only accept this year’s result if he thinks it’s free and fair. There was no evidence that was not the case last time, and there is no sign it will be different this year. Biden entered a colosseum of emotion when he slow-jogged on stage after his daughter’s Ashley’s introduction, then pulled out a handkerchief to dab his eyes. A thunderous ovation gave way to chants of “We love Joe!” and “Thank you Joe” from the crowd. Biden grabbed the podium, his arms wide, and absorbed the love. He turned and raised his hands to the those in the highest seats in the house. The president began by reprising his decision to run against Trump in 2020 — to ensure, he said, that “hate has no safe harbor,” then went on to cast a presidency that opened amid the horror of the Covid-19 pandemic as a stirring success that saved democracy and rebuilt “the backbone of America,” the middle class. Biden recalled the literal and metaphorical chill of his inauguration and the deep national crisis that prevailed at the time. “Now it’s summer, the winter has passed, and with a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed, democracy has delivered and now democracy must be preserved.” He summoned passion and conviction, proudly voicing words that would have been penned for a nominee’s address if he still led the ticket. His voice was strong — in fact, he spent much of the speech shouting. It was a booming contrast to the reedy tone that helped doom his career in his disastrous performance at the CNN debate against Trump in Atlanta two months ago. He rocked with anger when he spoke about the Republican nominee’s lies, what he sees as the ex-president’s besmirching of America’s image abroad and the toll wreaked by gun violence. Yet there were also reminders of why he will not claim a second term. Biden’s age was evident in the sometimes open-mouthed stare of an old man. His words often slurred together, or he tripped on a phrase. It’s been Biden’s fate to age in front of the eyes of the world. He’s no longer “Joey,” the beaming, barnstorming up-and-comer with the “dazzling Biden smile” as depicted in Richard Ben Cramer’s classic book “What it Takes.” He’s not even the dynamic wisecracking senator of the 2008 presidential primary run. The president is likely to deliver a farewell address before he leaves office in January. But Monday night was likely his last chance before such a captive live audience. There will be no more State of the Union addresses. This was not a final goodbye, but a president in the twilight of his days was writing the first history of his own administration. Biden was also generous to his chosen successor. All of his triumphs were hers too, he argued, including actions to protect “the freedom to vote, your freedom to love who you love and your freedom to choose.” When the crowd chanted “Thank you Joe,” Biden interrupted, “Thank Kamala too.” That probably pleased Trump, who has been trying to paint Biden’s presidency as an inflation-riddled global disaster – in which Harris is fully complicit. But by leaving now, and ending a contest between an 81-year-old and a 78-year-old, Biden has allowed his vice president and the new Democratic nominee to run with the aura of the change candidate. Trump is struggling to cope with it. In fact, he’s having a harder time letting Biden go than the Democratic Party is. Still, Harris faces a fearsome task. While she’s had a strong start and has reversed Biden’s polling deficits, she’s locked in a neck-and-neck race with Trump in swing states and the ex-president remains a feral campaigner. Perhaps the welcome in which Biden basked Monday will slake some of the reportedly still raw disappointment that he feels at how his storied career will end. It’s unlikely, however, to ease his inner circle’s sense of betrayal over party elected officials who acted to push him aside after his debate performance validated voter anxiety about his age. (The key figure in the effort to move him on, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN Monday she hoped Biden would “feel the love in this room, it’s overwhelming.” Biden later told reporters he hasn’t spoken to the former House speaker since his decision to bow out of the race.) For all the adulation that rained down from the rafters of the United Center from party members who now consider Biden a selfless hero and an indisputably great president, the effective ending of his reelection campaign by a party that believed he would lose represents an undeniable act of ruthlessness. There was just a sense in the short speech by first lady Jill Biden – when she said that her husband had to “dig deep into his soul” to decide not to run again – of the pain of the last month. And when Ashley Biden called her father one of “the most consequential leaders in history,” she seemed to be warning the country what it was about to lose. But the president insisted he was not angry at those who nudged him aside. In the closest he came to explaining his decision, he said, “It’s been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president. I love the job, but I love my country more.” Biden had gone from being the final speaker on the last night of the convention, a spot reserved for the nominee, to its warm-up act on the first night. And Air Force One was poised for an overnight flight west to his California vacation. The main business of the convention will now go on without the sitting president. The last few months have been cruel to Biden. Yet he has as deep an understanding of the treachery of fate as any political leader alive. His whole life has veered between great heights and tragedy, epitomized by the death of his wife and infant daughter just after he’d won election to the Senate, and then the death of his beloved son Beau from brain cancer while he was vice president. There’s long been a sense inside Biden’s hugely loyal corps of friends and family that he’s not gotten the credit he deserves in a Washington career that started when Richard Nixon was president. Even when he claimed the Democratic nomination in 2020, at a convention without the traditional balloon drop, and then won the presidency after a lifetime of pursuing it, he didn’t get the full fanfare amid Covid-19 precautions. But the love Biden received on Monday will change the way history remembers his career. Whenever there’s a Democratic convention, his speech will be recalled, alongside the fabled moments of the party’s past. And when the achievements he proudly proclaimed Monday have faded, Biden will be remembered for generations — just like the first president, George Washington — as much for the way he left office as for what he did when he held it."
Jayden Daniels named as Washington Commanders starting quarterback | CNN,"Published 6:34 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T10:34:29.416Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/sport/jayden-daniels-washington-commanders-spt-intl/index.html,"The Washington Commanders have officially named rookie Jayden Daniels as their starting quarterback for the 2024 NFL season. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner – who played college football at Arizona State and Louisiana State University (LSU) – was selected second overall in the 2024 Draft as the franchise hopes to usher in a new era of quarterback play and stability. Daniels is set to be the team’s eighth Week 1 starting QB in as many years. “He’s ready and earned the right [to be the starter],” said Washington head coach Dan Quinn. “He’s really put in the work while being surrounded by some excellent teammates here.” Nine-year veteran Marcus Mariota is also on the Washington roster, but as the offseason progressed, it seemed to become clearer that Daniels would be declared QB1. Daniels is the second rookie QB to officially get the starting nod – No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams was announced as the Chicago Bears’ starter less than a month after the draft. The former Tigers star is set to play in his first regular season game on September 8 when the Commanders travel to Florida to take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in their 2024 opener. “It’s just a blessing that [Quinn] and [general manager Adam Peters] trust me to go out there and lead the team, lead the franchise to hopefully win some games,” said the 23-year-old. “So big-ups to them, it’s a blessing, something I dreamed about as a kid, to be at this moment, to experience this moment.” Daniels played his first three college seasons at Arizona State before transferring to LSU. He is fresh off an impressive 2023 campaign where he established himself as one of the nation’s top quarterback prospects and won the Heisman, awarded annually to the most outstanding college player. Per the NFL, he is the third LSU player to win the award after Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow (2019) and Billy Cannon (1959). He is fourth all-time in passing yards at the school. While he is a major threat to defenses through the air, Daniels is also known for his running ability and is the only player in NCAA D1 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) history to pass for 12,000 yards and rush for 3,000 yards, per the Commanders. His willingness to carry the ball has led to some concerns over his durability after taking some big hits at college, including one against Alabama in November that placed him in concussion protocol. Daniels has impressed so far in limited preseason action. Over two games against the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, he completed 12-of-15 passes for 123 yards and rushed for an additional 13."
Trump heads to battleground Michigan for the first time since Harris shook up the presidential race | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T10:00:02.420Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/donald-trump-michigan-rally-harris/index.html,"Donald Trump’s counterprogramming to the Democratic convention continues Tuesday in Michigan, the former president’s first visit there since a seismic shakeup in the race altered the playing field in the Midwest battleground. A month ago, the Trump campaign projected confidence in the Wolverine State. At Trump’s nominating convention, Chris LaCivita, a top strategist to the former president, told a room full of reporters that Michigan stood out as the so-called Blue Wall state most likely to turn red in November. Days later, Trump landed triumphantly in Grand Rapids for his maiden rally with new running mate JD Vance. In what was also his first campaign event following the attempt on his life, Trump poked fun at the Democratic angst surrounding the top of their ticket. “Who would you most like to run against?” he asked a fully packed auditorium before rattling off rumored contenders to replace President Joe Biden, who was then still seeking reelection. When the former president floated Biden’s name, his supporters cheered loudest. But those hopes were soon dashed. The next day, Biden dropped out, and Trump’s opponent soon became Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Democrats will formally nominate Tuesday at their convention in Chicago. Harris’ entry into the race has shifted the political landscape in Michigan, just as it has across the nation. Polls that showed Trump with an advantage earlier this summer predict a far more competitive race heading into the fall. One recent survey of likely voters from The New York Times/Siena College measured Harris’ support at 50% compared with Trump at 46% in a two-way race. Displaying his unwillingness to fully come to terms with his fast-changing fortunes in Michigan, Trump recently spread a far-right conspiracy theory that Harris lied about her crowd sizes in the Detroit area despite overwhelming video and photographic evidence proving otherwise. Against this backdrop, Trump arrives in Michigan once again, this time appearing an hour outside Detroit in Livingston County. Surrounded mostly by counties that voted for Biden in 2020, Livingston broke strongly for Trump, giving him more than 60% of the vote four years ago. His margin, though, was 7 points smaller than in 2016 – one of many small turns against him that contributed to Biden flipping the state. Ahead of the visit, Harris’ campaign criticized Trump for choosing to rally supporters in Howell – the largest city in Livingston County – a month after White supremacists marched through the suburban community’s downtown. Local media in Michigan published pictures and videos of the incident, during which about a dozen masked individuals voiced support for the former president. In one video, demonstrators chanted, “We love Hitler. We love Trump.” The Republican state representative from the city called the public display “very disgraceful,” the Livingston Daily reported. Howell has a long, complicated history with race. According to a detailed timeline published by the paper, the grand dragon of the Michigan Ku Klux Klan settled on a farm just outside the city in the 1960s, a catalyst for decades of strife in Howell. A cross burning on the lawn of a Black couple rocked the city in the 1980s, and it was the site of a KKK rally in the 1990s. More recently, students at the local high school drew outrage for racist social media messages after their all-White basketball team beat a mixed-race team. “The racists and white supremacists who marched in Trump’s name last month in Howell have all watched him praise Hitler, defend neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, and tell far-right extremists to ‘stand back and stand by,’” Alyssa Bradley, the Harris campaign’s Michigan spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Trump’s actions have encouraged them, and Michiganders can expect more of the same when he comes to town (Tuesday).” None of Howell’s history, however, prevented Biden from visiting in 2021. Then, he appeared at the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 324 training facility to build support for his infrastructure package and domestic agenda. In a statement to CNN, Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president in Howell intends to “deliver a strong message on law and order, making it clear that crime, violence, and hate of any form will have zero place in our country when he is back in the White House.” “Did the media write this same story when Joe Biden visited Howell in 2021, or when Kamala Harris visits cities where racist protests and marches have occurred in the past? No, of course not,” Leavitt said. The Trump campaign sent CNN a list of recent stops made by Harris in locations where the Southern Poverty Law Center had recorded race-based incidents. Multiple sources close to the former president insisted that the campaign was unaware of the July events in Howell and chose the location for other reasons – for example, the county sheriff is a strong supporter of the former president, and the city is part of the critical Detroit media market. “Livingston County Sheriff’s Office is an incredible supporter of the campaign and the President’s policies,” one source familiar with the decision told CNN. “They’re emblematic of what we are talking about in Howell, Michigan – meaning they support pro-police policies, they support law and order, they support all the things that the president has done in his administration. The sheriff of that county is very, very outspoken about his support of President Trump.” Trump’s visit to Michigan is part of a four-day swing through key battlegrounds while Democrats meet in Chicago. He visited Pennsylvania on Monday and has appearances planned in North Carolina and Arizona later this week."
The truth behind Harris’ inflation and corporate greed claims | CNN Business,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T09:00:03.214Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/economy/inflation-kamala-harris-corporate-greed/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris has picked up the baton from President Joe Biden on the fight against so-called greedflation – the notion that the United States’ inflation crisis was exacerbated by excessive corporate profit-taking that marked up goods or shrunk their sizes and padded businesses’ bottom lines. Is there any truth to those claims? Sure, some. “We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high,” Harris said during a speech about the economy Friday in North Carolina. “Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades. And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren’t.” “I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case,” Harris said. But the Harris and Biden fight against greedflation and price gouging ignores three fundamental truths: Consumers play a pivotal role in the price of goods. Inflation had many causes, but corporate greed was not a primary factor. And the war on inflation has largely been won already. Make no mistake, some of the biggest food companies are raking in big fat profits. But here’s the kicker: Many reported even bigger profits when inflation was much lower. Take, for instance, PepsiCo. Last year, the company reported earning a very solid $9.1 billion in profit. That’s $2 billion more than what it made in 2020. But it’s still below the $12.5 billion profits it earned in 2018, when prices were rising at an annual pace below 3%. Similarly, Kroger, one of the nation’s largest supermarket chains, earned a bigger profit in 2018 compared to 2023. Kraft Heinz, meanwhile, made $10.9 billion in 2017. That’s almost four times as much as it earned last year. So Harris’ claim doesn’t quite hold up on the whole, though there are some recent examples where charging consumers more has fed higher corporate profits. Cal-Maine Foods, the largest egg producer in the US, saw its revenue double and profit surge 718% in the first quarter of last year because of sharply higher egg prices. “Vice President Harris believes it is wrong for bad actors to rake in record profits on the backs of increasing prices on consumer goods,” a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson told CNN. Before the hate mail piles up, let’s state the obvious: Wall Street’s gonna Wall Street. Companies will find any way and any reason to make more money off of customers. Big business is not your friend. So, yes, shrinkflation – that sneaky practice of keeping the price the same but shrinking the product – remains an annoying tendency. And greedflation is for sure a thing. We’re not just saying that: The San Francisco Federal Reserve had a whole study on it in May, and it noticed unusual price spikes that weren’t supported by the market for gasoline, cars, repair costs, laundry and personal care, among some other goods and services, when inflation started to spike in 2021. But here’s the thing: The US economy is not just a few markets. It’s a massive $29 trillion beast. In aggregate, corporate profit taking was not a leading cause of inflation – according to that same San Francisco Fed study. Those price markups in certain sectors weren’t out of the ordinary – and measuring the economy as a whole, greedflation was basically nonexistent. It’s always good to have a Fed study to help make your point, but it doesn’t take super smart economists to explain the case against price gouging as a leading cause of inflation. It’s really just Econ 101: Supply and demand set prices – not companies alone. And there’s no better evidence of that than what’s happening in retail right now: After years of rising prices, companies across the board in their quarterly financial calls with Wall Street analysts have said some customers are refusing to pay higher prices – so companies like Target, Starbucks and McDonald’s have cut prices and added deals to bring customers back. Rents have also come down in recent months because of a glut in new rental housing. That’s led a growing number of landlords to offer perks like a month of free rent or free parking to get people to sign on the dotted line. Good ol’ supply and demand. So if it wasn’t mean corporations, what actually caused inflation to spike? The story starts with Covid throwing the global economy into turmoil. The pandemic temporarily shut down the production of goods and created massive supply and demand imbalances. Many nations, including the United States, effectively turned their economies off for a short while and pumped trillions of dollars of stimulus into the economy to support businesses and workers. That gave workers an extra cushion in their bank accounts that artificially boosted consumer spending – a phenomenon that would last for several years. The Federal Reserve joined those efforts to boost demand across the economy by bringing interest rates down to near-zero levels for two years. That locked in wealth for generations, as Americans snatched up homes with a 30-year mortgage rate of just 2% to 3%. And those who had already bought a home were able to refinance at a similar rate. This all created the perfect storm for prices to shoot through the roof. Then, came Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which exacerbated the snarled global supply chain problem, driving prices even higher. And disruption and chaos in the Middle East sent oil higher for a while, too. No one likes paying higher prices, and polling consistently shows Americans hold a negative view of the economy because of inflation. But that’s no longer the economy’s biggest concern. Inflation has moderated so much that economists are now worried about jobs, not prices. After spiking above an annual increase of 9%, consumer inflation has fallen below 3% to a three-year low. A different measure of inflation, the Federal Reserve’s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, has fallen to within a half percentage point of the Fed’s target of 2% inflation. That means attacks on greedflation and price gouging, though perhaps good politics, may be bad policy. In fact, Harris’ plan to cap certain prices could create more problems than it solves, several economists told CNN. Corporations cannot be trusted to be good actors – that’s why regulations exist. But the war on inflation has been won. Consumers have spoken. Taking action now probably isn’t going to help much."
"After two decades of crossing paths, Obama will deliver a ‘forceful affirmation’ for Harris at the DNC | CNN Politics","Published 4:00 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T08:00:03.320Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/obama-dnc-speech/index.html,"If there was one lesson Kamala Harris took from the 2004 Democratic National Convention, it was to fuel up for some long days. “You definitely have to eat your Wheaties,” the then-39-year-old San Francisco district attorney told a crowd in Boston before heading off to what had become the week’s hottest ticket: a party celebrating the breakout keynote speaker, US Senate candidate Barack Obama of Illinois. Now, 20 years later, Obama – who went from star of that convention to the nation’s first Black president in a short four years – will speak on behalf of Harris, the party’s newly minted standard-bearer, delivering a “forceful affirmation that Harris is the right leader for the moment,” an adviser said. Arriving at this moment was indirect, painstaking and awkward for so many Democrats, considering the 2024 convention was long intended to be a celebration of President Joe Biden, Obama’s onetime vice president. Obama is among the party elders whose quiet maneuvering helped Biden realize that Democrats were headed to almost certain defeat if he stayed on the ticket. Harris’s quick ascension to the top of the Democratic Party would have been unlikely without the swift endorsement of Biden – whose own presidency was made possible in no small part by Obama. “She served him, and now he’s serving her and supporting her to be the president,” said Illinois Rep. Jonathan Jackson, who represents much of Chicago’s South Side. “He’s an honorable man, and history will be his best friend.” Yet in many ways, Harris’ rise to presidential nominee amounts to a continuation of the arc that began with Obama on that summer evening in Boston two decades ago. She is the first woman of color to become the nominee of a major American political party. And in only four weeks of rallying Democrats behind her, the energy fueling her candidacy and thunderous crowds chanting her name have drawn comparisons to Obama’s history-making 2008 run. “This is a candidate who’s energized the party in a way that I haven’t seen, certainly since ’08,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN. “I’ve not felt this kind of energy and electricity at any convention other than the one for Barack Obama.” For two barrier-breaking politicians – Obama, 63 and Harris, 59 – this year’s convention is a bookend 20 years in the making. As both climbed the Democratic ranks, they have intersected at various moments, each coming to represent, and embrace, an image of the party’s next generation, following in the footsteps of civil rights giants who came before them. It was 2009 when journalist Gwen Ifill drew this connection between the two, saying on the “Late Show with David Letterman”: “They call her the female Barack Obama.” They have never formally worked together, either in the Senate or in Obama’s administration, although Harris has written that Eric Holder, Obama’s first attorney general, asked if she’d be interested in replacing him when he stepped down. Obama played a key role in her election as California attorney general in 2010, endorsing her candidacy and arriving in Los Angeles for an October rally that helped boost her campaign. To a crowd of thousands, he described Harris as “a dear, dear friend of mine, so I want everybody to do right by her.” Two years later, Harris delivered a brief speech at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, as Obama was fighting for reelection against Mitt Romney. “We need to give him another four years. We need to move forward,” Harris told the crowd on the second night of the convention. “President Obama will fight for working families. He will fight to level the economic playing field and fight to give every American the same fair shot my family had.” Near the end of his second term, Obama took the rare step of weighing in on California’s all-Democratic Senate race. He not only endorsed Harris, but filmed television ads with the message: “Kamala Harris will be a fearless fighter for the people of California every single day.” Along the way, there have been moments of awkwardness. At a fundraiser in 2013, Obama deemed Harris the “best looking attorney general” in the country – an aside for which he would later call to apologize. While Harris recalls seeing Obama at the Boston convention, aides to the former president say his first memory of meeting Harris came a few months later during a California fundraising event for his 2004 Senate race. Four years later, as Obama was mounting a long-shot bid for the White House, Harris bucked many in her party to endorse him over then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, who had the early support of much of the Democratic establishment and many Black leaders. Harris flew to Springfield, Illinois, to watch him announce his candidacy; a photo from that February day in 2007 shows a windswept Harris – then the district attorney in San Francisco – not onstage or in a VIP room, but among the crowd, waiting for Obama to walk past and shake her hand. In the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, she packed her black down jacket and boots and trekked to Des Moines right after Christmas to join the ranks of Obama’s army of volunteers. “No job was too small for any of us,” Harris would later recall, “and we spent hours in freezing temperatures knocking on doors.” Behind one of those doors at a senior-living facility was a well-dressed Black woman who – when Harris asked whether she planned to caucus for Obama – told her flatly: “They not gonna let him win.” It was a moment Harris would later recall that changed her perspective. “Her response suggested to me that, because she had seen and experienced significant disappointments in her life, she didn’t want to have hope about electing the first black President, only to suffer disappointment when he didn’t win,” she wrote years later. On the evening of the caucuses, Harris was tasked with handing out pizza in the cold – and ran into the same woman, waiting in line wearing a fox stole. Obama won Iowa, but the battle against Clinton was far from over. A few months later, Harris was dispatched to San Jose to pitch Obama to California activists and superdelegates at the party’s state convention in March. She was virtually unknown on the national stage. The Clinton campaign’s surrogate at that gathering – the candidate’s husband, former President Bill Clinton – was decidedly not. “Can you say ‘gulp’?” Harris joked before the crowd. In her address, however, Harris tied her appearance on the same stage as a former president as in keeping with Obama’s candidacy. “When you really think about it, hasn’t that been, from the beginning, what this campaign to elect Barack Obama has been about?” she asked. “Hasn’t it been about the audacity to do things unimaginable?” When Harris launched her Democratic presidential campaign in 2019, she sought Obama’s counsel on her message and strategy. She had two meetings with him in Washington, aides said, and occasionally talked by phone. Obama offered similar advice to all candidates, including Biden, but offered no endorsement in the primary. As she campaigned across Iowa in a crowded field of candidates, Harris often invoked Obama’s grassroots support that propelled him to victory over Clinton. She sought to model her campaign after his, even announcing an “all in on Iowa” strategy. But she ultimately struggled to connect with voters who were drawn to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, then-South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and other rivals. “In good faith, I cannot tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do,” Harris said in a video message on December 3, 2019, as she dropped out of the race a month before voting began. Less than three months later, Biden roared from behind to seize the Democratic nomination. Harris quickly endorsed his candidacy and worked to smooth over animosity from their primary rivalry, derived in part from a debate-stage clash over busing and race. With Biden’s selection of Harris as his running mate, her trajectory to the White House resumed. While the Democratic convention here this week represents a passing of the torch from Biden to Harris – far sooner than he envisioned – it also underscores how her candidacy is forever intertwined with Biden and Obama. For whatever hard feelings Biden may harbor toward some longtime Democratic allies, his advisers insist that none are directed toward Harris and that he is committed to helping her win in November – an election that will still shape his legacy, too. And for the next 77 days, Obama has made clear to Harris that he will do whatever she needs in her quest to become the nation’s 47th president. His first task, aides said, comes Tuesday night at his convention speech, which he sees as an opportunity to make a case for Harris and Gov. Tim Walz, whom Obama admires and previously endorsed in his Minnesota races. For this moment, Harris is not expected to be in the audience listening to Obama as she was two decades ago in Boston. She’ll be taking a quick detour to a rally in Wisconsin, trying to follow in the footsteps of both Obama and Biden in winning that critical battleground state."
"Analysis: Where Harris has, and has not, rebuilt the Democratic coalition | CNN Politics","Updated 3:15 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T04:01:02.229Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/harris-coalition-2024-analysis/index.html,"The Harris coalition is coming into focus. When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee last month, her twin challenges were to shore up support with the groups where Biden was weak and to maintain his standing with the groups where he was relatively stronger. As she arrives at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week, a broad array of polls testify to her progress on both tests. In both national and battleground state surveys, she’s regained a solid amount of the ground that Biden had lost with such traditionally Democratic-leaning groups as Black and younger voters, and made a more modest recovery with Latinos. Simultaneously, in both national polls and surveys of the critical Rustbelt battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, she is matching or exceeding Biden’s showing among older and working-class Whites — two groups in which Biden had largely maintained his 2020 level of support before quitting the race. Harris’ performance on each of these fronts has allowed her to pass former President Donald Trump in most polling averages measuring each candidates’ overall national support. More importantly, it has reopened the electoral map, providing her more pathways to 270 Electoral College votes than Biden had before he left the race. Her gains among younger and non-White voters have allowed her to put back into play Sunbelt battlegrounds that Biden’s struggles among those voters had moved largely beyond his reach. And in the Rustbelt battlegrounds that represented Biden’s most plausible path to 270 Electoral College votes, Harris looks stronger than the president did because she’s gaining there too among younger and non-White voters while running at least as well as he did among Whites. But in the Rustbelt and Sunbelt alike, formidable challenges remain to this emerging “Kamala coalition.” Although Harris has demonstrably regained ground with younger, Black and Latino voters, in most polls she still lags below the levels Biden reached with them in 2020. It’s far from certain Harris can win any of the major Sunbelt battlegrounds — North Carolina and Georgia in the Southeast, Arizona and Nevada in the Southwest — unless she can come even closer to those previous Democratic benchmarks. And the remaining voters she needs may be tougher to corral than those that have already returned to her. In the industrial states, she faces the challenge of defending the beachheads she’s established with working-class and older Whites, who comprise a much larger share of the vote in these places than in the Sunbelt battlegrounds. These White voters without a college degree will likely be the most receptive audience to the GOP arguments that Harris is soft on crime and immigration, and an extreme “woke” cultural liberal. Mark Graul, a veteran GOP operative in Wisconsin, predicted that Harris’ support with these voters will erode as Republicans bombard them with advertising. “I think the surveys we are seeing right now are at or near her peak” with blue-collar White voters, he said. “If the Trump campaign does its job … that kind of messaging is going to drive those working-class White voters who may have been open to the excitement of ‘Hey, we got rid of Biden and I don’t like either of those guys’ to jump back [to Donald Trump].” Yet it is significant that more working-class voters did not immediately move back to Trump in polls when Democrats replaced their 81-year-old White male nominee with a younger woman who would be the first Black woman and Indian American president. That suggests Harris’ race and gender do not render her intrinsically unacceptable to a larger group of these working-class Whites than the share that find it difficult to support any Democrat. That doesn’t mean Republicans ultimately can’t peel away more of those voters from her; but it does mean they will have to dislodge them, voter by voter, with their arguments and ads, rather than benefiting from an instinctive recoil to a woman of color nominee. For now, polls generally show Harris generating at least as much support among working-class White voters as Biden did, both in his 2020 race and the polling before he left the 2024 race. Biden didn’t run great with working-class White voters in 2020, but he did improve a few points over Hillary Clinton’s performance in 2016, reaching about one-third of their vote, according to the exit polls and the Pew Research Center’s well-respected validated voters study. Most significantly, the exit polls found that Biden gained over Clinton among them in Michigan and Wisconsin (where he carried about two-fifths of them) and Pennsylvania (where he won about one-third). That improvement, combined with a parallel uptick in support from college-educated White voters, allowed him to recapture all three states, after Trump in 2016 had dislodged them from what I called the “blue wall” — the 18 states that voted Democratic in each presidential election from 1992 through 2012. Amid all his other problems this year, polls had shown Biden largely holding as much support among these blue-collar White voters as he did in his first contest with Trump. Harris today looks even a bit stronger. National surveys released in August by Marquette Law School, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist and Fox News Channel each showed her drawing 36-40% of non-college White voters, a share higher than Biden’s in 2020 and back in the range of Barack Obama’s performance in 2008 and 2012. (The Washington Post/ABC/Ipsos poll released Sunday did not find Harris quite as strong, but still reported her slightly surpassing Biden’s performance among Whites without degrees.) New York Times/Siena College surveys found her matching or beating Biden’s 2020 showing in the exit polls with non-college educated Whites in each of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; another round of surveys from those pollsters released last weekend found her beating Biden’s share with those blue-collar Whites in North Carolina and Georgia, and exactly equaling them in Arizona and Nevada. White men without a college degree could be an especially difficult audience for Harris, but many Democrats are hopeful she can remain competitive in these communities overall by maintaining relatively strong support among blue-collar White women. Both Biden and Hillary Clinton won only about 35% of them in the exit polls. But Democrats see an opportunity to improve on that since many of those women support legal abortion. With the concerns about Biden’s age and capability eliminated as a factor, Democrats also hope that more of those women may feel free to express their unease about Trump’s character and behavior: in a recent national New York Times/Siena poll, almost exactly half of White women without a college degree said they did not believe Trump had the temperament to succeed as president, according to detailed results provided by Siena. Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster with long experience in Wisconsin, argues that defending Harris against the GOP’s culturally based attacks on issues like crime and immigration aimed at these working-class White women is imperative for her campaign. Harris’ vulnerability to Republican attacks overall is less “than Biden had,” Maslin said. “But we are dreaming if we don’t think there is still some vulnerability. They have much better ground that they are going to get to here.” Support for legal abortion and distaste for Trump’s behavior and leadership style could also allow Harris to expand on Biden’s already substantial margins among White women with at least a four-year college degree. It’s easy to forget that the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices overturned the constitutional right to abortion only after the 2020 election, when Biden already carried between 54-59% of college-educated White women, according to the major data sources. With abortion more politically relevant now than then, Harris has a good chance to exceed those numbers in 2024, many strategists in both parties believe. Conversely, she will be challenged to preserve Biden’s 2020 support among college-educated White men, who are a receptive group for Trump’s arguments that, as a business executive, he can better manage the economy. But if she can avoid, or at least minimize, erosion with those men (who split almost evenly in 2020), she will be strongly positioned to improve over Biden’s 2020 showing with all college-educated Whites. Already the Marquette, Marist and Fox national polls, and the New York Times/Siena survey across the three big Rustbelt battlegrounds all showed her on track to exceed Biden’s 2020 showing with these voters. Running that well among college-educated White voters in places such as the suburbs of Philadelphia and Milwaukee, Oakland County outside Detroit, and Madison, Wisconsin, could allow her to survive some erosion compared to Biden in 2020 among Whites without a degree and still hold those three states. While matching Biden’s relative strength among White voters is central to Harris’ prospects in the Rustbelt, reversing his weaknesses with younger and diverse voters is the key to her chances in the Sunbelt. Harris has also made progress on that task. But on this part of her test, her grade is more clearly an incomplete. Over the past few weeks, surveys by Democratic operatives, or groups allied with the party, have all found Harris improving notably over Biden’s showing before he left the race with such core party constituencies as Latinos, young people, Black men and single women. But in each case, the surveys still showed her lagging Biden’s level of support with those groups in 2020. The recent New York Times/Siena surveys likewise showed Harris moving back past 80% among Black voters in both the industrial Midwest and Southeast but still lagging the roughly 90% or more Biden won last time in all those states. These polls also found Harris matching Biden’s 2020 share among Latinos in Arizona, but still substantially underperforming in Nevada. Page Gardner, a veteran strategist for progressive groups, who sponsored the work on single women, explained their continued dip in support from 2020 by citing factors that are relevant to all the Democratic-leaning groups that had drifted away from Biden. The problem, Gardner said, starts with “economic factors – prices, with housing a particularly acute concern.” But the shortfall extends to a broader sense that the Biden years have not produced as much progress as these voters expected. “Although excitement and motivation has increased, there is an underlying sense of discouragement regarding things actually changing for them,” Gardner said. “Like so many others in the electorate, majorities of these women feel like they are losing power.” Polling by Equis Research, a Democratic firm that recently conducted an in-depth survey of Latinos across the battleground states, found Harris gaining among both Latino women and men, but still running much better among the former than the latter. Carlos Odio, the Equis co-founder and senior vice president for research, said he believes Harris eventually could equal or surpass Biden’s 2020 Latino performance, but acknowledges she remains below that level now in the group’s polling. “She clearly has gotten a good will boost; people like her; people like that she represents a change; they generally have good feelings about her,” he said. “But especially for the voters who are still up for grabs, they are waiting to see what more she has to say on the economy.” While “her entrance answers a lot of voters’ demands for something other than [the choices] they had before,” Odio added, “there’s always a concern with an unknown quantity: What do they represent, does she have any wacky views? I think a lot of what you are going to see from this campaign is reassurance.” On Monday, the Black Men Vote PAC released a survey that likewise found Harris gaining across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with the men they focus on but Trump still roughly matching his improved performance with them in 2020, and showing the potential for even greater gains with younger men. “These findings indicate that there is still work to be done to secure the full support of this critical voter bloc,” the group said in a release announcing the results. With young people, the story is similar. While surveys had often found Biden consistently underperforming vs. Trump among younger voters, the latest national and state polls generally show Harris restoring a solid advantage with them. But, as with the other groups, most surveys did not yet show her matching Biden’s roughly 3-in-5 support last time among adults younger than 30. On a recent episode of The Daily Blast podcast with Greg Sargent, John Della Volpe, a Harvard Kennedy School expert on youth voting who is advising a super PAC trying to build support among young people for Democrats, said a recent poll he conducted found Harris drawing just over half of younger voters against Trump, after the former president stunningly led Biden with them in the group’s previous survey. “I don’t think that she would be comfortable with [that] margin a month or two months from now, honestly,” Della Volpe said. “This needs to get somewhere into the mid-50s, which … is what I think is required to feel comfortable about an Electoral College victory in November.” The recent swing state polls released by a bipartisan team of pollsters for the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter underscored how these shifts have moved Harris back into contention, but hardly into a safe position, across the battlegrounds. The surveys found Harris numerically ahead of Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, tied in Georgia and numerically behind only in Nevada. In May, Cook’s polling found Trump ahead or tied with Biden in all seven states. Patrick Toomey, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with a GOP partner, said gains with a broad range of groups had propelled Harris past Trump. “Harris is in a stronger position than Biden was in May because her candidacy has won over a mix of non-college White voters in Rust Belt States … and college-educated Whites in the Sun Belt while posting gains among Black women and Latina voters across” all the states, he said. Still, like the polling by Democratic groups, the Cook battleground state surveys showed Harris underperforming with Black, Latino and young voters. Harris ran no better among Latino and Black men across the battleground states than Biden did in May, Toomey said. These trends leave the battleground states within reach for Trump, if he can discipline himself to mount a cohesive campaign against Harris as too liberal and inexperienced, argued Greg Strimple, the Republican pollster on the Cook survey. “There is a path for Trump,” Strimple said. “It’s just whether he can take it.” Harris’ gains have virtually eradicated one previously critical category in the race: the heralded “double haters” who disliked both Trump and Biden. Multiple surveys, such as recent national polls by the Pew Research Center, ABC/Washington Post and Monmouth College, as well as Equis’ survey of Latino voters, have found that there are far fewer “double hater” voters negative on both Harris and Trump than there were voters negative on both Biden and Trump. That decline reflects Harris’ success at winning back many from the large pool of Democratic-leaning voters who could not support another Biden term. “These were Democratic voters that we’ve lost,” said Stanley Greenberg, the long-time Democratic pollsters. “They are people that were voting strongly Democratic and had been alienated by inflation, and Biden just couldn’t get a hearing with them. Most of her gains have come from people who have been leaning into voting Democratic and want to see her succeed.” Harris’ success at recapturing these Democratic-leaning younger, single and non-White voters alienated from Biden while holding his beachhead among older and working-class Whites has created a coalition strong enough to contest all the major battlegrounds, after many of them seemed already lost to Trump. But the continued limits on her support on both sides of this ledger means she isn’t guaranteed victory in any of the pivotal states. “The trajectory before Biden’s withdrawal is that it looked very likely Donald Trump was going to be elected to a second term,” said Bryan Bennett, the senior director of polling and analytics at the Hub Project, a progressive organization. “Harris entering the equation has returned the race to a jump ball.” That’s an inherently precarious position. But compared to their situation just one month ago, the Democrats gathering in Chicago this week will take those odds in a heartbeat."
Hillary Clinton casts Harris in the lineage of female political firsts | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:13 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2024",2024-08-20T04:04:51.602Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris-history/index.html,"Hillary Clinton highlighted Monday the history that Kamala Harris could make if she becomes the first woman elected president, referencing the proverbial glass ceiling the former secretary of state tried to but failed to break during her 2016 campaign for the White House. “Together, we put a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling,” Clinton told the crowd at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago about her historic run eight years ago. “On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris, raising her hand, and taking the oath of office as our 47th president of the United States.” Clinton – the first woman to capture a major-party nomination for president – said Democrats were “writing a new chapter in America’s story” as she launched into a history of women seeking higher office, mentioning two former New York congresswomen – Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to run for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman nominated for vice president. Harris, who was officially nominated earlier this month, is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. Throughout her remarks Monday, Clinton drew comparisons between her own journey to the nomination and Harris’. She also discussed the wave of political activity among women prompted by her 2016 defeat to Donald Trump. Clinton won the popular vote against Trump, but lost the Electoral College. “Nearly 66 million Americans voted for a future where there are no ceilings on our dreams and afterwards, we refused to give up on America,” Clinton said. “Millions marched, many ran for office. We kept our eyes on the future. Well, my friends, the future is here.” The former first lady – whose husband, Bill Clinton, is expected to speak at the convention Wednesday – said that Harris “will fight to lower costs for hardworking families, open the doors wide for good paying jobs, and yes, she will restore abortion rights nationwide.” Clinton also offered up arguments against Trump, including taking jabs at his legal issues.  The former secretary said that Trump “fell asleep at his own trial, and when he woke up, he made his own kind of history – the first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions.” At one point, the crowd started shouting, “Lock him up,” in a notable – and ironic – moment. Trump’s campaign rallies in 2016 were frequently interrupted by his supporters’ chants of “Lock her up” in reference to Clinton, whom the FBI investigated over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. No charges were filed against her. As the audience chanted Monday night, Clinton nodded and continued speaking. In veiled attacks against Trump, Clinton argued that Harris “reveres our Medal of Honor recipients” and “won’t be sending love letters to dictators.” Trump on Thursday, when talking about giving GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s top civilian honor, said that it was “actually, much better” than the Medal of Honor “because everyone (who) gets the congressional Medal of Honor, that’s soldiers. They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead.” Clinton, who faced attacks from Trump about her laugh in the 2016 campaign, pushed back against Trump for similarly mocking Harris’ laugh, and her name. “We have to fight for Kamala as she will fight for us. Because you know what? It still takes a village to raise a family, heal a country and win a campaign,” she said."
Harris proposes raising corporate tax rate to 28% to help pay for campaign promises | CNN Politics,"Published 11:43 PM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-20T03:43:57.390Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/harris-corporate-tax-rate-raise-proposal/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris will push to increase the corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21%, her campaign said Monday, the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Coming days after she unveiled a four-part economic package that would provide tax relief to working and middle-class Americans, the corporate tax proposal marks Harris’ first effort to detail how she would pay for her policy platform should she win the presidential election. “As President, Kamala Harris will focus on creating an opportunity economy for the middle class that advances their economic security, stability, and dignity,” campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement. “Her plan is a fiscally responsible way to put money back in the pockets of working people and ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.” The rate hike, which is in line with what President Joe Biden has supported but less than the 35% rate that Harris proposed during her 2020 presidential campaign, would reverse a major component of former President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That law reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% – and it doesn’t expire, unlike the TCJA’s individual income tax provisions, which lapse after 2025. Raising the corporate tax rate would reduce the deficit by $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The watchdog group estimates the price tag of Harris’ economic package would be $1.7 trillion over the next decade. Trump, on the other hand, has said he would cut taxes on businesses, as well as provide relief for Americans. Trump would like to lower the corporate tax rate to as low as 15% – though he acknowledged in an interview last month with Bloomberg Businessweek that reducing it that much would be hard. Last Friday, Harris proposed a populist economic platform, which includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and child rearing more affordable. It would provide tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans, largely by restoring the American Rescue Plan Act’s enhanced child tax credit and by creating a new $6,000 credit for children in their first year of life."
"As his campaign sharpens attacks on Harris, Trump remains fixated on Biden | CNN Politics","Published 10:52 PM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-20T02:52:49.756Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/trump-attacks-harris-biden/index.html,"As Democrats prepared for a deeply symbolic night to mark the passing of the generational torch, former President Donald Trump remained fixated on his former opponent. Trump’s campaign has pushed sharply against Vice President Kamala Harris, launching a weeklong swing-state tour in tightly controlled environments with small crowds. The goal is to counterprogram the Democratic convention by leveling the kinds of policy-based attacks the former president’s allies have urged him to focus on in recent weeks. But for Trump, who advisers say left the GOP convention confident of a comfortable victory in November, letting President Joe Biden go hasn’t been easy. One adviser, asked if he expected Trump to watch Biden’s speech Monday evening, said simply: “Of course.” He posts on social media about Biden’s decision to step down – and the Democratic pressure that drove the decision – with regularity. He frequently floated, with no evidence or credibility, the idea that Biden would try to step back into the race until a virtual Democratic roll call nominating Harris made that scenario impossible. “I think he’s a little nostalgic for where things were a month ago,” said a Republican who has spoken to Trump in the last few days. “Understandably.” Trump’s first battleground-state event of the week, in front of roughly 150 people in a York, Pennsylvania, manufacturing plant earlier Monday, marked a clear – if somewhat nonplussed – effort to stick closely to the economic and energy-focused remarks his advisers wanted him to give. But Trump asked to add a section to the policy remarks a few hours before the event. House Republicans had released a lengthy report making the case for Biden’s impeachment. After months of investigation, the report largely fell flat and contained no evidence that Biden, as vice president, had engaged in activities to benefit his son’s business partners. Trump, however, insisted on adding paragraphs to his remarks summarizing his view of the findings. “I said, ‘No, I want to talk about it, just briefly.’ It’s so sad, because he’s going to be making his speech tonight, and they don’t call him ‘Crooked Joe’ for no reason,” Trump said in York. The former president also levied personal attacks against Harris during his speech and at one point focused on her father, Donald Harris, a retired Stanford University economist. “He’s a Marxist professor. Can you imagine? Does anyone know that? I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden. I wonder if they knew where she comes from, where she came from, what her ideology is. But you could see it a little bit by this wack job,” Trump said of Harris and her father. The comments about where Harris “comes from” follow Trump’s repeated false attacks on the vice president’s racial identity. He falsely said last month that Harris – the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India – was “only promoting Indian heritage” and that she only recently “happened to turn Black.” Harris has long embraced and discussed her Black identity, while also honoring her Indian heritage. Trump also attacked Harris’ laugh, which he has mocked repeatedly. “Between his movement and her laugh, there’s a lot of craziness,” Trump said of Biden and Harris. “I’d say a step further than weird. Weird is a nice word by comparison,” the former president added, referencing the recent attack line from Harris and other Democrats that Trump and running mate JD Vance are “weird.” As Trump stood on the floor of the manufacturing plant in York, seeking to portray himself as an ally of manufacturing workers, he said Harris’ economic policies amounted to a “regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America.” Trump also falsely claimed that he “won” the classified documents case and that he was “totally exonerated” after US District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case against him. Cannon ruled last month that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, violated the Constitution. But Cannon did not rule on whether Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper or not. In a battleground state where natural gas drives much of the economy, the former president on Monday repeatedly attacked Harris over her past support for a ban on fracking, saying that she was “totally a non-fracker.” As an unsuccessful candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Harris backed a ban on fracking, but her campaign now says she no longer supports such a prohibition."
"Conservative Republican endorses Harris, calls Trump a threat to democracy | CNN Politics","Updated 9:43 PM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-19T16:00:09.565Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/conservative-republican-endorses-harris-calls-trump-a-threat-to-democracy/index.html,"Retired federal appeals court Judge J. Michael Luttig, a prominent conservative legal scholar put on the bench by President George H.W. Bush, is endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump, whose candidacy he describes as an existential threat to American democracy. It will be the first time Luttig, a veteran of two Republican administrations, has voted for a Democrat. “In the presidential election of 2024 there is only one political party and one candidate for the presidency that can claim the mantle of defender and protector of America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law,” Luttig wrote in a statement obtained exclusively by CNN. “As a result, I will unhesitatingly vote for the Democratic Party’s candidate for the Presidency of the United States, Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.” Luttig played a now famous role in persuading then-Vice President Mike Pence to defy Trump and certify the 2020 presidential election. In a series of tweets drafted at the request of Pence’s attorney, Luttig spelled out in stark terms the legal rationale for Pence to reject the former president’s attempt to overturn Joe Biden’s victory. Since then, Luttig has emerged as a preeminent constitutional critic of Trump. In endorsing Harris, Luttig argues that partisan distinctions must, in this election, be set aside in order to prevent the “singularly unfit” Trump from returning to the White House. “In voting for Vice President Harris, I assume that her public policy views are vastly different from my own,” Luttig writes, “but I am indifferent in this election as to her policy views on any issues other than America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law, as I believe all Americans should be.” Luttig’s scathing rebuke of Trump and endorsement of Harris underscores the depths of divisions between Reagan-and Bush-era Republicans and the modern, Trump-dominated GOP. The former judge is just as unsparing a critic of the Republican party as he is of Trump, whom together he says have launched “the war on America’s Democracy.” The corrosive effects, he adds, will echo through generations. “Because of the former president’s continued, knowingly false claims that he won the 2020 election, millions of Americans no longer have faith and confidence in our national elections, and many never will again,” Luttig writes.  “Many Americans – especially young Americans, tragically – have even begun to question whether constitutional democracy is the best form of self-government for America.” The stakes, Luttig argues, are as high now as in the late 18th century, when the country’s founders and authors of the US Constitution – including Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, typically political foes – joined together to voice concern over the potential emergence of an authoritarian demagogue. “The time for America’s choosing has come,” Luttig writes. “It is time for all Americans to stand and affirm whether they believe in American Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law, and want for America the same – or whether they do not.” Though this will be Luttig’s first time pulling the lever for a Democrat in any election, he has, in the aftermath of January 6, 2021, come out in support of some decisions by the Biden administration. He wholeheartedly endorsed the 2022 nomination of now-Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the high court, even calling out Republicans who said they would not vote to confirm her. “The President knew at the time that there were any number of highly qualified black women on the lower federal courts from among whom he could choose – including Judge Jackson – and Republicans should have known that the President would nominate one of those supremely qualified black women to succeed Justice Breyer,” he wrote at the time. Luttig now joins a number of high-profile Republicans endorsing Harris, including former members of Congress Joe Walsh, Barbara Comstock and Adam Kinzinger. Kinzinger, now a CNN contributor, will have a high-profile speaking slot this week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, also a CNN contributor, endorsed Harris at the end of July in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed. Her campaign, he wrote, was “the best vehicle toward preventing another stained Trump presidency.” Speaking to CNN, Luttig said his decision to publicly back Harris was a matter of knowing “right from wrong” – and acting in accordance. “In my faith, we believe that we will one day answer for our wrongs. I have always tried to live my life in anticipation of that day. Imperfectly, to be sure.  But I have tried,” an emotional Luttig said. “My endorsement of the Vice President was the right thing to do.  It would have been wrong for me to stay silent, and I believe I would have one day had to answer for that silence. “It’s really that simple.”"
Kamala Harris begins standard planning for presidential transition | CNN Politics,"Published 7:19 PM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-19T23:19:20.824Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/president-transition-kamala-harris/index.html,"Kamala Harris filed paperwork Monday morning to begin planning for a potential presidential transition – a standard move for a non-incumbent candidate but also another measure of her rushed campaign launch. Former President Donald Trump announced his own transition committee last week. To lead the effort, CNN has learned that Harris is tapping the same person who ran the process for Joe Biden four years ago: Yohannes Abraham, the current Indonesia-based US ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Abraham and Harris worked together closely on the last transition and then when he was the first chief of staff to the National Security Council under Biden. Abraham will not start the transition work until he leaves the State Department. He is expected to leave his ambassador job soon and move back to Washington. Abraham, who did not respond when contacted by CNN for comment, has earned praise for the job he is leaving behind. “Yohannes is one of our best,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on a visit to Laos at the end of July. “When he picks up the phone, Washington listens, in no small part because he used to be on the other side of the line in Washington himself.” The Harris transition operation will be hiring other staff, with Covington & Burling LLP – the law firm of former Attorney General Eric Holder, which ran the running mate vetting process for the Democratic nominee – helping advise how best to set up the effort. The purpose of a transition committee is to ease any new administration taking control of the massive federal government, prepare senior aides for jobs and structures they may not be familiar with and facilitate a smoother transition for whoever is sworn in at noon on January 20, 2025. But it’s a tricky balance for Harris, who is running as both an extension of Biden’s administration and a fresh start. A person familiar with the vice president’s planning told CNN that the transition apparatus will not be making personnel decisions before the election. It also will not have a role in policymaking for Harris, which remains the domain of the vice president’s office and the campaign. Harris was facing a deadline of next week to file the transition paperwork. The person also added that, as with the transition processes run by Biden and by Barack Obama in 2008, “this transition apparatus will focus on operational considerations in the pre-election period, such as making sure that sufficient vetting capacity exists post-election.” Eventually, the transition committee for the winning candidate will become the nexus for everything from picking Cabinet secretaries to hiring for lower-level jobs to getting arms around information and major decisions that will face the new president."
Polling data shows Trump campaign’s difficulty in framing the conversation around Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"Published 2:11 PM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-19T18:11:56.097Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/august-breakthrough-polling-project/index.html,"Heading into the Democratic National Convention, new data suggests that the Trump campaign’s initial attempts to frame the conversation about Vice President Kamala Harris have so far gained relatively little traction. Instead, the public’s attention has remained largely focused around the Democratic nominee’s selection of a running mate and other facets of her campaign – a dynamic that could be reinforced for another week as the Democratic Party gathers in Chicago. Meanwhile, the public conversation around the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, remains relatively unfocused in the quieter aftermath of a month of major news stories surrounding him. The Breakthrough is a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential candidates throughout the campaign. Charting the words used to describe each candidate, the project finds that in the weeks since Harris entered the race, the word “campaign” has been mentioned more frequently regarding Harris than Trump – a break from earlier in the summer, when the Trump campaign drew as much or more attention than President Joe Biden’s campaign. In the most recent survey – conducted August 9-12 by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan –Americans were more likely to report hearing about Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the Democratic vice presidential slot (and other news about the vice presidency, including her own current role) than any other topic. Slightly fewer mentioned other aspects of the Harris campaign, a broad category that includes the new ticket’s rally tour, fundraising totals, poll numbers or ads. “I’ve seen her more on the news lately,” one poll respondent wrote. Far fewer mentioned the border, and there was even less mention of the economy – two traditionally GOP-friendly campaign issues on which the Trump campaign has criticized Harris. The most prominent negative news about Harris to break through was criticism that she has been reluctant to hold news conferences or engage with the media. “She refuses to answer any questions from the media and I don’t know any of her ideas for office,” another respondent wrote. At the same time, the conversation around the former president is even more scattered, leaving the Trump campaign in the unusual position of fighting to carve out space in the public’s attention. In the aftermath of a flood of high-profile news featuring him –- the assassination attempt, his VP pick and the Republican convention – more recent developments, including his calls for more debates and his Mar-a-Lago press conference, have gained some notice. But the discussion around him has yet to coalesce around any new central theme. In that absence, some criticism of Trump is more prominent than it had been, with the word “lie” the fourth-most-mentioned word about him. “I [haven’t] seen much new lately,” wrote one respondent. “Just keep seeing clips of him saying that Harris is crazy and such.” A few others had followed news specifically about the Trump campaign’s messaging efforts, with one writing that they’d heard Trump “is struggling how to approach campaigning now that Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee.” Overall, public attention to both parties’ candidates is down slightly from the fever pitch of earlier this summer, when nearly 9 in 10 Americans were following news about Biden and Trump. But more than three-quarters of the public have heard something about Harris in the past week, a much higher profile than she held before assuming the nomination, and on par with Trump’s numbers. By contrast, fewer than half in any given week said they’d heard anything about independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (In the latest wave of data, much of the discussion that did exist around Kennedy focused on, as one respondent put it, “[s]omething kooky about a bear.”) The poll also looks at tone, a metric that incorporates the net tenor of the sentiments Americans are using to describe what they’re hearing. That’s distinct from the favorability ratings often seen in polling, which ask respondents directly to share their own opinions of a candidate. The results suggest that the reset in campaign dynamics following Harris’ entrance into the race – including a rise in Democratic enthusiasm for the race seen in other polling – is so far continuing to hold. While Trump’s scores on this metric have been underwater throughout the summer, he largely fared better than Biden, whose campaign was largely defined in its final days by a poorly received debate performance and by questions about his health and his viability within the Democratic Party. By contrast, Harris’ score on this metric has remained largely neutral in recent weeks, buoyed by positive numbers within her own party. “Have had a gleeful time with friends and like minded people that her campaign seems to be running so well,” wrote one poll respondent, who recounted watching multiple Harris rallies and receiving texts from her campaign. “We love her choice of running mate.” The Breakthrough survey project, which will run throughout the 2024 campaign, provides a different lens on the campaign than much other election polling, demonstrating which current events, campaign narratives and media stories break through to the American public amid a perennially busy news environment. In past elections, the responses to that question highlighted overarching campaign dynamics, ranging from the looming presence of the coronavirus pandemic during  the 2020 campaign, to the way mentions of Hillary Clinton’s email server dominated conversations throughout her 2016 campaign.

Harris and Trump both hate inflation. Their economic proposals could cause prices to go higher | CNN Business,"Updated 11:19 AM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-19T10:30:02.524Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/economy/trump-harris-inflation/index.html,"Inflation is slowly moving back to what’s considered a more sustainable pace, but for many Americans, it’s hard to take solace: The post-pandemic spike in price hikes drastically increased the cost of living. Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have pledged to bring those costs down. But some economists warn that the candidates’ aims — including an initial economic policy laid out Friday by Harris and the economic-related statements made in recent months by Trump — could push prices higher … and in the latter’s case, possibly much higher. Both candidates’ plans would probably raise the deficit and increase demand, including through government spending and tightening the labor market, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN via email. But Trump’s plan, or what he’s so far released of it, presents more risks, Brusuelas said. “Both inflation and the risk to permanently higher inflation are greater with the Trump proposal.” Analysis released Friday of Harris’ “Agenda to Lower Costs for American Families” from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that her proposed policies could increase deficits by $1.7 trillion over a decade (and could grow to $2 trillion if the housing policies were made permanent). The bulk of those costs, at an estimated $1.2 trillion, comes from Harris’ proposed expansion of the Child Tax Credit. “Where we’re looking now, I think it’s likely that both campaigns are going to be in the red (fiscally) for their proposals,” Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the CRFB, told CNN. “Higher deficits in the near term means more inflationary pressures, which either means people are going to see more cost increases at the grocery store, the pump, in their houses, or it means the Federal Reserve is going to have to respond by cutting rates more slowly.” A separate analysis from the Tax Foundation estimated Harris’ proposed tax subsidies and federal program expansions would likely exceed $2 trillion in costs over 10 years. Trump has so far not released as detailed an economic plan as Harris. However, a prior CRFB analysis of Trump’s suggestion to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits found the plan would cost between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion through 2035. The CRFB is planning a more comprehensive analysis of both campaigns’ proposals in the coming weeks as more information — especially details as to how they’ll be funded — is released. Both the CRFB and the Tax Foundation noted that their estimates could change as the Harris campaign provides more funding details and as the Trump campaign releases more comprehensive policy statements. “Higher debt, both in the near term and the long term, means higher interest rates … and that’s particularly a problem for the government, because interest is now the second-largest government program,” Goldwein said. “We spend more in interest than we spend on Medicare, than we spend on defense.” The Harris campaign has countered that the vice president’s economic plan will not add to the deficit. “She supports the revenue raisers in the [2025 fiscal year] Biden-Harris budget that ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share,” according to statement provided to CNN. A central part of Harris’ economic plan is making housing more affordable. The plan, which elaborates on proposals by President Joe Biden, includes building 3 million new housing units, down payment assistance and a tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Economists told CNN that the efforts to increase supply would help ease the current bottleneck that’s hampered the nation’s real estate market and caused prices to surge (and kept inflation elevated in the process); however, they were more reticent about the stimulus efforts. “The problem right now is too many people chasing too few houses,” Justin Wolfers, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “The solution to that is not to give people more money to buy houses.” Another possible boost to inflation could come from an expanded child tax credit through adding more money to people’s wallets. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the expanded child tax credit helped families afford child care costs and living expenses and helped to keep people in the workforce, said Michelle Holder, a labor economist and associate professor of economics at John Jay College in New York. There is a question about how much it will take to expand the tax cut permanently, Holder said. “On the other hand, I think there’s a reasonable counter to that critique, which is this gets money in the hands of people who will spend it. And families with children really do face high costs in terms of child care … and making it more affordable for parents, particularly women, to go out and work.” Separately, economists have told CNN that Harris’ proposal to put a federal ban on price gouging could be problematic, saying similar laws motivated people to buy more goods than they otherwise would have. Trump has floated several economic proposals, including hiking tariffs on imported goods, extending his 2017 tax cuts, cutting the corporate tax rate even further, cracking down on immigration and enacting “mass deportations” and expanding drilling for domestic oil and energy. In a June letter, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists sent a stark warning that Trump’s agenda — specifically the raising of tariffs on China and international trading partners, extending the 2017 tax cuts and cutting the corporate tax rate even further — would not only “reignite inflation” but would have “a negative impact on the US’ economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the US’ domestic economy.” Harris on Friday claimed that Trump’s agenda, specifically the 20% tax on imports, would raise prices for a typical American family by $3,900 a year. The $3,900 number Harris quoted was from the progressive Center for American Progress Fund, which analyzed a higher 20% tax on imports that Trump has cited in some rally speeches. A separate analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that the tariff proposals would cost the typical middle-income household at least $1,700 a year. The Nobel Prize-winning economists’ letter did not mention Trump’s immigration proposals; however, mainstream economists cautioned that his stated intentions of deporting 15 million to 20 million people, possibly using the National Guard, could have dire consequences for the US labor market, which has finally normalized after dealing with the pandemic-caused employment supply and demand shocks. Economists have told CNN that businesses would be forced to raise wages and prices. In addition, the rise in immigration has helped the labor market recovery and increased productivity, which has helped slow inflation. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
Analysis: Democrats gather to enshrine their stunning turn from Biden to Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:15 AM EDT, Mon August 19, 2024",2024-08-19T04:29:56.758Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-transition-analysis/index.html,"Democrats this week will enshrine one of the most audacious power plays in modern political history as they gather for a convention that was hastily reconfigured to try to vault Kamala Harris to a historic presidency. It begins with adulation for President Joe Biden, who will speak Monday night to a crowd grateful that he belatedly agreed to pass the torch. But the moment will be bittersweet for the 81-year-old president, who, despite a productive tenure, was pressured by his own party leaders to end his reelection bid when a 50-year career succumbed to the ravages of age. Biden told Americans last month when he announced his departure from the race that “History is in your hands. The power’s in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.” The response from his party was a swift coalescing behind Harris, 59, as hopes of some activists for a multi-candidate race among Democratic rising stars were dashed. With Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz leading their new ticket, Democrats now hope to thwart a White House comeback by Donald Trump amid panic over the prospect of a second term he plans to devote to “retribution.” Republicans left their convention in Milwaukee a month ago, convinced they were heading for a landslide victory under a candidate who emerged bloodied but defiant from an assassination attempt. At that point, the Democratic National Convention was shaping up as a grim valediction for an aging president who was losing to Trump in key states. But Harris has sent a jolt of electricity and joy through her party, mending some of the potentially catastrophic splits in Biden’s coalition. She’s pulled into a narrow lead over Trump in some national polls, reestablishing a neck-and-neck race with the former president in survey averages. And she’s restored multiple paths for Democrats to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. The mood shift in the party is astonishing, even if Harris’ biggest tests still lie ahead. “First of all, you were talking about a reelection nomination, a renomination. And now you’re talking about something completely different,” J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “This is a candidate who’s energized the party in a way that I haven’t seen certainly since ’08.” The refashioning of the race has left Trump — seeking to become only the second one-term president to win a non-consecutive second term — disoriented and pining for his matchup against Biden, whose hopes dissolved after his disastrous performance at the CNN debate in June. The Republican nominee has raged through a string of unhinged campaign events that have left party strategists despairing and pleading with him to focus. Harris hasn’t faced tough questions yet in an unscripted event, but she has been successful in styling herself as the change agent in the race despite spending four years playing a key role in Biden’s unpopular presidency. The party’s late attempt to save what many officials believe is the most critical election in a generation is fraught with risk. Democrats have put their fate in the hands of a vice president who was not seen as one of her party’s strongest political forces. Remarkably for a party nominee, Harris has yet to earn a single vote for president. She ended her first campaign in 2019 before the Iowa caucuses and claimed the nomination this time by acclamation after a virtual roll call of delegates rather than in a primary contest. She faces a critical debate clash with Trump on September 10, and her capacity to maintain the momentum of the campaign could be tested in future television interviews. Democrats are meeting under the historic shadow of the 1968 convention in Chicago, when activist violence sparked by the war in Vietnam transmitted an unflattering picture of the party to Americans who eventually embraced a right-wing Republican law-and-order message. There are other parallels to that fateful convention — it featured a Democratic vice president, Hubert Humphrey, who was trying (and ultimately failed) to win the election after the sitting president (Lyndon B. Johnson) was forced to pull out of his reelection race. Demonstrations are again expected in the week ahead, especially among pro-Palestinian supporters who have hounded Biden over his support for Israel after tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war in Gaza. It is not, however, clear whether progressive and Arab American voters who registered protest votes against Biden in the primaries — especially in the key swing state of Michigan — will pose a similar threat to Harris’ hopes in November. Harris will be under extraordinary pressure with her speech Thursday night to introduce herself to Americans still unfamiliar with her life story and ideas. This is where Biden’s Monday address will be especially crucial as he hands over the political reins of the party to Harris, even while he’s still president. To reinforce the pivot, Democrats will turn to former President Barack Obama on Tuesday night. Twenty years after he burst onto the scene as an unknown Illinois legislator with an electrifying convention speech, and nearly eight years since he left the White House, the party will again rely on the 44th president’s rhetorical skill. Harris has barely put a foot wrong in infusing her party with a spirit of Obama-style optimism and hope. A rocking convention could project a spirit of unity and give her a polling bounce heading into the final stretch of the race. Harris, benefiting from the generational comparison to Biden, 81, and Trump 78, is styling her new campaign as a fight for America’s future against a backdrop of historic possibility: If elected in November, she’d be the first Black female president and first Indian American president. At a rowdy rally in Philadelphia earlier this month at which she introduced Walz as her running mate, Harris rooted her appeal to voters in freedom — of economic opportunity, reproductive and voting rights, and the right to be safe from gun violence. “Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms: We’re not going back,” she said. Harris, a former prosecutor and attorney general of California who put financial and sexual offenders behind bars, also coined a new message against Trump, who has been indicted four times and is awaiting sentencing after he was convicted in a hush money trial in New York. “I took on perpetrators of all kinds — predators who abused women, fraudsters who scammed consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said. Two polls released on the eve of the convention — from CBS News/YouGov and ABC News/The Washington Post/Ipsos — showed the vice president with a narrow lead over the ex-president. And battleground surveys show Harris is competitive in the must-win “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. She’s also reopened multiple pathways to the White House, including through Sun Belt states that appeared closed off when Biden was the nominee. Yet Harris is only at the beginning of a showdown with Trump, who has shown he’ll do anything — including threatening democracy — to win power. The former president has, for example, started to refer to the switch from Biden to Harris as an unconstitutional “coup,” raising fears he’s laying the groundwork to challenge another democratic election if he loses in November. Trump unleashed a fresh attack on Harris over the weekend after she unveiled her economic plan, which included a vow to lower the cost of housing and to use federal power to crack down on supermarket giants that she accused of price gouging. Trump seized on criticism from many mainstream economists that the plan equated to price controls in state-run economies that made staples scarce in grocery stores. Harris’ approach, which is strikingly populist and progressive, represents a gamble since Trump is already trying to portray her as an ultra-liberal and Venezuela-style socialist or a communist. But while it employs questionable economics, the Harris plan could score in a political sense. She’s courting voters worn down by years of inflation and high prices following the pandemic. Most polls still show Trump is more trusted on the economy than she is. But at his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump showed signs of concern that Harris had outflanked him on an issue on which his campaign has tried to anchor the election. He described the vice president’s plan as “very dangerous because it may sound good politically, and that’s the problem.” Biden had cast his race against Trump as a fight for the soul of the nation and a vital quest to preserve democracy. But he also struggled to reconcile his own unpopularity, especially on the economy, with a presidency that, in legislative terms, may be the most prolific Democratic administration since Johnson’s. His prime-time address on the first night of the convention — instead of as originally scheduled on the last night, which is the spot reserved for the nominee — will poignantly underline the switch in the Democratic ticket. At his first formal event with Harris since he folded his reelection bid, Biden seemed moved by his reception from her crowd in suburban Maryland. That was likely a taster for the love that will rain down from the rafters of Chicago’s United Center for a president who, for all his reluctance to leave the race, is viewed by his party as an exemplar of political self-sacrifice and patriotism. “President Biden will go down in American history as one of the most consequential presidents of all time,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. “He made a very selfless decision to pass the torch to Vice President Harris, who’s a courageous leader, a compassionate leader and a commonsense leader.” That is exactly the message Democrats hope millions of Americans will take away from their convention."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail in the pivotal battleground of Pennsylvania on Sunday, the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is making his own plans to share his vision for the country in key states while Harris accepts her nomination in Chicago. Catch up on what the candidates were up to Sunday: Harris and Walz on the trail: Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — along with second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz — embarked on a bus tour across western Pennsylvania. They visited a Sheetz, a football practice, a firehouse (where they met Hank, the firehouse dog), and a campaign field office, where Harris appeared to call Trump a “coward.” Trump plans counterprogramming: While Harris is in Chicago this week, Trump campaign officials said the former president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will hold daily events in battleground states, gaggle opportunities for reporters and news conferences with surrogates. Star-studded DNC: Kerry Washington, Tony Goldwyn, Mindy Kaling and Ana Navarro will serve as hosts at the convention as celebrity enthusiasm in Democratic politics is at a high. Other stars, including John Legend and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, are also set to appear at events during the convention. Protests expected in Chicago: Tens of thousands of protesters from across the country are expected to march on the convention this week, activists said at a news conference Sunday. Illinois JB Pritzker confirmed that “about 250” members of the state’s National Guard will be on standby, but he told CNN earlier in the day that he expects “we’re going to have peaceful protests.” DNC schedule takes shape: The schedule for the convention has begun to take a clearer shape — sources say Michelle Obama, former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will join a growing “who’s who” of speakers throughout the week. Meanwhile, Biden is working on his keynote address set for Monday night (as is Harris for Thursday night), and Hillary Clinton plans to use her speech to discuss the proverbial glass ceiling that she herself failed to fully break in 2016. Former Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia said Sunday that she would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. Asked what the difference between voting for Harris and endorsing her was, Comstock said, “I don’t know that there’s really a difference,” noting that she didn’t vote for Donald Trump in 2016 or 2020. Comstock lost her reelection bid in 2018, with Trump saying at the time she did not win because she did not “embrace” his policies. She has since hit other Republicans for their continued support of the former president. The former congresswoman also praised her contemporaries, including former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who has thrown his support behind Harris — and is even speaking at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. She said the Illinois Republican is “a perfect person to make the case that while he might disagree with the vice president on some of her policy issues, he agrees on democracy.” Comstock added that since Harris “has had sort of a flawless rollout” after President Joe Biden announced he would not run for reelection, “I think you’ve had a consolidation not only of the Democratic Party, but of that anti-Trump coalition mission that has been out there, that has been sort of reenergized.” Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff arrived in Chicago on Sunday night ahead of the Democratic National Convention. She landed in the host city for the convention — where she is will accept her party’s nomination for president — after spending the day campaigning across western Pennsylvania with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The Trump-Vance campaign is aiming to prevent the Harris-Walz camp from having “free shots on goal” throughout the week of the Democratic National Convention by holding daily events in battleground states, gaggle opportunities for reporters and news conferences with surrogates, according to a Sunday call with senior campaign officials.  Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, will hold events in battleground states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona, the campaign said. Trump will hold a crime and safety event in Detroit on Tuesday before joining Vance on Wednesday for a national security-focused event in Asheboro, North Carolina, according to senior campaign officials. Trump’s campaign said in a news release Sunday night that he will visit the southern border in Cochise County, Arizona, on Thursday. On Friday morning, Trump will hold an event in Las Vegas before heading to Glendale, Arizona, for an afternoon rally, the campaign said. As Democrats convene in Chicago for their convention, the Trump campaign will also hold daily news conferences in the city at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, deploying surrogates, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. A campaign official said gaggle opportunities will be available for reporters to speak with Trump and Vance throughout the week. The campaign aims to draw a contrast with Vice President Kamala Harris, who it has frequently said is hiding from the media.  This post has been updated with additional information. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker confirmed Sunday that “about 250” members of the state’s National Guard will be on standby at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week.  “They are really on standby,” Pritzker said at a news conference. “They are at the perimeter.” Pritzker said the Illinois National Guard members who will be present are trained as military police.  Tens of thousands of protesters from across the country are expected to march on the convention this week, activists said at a news conference Sunday.  Pritzker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that his state and the city of Chicago are prepared for the DNC and for any protests connected to the event. “Honestly, I expect we’re going to have peaceful protests,” the governor said when asked about the possibility of Israel-Hamas war demonstrations.  Vice President Kamala Harris said the speech she’s preparing for the Democratic National Convention is “almost done” and previewed the broader messages she plans to focus on during her Thursday remarks. Harris elaborated more on the economic policy she unveiled Friday, explaining her belief that both her proposed expansion of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit will generate a “great return on investment.” Harris also declined to answer directly when asked whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “ready” to agree to a ceasefire deal but reiterated her belief that “we got to get a ceasefire and we got to get those hostages out.” Harris said that she “will not speak” for Netanyahu as the US continues to mediate a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas but that the Biden administration is “going to continue to work very hard this.” Kerry Washington, Tony Goldwyn, Mindy Kaling and Ana Navarro will serve as hosts at the Democratic National Convention this week, convention officials told CNN. According to organizers, reported first by CNN, each star will host one night of the four-day convention, in a role similar to an award show host, kicking off the broadcast with opening remarks and then reappearing onstage throughout the evening to help guide the audience through programming. Goldwyn will host Monday night, Navarro on Tuesday, Kaling on Wednesday and Washington will host on Thursday, which is when Vice President Kamala Harris will formally accept the Democratic nomination. Washington, who is one of the most politically active celebrities in Hollywood, has her own political nonprofit, Influence Change, which recruits fellow artists to promote civic engagement. She served a similar role at the 2020 DNC, where she opened the third night. The actress and activist, who played a political fixer on Shonda Rhimes’ “Scandal,” also spoke at the 2012 DNC. Washington’s “Scandal” co-star, Goldwyn, played the president on the ABC drama. In real life, Goldwyn is also an activist who has directed his spotlight to Democratic causes. In 2019, Kaling and Harris participated in a cooking video together in which they made masala dosa, a South Indian dish. In the video, “The Office” actress and then-Sen. Harris spoke about their Indian heritage. Navarro, who says she is a Republican, has lent her support for Democratic candidates over the past decade, ever since Trump entered politics. The TV commentator and political strategist, who is a contributor with CNN and co-host of ABC’s “The View,” has said that she voted for a Democrat for the first time in her life in 2016. Read more about the stars backing Harris at the convention here. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, visited a Sheetz convenience store, the latest stop on their Pennsylvania bus tour Sunday. Harris and Walz, along with second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, stopped by the convenience store in Coraopolis, where the vice president picked out a bag of nacho cheese-flavored Doritos. “These are my go-to. The original, nacho cheese,” she told reporters at the convenience store. When asked by reporters how her debate prep is going ahead of her September 10 matchup with Trump, Harris said she had not done debate prep during the Sunday bus tour.  “Haven’t had it today. One day at a time,” she said. The stop is the campaign’s latest visit to a regional food establishment after Walz visited a Runza, a fast-food chain popular in Nebraska and surrounding states, after a campaign rally outside Omaha on Saturday.  President Joe Biden told reporters Sunday that he feels “good” about his Monday keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. “Good, real good,” he told reporters about his DNC speech after disembarking from Air Force One. CNN previously reported that Biden was spending the weekend readying his speech for the opening night of the convention, a moment markedly different from what he had prepared for just a few weeks ago before he dropped out of the race and the Democratic Party coalesced around a new presidential nominee. The president is expected to use his speech to lay out his argument for Harris, describe the record they’ve achieved together and stress the need to defeat former President Donald Trump, Biden aides said. When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for president eight years ago in Philadelphia, she heralded a milestone — the first time in American history that a major political party was nominating a woman for president. But a handful of months later, in a devastating night for Democrats across the country, Clinton would lose the election to Donald Trump. At what was supposed to be Clinton’s victory night party in New York City, green-tinted confetti meant to look like shattered glass were emptied out into boxes, unused. This week, as her party once again prepares to formally nominate a woman for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Clinton plans to discuss that proverbial glass ceiling that she herself failed to fully break when she takes the stage Monday. Clinton and Harris have been in regular touch since President Joe Biden chose Harris as his running mate in the 2020 election, and the two women have spoken multiple times since Biden dropped out of the 2024 race last month, sources said. The former secretary of state was one of the first people Harris called the day Biden ended his campaign. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, immediately endorsed Harris after Biden left the race. Since then, the person familiar with Hillary Clinton’s thinking said, she has been “legitimately excited” about the enthusiasm that has surrounded Harris’ ascent to the top of the Democratic Party and has made clear to associates that “there’s something different about what’s happening now.” Clinton will aim to use her speech to make “very clear that she believes this can be done … and we have to stand behind Harris,” they said. “Because we’ve seen this movie before.” Tens of thousands of protesters from across the country are expected to march on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, activists said at a news conference Sunday.  “This is a national mobilization,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC. The coalition’s website says “the March on the DNC will be a march for Palestine” and the main demand will be ending US aid to Israel. People are expected to arrive in Chicago by car, caravans, charter buses and trains ahead of Monday’s convention start, according to Abudayyeh.  Abudayyeh said the route for Monday’s march that the city prefers protesters take “is 1.1 miles long. The route that we want is 2.4 miles long,” adding that the group will fight “to make sure that we get a longer route.”  He reiterated that if the city does not agree to a longer route at the beginning of Monday’s march, “we will march the [longer] route.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday morning that his state and the city of Chicago are prepared for the DNC and for any protests connected to the event. “Honestly, I expect we’re going to have peaceful protests,” the governor said when asked about the possibility of Israel-Hamas war demonstrations.  Abudayyeh said at the news conference when discussing the war in Gaza, “Somebody has to stop this.” “If Kamala Harris isn’t going to do it, and Joe Biden isn’t going to do it … then the people have to do it,” he continued.  While pro-Palestinian groups are preparing to march in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza, inside the DNC, expectations are murkier — as activists push the Democratic National Committee and Harris to take a harder line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Tim Walz visited players and coaches of the Aliquippa High School football team as part of their Pennsylvania bus tour. Harris and Walz, along with second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, spoke to players of the defending Pennsylvania Class 4A champion football team and drew similarities between the football team and the presidential campaign. Walz, a former Minnesota high school football coach, reflected on his state championship team. He also praised the players for their effort to improve as athletes and community leaders.  Harris also praised the young athletes for their work on the football field and their willingness to be role models for others. “You all are the future of our country, and you all have known from the day you were born, were all born leaders. And it’s just a matter of when people decide to turn that on,” Harris said. “The fact that you’re on this field today tells me you decided to turn it on at an early stage of your life, to be a leader and to be a role model.” Vice President Kamala Harris is set to accept her party’s nomination Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, but only after a “who’s who” list of speakers from of the Democratic Party and beyond. From past presidents and presidential hopefuls to key Harris allies, here’s a look at some of the people who are set to deliver speeches in Chicago this week: Monday: Tuesday: Wednesday: Thursday: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are also expected to speak at some point during the convention, according to DNC officials. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made a brief visit Sunday to a Pennsylvania firehouse, where they met with local firefighters and the firehouse dog. Harris and Walz, along with second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, shook hands with members of the Aliquippa Fire Department as part of the campaign’s bus tour through Pennsylvania. While visiting, Harris got the chance to meet the fire station’s dog, Hank. Harris pet the dog briefly before shaking hands with other firefighters. She also delivered baked goods to the fire station, according to reporters traveling with the vice president. Shanen Ebersole is voting for Donald Trump. With plenty of reservations, but zero hesitation. “It’s definitely a vote for Trump,” Ebersole said. “I’m happy doing that with the choices that we have. I don’t think there is any way I could vote any other direction.” Ebersole was a Nikki Haley supporter when we first met before the Iowa caucuses. Trump won 59% of the caucus vote in conservative Ringgold County; Ebersole was one of just 16 votes for the former South Carolina governor. Once Trump locked up the GOP nomination, Ebersole thought a bit about voting third party. But her maverick streak has limits. Her family and her farm come first, so she came home to Trump. Ebersole is part of our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are members of critical voting blocs or areas in those states. Keep reading about the project here. Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to call former President Donald Trump a “coward” without mentioning him by name while contrasting her leadership style with his during a campaign stop in Rochester, Pennsylvania, on Sunday.  Harris told the crowd of volunteers and staff gathered outside the campaign’s field office in Beaver County that she believes a leader should project strength not “based on who you beat down,” in an apparent reference to her opponent. “Anybody who’s about beating down other people is a coward,” she added.   Harris’ remarks came during a canvass launch event alongside her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and their spouses as part of the campaign’s bus tour through western Pennsylvania. Harris urged staff to continue working on behalf of her campaign and praised the volunteers for standing up for their shared values. Not since the Obama years has celebrity enthusiasm in Democratic politics been so high, merging the world of pop culture and politics as the race to kicks into high gear with this week’s Democratic convention in Chicago. John Legend – who performed at the 2008 and 2020 conventions – is set to headline a show Tuesday for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. On Wednesday afternoon, “Veep” star Julia Louis-Dreyfus is hosting a panel with the country’s eight female Democratic governors. And on Wednesday night, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts will perform at a benefit concert thrown by the Creative Coalition, a Hollywood advocacy nonprofit. Notable actors expected to attend include Tim Daly, Uzo Aduba, Anthony Anderson, Iain Armitage, Yvette Nicole Brown, David Cross, Jon Cryer, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Danai Gurira, Richard Kind, Busy Philipps and Sheryl Lee Ralph. High-profile speakers are still being finalized, multiple sources told CNN, adding that a slew of actors will speak on the convention’s main stage. But speculation has run rampant on two stars in particular: Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. With no major performer announced, fans of both Beyoncé and Swift are hopeful the women – who both endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020 – will show up in Chicago. Representatives for Swift and Beyoncé did not respond to CNN’s numerous requests for comment. Spokespeople for the DNC and the Harris campaign would not comment on the rumors surrounding the two megastars. Read more here. Vice President Kamala Harris briefly participated in a phone banking event Sunday, rallying support from local Democrats and talking on the phone with one Erie, Pennsylvania, resident during a stop at the Harris campaign’s field office in Beaver County. Harris, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz stopped by the campaign’s field office in Rochester and each took turns working the phones to talk to supporters. The four were joined by Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Chris Deluzio, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and Beaver Falls Mayor Kenya Johns. Harris spoke to one supporter on the phone and promised to visit her the next time the campaign stops in Erie. As a mix of invited guests and voters awaited the launch of Vice President Kamala Harris’ bus tour at an airplane hangar in Pittsburgh, many said they like the pillars of her first big policy push on the economy. Emily Best, 40, lives in Brussels but has always remained a Pennsylvania voter. She showed up Sunday morning with her Butler-based retired mom, 69-year-old Ellen Garbuni, with excitement about the prospect of voting for America’s first female president. Best said Harris’ proposal to expand the child tax credit is a policy she can especially appreciate. Michael Kinney, a software engineer, said Harris’ economic policies “make sense” to him, particularly as it relates to corporate landlords. Donna Granvinetti, meanwhile, lives in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and canvassed Saturday with hopes of reaching independent and Republican voters. Outside the heavily guarded perimeter of the Democratic convention this week, pro-Palestinian groups are preparing for tens of thousands to march in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. On the inside, expectations are murkier – as activists push the Democratic National Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris to take a harder line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. The Uncommitted National Movement, which emerged during the Democratic presidential primary to marshal protest votes against the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict, is demanding the party offer a primetime speaking slot to a pediatrician recently returned from Gaza, as well as a series of policy concessions headlined by an arms embargo against Israel. The mixture of giddy enthusiasm for Harris’ new campaign, which has captivated suddenly optimistic Democrats, and anger among the party’s pro-Palestinian factions over President Joe Biden’s continued support for the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has created an odd, frenetic buzz around the quadrennial gathering. Since Harris became the party’s standard-bearer, the mood has somewhat changed. Protesters have briefly disrupted a couple of her speeches, and campus demonstrations are poised to resume when students return to schools in the coming weeks, but the movement’s leaders have mostly shifted to quieter means of lobbying for changes in US policy. As of Friday, there are not believed to be any Palestinian-American speakers on the schedule, and it remains unclear who will occupy some of the most sought-after speaking slots and what they’ll say – or not say – about the most divisive matter in Democratic politics. The DNC did not respond to a request for comment, but a source involved in convention planning told CNN there has been some uncertainty on the DNC’s end over how to address asks they consider unworkable given the circumstances. Still, the source said, there is a sense of good-faith shared between the parties. Whether that lasts is an open question. Read more here. Multiple sources involved in the convention planning tell CNN that by the time President Joe Biden publicly announced on a July Sunday afternoon that he would be ending his campaign, much of the overarching infrastructure of the convention – including things like stage design – was already set. But fortunately, those sources said, plenty of details that are typically left until the last few weeks leading up to the convention had not been executed yet. So even with a new presidential nominee, convention planners were able to march forward towards Chicago without too many serious disruptions or course corrections. The most notable changes to this week’s convention have been in the programming and line-up of speakers. Biden, who would have been formally accepting his party’s nomination on the final night, is now speaking on the first night; Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff’s remarks on Tuesday night will now hold far greater prominence; and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has taken Harris’ Wednesday night prime time spot as the vice president’s new running mate. The guests, entertainment, music and many other details will now reflect Harris’ ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket. Still, convention planners said there will be plenty of “odes” throughout the week to Biden. Quotes like “History is in your hands” – words the president said from the Oval Office announcing his decision to end his campaign – will be prominently featured inside the arena, for example. “We felt it was important that people still be reminded that President Biden really set the foundation for this convention,” the organizer said. Vice President Kamala Harris touched down in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Sunday afternoon to kick off the Harris-Walz bus tour through the western part of the key battleground state. Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, greeted Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff at the airport hangar. After posing for selfies, the four boarded the newly unveiled red, white and blue “Harris-Walz” tour bus, which features the slogan: “A New Pathway Forward.” The bus will head to Rochester, Pennsylvania, for a campaign event where Harris and Walz are expected to deliver remarks. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close ally of former president Donald Trump, said Sunday that Trump could lose the 2024 presidential election if he doesn’t focus his campaign on policies. “I think in my view is that me and Nikki (Haley) need to go to Georgia. We’re giving advice on TV to President Trump. He’s got a lot of critics, he’s got a lot of advisors, but to Nikki Haley and (Florida Gov. Ron) DeSantis, and (Virginia Gov. Glenn) Youngkin and all these great people we have, let’s get together and actually campaign for the guy rather than just give advice,” he continued. Delegates gathered inside Chicago’s United Center for the Democratic National Convention will participate in a ceremonial roll call Tuesday to celebrate Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to sources familiar with the planning. The 57 delegations will deliver remarks and cast ceremonial votes. Notably, the first roll call will begin with President Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware and the last roll calls will come from California and Minnesota, the home states of Harris and Walz. These details are meant to drive home the passing of the torch occasion, organizers said. Harris already became the party’s official nominee earlier this month after receiving a majority of votes via a virtual roll call, but Tuesday’s in-person votes will mark a heavily symbolic moment. Because the party went through such heavy turmoil over the past few months — culminating in Biden dropping out of the 2024 race in July and Harris quickly locking up the nomination days later — many Democrats are looking forward to this week as a cathartic celebration. There was also no in-person roll call four years ago for then-presumptive nominee Biden because the Covid-19 pandemic forced that year’s convention to be largely virtual. It’s already been a whirlwind election campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris — and it’s not slowing down any time soon, as the Democratic National Convention (DNC) kicks off this week. Delegates from across the country will gather in Chicago for the first day of the DNC Monday, where Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, will outline their vision for the country and how they plan to defeat Donald Trump in November. The theme for Monday is “For the People” and features a keynote speech from US President Joe Biden. Here’s what to know going into the week ahead: Former President Donald Trump will hold a series of what his campaign is internally calling “messaging events” in several battleground states this upcoming week, a source tells CNN, in counterprogramming to the Democratic National Convention. These events will be at smaller venues and will focus on the economy, crime and immigration, three issues the former president’s campaign believe could help Trump win in November. Trump’s event on Monday will be in Pennsylvania, the same day that the DNC kicks off in Chicago. His remarks will focus on the economy, according to a statement. And on Tuesday, Trump will deliver remarks on crime and justice in Howell, Michigan, the campaign announced. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will also hold a rally focused on crime the same day in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The following day, Trump and Vance will deliver remarks on national security in Asheboro, North Carolina. On Friday, Trump will host a rally in Glendale, Arizona. It will be co-hosted by Turning Point PAC and Turning Point Action, and will give “speakers their first opportunity to react to news from the convention,” a statement said. Former President Donald Trump on Sunday shared a fake image depicting someone who appears to be Vice President Kamala Harris speaking in front of a communist symbol at the Democratic National Convention.  In the post on X, the word “Chicago” is shown in the corner of the arena, where the Democratic convention is taking place this week. The hammer and sickle, which is a communist symbol, is prominently placed in front of Harris.  When reached for comment about the altered image and why Trump shared it, Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said, “Kamunism,” an attempt to tie the vice president’s first name to communism.  Miller also shared a cover of the New York Post that had the headline, “Kamunism.” X has a policy against sharing “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm” and says it may label such content as “misleading media,” but the policy does not appear to be consistently enforced. As of Sunday morning, Trump’s post did not have a label indicating that the image was fake. X has not responded to a request for comment by CNN.  CNN has also reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.  Trump regularly shares altered media on his Truth Social website. Trump has only recently started posting on X again after his account was dormant for nearly a year.  Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Sunday that giving Vice President Kamala Harris control over inflation policy is like giving Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile who died in jail before he could face trial on federal sex-trafficking charges, control over human trafficking policy.  Arguing Harris got “a bit of a sugar high” in the polls a couple weeks ago after launching her campaign, Vance said internal Trump data has shown she “has already leveled off.” “If you talk to insiders in the Kamala Harris campaign, they’re very worried about where they are, because the American people just don’t buy the idea that Kamala Harris, who’s been vice president for three and a half years, is somehow going to tackle the inflation crisis in a way tomorrow that she hasn’t for the past 1,300 days,” Vance told Shannon Bream on Fox News Sunday. As CNN’s Jennifer Agiesta reported, the latest CNN Poll of Polls shows Harris at 50% support to former president Donald Trump’s 48%, incorporating two new polls from CBS News/YouGov and from ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos, both of which found Harris holding a narrow lead nationally. Vance claimed “polls tend to radically overstate Democrats” and insisted the Trump campaign is in a “very, very good” place.   Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu has urged Donald Trump to “stick to the issues,” telling CNN’s Jake Tapper that “almost any other Republican candidate would be winning this race by ten points.” Speaking on “State of the Union” Sunday, Sununu said Trump should focus on what his campaign hopes to achieve rather than leveling personal attacks against his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Sununu was asked about recent controversial comments from Trump, who this week saidthe Presidential Medal of Freedom, which honors civilians, “is actually much better” than the Medal of Honor, because service members who receive the nation’s highest military decoration are often wounded or awarded it posthumously. “They were asinine comments, there’s no doubt about that,” Sununu told Tapper. “I don’t think they’re the first asinine comments former President Trump has ever made; I don’t think they will be a game changer in terms of the election.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will both speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this upcoming week. Other speakers throughout the week include President Joe Biden, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, will deliver the vice presidential acceptance speech on Wednesday and Harris will deliver her presidential acceptance speech Thursday. A second major national poll finds Vice President Kamala Harris with a narrow lead over former President Donald Trump, with likely voters nationwide breaking 51% for Harris to 48% for Trump in a new CBS News poll conducted by YouGov.  Here are some key things to know from the survey ahead of the Democratic National Convention: What matters to voters? The following number of respondents also felt the below issues were “key issues” in the upcoming election: Here’s how voters fall on those issues: The CBS/YouGov poll was conducted online August 14-16 among a random national sample of 3,258 registered voters nationwide. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. The latest CNN Poll of Polls, which takes the results from the four most recent national polls — including this CBS survey — finds Harris at 50% support to Trump’s 48%. Sen. Chris Coons, a Harris-Walz campaign co-chair and close ally of President Joe Biden, defended Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic agenda on Sunday – elements of which have been met with criticism from economists in both parties. Harris on Friday floated a plan to ban price gouging across the food industry that some economists have said would create more problems than it would solve. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans who served on the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, will speak at the Democratic National Convention this week, three sources familiar with the planning tell CNN. Kinzinger is slated to speak on Thursday night, the sources said, the same evening Vice President Kamala Harris will address convention delegates. Kinzinger, who is now a CNN political commentator, was one of 10 House Republicans to vote for former President Donald Trump’s impeachment for “incitement of an insurrection” in relation to Trump’s role during the attack on the US Capitol. Kinzinger has endorsed Harris, whose campaign has launched a “Republicans for Harris” effort in an attempt to appeal to GOP voters who are turned off by Trump. Other notable Republicans could also address convention delegates, but no plans have been finalized.  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries indicated Sunday he is not confident a House Republican majority would certify the presidential election if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected, as attacks from former president Donald Trump raise fears he would question the election outcome if he loses.  “I’m confident that we’re going to do everything that we need to do over the next few months to make sure that House Democrats take back the majority so the American people do not have to encounter that question,” Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has shocked even the people close to her with how she’s been coming across in the four weeks since she became a presidential candidate. Three weeks into her campaign, President Joe Biden’s pollsters held a deep-dive call with Harris’ inner circle to discuss what she’s been saying on the stump. Some of their suggestions included a focus on the future, and to lay off the “weird” talk. Harris’ advisers listened. They considered the arguments. They decided to stick with what the crowds were chanting in the arenas. And when advisers who had been on the call briefed the vice president on the suggestions, according to CNN’s conversations with close to a dozen people involved with internal campaign decisions, she told them she wasn’t going to listen to the pollsters herself and would instead trust the instincts she had buried under self-doubt for so long. Many political obsessives who had largely written off the vice president can’t understand how a woman whose early struggles they still keenly remember is now projecting as succinct and punchy, comfortable onstage and in her own skin. Read more about Harris’ plans for her fast-moving campaign here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama, whose past convention speeches have galvanized Democrats, will address this week’s gathering in Chicago, according to a person familiar with the plans.  She is expected to speak on Tuesday, the same evening as her husband, former President Barack Obama. Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris alongside her husband in a video last month.  Essence magazine first reported on Michelle Obama’s plans.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has dramatically reshaped the 2024 electoral map since earlier this year, when the contest looked to be between an unpopular and elderly incumbent president and the former president (and now convicted felon) he defeated four years prior. The moves we are making in this latest installment of our “Road to 270” electoral map are all in a positive direction for Harris and suggest she has more potential paths to 270 electoral votes than President Joe Biden had when he was the party’s standard-bearer. This current outlook reverts the state of play to where it was in the closing days of the 2020 campaign, with seven battleground states (and one congressional district in Nebraska) as the central turf upon which the candidates and their campaigns will dedicate most of their time and money to win the White House. In this new electoral outlook, we have moved four states from leaning Republican to toss-up battleground status. Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina have a combined total of 53 electoral votes that we have moved from leaning in Trump’s direction to toss-up. Trump now has 24 states (and one congressional district in Maine) either solidly in his corner or leaning in his direction that total 219 electoral votes, 51 votes short of the 270 required to win. For her part, Harris has 19 states plus the District of Columbia either solidly in her favor or leaning in her direction, which brings her total electoral vote count to 225, 45 votes short of the 270 required to win. We currently rate seven states (and one Nebraska congressional district) totaling 94 electoral votes as true toss-ups as we head into the Democratic National Convention and the final weeks of summer. Read more here. The Democratic torch is set to be passed Monday night in Chicago, where Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to make her first appearance on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention after President Joe Biden delivers his marquee speech to the party faithful. As Democrats put the finishing touches on a far different convention than imagined only a month ago, several people familiar with the planning tell CNN that Harris is poised to appear alongside Biden before the party begins to look forward toward the November election. The whirlwind change to the Democratic ticket – with Harris replacing Biden as the party’s nominee – is giving way to something of a slow motion series of appreciations for Biden. Their joint appearance on Thursday in Maryland, where Biden arrived to a hero’s welcome, was seen as the prelude to the big finale on Monday.  The moment will amount to the end of a long political arc for Biden, who attended his first Democratic National Convention as a 29-year-old candidate for Senate in 1972. At the time, he was running to be the country’s youngest senator. He’ll walk onstage Monday as it’s oldest sitting president.  While there were early discussions around whether Biden would attend Harris’ acceptance speech on Thursday, they did not advance. He is not expected to remain in Chicago past Monday, as the convention turns toward officially elevating Harris as the Democratic standard bearer.  Biden has watched with genuine pride as the party coalesces around Harris, people familiar with his thinking say, and he has voiced relief that a prolonged battle for the nomination was avoided after he swiftly endorsed her following his decision to withdraw.  Harris, meanwhile, has taken pains to venerate Biden in public. “I could speak all afternoon about the person that I’m standing on this stage with: our extraordinary president, Joe Biden,” she said Thursday.  Before she arrives in Chicago, Harris is planning to roll through battleground Pennsylvania on a bus tour. She’ll also hold a rally in nearby Milwaukee on Tuesday.  Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over former President Donald Trump in a new poll from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos, the first major national poll in which Harris has held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error since she entered the race last month. Among registered voters nationwide, the poll finds Harris with 49% support to Trump’s 45% in a two-way matchup. With independent and third-party candidates in the mix, Harris holds 47% support to Trump’s 44%, with Robert F. Kennedy at 5% and no other candidate above 1%. The survey finds a steep improvement in Americans’ level of satisfaction with their choices for president since before Harris became the Democratic nominee, with 44% now saying they are satisfied with their options compared with 28% who felt that way in early July. That shift has been most dramatic among Democrats, who went from 20% saying they were satisfied in July when President Joe Biden led the ticket to 60% saying the same now. Among independents, satisfaction with the choices for president has grown from 19% to 30%. Economic issues remain a driving force in the election, with about half saying the economy (49%) or inflation (49%) are one of the single most important issues in their choice for president.   The Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online August 9-13 among a random national sample of 2,236 adults, including 1,975 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points, it is plus or minus 2.5 for results among registered voters. Democrats will gather in Chicago on Monday for the opening day of the Democratic National Convention as they look to give a hero’s send-off to President Joe Biden and rally around their new nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. “Our convention is an opportunity to bring the story of our party to the American people — not just the story of what we’ve achieved under the Biden-Harris administration, but how the Harris-Walz ticket is planning to build on that historic record for a new way forward into the future,” said Minyon Moore, the convention’s chair. Here are the themes for each night of the convention: Monday: “For the People,” featuring a keynote from Biden. Tuesday: “A Bold Vision for America’s Future,” with an expected speech from former President Barack Obama. Wednesday: “A Fight for Our Freedoms,” with an expected speech from vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. Thursday: “For Our Future,” closing out with an acceptance speech from Harris. Far from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns. Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. Nobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience. So we don’t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of the upcoming key dates: Click here for more of what to expect in the months ahead. President Joe Biden is spending the weekend readying his speech for the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, a moment markedly different than what he had prepared for just a few weeks ago before the Democratic Party coalesced around a new presidential nominee. The president’s keynote speech Monday will provide Biden with one of the most high-profile moments he has left to address the American people as his more than five decades in politics begins to wind down. The remarks will come nearly one month after Biden bowed out of the 2024 race and threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris as his chosen successor. Biden will make his case for why Harris should be elected president in front of thousands of Democratic delegates and party members at the United Center in Chicago just weeks after many in his own party publicly and privately clamored for him to end his presidential bid. Biden’s aides believe he now enters the convention having earned the goodwill of the Democratic Party following a productive single term in the White House and his move to pass the torch to Harris. The president is expected to use his speech to lay out his argument for Harris, describe the record they’ve achieved together and stress the need to defeat former President Donald Trump, who he believes poses a threat to democracy, Biden aides said.

Pro-Palestinian activists face complicated new decisions as Democrats gather to support a surging Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:09 AM EDT, Sun August 18, 2024",2024-08-18T11:00:02.472Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/18/politics/pro-palestine-activists-dnc-harris/index.html,"Outside the heavily guarded perimeter of the Democratic convention this week, pro-Palestinian groups are preparing for tens of thousands to march in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. On the inside, expectations are murkier – as activists push the Democratic National Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris to take a harder line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. The Uncommitted National Movement, which emerged during the Democratic presidential primary to marshal protest votes against the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict, is demanding the party offer a primetime speaking slot to a pediatrician recently returned from Gaza, as well as a series of policy concessions headlined by an arms embargo against Israel. The mixture of giddy enthusiasm for Harris’ new campaign, which has captivated suddenly optimistic Democrats, and anger among the party’s pro-Palestinian factions over President Joe Biden’s continued support for the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has created an odd, frenetic buzz around the quadrennial gathering. Though little has changed on the ground in Gaza and, increasingly, the West Bank, over the past few weeks, some of the leading progressive groups, anti-war organizers, and Arab- and Palestinian-American activists who were poised to lead the charge in Chicago are facing a starkly different reality from a month ago, when Biden still topped the ticket. “When Biden stepped aside, many of the people in the Uncommitted camp, anti-war voters breathed a sigh of relief,” said Waleed Shahid, a progressive strategist and co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement. “Then there were some signs of movement. One was Vice President Harris not attending Netanyahu’s speech. Vice President Harris giving a statement that she won’t be ‘silent’ about the killing of civilians. And just, from her, a little bit more empathy and centering of the horrific death toll of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.” Protests over Israel’s war on Hamas following the group’s October 7 attacks have led to large-scale demonstrations around the country calling for an immediate ceasefire. Some of those demonstrations have been blatantly antisemitic, with some protesters voicing support for Hamas, drawing condemnation from Biden and Harris. Since Harris became the party’s standard-bearer, the mood has somewhat changed. Protesters have briefly disrupted a couple of her speeches, and campus demonstrations are poised to resume when students return to schools in the coming weeks, but the movement’s leaders have mostly shifted to quieter means of lobbying for changes in US policy. Harris spoke briefly with Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, two co-founders of Uncommitted, before a speech in Detroit on August 7, with the vice president thanking them for their work, according to the activists. A source familiar with the meeting said she had not expressed openness to the group’s calls for an arms embargo on Israel, but Harris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, said after the encounter that the vice president would “continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.” Addressing Uncommitted supporters after the exchange with Harris, Elabed offered more qualified optimism. “I understand that when (Harris) agreed to meet with me, she wasn’t agreeing to an arms embargo,” Elabed said. “She was agreeing to discuss an arms embargo and discuss a policy that will save lives now and hopefully get us to the point where we can put our support behind Vice President Harris.” In the weeks before, Uncommitted delivered a series of requests to the DNC as part of a bid to center the Gaza issue during the convention. Few were likely ever to be accepted – like a commitment in the party platform to not send unrestricted weapons to Israel, and floor credentials and office space for Uncommitted staff – but the group has pressed hardest for a prominent speaking slot for Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric physician who has volunteered in Gaza and described the devastation there in harrowing detail. So far, though, there is no indication that Haj-Hassan will be allowed onstage. One source in the Uncommitted camp closely involved in conversations with the party said the DNC received their asks, but has not meaningfully engaged since then. As of Friday, there are not believed to be any Palestinian-American speakers on the schedule, and it remains unclear who will occupy some of the most sought-after speaking slots and what they’ll say – or not say – about the most divisive matter in Democratic politics. The DNC did not respond to a request for comment, but a source involved in convention planning told CNN there has been some uncertainty on the DNC’s end over how to address asks they consider unworkable given the circumstances. Still, the source said, there is a sense of good-faith shared between the parties. Whether that lasts is an open question. “At the convention – along with my fellow uncommitted delegates – I will advocate for VP Harris to support a permanent ceasefire and an arms embargo,” June Rose, an uncommitted delegate from Rhode Island who grew up as an Orthodox Jew, said in a social media post on Friday. “We will make our voices heard in Chicago.” “It’s part of the party, it’s part of their base, and it would be more than a just a goodwill gesture” to allow pro-Palestinian speakers, said Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. “Politically, it would makes sense for them to do it. But it’s not surprising if they’re not. I mean, this is consistent with the party leadership. They haven’t been the best on this issue.” Ayoub, who praised Harris for ramping up engagement with the activist community and for her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, had been involved in the vice presidential vetting process for Dr. Jill Stein, once again the Green Party’s presidential candidate. He spoke with CNN in his capacity as an ADC leader, but acknowledged submitting paperwork requested by Stein’s camp.  (Stein chose Rudolph “Butch” T. Ware III, a historian of Africa and Islam, who made anti-Israel comments on his social media on the day of Hamas’ attack on Israel, for the role.) The more pressing question for Harris’ campaign and party leadership, as the contest enters its final sprint, is whether the vice president plans to propose or offer any substantial changes – or tweaks – to US policy in the region. Harris allies have said her hands are tied given her role in Biden’s administration. Activists see it differently, arguing she has a direct line to the president and, with it, more sway than most. “The message that’s being conveyed to this part of the Democratic Party is that there is no alternatives to sending American bombs to Netanyahu,” Shahid said. “That’s what people are hearing. They’re not (accepting), ‘Oh, it’s the vice president. She doesn’t agree.’ That’s not good enough.” Lexis Zeidan, a Palestinian-American Christian co-chair of Uncommitted and director of the Not Another Bomb campaign, also said the status quo messaging from the campaign, though an improvement from a few weeks ago when Biden was still running, needed more substance if it is going to win back votes in November. “The community is not a monolith. Some are feeling very skeptical, given the nature of how the Democratic Party has acted the past 10 months,” Zeidan told CNN. “Some people really are waiting to hear something – the right thing – so they can support and mobilize behind her.” The desire to see a meaningful shift, Zeidan added, was not about personal feelings, but bare-knuckle politics. “I can’t tell my community that I  ‘feel’ or ‘think’ Vice President Harris is more sympathetic to Palestinians, so we should vote for her. That’s not going to work. People want to vote for something,” she said. “They want to see an end to the madness. They want to vote for someone who is going to end that.” The Uncommitted National Movement, which began as an operation to coalesce protest votes in Michigan against Biden’s policy in Israel and Gaza, has been the most successful among the anti-war, pro-Palestinian groups in engaging with Harris’ team and convention organizers. The back-and-forth between them echoes the mutually beneficial posturing, headlined by the creation of joint policy “task forces,” by Biden’s 2020 campaign and progressive allies of independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders after that year’s primary. But the Harris campaign is also working outside familiar progressive circles, engaging with elected officials and leaders from Arab American and Jewish communities in Michigan, according to sources familiar with the meetings. Those conversations, which were held on Thursday in the Detroit metro area and were in the works for several weeks, according to one of the sources, are the most recent signal that the campaign appreciates the electoral stakes of winning over progressives and young voters as well as Muslim and Arab American communities, which represent important voting blocs in the battleground state of Michigan. Biden campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez and Nasrina Bargzie, a former White House official leading the Harris campaign’s outreach to Arab American and Muslim communities, participated in meetings with Arab American elected officials and leaders on Thursday, according to two participants. Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, met with the campaign officials in a separate meeting, telling CNN they had a “frank and open discussion.” Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, met with the campaign officials in a separate meeting, telling CNN they had a “frank and open discussion.” “I delivered a message of great concerns about what is happening in the Middle East,” said Siblani, who met with Chávez Rodríguez earlier this year. The Biden-Harris administration, he told the campaign leaders, “are doing absolutely nothing to stop the genocide as they continue supplying Netanyahu’s killing machine with US made bombs to kill more people.” Chávez Rodríguez and Ilan Goldenberg, another former White House official who is now leading the campaign’s outreach to the Jewish American community, also met with leaders from the Jewish community while in Michigan. “Julie is traveling to Michigan as part of our campaign’s ongoing outreach to communities across the country,” said Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa. Sophie Ellman-Golan of Jews For Racial & Economic Justice, a New York-based grassroots group, told CNN that the unexpected switch of Harris for Biden should not be underestimated – that “space opened up” after the change and movement leaders felt “something other than despair” for the first time in recent memory. “We’re not trying to fight the Democratic party,” Ellman-Golan said. “Elections are about voting for the conditions we want to organize under. We’re actively trying to shape those conditions and the fight around the DNC is about actively trying to shape those conditions.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more accurately characterize Harris’ interaction with Uncommitted activists earlier this month."
CNN’s new Road to 270 shows how the election has grown more competitive with Harris in the race | CNN Politics,"Published 9:00 AM EDT, Sun August 18, 2024",2024-08-18T13:00:02.518Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/18/politics/presidential-election-270-electoral-votes/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has dramatically reshaped the 2024 electoral map since earlier this year, when the contest looked to be between an unpopular and elderly incumbent president and the former president (and now convicted felon) he defeated four years prior. The moves we are making in this latest installment of our “Road to 270” electoral map are all in a positive direction for Harris and suggest she has more potential paths to 270 electoral votes than President Joe Biden had when he was the party’s standard-bearer. This current outlook reverts the state of play to where it was in the closing days of the 2020 campaign, with seven battleground states (and one congressional district in Nebraska) as the central turf upon which the candidates and their campaigns will dedicate most of their time and money to win the White House. In the four weeks since Biden ended his presidential bid, those seven states have seen a combined $240 million in advertising spending, according to AdImpact, with an almost even split between Democrats and Republicans. SEE CNN’S ROAD TO 270 INTERACTIVE MAP Our previous electoral outlook had former President Donald Trump with a clear advantage in the quest for 270 electoral votes.  That advantage has evaporated with Harris’ entrance into the race and her rapid success at unifying the Democratic Party and restoring political strength with some key constituencies (voters of color, young voters, female voters) which have been part of recent winning coalitions for Democratic candidates. Despite the momentum shift, it is important to note that this race has snapped back to a margin-of-error contest with no current clear leader. Both Trump and Harris have multiple viable paths to 270 electoral votes. In this new electoral outlook, we have moved four states from leaning Republican to toss-up battleground status. Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina have a combined total of 53 electoral votes that we have moved from leaning in Trump’s direction to toss-up. Trump now has 24 states (and one congressional district in Maine) either solidly in his corner or leaning in his direction that total 219 electoral votes, 51 votes short of the 270 required to win. For her part, Harris has 19 states plus the District of Columbia either solidly in her favor or leaning in her direction, which brings her total electoral vote count to 225, 45 votes short of the 270 required to win. We currently rate seven states (and one Nebraska congressional district) totaling 94 electoral votes as true toss-ups as we head into the Democratic National Convention and the final weeks of summer. We should be very clear about what this electoral outlook is and, more importantly, what it is not. It is a current snapshot of the electoral college landscape in what will likely prove to be another very close and extraordinarily consequential presidential election. It is not a prediction of how things will turn out in November. We base this current outlook on public and private polling; conversations with campaign advisers, Republican and Democratic political operatives; members of Congress; and political professionals involved with outside groups poised to be active in the race. As some of the Sun Belt states (Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina) have become far more competitive with Harris in the race, it is still probably true that her most direct route to 270 electoral votes would be to keep the three so-called “Blue Wall” states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) and the Omaha-area congressional district in Nebraska in the Democratic column. Trump’s most direct path to 270 electoral votes would be to keep all the states he won in 2020 and flip Georgia and Pennsylvania (two states he won in 2016) back to his column. In that calculation, it is critical for Trump that he tries to prevent North Carolina from slipping away, which may explain why he is making his second trip there in as many weeks and has upped his investment in television advertising in the Tar Heel state. Solid Republican: (TOTAL: 188 Electoral Votes) Alabama (9), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Iowa (6), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (4), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), Ohio (17), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (40), Utah (6), West Virginia (4), Wyoming (3) Leans Republican: (TOTAL: 31 Electoral Votes) Florida (30), Maine 2nd Congressional District (1) Toss-ups: (TOTAL: 94 Electoral Votes) Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nebraska 2nd Congressional District (1), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19), Wisconsin (10) Leans Democratic: (TOTAL: 50 Electoral Votes) Colorado (10), Minnesota (10), New Hampshire (4), New Mexico (5), Oregon (8), Virginia (13) Solid Democratic: (TOTAL: 175 Electoral Votes) California (54), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (19), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (28), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12)"
Inside the fast-moving launch of Kamala Harris for president | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun August 18, 2024",2024-08-18T10:00:02.871Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/18/politics/kamala-harris-presidential-campaign/index.html,"Three weeks into her presidential run was the first time the Biden campaign’s pollsters — now hers — held a deep-dive call with Kamala Harris’ inner circle to discuss what she’s been saying on the stump. Over the line came a lot of praise, but also some suggested tweaks. First, said veteran Democratic numbers man Geoff Garin, summarizing their analysis, stop saying, “We’re not going back.” It wasn’t focused enough on the future, he argued. Second, lay off all the “weird” talk — too negative. Harris’ advisers listened. They considered the arguments. They decided to stick with what the crowds were chanting in the arenas. When advisers who had been on the call briefed the vice president on the suggestions, according to CNN’s conversations with close to a dozen people involved with internal campaign decisions, she told them she wasn’t going to listen to the pollsters herself and would instead trust the instincts she had buried under self-doubt for so long. Harris has shocked even people close to her with how she’s been coming across in the just four weeks since she became a presidential candidate. Many political obsessives who had largely written off the vice president can’t understand how a woman whose early struggles they still keenly remember is now projecting as succinct and punchy, comfortable onstage and in her own skin. Part of this is a strategic decision to limit her appearances and hold off from sitting for an interview, so that her only major moment without a teleprompter or aides first editing video was on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base as she greeted the Americans returning home in President Joe Biden’s multilateral prisoner swap. A snippet of her jumbled syntax was quickly pumped out by Republican National Committee operatives and others: “This is just an extraordinary testament to a president who understands the power of diplomacy and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy and strengthening alliances.” And while several Democratic officials told CNN privately that the turnaround for a politician whose weaknesses haven’t magically disappeared may be setting the party up for devastation if she stumbles, Harris isn’t just feeding off the burst of Democratic good feelings that followed Biden’s exit. She’s feeling a sense of liberation campaigning for herself rather than calibrating around Biden. “This is her clear voice. When she says, ‘I will sign this into law,’ those are words she has never been able to be speak before,” said her deputy chief of staff, Erin Wilson, who for the last two years helped manage many of Harris’ political relationships. “It was her job to be that strong partner that Joe Biden needed in his administration,” said Daniele Monroe-Moreno, the Nevada Democratic Party chair and a state representative who has known Harris since before she was vice president. “The spotlight is on her now, and this is her time. And you sense that she has a renewed sense of confidence.” Harris is also reaping the benefits from years of a quietly revamped internal operation and a small circle of advisers she tends to meet with at her dining room table at the Naval Observatory, which remains the nexus of power, while the staff still in the headquarters Biden established in Wilmington, Delaware, manages the campaign operations. Those are the people she talks to. Those are the ones who, while the Biden campaign wasn’t much testing what his running mate should say, were coming up with their own debate prep plans, which were already underway by the time Biden took the stage for his. Unlike Harris’ last campaign — which imploded in a swirl of self-doubt, second-guessing and rival factions pulling and pushing her over ideas and wording — this one has been defined by the shortness of the race. She hasn’t had time for any of the old lingering. She hasn’t had time to try to work any new people into her circle of trust. The result — despite a politician who had developed a reputation for word salads and hedging herself into incomprehensibility — is the least message-tested Democratic presidential campaign in decades. Rather than honing a stump speech over months on the trail, Harris had about 26 hours between finding out she’d be running and having to deliver hers for the first time, at her new campaign headquarters in Wilmington, and it was carried live on national TV. Most of its paragraphs and themes came right out of those prep sessions overseen by Harris’ chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, and shaped by volunteer consultant wordsmith Sean Clegg, former policy adviser Rohini Kosoglu and longtime Democratic debate expert Karen Dunn. Overnight, Brian Fallon, who joined the orbit only in January as Harris’ campaign communications director, scrapped together lines she had come up with and others they had helped craft for her. Even what’s become one of her trademarks — “I know Donald Trump’s type” — was a last-minute revision. “I want to say something like, ‘I know his type,’ but more eloquent,” Harris said, standing in a hold room in Wilmington, looking over the prepared paragraphs about her prosecutorial record, according to people in the room. “Just say that: ‘I know Donald Trump’s type,’” her communications director, Kirsten Allen, said back. By the time she was doing her run-up to it at a Philadelphia rally two weeks later, the crowd started cheering before she even got to the punchline. To Anita Dunn, the recently departed top Biden adviser, how Harris is coming across on the trail should be a surprise only to those who hadn’t been watching her diligent efforts to reboot. Harris’ set of experiences, Dunn said, lend her two particular advantages in this moment. “There is nothing that prepares you to run for president like running for president. Two, she has been vice president for three and a half years, and that gives her a depth and foundation to run from that is difficult to replicate,” Dunn said. “And she doesn’t have the usual problems that vice presidents do of being seen as more of the same because she so clearly is communicating change.” Bruised and brewing from her first year as vice president, Harris didn’t trust Biden’s West Wing aides. She didn’t trust reporters. She didn’t trust her own instincts. The plan was to gear up for a 2028 run that boxed out primary opposition. The main component was getting Harris out of the psychological bunker she had retreated to. Voles, an aide with presidential experience going back to the Clinton years and who had the trust of Dunn, joined as an adviser in the summer of the first year, trying to tweak the chaos. Voles’ elevation to chief of staff in April 2022 reflected Harris’ recognition that she needed a reboot that went deeper than replacing the top press aides and others who had already cycled through. Some of the changes were operational, such as merging the scheduling and advance teams, or building up an in-house online outreach operation. Some were strategic, like forcing Harris to agree to more interviews despite her resistance, both to get her more practice and to dilute the impact when she inevitably made mistakes. Some were about injecting a different spirit: Aides talked about needing to remember who she was, the strengths that put her on the ticket to begin with and her ability to connect with voters once she stepped out of the background. By late summer 2022, with Covid-19 fading and Biden largely finishing a legislative agenda that had often kept Harris in Washington on standby to break ties in the Senate, she told aides she wanted to be on the road at least two days a week (and most Saturdays) ahead of the midterms. Biden had given Harris the portfolios of the root causes of migration and voting rights, but after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, she had quickly identified herself as the face of the fight for abortion rights. She and aides zeroed in on other issues that likewise spoke to the Democratic base, and specifically the rising generation: climate, small business and maternal health. Aides turned Harris’ abortion rights focus into its own organizing tool. Though there were a few rallies, she more often took meetings in Washington or on the road with groups of faith leaders and state legislators. All aimed to have attendees walk away with a warmer impression of her. Speeches hadn’t been going well for Harris, so aides shifted to moderated conversations to draw her out in front of friendly crowds, hoping for moments they could clip and post. Guests who Wilson, the deputy chief of staff, and other aides identified as likely future convention delegates or potential primary opponents were booked onto Air Force Two. Every airport arrival was stacked with officials for her to greet; every photo line after events was curated with local politicians, business owners, student leaders. Receptions at the Naval Observatory ramped up to the point that by the Christmas 2023 season, she had two and a half weeks of sometimes multiple events per day — chosen crowds coming through for a hot chocolate bar, a photo with her and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, and a souvenir apron. “When you’re building a car, if you put the gas in the tank, it’s going to move,” said Megan Jones, a veteran of the Harry Reid machine in Nevada who worked on Harris’ last campaign, then joined her office in 2022 as an adviser to help manage her politics. “We just needed the gas — because we built it.” Jones came up with the idea of branding Harris with college tours and organized them with a new senior adviser, Stephanie Young. The tours provided not just built-in audiences and a way to make multiple stops around the same theme, but also put the vice president in front of a group that would make up a larger share of the electorate by the time Harris’ team was expecting the next primaries. The vice president would often talk about how college students had other places they could go and professors lecturing to them — “They get that in their college classes all day,” Harris said at one point, according to an aide. Aides responded that meant Harris was going to have to learn how to be entertaining. They stressed message discipline. Repetition. Hitting easy themes like “freedom,” and talking less about the bills Biden passed than their specific provisions — her godchildren, Harris would say in meetings, had no idea what the Inflation Reduction Act was, but they know about replacing lead pipes and tax credits for buying electric cars. More conversations on the road made her more anxious that what Biden was saying wasn’t resonating. He wasn’t speaking to people in ways that they wanted to be spoken to, she’d say, according to advisers. Throughout, Voles, who had a campaign communications background, backed the new press team’s efforts to push Harris out more. They abandoned an early decision that she shouldn’t speak to reporters off the record on Air Force Two because Biden did only sometimes. So too with a general rule against doing local interviews when Harris’ press secretary, Ernie Apreza, made them a pet push. “POTUS doesn’t do local interviews because it muddles the message,” one aide warned, according to memories of the conversation. “POTUS is POTUS,” another aide responded. “We don’t have that luxury.” Harris put in her own request: more drive-time radio. But mostly, they stayed away from traditional political interviews and toward influencer conversations and targeted constituency media such as podcasts. Several aides acknowledge now to CNN they were building “echo chambers.” The little data Harris advisers had, including a round of focus groups conducted in the early spring, confirmed what they had assumed: She was doing better among the young voters, Black voters and Latino voters with whom Biden was struggling. Looking at data from Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, they could see the efforts paying off. Harris knew if Biden lost to Trump, her political career would probably be finished too. “Our two destinies are tied,” she told advisers a few times, several recounted. Voles and campaign chief of staff Sheila Nix tried to guide Harris and the other aides along that balance. Yet even through July, worries among some Biden aides that she’d flop were intense enough to be among the factors keeping him from dropping out. They weren’t the only ones: Through the spring, multiple top Democratic operatives were still so skeptical of Harris and her staff’s abilities that they were telling CNN they doubted she would have been able to survive the Democratic primaries in 2028. Context is everything for this run, and that’s especially true of Harris’ laugh. For years, Republicans and supportive media outlets caricatured it as forced. Often, political opponents referred to it as a “cackle.” Now her campaign is promoting it as emblematic of the joyous spirit she is trying to project. “The quirks and her humor and the way that she presents,” said Robert Garcia, the freshman California congressman who got close to his then-junior senator when he was still the mayor of Long Beach, “people today are finding endearing and hopeful.”"
"August 17, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-17T12:45:09.625Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-harris-election-08-17-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is significantly staffing up its legal team ahead of what it expects will be aggressive legal challenges to the election outcome in November. The new team includes two former White House counsels — Dana Remus and Bob Bauer — along with Marc Elias, one of the Democratic Party’s top election lawyers. Remus and Bauer are expected to provide overall strategic direction to the legal apparatus, according to a campaign official. Both bring extensive experience in election issues. Remus was a White House counsel to President Joe Biden. Bauer served in that role under President Barack Obama, and has recently served as Biden’s personal attorney. He also played Trump in Biden’s debate practice this summer. Others involved in the effort are Maury Riggan, the campaign’s general counsel and lead in-house lawyer, and Meredith Horton, the campaign’s national voter protection and access director. Elias will lead recounts and advise the campaign on recount strategy. The New York Times was first to report on the the changes. The Harris campaign describes the legal effort as the largest voter protection program in American presidential history. Former President Donald Trump said Saturday he thought he was “much better looking” than Vice President Kamala Harris.  Trump said he heard a commentator argue that Harris has an advantage over Trump because she is a “very beautiful woman.”   Former President Donald Trump on Saturday criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly unveiled economic agenda and questioned why she hadn’t implemented her proposals while she was already in office.   Trump said, “So this is Day 1305, we’re at thirteen hundred and give, so why isn’t she doing it now? Why doesn’t she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband, go to Washington and do it now? You could do it right now.” Trump said Harris’ plan is “very dangerous because it may sound good politically, and that’s the problem, and we have to be very careful because when somebody gets up and says, ‘We’re going to give you everything, $25,000 for a house, we’re going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free health care, we’re going to give you everything, universal health care,’ it sounds so beautiful.” Harris on Friday proposed a new plan to provide tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans, and her new economic agenda includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and child rearing more affordable.  “She’s promising to hand out things she can’t deliver. She can never deliver them; she will never get them approved,” Trump said. “The things that she said yesterday don’t work. They have never worked,” he added. Trump again falsely claimed that implementing a tariff “doesn’t affect our country.”   CNN has previously fact checked that study after study including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have shown that American consumers and industries bear almost the entire cost of US tariffs, including those duties previously imposed by Trump. When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer when the foreign-made product arrives at a US port. It’s possible that some foreign manufacturers lowered their prices to stay competitive in the US market after Trump raised tariffs – but not enough to keep the cost paid by American importers the same as before. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz celebrated a homecoming at a Saturday campaign rally in Nebraska, the state where he grew up, where he met his wife — Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz — and where he began his teaching career. Walz acknowledged his former colleagues and former students from Alliance High School in Alliance, Nebraska, amid the hundreds gathered in La Vista to hear him speak, telling the audience, “it feels good to be home,” while sharing the values he learned growing up in the state.  Walz referenced local Nebraska landmarks and cultural touchstones throughout his remarks, often as a means of contrasting his Midwestern roots with former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. At another point, Walz took a swipe at Vance for claiming Midwestern roots, while suggesting Vance isn’t familiar with a local delicacy, to the delight of the Nebraskans in the crowd. Following his remarks, Walz stopped at a Runza and picked up an order of hamburgers, sandwiches and other items totaling over $600, a restaurant employee told CNN.  Gwen Walz preceded the governor at the rally and shared a story of the two of them teaching together in Nebraska, highlighting how the couple “huddled” to come with a play to improve the reading of a student athlete that allowed him to continue playing football and ultimately graduate high school.   More on the electoral landscape: Nebraska is one of two states – along with Maine – that divide Electoral College votes by congressional district, rather than statewide, winner-take-all rules. Omaha’s single electoral vote could impact the outcome of the presidential race. President Joe Biden carried the electoral vote from the state’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020. Former President Donald Trump has been pushing Nebraska Republicans to change the state’s election law. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will roll through Pennsylvania on a bus tour Sunday, dropping in on the crucial battleground state just days before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It’s a move that underscores how aggressively the Harris-Walz ticket plans to compete for Pennsylvania and its 19 Electoral College votes. The pair’s first rally shortly after Walz was announced as Harris’ running mate was in Philadelphia, the commonwealth’s largest city, and they embarked on a dayslong tour of battleground states shortly after. Sunday’s tour, which is scheduled to begin in Pittsburgh, will mark the first time that Harris, Walz and their respective spouses – second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz – will appear on the campaign trail together since they shared the stage in Philadelphia. The goal, according to the campaign, is to have a cluster of intimate events with voters, ranging from canvass kick-offs to stops at local retail shops. The campaign has 36 coordinated offices and 300 staffers in Pennsylvania, which Harris has already visited seven times this year. The campaign has touted a robust volunteer operation: Some 43,000 people have signed up to volunteer in the Keystone State since Harris announced her candidacy last month. Read more about the bus tour through Pennsylvania. Vice President Kamala Harris has committed to participate in a roundtable with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, her campaign and the union confirmed Friday, as she continues to court working class voters heading into November’s election. The Teamsters, a union with 1.3 million members, is among the last major unions to offer an endorsement in the 2024 race with a decision on whether to back either candidate expected after the conventions. Some Democrats have expressed frustration with Sean O’Brien, the union president, who spoke in a primetime slot at the Republican National Convention while seeking a similar role at next week’s Democratic National Convention. The union is expected to have a presence on stage at the convention, but O’Brien is not expected to speak at the Democratic confab, a source familiar with convention planning said. Teamsters leadership invited Harris to participate in a roundtable shortly after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, writing in a letter to her campaign, “Teamster members want to hear your vision on issues that affect their families.” Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said the vice president “has received and gladly accepted an invitation by IBT leadership to participate in a candidate roundtable to discuss her record of fighting for Teamsters and their families and to highlight her vision for the future. The campaign looks forward to scheduling the roundtable in the near future.” Kara Deniz, a spokesperson for the union, said the union just received notice Harris has accepted the invitation but a date has yet to be set. Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden each participated in roundtables with the Teamsters earlier this year. A pro-Palestinian protester attempted to interrupt Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s remarks at a rally in La Vista, Nebraska, on Saturday. The protester shouted at Walz during the beginning of his remarks. Members of the audience attempted to quiet the protester. Walz did not appear to acknowledge the protester, who unfurled a Palestinian flag before being escorted out of the venue by staff. Prior to the event, approximately a dozen protesters waving Palestinian flags and signs condemning US support of Israel’s military operation in Gaza gathered steps away from the line of attendees waiting to enter the rally. One banner in front of the group read “Justice for Palestine.” Others called for a ceasefire and an arms embargo with Israel. A piece of plywood in front of the group read “Shame on those complicit in genocide.” The protesters reflect a lingering tension for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign as she continues to navigate the political dynamics of the Israel-Hamas war. Harris has been interrupted at multiple campaign rallies by pro-Palestinian protesters since taking over the Democratic ticket. On Thursday, Harris campaign officials met with Arab American community leaders in Michigan, the latest outreach effort to the sizeable constituency in a key battleground state. This post has been updated with additional reporting on Walz’s event. The first presidential debate of 2024 upended the race for the White House, effectively terminated the reelection aspirations of President Joe Biden and perhaps forever altered the direction of the country. With so much potentially at risk at next month’s debate on September 10 — which will be the first time former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris encounter each other at close range — the planning for the high-stakes showdown has already begun. ABC, the network hosting the debate, announced Friday it will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Harris held her first formal debate training session earlier this week at Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, DC, she attended nearly four decades ago. A team of Democratic advisers joined her there earlier this week, including Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign, several people familiar with the planning told CNN. Karen Dunn, another longtime Clinton adviser who helped Harris prepare for her vice presidential debate in 2020, is also taking part in the preparation efforts, people familiar with the planning said. Former Harris aides Rohini Kosoglu and Sean Clegg are also involved with the effort, according to a person familiar with the prep. Trump, meanwhile, has enlisted one of the vice president’s ex-rivals to help with the preparations: Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 in a crowded field that also included Harris. He has revived the approach deployed ahead of his June debate with Biden, engaging in less formal policy sessions with close aides, advisers and allies in between campaign appearances and rounds of golf. Trump’s interest in Gabbard as he prepares to face Harris next month stems in part from the notable exchanges the former congresswoman had with the vice president during their 2020 race. Seen mostly as a gadfly and an oddity during her Democratic primary run in 2019, Gabbard’s attack on Harris’ record as a prosecutor may have been her largest direct impact on the race. Read more about how the candidates are preparing to face off. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is scheduled to deliver a marquee address Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention to help introduce Vice President Kamala Harris to the nation. A convention adviser tells CNN that Emhoff, who could become the nation’s first first gentleman if Democrats win in November, has been given a prominent speaking slot on the second night of the convention to paint a personal portrait of Harris.  His speaking role, perhaps, is one of the biggest examples of how the convention schedule has shifted dramatically with Harris at the top of the ticket. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to speak at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday evening, a source familiar with her schedule tells CNN. CNN has previously reported that former President Bill Clinton and vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz will both deliver remarks on Wednesday as well. Former President Donald Trump will hold a series of what his campaign is internally calling “messaging events” in several battleground states next week, a source told CNN, in counterprogramming to the Democratic National Convention. These events will be at smaller venues and will focus on the economy, crime and immigration, three issues the former president’s campaign believe could help Trump win in November. Trump will hold an event in Pennsylvania on Monday, the same day the DNC kicks off in Chicago. His remarks will focus on the economy, according to a statement. And on Tuesday, Trump will deliver remarks on crime and justice in Howell, Michigan, the campaign announced. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will also hold a rally focused on crime the same day in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The following day, Trump and Vance will deliver remarks on national security in Asheboro, North Carolina. He is also expected to visit Arizona next week. This post has been updated with more details on Trump’s and Vance’s events. Protective fencing is up, street closures are beginning and local and federal law enforcement officials say Chicago is prepared as Democrats begin to descend on the city for the party’s convention. The convention is kicking off just five weeks after the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania — a moment that raised concerns about the security at Democrats’ gathering in Chicago as well as Republicans’ convention in Milwaukee last month. Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Thursday on CNN that the attempted assassination “did heighten our awareness here” as law enforcement planned for “any possibility.” “Comparing Butler to a national special security event — you can’t compare it,” Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer told reporters this week. “This is a whole of government approach — we’ve been planning for this convention for well over a year.” Also looming as Chicago prepared for the convention has been the memory of 1968, when violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters erupted amid protests over the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War. Snelling said Chicago police have “taken corrective action on those past mistakes” — including efforts to prevent a repeat of 1968 in 2012, when Chicago hosted heads of government at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit. Street closures were set to begin Friday and Saturday as the city prepares to host about 50,000 visitors — including DNC delegates, an international media contingent, dignitaries, elected officials and more. “There will be traffic delays, but that’s Chicago. We always have traffic delays in the city,” Snelling said. Read more about how Chicago is prepping for the DNC. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign submitted signatures to gain ballot access in three states this week, including battleground Arizona, the campaign announced today. Kennedy’s campaign announced it submitted 110,000 signatures to Arizona’s elections office on Friday, more than double the 42,303 signatures required from Independent candidates to qualify for the state’s ballot. The petition filing in Arizona comes after Kennedy’s campaign submitted signatures in Montana on Wednesday and Alabama on Thursday, the campaign said. Kennedy’s campaign announced last month it had collected enough signatures to qualify. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in 19 states. He’s eligible to receive 236 potential electoral college votes. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz is returning to his Nebraskan roots Saturday for a rally right outside of Omaha, where a single electoral vote could impact the outcome of the presidential race. The Omaha-anchored 2nd Congressional District is a blue dot in a sea of Nebraska red, and the state is one of two – along with Maine – that divide Electoral College votes by congressional district, rather than statewide, winner-take-all rules. Saturday’s event marks the first time Walz, a Nebraska native who moved to Minnesota nearly three decades ago, has visited the state since joining Harris on the Democratic ticket. Of this year’s presidential battlegrounds, if Vice President Kamala Harris carries the so-called blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and former President Donald Trump wins Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the outcome of Nebraska’s 2nd District could likely tip the balance and keep the race from ending in an electoral tie. (In the case of a tie, the House of Representatives would decide the winner.) President Joe Biden carried the electoral vote from the state’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020. And Trump has been pushing Nebraska Republicans to change the state’s election law. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, has said he was open to calling a special legislative session dedicated to making his state’s presidential contest a winner-take-all affair — with the caveat that he has sufficient support in the legislature — which would all but assuring that Trump would collect the full lot of electoral votes. Nebraska Republican officials have not closed the door to trying to change the rules this year, even with less than three months remaining until Election Day. Locked in a tight race for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are eager to show voters how they’ll handle the economy if elected. Both campaigns have a populist bent, but the candidates have differing visions for helping Americans contending with the high living expenses that remain even as the recent spike in inflation has largely passed. Here’s how Harris and Trump compare on key economic platforms: Read more about the candidates’ economic plans. New electronic signs targeting Vice President Kamala Harris are on display inside the Mohegan Sun Arena in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, ahead of former President Trump’s rally there on Saturday. A full-screen electronic sign reads, “Kamala is lying to you” and has a link to a site paid for by the Republican National Committee that “fact-checks” Harris’ past statements and encourages visitors to contribute to the GOP campaign. Another rotating LED display claims that “Kamala is responsible for a broken economy,” foreshadowing attacks on Harris’ economic policies during Trump’s upcoming speech, which is slated to start at 4 p.m. ET. Harris on Friday unveiled a populist economic platform — which includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and child rearing more affordable — in a speech in battleground North Carolina. Democrats and Republicans have fought each other to a draw on battleground airwaves amid a flood of presidential advertising in the four weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out and transformed the presidential race. According to AdImpact data, seven key battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada — have seen $241.1 million worth of presidential advertising since July 21, when Biden withdrew, including reservations through Sunday, August 18. Those seven states account for more than 70% of all presidential advertising during that period. And over that four-week span, Democrats and Republicans have spent almost exactly the same amount on advertising in those states: $118.8 million from Democrats to $118.2 million from Republicans. This includes spending from both campaigns and outside groups, and ads on TV, digital, and other platforms. Where parties are putting in money: The parties, however, have placed slightly different emphases on some of these key states during that period. Democrats have invested significantly more in Michigan than Republicans, $24.5 million to $18.3 million, while Republicans have invested more in Georgia, $21.4 million to $15.1 million from Democrats. Democrats have also invested more in Wisconsin, while Republicans have spent more in Arizona. Both parties agree that Pennsylvania is the top target. In total, Pennsylvania has been bombarded with more than $76 million of presidential advertising in this four-week stretch. Democrats and Republicans have leapfrogged each other in the advertising lead there, with Democrats currently holding a small edge, $39.1 million to $37.5 million. Since Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascension the past several weeks, national and grassroots political organizers from the Indian American community say they’ve seen a groundswell of support and energy for the Harris campaign. Aunties and uncles are exchanging “LOTUS for POTUS” memes in WhatsApp group chats (Kamala means lotus in Sanskrit). The Indian American Impact Fund said the South Asian women Zoom call raised more than $275,000, and leaders from the advocacy group report an influx of small-dollar donations and volunteer sign-ups. At least part of the Indian American enthusiasm for Harris stems from pride in a shared identity. Harris’ lat﻿e mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and immigrated to the US in 1958 to attend a doctoral program at the University of California, Berkeley. Harris has shared childhood memories of visiting her grandfather in Chennai and has spoken about how her Indian heritage has influenced her life and career. This presidential election could mark a turning point for Indian American voters. With the Indian American population more than doubling in key battleground states between 2010 and 2020, some organizers say a fired-up electorate could make a difference come November. An estimated 4.8 million people in the US identify as Indian Americans – a relatively small slice of the US electorate – and more than 2.1 million of them are eligible voters, according to the research and policy organization AAPI Data. Indian Americans tend to be a reliably Democratic voting bloc with high turnout rates: 55% of Indian American voters identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic, and 91% said they plan to vote in November, an AAPI Data survey conducted before Biden’s departure from the race found. Read more about how Indian Americans are getting involved. The Democratic torch is set to be passed Monday night in Chicago, with Vice President Kamala Harris expected to make her first appearance on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention after President Joe Biden delivers his marquee speech to the party faithful. As Democrats put the finishing touches on a far different convention than imagined only a month ago, several people familiar with the planning tell CNN that Harris is poised to appear alongside Biden before the party begins to look forward toward the November election. The whirlwind change to the Democratic ticket – with Harris replacing Biden as the party’s nominee – is giving way to something of a slow motion series of appreciations for Biden. Their joint appearance on Thursday in Maryland, where Biden arrived to a hero’s welcome, was seen as the prelude to the big finale on Monday. The moment will amount to the end of a long political arc for Biden, who attended his first Democratic National Convention as a 29-year-old candidate for Senate in 1972. Then, he was running to be the country’s youngest senator. He’ll walk onstage Monday as it’s oldest sitting president.  Biden has watched with genuine pride as the party coalesces around Harris, people familiar with his thinking say, and he has voiced relief that a prolonged battle for the nomination was avoided after he swiftly endorsed her following his decision to withdraw.  Harris, meanwhile, has taken pains to venerate Biden in public. “I could speak all afternoon about the person that I’m standing on this stage with: our extraordinary president Joe Biden,” she said Thursday.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign says it has reserved $370 million in television and digital advertising through November’s election, including what the campaign says is the largest-ever digital ad buy in US political history. The massive ad buy represents a historic shift: $200 million will go toward digital ads, while $170 will go to traditional television spots. Reaching voters online or on their phones has become a new imperative for campaigns as they seek an advantage. The campaign says reserving the ad space early allows for more choice placement on highly rated programs, including sports and entertainment. They are also advertising on Fox News, “particularly during day-time programming which reaches a more moderate audience,” the memo states. The ad spots already reserved also include placement during the season premiers of “Grey’s Anatomy” and the “Golden Bachelorette.” The campaign said the ad buys represent significant increases from four years ago, doubling the 2020 Biden campaign purchase in Pennsylvania, investing four times as much in Georgia and six times as much in Nevada. Vice President Kamala Harris’ Caribbean roots are coming into focus for the millions of Americans getting acquainted with her after she was suddenly thrust to the top of the Democratic ticket a month ago. Already, her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, has sought to question her Black identity as the two vie for support among African American voters in states such as Michigan and Georgia, which could determine the outcome of this fall’s race.  “I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump asked in widely derided comments at a gathering of Black journalists last month. Harris is both. She’s the daughter of an Indian-born mother, Shyamala Gopalan, and a Jamaican-born father, Donald Harris. Donald Harris hails from a family that stretches back for generations in Brown’s Town, a market town in St. Ann Parish — a place that Harris readily claims and one that proudly claims her. Read more about Harris’ Jamaican roots here. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz enlisted at 17 and served 24 years in the National Guard before retiring in 2005 to run for Congress, launching a political career that ultimately led to his selection as the Democratic nominee for vice president. Like Walz, Ohio Sen. JD Vance enlisted in the military after high school, spending four years in the Marines and serving a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent. Even back then, his fellow Marines thought Vance, now the Republican vice presidential nominee, was destined for a career in politics. While they’re on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Walz and Vance share a key attribute that is increasingly rare in politics today: For the first time in nearly 30 years, two enlisted military veterans will square off as their party’s respective vice presidential candidate. Both Vance and Walz enlisted in the military as a springboard, attending college with the help of the GI Bill. Signs of their political aspirations, talent and leadership skills were clearly evident to those who knew them best in the military. In interviews with more than a dozen veterans who served with either Walz or Vance, a picture emerges of two men who exhibited attributes while in uniform that would guide their political careers. Though the details of their service vary, and neither one saw combat, both Walz and Vance left the military clear-eyed about the missteps the US made during the global war on terror. That skepticism would be a feature of their first political campaigns, 16 years apart. Walz expressed opposition to the US invasion of Iraq while running for the House in 2006, while Vance’s time in the Marines informed his isolationist views toward US engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan — as well as involvement in Ukraine — that arose in his 2022 Senate campaign. At a time when fewer Americans have military experience, the fact Walz and Vance both served stands out. Read more about their military service. Here’s where the candidates are on Saturday: Donald Trump: The former president is set to hold a campaign rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania this afternoon. The event is scheduled to begin in Wilkes-Barre at 4 p.m. ET. Gov. Tim Walz: The Democratic vice presidential nominee will headline a campaign rally in Nebraska on Saturday at 4 p.m. ET, shining a light on the fight for the state’s one swing electoral vote. (Nebraska is one of two states — along with Maine — that divide Electoral College votes by congressional district rather than statewide winner-take-all rules.) The Minnesota governor, a Nebraska native who moved to Minnesota nearly three decades ago, is scheduled to visit Omaha for the rally. Looking ahead: Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz will embark on a bus tour on Sunday in western Pennsylvania ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off Monday in Chicago. President Joe Biden is spending the weekend readying his speech for the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, a moment markedly different than what he had prepared for just a few weeks ago before the Democratic Party coalesced around a new presidential nominee. The president’s keynote speech Monday will provide Biden with one of the most high-profile moments he has left to address the American people as his more than five decades in politics begins to wind down. The remarks will come nearly one month after Biden bowed out of the 2024 race and threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris as his chosen successor. Biden will make his case for why Harris should be elected president in front of thousands of Democratic delegates and party members at the United Center in Chicago just weeks after many in his own party publicly and privately clamored for him to end his presidential bid. Biden’s aides believe he now enters the convention having earned the goodwill of the Democratic Party following a productive single term in the White House and his move to pass the torch to Harris. The president is expected to use his speech to lay out his argument for Harris, describe the record they’ve achieved together and stress the need to defeat former President Donald Trump, who he believes poses a threat to democracy, Biden aides said. As he prepared to board Marine One to fly to Camp David on Friday, the president was asked by reporters about his message for Democrats at the convention. The president answered: “Win.” Keep reading about Biden’s expected message at the DNC. New polling from The New York Times and Siena College suggests a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in four Sun Belt states, with no clear leader in Arizona, Nevada or North Carolina, while Trump holds the edge in Georgia.  Among registered voters, Trump leads in Georgia 51% to 44%, but in the rest, the margin falls within each poll’s margin of error: 49% Harris to 45% Trump in Arizona, 49% Harris to 46% Trump in North Carolina, and 48% Trump to 46% Harris in Nevada. The results suggest some differences between the battleground states across the country’s southern tier, including among key demographic groups state-to-state: Female voters: In Arizona and North Carolina, Harris has opened up wide leads among women, topping Trump 60% to 35% in Arizona and 57% to 39% in North Carolina. Those margins are more narrowly in her favor in Georgia (53% Harris to 42% Trump) and Nevada (51% Harris to 43% Trump). Latino and Black voters: Harris fares better among Latino voters in Arizona (56% Harris to 38% Trump) than she does in Nevada (45% Harris to 44% Trump). And her support among Black voters is significantly broader in North Carolina (85% Harris to 9% Trump) than it is in Georgia (73% Harris to 20% Trump).  White voters: Trump holds a wider edge among White voters without college degrees, a key part of his coalition, in the Southern states in this batch of polls than the Western ones. That group splits 79% Trump to 18% Harris in Georgia, and 67% Trump to 30% Harris in North Carolina, but breaks more narrowly in his favor in Nevada (59% Trump to 37% Harris) and Arizona (56% Trump to 40% Harris). Younger voters: Voters younger than 30 break in Trump’s favor in Georgia, 51% Trump to 44% Harris, while breaking more decisively toward Harris in the other three states, 52% Harris to 36% Trump in Arizona, 53% Harris to 39% Trump in Nevada, and 56% Harris to 39% Trump in North Carolina.  On the issues: Across all of these states, Trump holds a significant advantage over Harris as being more trusted to handle the economy (56% Trump to 41% Harris when results from all four states are combined), while Harris has a slightly larger edge on handling abortion (56% Harris to 38% Trump). On immigration, voters split 53% Trump to 43% Harris, and they break the other way by a similar margin, 52% Harris to 43% Trump, on handling democracy. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday unveiled a populist economic agenda, proposing a new plan to cut taxes for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans as she builds out the details of her governing agenda weeks after locking down the Democratic presidential nomination. The vice president proposed her economic platform — which includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and raising children more affordable — in a speech in battleground North Carolina. It comes as her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, seeks to pin blame on Harris for inflation since she and President Joe Biden took office. Here are more details: Far from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns. Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. Nobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience. So we don’t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect: Click here for more of what to expect in the months ahead. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a new radio ad this weekend targeting Black voters in six battleground states as it seeks to mobilize the key demographic.  The ad, titled “Foundation,” leans into Harris growing up in a middle-class family and her efforts to lower prices of everyday costs to ensure Americans “not only get by, but get ahead.”  The 60-second spot is part of a seven-figure paid media buy for the remainder of August. It will air across six swing states: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. The ad, along with an additional 30-second spot, will air on national radio stations and popular radio shows including “The Breakfast Club,” “The Morning Hustle,” Urban One radio network, Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Rickey Smiley and Erica Campbell."
"Indian Americans are fired up about Kamala Harris, and their votes could make a difference in the 2024 election | CNN Politics","Published 10:00 AM EDT, Sat August 17, 2024",2024-08-17T14:00:02.475Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/17/politics/indian-americans-kamala-harris-election-cec/index.html,"On a recent Sunday afternoon, Vineeta Gupta hosted 20 Indian American women at her home in Silver Spring, Maryland. Fueled by chana masala, naan and rice pudding, they wrote hundreds of postcards in an appeal to fellow South Asians. Their message: Vote Kamala Harris for the next president of the United States. Organizing for a political candidate was a highly unusual move for Gupta, a 61-year-old physician and human rights lawyer who immigrated to the US from India in 2003. Despite advocating various social justice causes, Gupta — a registered independent — had never involved herself in electoral politics outside of voting. That changed last month when Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, rose to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden announced he wouldn’t seek reelection. Gupta joined several WhatsApp groups of politically activated South Asian Americans. She participated in a “South Asian Women for Harris” Zoom call. She appealed to skeptical women of color on LinkedIn. On August 6, she drove to Philadelphia to watch Harris introduce Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate — Gupta’s first election rally. “It became impossible not to engage,” she told CNN. “The choice is not about Democrats or Republicans. The choice is between democracy and losing it.” Many Indian Americans appear to share Gupta’s newfound enthusiasm and urgency. Over the past several weeks, national and grassroots political organizers from the community say they’ve seen a groundswell of support and energy for the Harris campaign. Aunties and uncles are exchanging “LOTUS for POTUS” memes in WhatsApp group chats (Kamala means lotus in Sanskrit). The Indian American Impact Fund said the South Asian women Zoom call that Gupta joined raised more than $275,000, and leaders from the advocacy group report an influx of small-dollar donations and volunteer sign-ups. Indian Americans haven’t historically been a political force in US elections, but the 2024 race could mark a turning point for one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the country. With the Indian American population more than doubling in key battleground states between 2010 and 2020, some organizers say a fired-up electorate could make a difference come November. An estimated 4.8 million people in the US identify as Indian Americans – a relatively small slice of the US electorate – and more than 2.1 million of them are eligible voters, according to the research and policy organization AAPI Data. Indian Americans tend to be a reliably Democratic voting bloc with high turnout rates: 55% of Indian American voters identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic, and 91% said they plan to vote in November, an AAPI Data survey conducted before Biden’s departure from the race found. But while nearly half of Indian American voters (46%) indicated in the survey that they would vote for Biden, the figure was down nearly 20 points from 2020 (65%). And many Indian Americans, like Gupta, weren’t engaged beyond the ballot box — until Harris catapulted to the top of the ticket. Her ascension also reinvigorated the volunteers of the “Chitthi Brigade,” a grassroots group of South Asian women that gets its name from a Tamil term for aunt. New York state resident Indira Rajan, who co-founded the group in 2020 after Harris’ vice presidential nomination, said volunteers felt a sense of hopelessness around Biden that has since given way to a “sea change in motivation” and new sign-ups. She and her fellow “chitthis” across the country now plan to engage in letter-writing initiatives and meet-and-greets, as well as to collaborate with other local organizations on events. At least part of the Indian American enthusiasm for Harris stems from pride in a shared identity. Harris’ lat﻿e mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and immigrated to the US in 1958 to attend a doctoral program at the University of California, Berkeley. Harris has shared childhood memories of visiting her grandfather in Chennai and has spoken about how her Indian heritage has influenced her life and career. “She comes from Besant Nagar in Chennai. That’s where I grew up,” Rajan said. “It seems something very close to home.” “There’s more of a comfort level with her, partially because her mom looks like my mom,” said Viraj Mehta from Bethesda, Maryland. The 38-year-old physician said he was inspired to connect with the Indian American Impact Fund and join several organizing groups after Harris entered the presidential race. Though Indian Americans have risen to political prominence in recent years, the prospect of an Indian American occupying the nation’s highest office has especially energized organizers and volunteers, says Indian American Impact Fund Executive Director Chintan Patel. “It’s easy to imagine, moving forward, that parents are going to be telling their kids, ‘You should be a doctor. You should be an engineer. You should also be a president,’” he said. “It’s really helping reimagine for the South Asian American community what is possible here in America for our kids.” As powerful as that representation is, for most Indian Americans, it’s simply one consideration. Though some, including Mehta, supported Harris during her first presidential bid in 2020, Gupta and others have come on board because they see a more mature and savvy candidate now. “When she went into the race this time, there was something authentic about her,” Gupta said. “I identify with that myself, as a South Asian woman – how much implicit and explicit pressure we keep on our shoulders not to be our authentic selves.” While Harris’ Indian background can help turn out the vote and galvanize more volunteers, it won’t matter much in terms of how people vote, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder and executive director of AAPI Data and a researcher at UC Berkeley. Like US voters more broadly, many Indian American voters surveyed by AAPI Data identified the economy as their top policy concern – Indian American enthusiasm for Biden decreased from 2020 in part because voters said they disapproved of his economic performance, Ramakrishnan said. Still, there are some nuances to how this demographic votes, with Indian Americans particularly concerned about immigration and climate change, according to Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Ratna Rao, a grassroots political organizer in Michigan, said the Biden administration’s policies around illegal border crossing and asylum seekers were frustrating to those Indian Americans who endured long waits for green cards due to massive processing backlogs. “People feel like Democrats are more focused on people who are coming here illegally than the legal immigrants who have been working hard, paying taxes and being a part of the community,” she said. More than half of Indian Americans surveyed by AAPI Data also indicated that they could not vote for a candidate with opposing views on abortion. Gupta, who formerly practiced as a maternal health physician in India, said Republican-led attacks on reproductive rights are a key reason why she’s mobilizing for Harris. “After (Roe v. Wade) went to dust, I cannot imagine that we are going to restrict it even more,” Gupta said. “That is not acceptable for me as a woman, as a women’s health physician, as a mother.” Despite the overall enthusiasm, the support for Harris isn’t a given in some parts of the Indian American community. Ramakrishnan said Biden’s handling of Israel’s war in Gaza lost him support among some Indian Americans who wanted to see more US support for Palestinians. Rasheed Ahmed, executive director of the Indian American Muslim Council, said he and others in his circles are waiting to see how Harris will navigate the US relationship with India, considering the current Indian government’s policies and rhetoric toward Muslims and other minorities. “We want to see Vice President Harris taking some kind of position on the fundamental rights of minorities in India,” he said. “Most of us are waiting for that before we make the final call.” Whatever frustrations some Indian Americans may have with the Democratic Party, the GOP has not been able to capitalize on them and recruit more of the community into its fold. Just over 1 in 4 Indian American voters (26%) identify as Republican or lean Republican (compared with 21 % in 2020), according to AAPI Data. While the data indicates a slight dip in Indian American voters who identify as or lean Democratic, that decrease hasn’t necessarily translated into more support for the GOP, Ramakrishnan said – even as Indian Americans have become prominent in the party. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Ohio entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, two Indian Americans who sought the Republican presidential nomination this year, were both not viewed favorably by a majority of Indian Americans, Ramakrishnan said, citing past AAPI Data findings. “(Indian Americans are) more likely to favor the Democratic Party because they see the Democratic Party as stronger on combating discrimination by race,” he said. “After the 9/11 attacks, especially with the rise in hate crimes and discrimination and racial profiling of Indians, that gap between the Democratic and Republican Party and its credibility and that issue grew even wider.” The 9/11 attacks revealed to Lakshmy Parameswaran that her fundamental rights weren’t as secure as she once believed, prompting her entry into political organizing more than two decades ago. Now, she feels her rights and the country’s democratic institutions are similarly under threat. “This is really a very anxiety-provoking time in this country,” said Parameswaran, a grassroots organizer in Houston. “I’ve been here since 1973 – I’ve never felt this kind of anxiety. It’s been growing since 2016 onwards, and now it’s at a point where this can all be taken away.” The foothold gained by Christian nationalism in GOP politics has also contributed to the party’s struggles to reach Indian Americans, Ramakrishnan said. “Another factor, which has gotten stronger over time … is the rise of Christian conservatism and now Christian nationalism within the Republican Party,” he said. “Indian Americans are majority Hindu, and religiously very diverse, and so that makes it difficult for Indian Americans to feel at home in the Republican Party.” The selection of JD Vance as Donald Trump’s running mate excited Indian American conservatives – Vance’s wife, Usha, is the daughter of Indian immigrants, and people close to the former president expressed hope that she could appeal to minority voters. But her time in the spotlight has been brief so far – less than a week after her husband joined Trump’s ticket, Harris stepped in for Biden and grabbed the headlines. As is the case with most US voters, party identification is what ultimately matters, according to Ramakrishnan. Once Indian Americans identify and affiliate with one party – and a majority are fairly stable Democratic supporters of the Democrats – they’re unlikely to cross party lines just because of a shared ethnicity, he said. Energized by the fervor around the Harris campaign, Indian American grassroots organizers are getting more strategic about how they reach voters in their communities. Rao, the Michigan organizer, said she and fellow organizers are experimenting with friend-to-friend outreach in WhatsApp groups. In an attempt to appeal to parents, one tactic involves distributing short videos of young South Asians talking about how gun violence and other issues affect them. “We may be able to penetrate a little bit more of the people who don’t normally answer calls, open doors, or read a postcard that comes to them – better if they see a video that’s sent by a friend,” she said. Jayashree Bhaskar and her husband KS Bhaskar, who live in Chester County, Pennsylvania, organize phone banks on weekend afternoons for speakers of regional Indian languages such as Gujarati and Punjabi. The initiative has been so well received that Bhaskar said volunteers are asking for more language options, such as Tamil and Malayalam. Other efforts from the Bhaskars include door-knocking, text banking and dropping literature and voter registrations at temples in Bucks County. Though they recognize that they’re working with a small portion of the overall population, the Bhaskars say they’ve done the math: There are enough South Asian registered Democratic voters in Pennsylvania to help Harris win the key battleground state if they can turn them out. “Elections are won on the margin, and we can be the margin of victory,” Jayashree Bhaskar said. “It’s as simple as that.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris has committed to participate in a roundtable with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, her campaign and the union confirmed Friday, as she continues to court working class voters heading into November’s election. The Teamsters, a union with 1.3 million members, is among the last major unions to offer an endorsement in the 2024 race with a decision on whether to back either candidate expected after the conventions. Some Democrats have expressed frustration with Sean O’Brien, the union president, who spoke in a primetime slot at the Republican National Convention while seeking a similar role at next week’s Democratic National Convention. The union is expected to have a presence on stage at the convention, but O’Brien is not expected to speak at the Democratic confab, a source familiar with convention planning said. Teamsters leadership invited Harris to participate in a roundtable shortly after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, writing in a letter to her campaign, “Teamster members want to hear your vision on issues that affect their families.” Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said the vice president “has received and gladly accepted an invitation by IBT leadership to participate in a candidate roundtable to discuss her record of fighting for Teamsters and their families and to highlight her vision for the future. The campaign looks forward to scheduling the roundtable in the near future.” Kara Deniz, a spokesperson for the union, said the union just received notice Harris has accepted the invitation but a date has yet to be set. Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden each participated in roundtables with the Teamsters earlier this year. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein announced Rudolph “Butch” Ware, an activist and professor, as her vice presidential selection at the party’s convention on Friday.  Stein, the presumptive Green Party nominee, revealed her decision during the party’s virtual convention on Friday, one day before she is expected to formally accept the party’s nomination for president.  Stein said she chose Ware, a Muslim and professor at the University of California-Santa Barbara specializing in African and Muslim diaspora, because she wanted someone who could support her criticisms of Israel’s war in Gaza.   “We had wonderful candidates, but because we have always centered genocide, we really wanted a leading voice who is very directly connected with the genocide,” Stein said.  Stein said she only met Ware earlier this week as she solicited a wide-ranging search for candidates who could support her campaign’s message on its core issue. Ware and Stein spoke in a live-streamed interview on Instagram on Monday.  Ware has sharply criticized Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in social media posts and interviews, and he has attacked President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for supporting Israel’s effort. Gold Star father Khizr Khan said Friday that he was “saddened and appalled” by recent comments from former President Donald Trump, who claimed the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which honors civilians, “is actually much better” than the Medal of Honor.  Trump made the statement on Thursday while praising Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson, whom he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom while in office.  Khan, a longtime Trump critic who made headlines for an emotional speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, also said he wasn’t surprised by what Trump said.    GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, an Army veteran, told Collins that the former president respects service members and that his comments were a fair comparison made to the general population, “most of whom have never served in the military.” “I would say, yes, it is better to get that,” Mast said. “It’s certainly a higher honor to receive the Medal of Honor because you served in combat, but the Presidential Medal of Freedom is something people want to get. That’s a distinct difference.” Far from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns. Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. Nobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience. So we don’t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect: Click here for more of what to expect in the months ahead The first presidential debate of 2024 upended the race for the White House, effectively terminated the reelection aspirations of President Joe Biden and perhaps forever altered the direction of the country. With so much potentially at risk at next month’s debate — which will be the first time former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris encounter each other at close range — the planning for the high-stakes showdown has already begun. ABC, the network hosting the debate, announced Friday it will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Harris held her first formal debate training session earlier this week at Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, DC, she attended nearly four decades ago. A team of Democratic advisers joined her there earlier this week, including Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign, several people familiar with the planning told CNN. Karen Dunn, another longtime Clinton adviser who helped Harris prepare for her vice presidential debate in 2020, is also taking part in the preparation efforts, people familiar with the planning said. Former Harris aides Rohini Kosoglu and Sean Clegg are also involved with the effort, according to a person familiar with the prep. Trump, meanwhile, has enlisted one of the vice president’s ex-rivals to help with the preparations: Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 in a crowded field that also included Harris. He has been engaging in less formal policy sessions with close aides, advisers and allies in between campaign appearances and rounds of golf. Trump’s interest in Gabbard as he prepares to face Harris next month stems in part from the notable exchanges the former congresswoman had with the vice president during their 2020 race. Seen mostly as a gadfly and an oddity during her Democratic primary run in 2019, Gabbard’s attack on Harris’ record as a prosecutor may have been her largest direct impact on the race. Though Harris’ team was prepared for the attacks, they admitted that they were shocked by just how much Gabbard was able to rattle Harris, and later said that it helped lock Harris into a tailspin her campaign never recovered from. In crafting the rollout of her first economic policy pillar, Vice President Kamala Harris made clear she needed to “meet voters where they are” by tackling the high cost of living before introducing any forward-looking policies, advisers to the Democratic presidential candidate tell CNN. The platform released today to expand the child tax credit and earned income tax credit and tackle issues with supply and demand in the housing market is meant to be an olive branch to Americans frustrated with the economy. The campaign is planning future policies based on fostering innovation and growth, CNN has reported. Harris will also eventually describe in detail how she plans to pay for the policies she’s proposing. Harris at present backs the tax increases on higher-income individuals and corporations that President Joe Biden included in his budget blueprint in March. The Tax Foundation estimated that those tax hikes would raise $2.1 trillion in revenue for the federal government over 10 years. Today, the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Harris’s economic proposal would cost $1.7 trillion over a decade. A variety of Minnesota public school districts say they do not provide tampons in boys’ bathrooms — debunking a claim former President Donald Trump has been making about Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. Trump has asserted that Walz signed a law that forces Minnesota schools to provide free tampons in boys’ bathrooms, suggesting this supposed policy is evidence of Walz’s radicalism on gender issues. Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. The law, signed by Walz in 2023, intended to make sure students of all income levels and gender identities have ready access to menstrual products, says school districts and charter schools must make menstrual products like tampons and pads available at no cost “to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12 according to a plan developed by the school district.” The law never specifies that menstrual products must be put in “boys’ bathrooms,” and it allows school districts to decide what counts as a bathroom “regularly used by students.” Districts are permitted to provide menstrual products in bathrooms for students of any gender, which are often single-stall rooms, rather than in their traditional multi-stall bathrooms for boys. All 12 of the districts that responded Friday to a CNN survey of 25 districts, including the Minneapolis and St. Paul districts in the state’s two most populous cities, said they comply with the law without providing tampons in traditional boys’ bathrooms. A 13th district, Anoka-Hennepin, said the same to the Star Tribune newspaper earlier this month. Read the full fact check of Trump’s claim about the Minnesota bill. Independent presidential candidate Cornel West will not appear on November’s presidential ballot in Michigan, the state’s elections office said on Friday.  The Michigan Bureau of Elections said in a letter to West he failed to qualify for Michigan’s ballot after his petition was challenged by Clear Choice PAC, a pro-Harris group combatting third-party candidates across the country. West’s petition was determined to be improperly notarized, violating Michigan state law, the letter from Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater read. Clear Choice’s challenge to West’s petition also claimed that the signatures he submitted were fraudulent and improperly collected. The Michigan Bureau of Elections did not make a determination on the validity of West’s signatures. West being on the ballot in Michigan could have potentially complicated the dynamics of the race in that state, particularly for Vice President Kamala Harris. West has referred to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as “apartheid” and called for an immediate ceasefire. He has met with Muslim and Arab-American leaders in Michigan and made an effort to peel away the support of progressive voters who supported President Joe Biden in 2020. In a statement to CNN, West campaign spokesperson Edwin DeJesus criticized the ruling and suggested West was not granted ballot access because of West’s outreach to Muslim and Arab-American communities in Michigan. “The charges regarding procedural errors in our filings, such as notarization specifics, are trivial technicalities being weaponized to distract from substantive policy debates,” DeJesus said. Clear Choice founder Pete Kavanaugh praised the decision for enforcing petition-gathering laws in the state, saying that “candidates who play by the rules should be on the ballot, but Cornel West is blatantly not playing by the rules, in Michigan or anywhere else.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a new radio ad this weekend targeting Black voters in six battleground states as it seeks to mobilize the key demographic.  The ad, titled “Foundation,” leans into Harris growing up in a middle-class family and her efforts to lower prices of everyday costs to ensure Americans “not only get by, but get ahead.”  The 60-second spot is part of a seven-figure paid media buy for the remainder of August. It will air across six swing states: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. The ad, along with an additional 30-second spot, will air on national radio stations and popular radio shows including The Breakfast Club, The Morning Hustle, Urban One radio network, Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Rickey Smiley and Erica Campbell. Food prices have surged by more than 20% under the Biden-Harris administration, leaving many voters eager to stretch their dollars further at the grocery store. On Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris said she has a solution: a federal ban on price gouging across the food industry. There’s just one issue: Harris’ proposal could create more problems than the one it’s trying to solve, some economists say. Gavin Roberts studied anti-price gouging laws some states passed during the pandemic. One of the biggest effects he observed, especially at grocery stores, was that these laws motivated people “to go buy goods more than they would if prices had risen.” When prices are high, in most cases, the best policy action in response is actually taking no action, Roberts, the chair of Weber State University’s economics department, told CNN. That would cause consumers who are deterred by, say, high prices of beef, to instead purchase another type of meat or protein. That helps keep beef on the grocery store shelves for people who want it enough to pay the higher prices. And while Harris claims her proposal “will help the food industry become more competitive,” Roberts said it would do just the opposite. “It’s more likely to maintain that status quo,” he said because it would keep new competition from moving in to take advantage of the bigger profit margins — competition that could have helped lower prices in the long run. Instead of pursuing anti-price gouging policies, Roberts recommended that Harris investigate what, if anything, is stopping new parties from entering concentrated industries. Campaign staff declined to comment on critiques of Harris’ proposed price-gouging ban, pointing CNN to Harris’ speech and the fact sheet shared ahead of it. And the proposal had its supporters, as well. Lindsay Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive think tank, applauded the plan. “I definitely don’t think that the price gouging statute will result in shortages,” she told CNN, adding that it would give government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission more authority to “crackdown on bad actors” charging consumers higher prices. Former President Donald Trump is featured on a new song by rappers Kodak Black and Fivio Foreign called “ONBOA47RD.”   The campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In one of his last presidential acts, Trump granted clemency to Kodak Black, whose real name is Bill Kapri. Trump’s then-press secretary Kayleigh McEnany described the rapper as “a prominent artist and community leader” in a statement announcing his clemency. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday unveiled a populist economic agenda, proposing a new plan to cut taxes for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans as she builds out the details of her governing agenda weeks after locking down the Democratic presidential nomination. The vice president proposed her economic platform — which includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and raising children more affordable — in a speech in battleground North Carolina. It comes as her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, seeks to pin blame on Harris for inflation since she and President Joe Biden took office. Here are more details: Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance argued Friday in favor of immigration policy that “promotes assimilation” and doubled down on the idea that unchecked influxes of immigration could foster “ethnic conflicts” when pressed about his previous comments about 20th century immigration waves. A reporter asked the Ohio senator about comments that he made in a 2021 podcast interview suggesting that previous waves of immigration from Europe promoted “inter-ethnic” conflict in the US. Responding to the reporter on Friday, Vance said, “I also said there were a lot of benefits to that wave of immigration,” adding, “But has anybody ever seen the movie ‘Gangs of New York?’ That’s what I’m talking about,” referring to the film featuring strife between Irish immigrants and anti-immigrant gangs.  “What happens when you have massive amounts of illegal immigration, it actually starts to create ethnic conflict,” he added. Vance argued in order to address the issue as it currently stands, “we’ve got to slow those illegal immigration levels to zero.” “We do have to deport some people who have come here illegally, and I think that will promote assimilation and a common American culture that’s in the best interest of everybody,” he said, adding the reason why he thinks he and his wife, Usha, the daughter of Indian immigrants, have a good marriage is because “we both very much feel like America is our home, like our children belong here.” The ability to own a home has grown increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday highlighted one of her foundational policies: to help make housing more affordable. The plan, which builds on proposals that President Joe Biden has already announced, promises: Long before the pandemic and supply chain issues and rise in remote work rocketed the nation’s real estate industry, chronically low inventory served as a bottleneck and helped fuel higher prices and worsen affordability. Although economists and policy analysts cheered some of her plans to assist buyers – specifically a proposal to drastically increase the supply of homes for purchase – some feared that parts of Harris’ plan may exacerbate the problems in the market. The down-payment assistance proposal and tax credits could potentially fuel demand and higher prices, said Lanhee Chen, director of domestic policy studies at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University and a past CNN opinion contributor who has worked on political campaigns for Republicans. The economic plans released by Vice President Kamala Harris detail dozens of ways her administration would put money back in Americans’ pockets on issues like child care and housing, where costs have risen dramatically in recent years. What’s missing is how the government would pay for those benefits, which will cost hundreds of billions of dollars.  Those details will come later, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, as Harris’ team plans a series of rollouts on economic policies centered on specific themes.  One future policy rollout will focus on plans to spur innovation and growth, the sources said, describing the focus as keeping the US competitive in fostering businesses of all sizes.   In remarks in North Carolina on Friday, Harris alluded to a forthcoming announcement on the “opportunity economy.”  With inflation and the cost of living consistently ranking among the top concerns for voters, the Harris team planned a first rollout focused on policies attempting to address those concerns directly. Among the proposals is a plan to restore the American Rescue Plan’s expanded child tax credit of $3,600 per child, a proposal that the Tax Foundation estimated would cost $223 billion over the next 10 years when it was included in Biden’s budget blueprint.  That blueprint proposed paying for expanded tax credits by raising the tax rate on corporations and individuals making more than $400,000.   Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday acknowledged that the United States is facing “a serious housing shortage” and vowed to address it, if elected, by building three million homes that are affordable for the middle class by the end of her first term. “By the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.” CNN has previously reported that the goal of building 3 million units is one of the most critical elements of Harris’ approach to the housing crisis. Vice President Kamala Harris is promising $25,000 in down-payment assistance to support first-time home buyers if she is elected president in November. “We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well. Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough,” Harris said on Friday. The down-payment assistance is aimed at helping “more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.” What we know about this plan: The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time home buyers. The plan, which would be implemented during Harris’ first term, according to the campaign, would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, something President Joe Biden proposed earlier this year. According to the Harris campaign, the plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation home buyers, to access the funds. CNN’s MJ Lee, Tami Luhby and Samantha Delouya contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to contrast herself with her opponent Donald Trump, arguing in remarks unveiling her economic platform in Raleigh, North Carolina, that the former president did not discuss his plans in a recent visit to the state. Harris also used the economic policy speech to call back to Trump’s sweeping tax cuts in 2017, which she said “overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations.” This post was updated with more of Harris’ criticism of Trump’s economic policies. Vice President Kamala Harris said that while some factors putting pressure on prices have improved since the onset of the pandemic, “prices are still too high.” She went on to suggest that “price gouging” could be keeping prices elevated. The jury is still out on the extent to which alleged corporate greed, also referred to as price gouging, has contributed to inflation over the last few years. Research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve suggests alleged corporate price gouging was not a primary catalyst for the inflation surge that began in 2021, while progressive-leaning think tanks have published research that suggests there’s a more direct link. In any event, the inflation Americans have had to contend with over the past few years is the product of a confluence of events that include the war in Ukraine, government spending and pandemic-related disruptions across the economy. Vice President Kamala Harris contrasted her cost-savings plan with former President Donald Trump’s plan during a speech Friday on the economy. She repeatedly used the term “Trump tax,” arguing former President Donald Trump’s agenda would raise prices for a typical American family by $3,900 a year. The “Trump tax” Harris is referring to is Trump’s plan to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a tariff of at least a 10% on all $3 trillion worth of US imports. That unprecedented plan has been almost universally panned by mainstream economists. It would impose “significant collateral damage on the US economy,” costing consumers at least $500 billion a year, according to a paper published in May by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The nonpartisan group estimated Trump’s tariff proposals would cost the typical middle-income household at least $1,700 a year. The $3,900 number Harris quoted was from the progressive Center for American Progress Fund, which analyzed a higher 20% tax on imports that Trump sometimes cites in his rally speeches. Like former President Donald Trump on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris called out the high prices Americans are paying for groceries during a campaign speech Friday. “We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high,” she said. Americans paid 21% more for their groceries last month compared to when Harris took office in 2021, according to Consumer Price Index data. Compared to February 2020, grocery prices are up more than 25%. But price pressures are fading. Grocery prices rose at an annual pace of 1.1% last month, according to the latest CPI data released Wednesday. That’s a huge improvement from last July, when grocery prices were rising at an annual pace of 3.6%. But prices are growing at a very fast pace for some individual items. For instance, frozen beverages and eggs cost more than 19% in July compared to a year ago. Hot dog prices are also up nearly 10% for the year ended in July. Vice President Kamala Harris said Friday that lowering the cost of living will be a top priority of hers, highlighting the sharp price hikes that families have faced since before the pandemic. “We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed; but supply chains have improved, and prices are still too high,” Harris said in North Carolina. The pandemic, its effect on consumer behavior and the rapid economic recovery, dislodged the global supply chain, hurling once smoothly running businesses, industries and economies into a state of disarray. The unprecedented stress on supply chains contributed significantly to inflation’s rise in early 2021; however, it was not the sole cause. Inflation’s rapid ascent, which began in early 2021, was the result of a confluence of factors, including effects from the Covid-19 pandemic such as snarled supply chains and geopolitical fallout (specifically Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) that triggered food and energy price shocks. Heightened consumer demand boosted in part by fiscal stimulus from both the Trump and Biden administrations also led to higher prices, as did the post-pandemic imbalance in the labor market. Vice President Kamala Harris said she would pass the first federal ban on price gouging on food if she is elected president — speaking about a topic that is emerging as key to voters. The vice president pointed to the cost of items such as bread and ground beef. She claimed big food manufacturers are seeing their profits go up, but there are some grocery chains that have not passed along savings to customers. Harris said she would take action against those who are not “playing by the rules” and talked about her past as a prosecutor. “So believe me, as president, I will go after the bad actors,” Harris said. More on this: As part of her first 100 days in office, the vice president’s campaign previously said she would implement a plan to keep costs down that includes authorizing the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and implement harsh penalties on companies that violate the federal ban, resources that can detect price-fixing, and more support for small businesses to potentially grow into competitors of large companies. Vice President Kamala Harris said in remarks unveiling her economic plan that she will be “laser-focused” in efforts to create more opportunities for the middle class, with an approach she called the “opportunity economy.” Harris went on to explain the term, saying it is “an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed. Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children.” Vice President Kamala Harris highlighted the strength of the United States economy today — saying it is the policies of the Biden-Harris administration that brought it back from “one of the worst economic crises in modern history.” At a campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday, Harris painted the election in November as being about “two very different visions for our nations.” “Ours, focused on the future, and the other focused on the past,” she said. The economy is one of those areas where this contrast is highlighted, Harris said. Specifically, she said the Biden-Harris administration made investments in infrastructure, manufacturing and clean energy. She also pointed out a new report that measured inflation below 3% for the first time since March 2021. Former President Donald Trump will hold an event on Monday in Pennsylvania, offering counter-programming to the Democratic National Convention that is kicking off the same day in Chicago. Trump’s remarks will focus on the economy, according to a statement. In the statement, the former president’s campaign attacked Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic plans, arguing that the Biden-Harris administration policies have hurt Americans. Trump held a news conference yesterday where he stood at a podium flanked by tables filled with grocery store products and prices to indicate the impacts of inflation. Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance on Friday again pushed back on the idea that former President Donald Trump needs to refocus his campaign strategy on issues, instead of personal attacks, in order to be more successful in winning over voters in swing states. Vance said the reason Trump is successful in connecting with voters is “even when they disagree with something that he might say, they know that he just is who he is.” The Ohio senator added that he would rather support a candidate who he disagreed with “25% of the time,” but “was a real human being and was willing to speak off the cuff,” than Vice President Kamala Harris, who Vance argued “hides behind a teleprompter.” A major part of Vance’s recent campaign strategy has been attacking Harris for not sitting down for interviews or taking many reporter questions, while he’s been holding press availabilities at all of his solo campaign stops in battleground states. Vance has been holding policy-themed campaign stops, including an event with police in Milwaukee on Friday, preceded by a veteran-focused stop in Pennsylvania and a manufacturing-focused stop in Michigan. Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, is reprising his role of playing Donald Trump as he and a team of Democratic advisers intensify their efforts to prepare Vice President Kamala Harris for her first debate next month with the former president. Several people familiar with debate planning tell CNN that the Harris campaign invited Reines to help the vice president get ready for her encounter with Trump on September 10 in Philadelphia. Harris, along with Reines, took part in their first formal debate training session earlier this week at Howard University, where Harris attended college nearly four decades ago. Aides to Harris were struck by how uncanny Reines’ impression of Trump is, a person familiar with the preparations told CNN. Karen Dunn, another longtime Clinton adviser who helped Harris prepare for her vice presidential debate in 2020, is also taking part in the preparation efforts, people familiar with the planning say. Former Harris aides Rohini Kosoglu and Sean Clegg are also involved with the effort, according to one person familiar with the plans. The debate preparations are expected to intensify after the Democratic convention next week in Chicago. Neither the Harris campaign nor Reines have responded to requests for comment. The Washington Post was the first to report the debate preparations involving Reines. The New York Times reported on the involvement of Kosoglu and Clegg. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance defended his running mate’s comment Thursday that Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson received the “much better” Medal of Freedom, compared to the top military award, the Medal of Honor. Vance insisted Friday that the “veteran community is very, very much behind Donald Trump.” Vance pointed to his own experience as a Marine and said Trump also awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor and other commemorations to military veterans when he was president. “This is a guy who loves our veterans and who honors our veterans. I don’t think him complimenting and saying a nice word about a person who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom is in any way denigrating those who receive military honors,” he said. Some background: Trump called the Medal of Freedom the “much better” medal compared to the Medal of Honor because for the latter the recipients have “been hit so many times by bullets or they’re dead.” Trump made the comments at an event focused on combating anti-Semitism in which he was introduced by Adelson, who has donated millions of dollars to his reelection effort. Adelson’s late husband, Sheldon Adelson, was also a major Republican donor who supported Trump. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed reporting to this post. As Former President Donald Trump prepares for his first debate with Vice President Kamala Harris next month, he has enlisted one of the Democrat’s former rivals to help: Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard’s involvement, first reported Friday by The New York Times, was confirmed to CNN by the Trump campaign. Gabbard, who previously represented Hawaii in the US House, ran for president in 2020 in a crowded Democratic field that also included Harris. The two had several notable exchanges during Democratic primary debates, where Harris criticized Gabbard for her foreign policy views while Gabbard challenged Harris’ record on criminal justice. Gabbard endorsed President Joe Biden after suspending her campaign, but then became a vocal critic of the president. She announced she was leaving the Democratic Party in 2022. The September 10 debate between Harris and Trump will be held in Philadelphia, ABC News announced Friday. Advisers to Trump told CNN that while the former president is preparing for the debate, these ongoing sessions — now underway — were likely to remain less formal, as they were for Trump’s debate earlier this year with Biden.   President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential election – and Vice President Kamala Harris’ subsequent rise as the Democratic Party’s nominee – perked up some Americans feelings about the economy this month, but some others became more pessimistic. The University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey, released Friday, showed that “sentiment for Democrats climbed 6% in the wake of Harris replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee for president.” Sentiment among people surveyed who identified as “independent” also improved, rising 3%. But consumer sentiment among respondents who identified as Republican “moved in the opposite direction, falling 5% this month,” the survey said. The poll also found that more respondents feel more confident about how Harris would handle the economy versus her opponent, former President Donald Trump. Amid an unusually hectic summer for national politics, a group of teenage voters met in Washington, DC, as part of their America in One Room: The Youth Vote event from July 19-22 to discuss politics. CNN spoke with three of the first-time presidential voters at the event. Here’s what they said: Ysabella Olsen: The 18-year-old Democrat from Missouri said she believes her state will go red, but “I think that if we stopped voting altogether, that would be problematic.” The impact of voting in local elections is not lost on Olsen. “I think on the local level, my vote really does matter,” she said. “In the first election I ever voted in, our park tax won by 52 votes. And I think that’s really big. It shows that my vote does matter. And even though it’s … not like a huge tax, if that didn’t pass, we wouldn’t be able to beautify our park, keep our riverfront safe, build a veterans’ memorial.” Moving forward, Olsen said she hopes the Democratic Party focuses on future-looking policies, such as combatting climate change and advancing racial equity, She cited Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as a politician who understands the need to prioritize “policies of the future that young people want.” Andrew Langmuir: The 18-year-old Democrat from New Jersey said he is “not a fan of the two-party system at all” and wished voters had more choices beyond the two major parties. While he comes from a blue state, he says he doesn’t think it’s a reason to abstain from voting. “If people keep on saying, ‘My vote doesn’t matter,’ and then they stop voting, there’s a potential that it won’t always stay that way.” In November, he will vote for Kamala Harris and encourages other young Americans to turn out and vote. Elijah Butcher: The Independent from South Carolina has libertarian views. The 18-year-old said he appreciated hearing from people his age with different perspectives from his own – the participants were 42% Democrat, 28% Republican and 20% independent. “It may seem a little naive, but I think my vote does matter, even if I vote for a third-party candidate and a third-party candidate … barely gets any votes and loses by a lot,” he said. “That’s still a vote that’s not going to the two major parties and still a vote that’s towards a cause that I believe in more than the two major parties, and I’m proud of that fact.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has made two additional hires, tapping White House officials to join her communications team. Ian Sams, a former spokesperson for Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign, will be joining the Harris 2024 campaign as a top spokesperson, according to a person familiar with the move. Sams is currently a spokesperson for the White House Counsel’s office, and has worked on oversight and investigations issues pertaining to President Joe Biden in that role. Sams’ style is viewed by some in Democratic politics as being an attack dog; others have at times have bristled at his at-times combative nature. Additionally, Kristen Orthman will leave her post as principal deputy communications director at the White House to join the Harris campaign, according to a source familiar. The vice president has beefed up her team with people she has worked with and has already established relationships with; she left the top leadership of the campaign more or less intact since Biden dropped out but made additional hires. Protective fencing is up, street closures are beginning and local and federal law enforcement officials say Chicago is prepared as Democrats begin to descend on the city for the party’s convention. The convention is kicking off just five weeks after the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania — a moment that raised concerns about the security at Democrats’ gathering in Chicago as well as Republicans’ convention in Milwaukee last month. Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Thursday on CNN that the attempted assassination “did heighten our awareness here” as law enforcement planned for “any possibility.” Also looming as Chicago prepared for the convention has been the memory of 1968, when violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters erupted amid protests over the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War. Snelling said Chicago police have “taken corrective action on those past mistakes” — including efforts to prevent a repeat of 1968 in 2012, when Chicago hosted heads of government at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit. Street closures were set to begin Friday and Saturday as the city prepares to host about 50,000 visitors — including DNC delegates, an international media contingent, dignitaries, elected officials and more. “There will be traffic delays, but that’s Chicago. We always have traffic delays in the city,” Snelling said. Read more about how Chicago is getting ready for the DNC. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Friday bashed Vice President Kamala Harris over her expected call for a federal ban on price gouging to lower grocery prices and everyday costs. The campaign added: “If lowering prices is a ‘day one’ priority for Harris, did she forget her ‘day one’ was 3.5 years ago?” Harris on Friday is expected to unveil her economic policy in Raleigh, North Carolina. The proposal, her campaign said, is part of Harris’ efforts to prevent corporations in the food and grocery industries from hiking up prices on consumers and is a fraction of a larger plan she will roll out to tackle high costs and inflation. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin defended Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Friday amid criticism that Walz falsely claimed in 2018 he carried weapons “in war” when he never actually served in combat. The Harris campaign said in a statement that Walz had “misspoke.” Durbin compared Republican complaints about Walz’s words to the “swift-boating of John Kerry,” cautioning that Democrats were “naive at the time, believing that no right-thinking American would fall for it. Some did, and it might have cost an election.” Democratic members of Congress who served in the military also signed an open letter defending Walz’s military service record and calling GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s attacks on Walz “beyond the pale,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN Friday.  Durbin also said he was unaware of reports from CNN and other outlets that Walz’s first congressional campaign in 2006 lied that he was not drinking alcohol when he was arrested for DWI in 1995, though court and police records connected to the incident show that Walz admitted in court that he had been drinking. The artist behind the iconic “Hope” poster that became a prominent symbol of Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign has created similar artwork for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid. Shepard Fairey’s new poster, titled “Forward,” features the Democratic nominee in shades of blue, contrasted by red lipstick. Harris is depicted wearing a pearl earring and necklace. Fairey also offered an endorsement of Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate, adding that “they are our best chance to push back on encroaching fascism and threats to democracy, and our best chance for creating the world we all desire and deserve.” Years after the “Hope” poster, Fairey said Obama didn’t live up to his promise, telling Esquire in 2015 that “there have been a lot of things that he’s compromised on that I never would have expected.” And in the next election, despite calling Donald Trump “dangerous,” Fairey did not create artwork for his opponent Hillary Clinton, and told CNN in 2016 that he didn’t find Clinton “inspiring enough” to illustrate. Fairey then went on to draw three posters in protest of Trump ahead of his inauguration. The posters, titled “We the People,” featured Muslim, Latina, and African-American women. Although Fairey did not create artwork endorsing Joe Biden in 2020, the artist partnered with climate advocacy group Greenpeace USA on a poster that called on Biden — just days into his presidency — to deliver on his climate campaign promises. Jo Anne Price wears a button that says: “You find it offensive. I find it funny. That’s why I’m happier than you.” Price is a Black woman who runs a store selling pro-Trump merchandise in Christiansburg, Virginia. “Racism is a made-up word,” the 72-year-old says. “I don’t know what it is, because it doesn’t exist,” and “if I don’t accept it, it doesn’t apply to me.” Sebriam Vannoy, an older Black gentleman in the store, wore a head-to-toe camo print outfit with “Trump was right,” and three Christian crosses printed on the chest. Vannoy and Price are all in for former President Donald Trump and his reelection bid. They know it’s unusual to be Black and a supporter of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, though both the Republican and Democratic campaigns are trying to shore up or gain support in communities of color. Price, a former chairperson of the Montgomery County GOP, said she didn’t mind the Trump campaign’s assertion that Black people would relate to him because he was a convicted felon. She blames the mass incarceration of Black men in the 90s on “Biden’s laws,” the controversial 1994 crime bill of which President Joe Biden was a key supporter. Vannoy’s support for Trump did not waver once Biden said he would not seek reelection. It wasn’t about race, but sex. One of the most striking things about interviewing strong supporters of Trump is how many defend his most controversial statements. Price said she didn’t have a problem with Trump questioning whether Harris was really Black. “The point he’s making simply is that she is not a Black-Black person,” Price argued, because Harris’ dad was Jamaican and her mom was Indian, making her background different from people whose parents were born here.  Read the full story. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which honors civilians, “is actually much better” than the Medal of Honor, because service members who receive the nation’s highest military decoration are often wounded or awarded it posthumously. Trump was praising Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson, whom he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom while in office, during remarks at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “She gets it and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman, and they’re rated equal,” Trump said. It’s the latest in Trump’s history of making disparaging comments about military service. Keep reading. ABC News announced that the September 10 presidential debate will be held in Philadelphia at 9 p.m. ET. The debate was originally accepted by former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden before the latter dropped out of the race. Trump agreed to the September debate after saying that he would not debate Vice President Kamala Harris if she did not agree to attend a proposed Fox News debate on September 4. Harris, who had previously agreed to the ABC debate, confirmed her participation last week and said she would be “happy” to discuss a further debate. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will launch a bus tour through western Pennsylvania on Sunday, the campaign announced. Harris and Walz will be joined by second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz. CNN previously reported that the tour is scheduled to begin in Pittsburgh and the goal, according to the campaign, is to have a cluster of small events with voters, ranging from canvass kickoffs to stops at local retail shops. The tour follows the pair’s days-long tour of battleground states following Harris’ announcement of Walz as her running mate last week. The Democratic National Convention begins on Monday in Chicago. Officials from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign held meetings with elected officials and leaders from the Arab American and Jewish communities in Michigan this week, according to sources familiar with the meetings. The meetings, which were held Thursday in the Detroit metro area and were in the works for several weeks, according to one of the sources, come as Harris is navigating the Gaza conflict on a political and diplomatic level following her ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket. The war in Gaza continues to be a chief concern among progressives and young voters as well as Muslim and Arab American communities, which represent important voting blocs in the battleground state of Michigan.  Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and Nasrina Bargzie, a former White House official leading the Harris campaign’s outreach to Arab American and Muslim communities, participated in meetings with Arab American elected officials and leaders on Thursday, according to two participants.  Assad Turfe, the chief deputy county executive of Michigan’s Wayne County, was among those who met with the campaign officials and described his conversation as “productive.” Chavez Rodriguez and Ilan Goldenberg, another former White House official who is now leading the campaign’s outreach to the Jewish American community, also met with leaders from the Jewish community while in Michigan. Jordan Acker, an attorney and University of Michigan regent who said his law firm was vandalized and a masked protester appear at his home earlier this year, told CNN he participated in that meeting, and also described it as “productive.” The Detroit Free Press first reported on the campaign’s engagements in Michigan this week. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Friday announced a new presidential transition organization. Trump Vance 2025 Transition, Inc. will be overseen by former Trump administration official Linda McMahon and billionaire Howard Lutnick, and Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. as well as Trump’s running mate JD Vance, who will have an honorary co-chair role alongside the former president.  The formation of the group comes as Trump and his campaign distance themselves from Project 2025, which has created a conservative blueprint for the next Republican president.  Some context: Donald Trump has made it clear he wants little to do with Project 2025, recently claiming on social media, “I have no idea who is behind it.” In fact, at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed reporting to this post. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is attacking Vice President Kamala Harris for “copying” former President Trump as she is set to unveil her economic policy proposal in North Carolina Friday. Vance posted the comments, quoting a tweet highlighting Harris’ support for no tax on tips and a $6,000 child tax credit for new parents. Part of Harris’s proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. It would also include a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. Vance, who advocated for a “broad-based family policy” on CBS Face the Nation, said he would love to see the child tax credit expanded to $5,000 per child, with inclusions for single parents and grandparents who care for children. He said the tax credit should not be based on income.  President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered remarks from Prince George’s County, Maryland on Thursday, sharing the stage for the first joint public event since Biden withdrew from the 2024 race and threw his support behind Harris. Introducing Biden for the first time since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris offered effusive praise for Biden, telling a raucous crowd, “I could speak all afternoon about the person I’m standing on this stage with – our extraordinary president Joe Biden.”  Throughout Harris’ remarks, the crowd erupted in chants of “Thank you, Joe,” which continued after Biden took the stage following Harris’ introduction. Here are highlights from the speech: The Secret Service has begun bolstering Donald Trump’s security detail and plans to surround the former president with bulletproof glass at campaign rallies.  A senior official told CNN that an increased number of agents and certain technological changes are also part of the bulked-up measures, though they declined to provide more details for security reasons.  The measures are being implemented in the wake of the near-assassination of Trump at a rally last month in Butler, Pennsylvania. Ballistic glass is commonly used for the protection of current presidents and is moved into place by the Department of Defense, which has an extensive transportation operation, including planes. For Trump, the Secret Service will strategically place the glass around the country in areas where he is expected to visit, because the agency doesn’t have its own aircraft, the official told CNN.  Ballistic glass is generally used for outdoor events, whereas indoor events usually don’t require such a measure, because individuals are screened before entering. The official told CNN that the glass could be used in either setting depending on the security at each location. A Secret Service spokesperson told CNN the agency could not comment on specifics for security reasons. The Harris campaign is kicking off a “weekend of action” ahead of the Democratic National Convention as they seek to court voters in swing states. More than 2,800 events will be held across key battleground states including “Kallin’ for Kamala” phone banks, canvas kickoffs, trivia nights, Project 2025 message trainings and “Hound Lovers for Harris” meetups at dog parks. Organizing booths will also be stationed at cultural events including Wisconsin’s Africa Fest and the Puerto Rican Family Festival in Milwaukee. The campaign says more than 10,000 volunteers will barnstorm swing states in an effort to mobilize voters through door-knocking and making phone calls. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell are among several Democratic surrogates who are expected to hit the trail this weekend to rally support for the Harris-Walz ticket. The campaign touted their ground infrastructure with 280 offices and 1600+ staff, and criticized former President Donald Trump for “holding desperate press conference after desperate press conference to try and steal attention.” “The Trump-Vance ticket is spiraling while the Harris-Walz campaign is doing what’s needed to break through, reach voters and win a close election this November,” the press release said. Democratic members of Congress who served in the military have signed an open letter defending Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military service record and calling Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s attacks on Walz “beyond the pale,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.  The letter, signed by 19 Democratic veterans in Congress and coordinated by Navy veteran Rep. Mikie Sherrill, praises Walz’s “ethos and leadership” and his work as a former member of Congress and governor on behalf of veterans. The letter also attacks Vance, who served in the Marine Corps, for calling Walz’s military service into question. “In the military, we all learned to respect and defend our fellow service members. While we might disagree with their policy proposals, we would never question their motives. We would never say that person doesn’t love America,” the letter states. “But that’s exactly what JD Vance did this week. And even worse, his attacks were purely politically driven.” The letter goes on to highlight former President Donald Trump’s previous comments disparaging military service members, calling those comments “a disgrace,” and urging Vance to cease criticizing Walz’s military service. The letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Tom Carper, Tammy Duckworth, Mark Kelly, Gary Peters and Jack Reed, along with Democratic Reps. Jake Auchincloss, Salud Carbajal, Jason Crow, Christopher Deluzio, Ruben Gallego, Chrissy Houlahan, Ted Lieu, Seth Moulton, Jimmy Panetta, Pat Ryan, Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan, Bobby Scott, Mikie Sherrill and Mike Thompson. It comes in response to Vance and Republican allies accusing Walz of misrepresenting his service record, highlighting a video of a 2018 campaign event in which Walz said he carried weapons “in war.” Vance said that quote amounted to “stolen valor.” The Harris campaign said in a statement following the attacks from Vance that he “misspoke.”  Vance has also falsely accused Walz of dodging an overseas deployment. Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. Shortly after he retired, Walz’s unit received notification they would deploy to Iraq. Vance response: Vance spokesperson Luke Schroeder responded in a statement to CNN, repeating those claims: CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. Correction: An earlier version of this post included an incorrect list of signatories. It has been updated. Deep into his ranting news conference on Thursday, former President Donald Trump told a truth that explained everything: He was referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, whose late entry into the general election race has left him bitter, disoriented, and mourning the loss of the old campaign — the one he was winning against President Joe Biden. Trump’s discombobulation was laid bare in a self-pitying and raging stream of consciousness delivered at his New Jersey golf club that raised serious questions about the future trajectory of his quest to return to power. The ex-president insulted his way into the Oval Office in 2016 — when his often-unhinged soliloquies that shattered all the rules of decorum and politics delighted grassroots Republican voters craving an anti-establishment revolution. But eight years on, the now-familiar act is getting tired, a reality that’s been thrown into sharp relief now that Trump is facing a new campaign against a younger, more energetic opponent rather than a re-run against 81-year-old Biden.  Trump is driving his strategists to distraction by refusing to stay focused on the issues — like the economy — that could help him prevail in November. He keeps missing chances to prod Harris’ vulnerabilities, allowing the vice president the space to power up her campaign and erase Biden’s polling deficits. Read the full analysis. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday is expected to propose a new plan to cut taxes for middle-class and lower-income Americans as part of her economic policy rollout, according to Harris-Walz campaign officials. The plan would offer tax relief for more than 100 million Americans. Much of the plan revives or extends temporary measures that President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of Biden’s term. Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021. Biden and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have been unsuccessful in their efforts to partially revive it – in part because of its hefty price tag. A bipartisan bill that would have temporarily beefed up the child tax credit passed the House earlier this year but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. The proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. That’s when a family’s expenses, such as cribs, diapers and car seats, can be at their highest and when many parents have to take time off from their jobs, the campaign noted. Harris’ economic policy would also expand the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, to offer frontline workers without dependent children a tax reduction of up to $1,500. The American Rescue Plan enhanced the maximum credit, which is available to workers in lower-income jobs, to roughly that amount, but the enhancement to the EITC was only in effect for 2021. The vice president’s package calls for extending the more generous Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhancement, which was made available through the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, has helped push sign-ups for Obamacare coverage to record levels. Harris’ proposed plan does not specify how long these costly provisions would be in effect. Here’s what we know so far about Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s economic plans: Eliminate taxes on tips: Both Trump and Harris have called for ending federal taxes on tips – though Trump unveiled the idea first and has blasted his rival for copying him. End taxes on Social Security benefits: Trump has also offered tax relief to another influential voting bloc – senior citizens. He announced late last month that he wants to end taxes on Social Security benefits. Add more tariffs: Trump is calling for more tariffs if he returns to the White House. While Harris has not talked about her trade plans specifically, the Biden-Harris administration kept a lot of Trump-era tariffs in place and has increased some of those duties. Tackle expiring tax cuts: Trump and Harris have differing views on how to handle the expiration of more than $3.4 trillion in individual tax cuts next year. The former president has said that one of his main goals would be extending the sweeping array of tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of the signature achievements of his first term. Harris, on the other hand, told Politico last month that she will continue President Joe Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. Cut prices: Both Harris and Trump have put a focus on addressing the prices of groceries and other everyday items for Americans. Expand affordable housing: Harris is set to announce Friday a three-section plan to address the nation’s lack of affordable housing. Part of the package builds on proposals that Biden has already unveiled. Harris would also seek to repurpose some federal land for affordable housing, similar to proposals floated by Biden and Trump. Read the full story. Locked in a tight race for the White House with Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump is eager to show voters how he’ll handle the economy if elected.

What voters need to know about Harris’ and Trump’s economic policy proposals | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:58 PM EDT, Fri August 16, 2024",2024-08-15T22:19:41.484Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/harris-trump-economy-policies-inflation/index.html,"Locked in a tight race for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are eager to show voters how they’ll handle the economy if elected. Both campaigns have a populist bent, but the candidates have differing visions for helping Americans contending with the high living expenses that remain even as the recent spike in inflation has largely passed. Harris spoke Friday afternoon about the economic proposals she’s rolled out this week, including enhanced tax credits for kids, housing assistance and efforts to stop price gouging. She described her forward-looking agenda as “an opportunity economy,” where Americans are given a real chance to succeed, while saying Trump is only focused on helping the wealthy and big businesses. Trump held two speeches this week centered on the economy and his policies, but he has yet to release a detailed economic plan. He has repeatedly slammed the Biden-Harris administration for high inflation and has pledged to bring down prices immediately. And he accuses Harris of wanting to institute “communist price controls.” In reality, a president has few tools to address rising prices unilaterally. It’s the job of the Federal Reserve to set interest rates. Also, most of their major proposals would require congressional approval – and the candidates have not specified how they’d pay for their costly wish list at a time when the federal debt is swiftly rising, though Harris said she would ask well-off Americans and corporations to pay more. Here’s what we know so far about Harris’ and Trump’s economic plans: Both Trump and Harris have called for ending federal taxes on tips – though Trump unveiled the idea first and has blasted his rival for copying him. The proposal has become one of Trump’s favorite pledges at his campaign rallies. He first floated the idea in June in Las Vegas, Nevada, a key swing state with many hospitality and service workers, but did not provide any details. Earlier this week, he suggested that he supported eliminating both federal income and payroll taxes on tips – a more financially impactfulproposal. “We’re looking at doing the full bore,” Trump said in an interview with Spectrum News 1 in North Carolina when asked if he supported eliminating both federal income and payroll taxes. Such a measure would require congressional approval. Asked for clarity afterward, Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavittsaid she had nothing to add. About 4 million people worked in tipped occupations in 2023, or about 2.5% of all employment, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University, a policy research center. But more than a third earn too little to owe federal income tax. Federal payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare and total 15.3%, half of which is paid by employers. Harris last week also promised to end federal income taxes on tips at a rally in Las Vegas. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan. If both federal income and payroll taxes were eliminated, it would lower revenue by $150 billion to $250 billion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Just getting rid of federal income taxes on tips would lead to a loss of about half that size. Trump has also offered tax relief to another influential voting bloc – senior citizens. He announced late last month that he wants to end taxes on Social Security benefits. “To help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of inflation, there will be no tax on Social Security. We’re going to stop it,” he said at a Wednesday rally billed as an economic speech. Currently, seniors don’t owe taxes on their benefits if they earn less than $25,000 per individual, or $32,000 for married couples, of so-called combined income, which takes into account their adjusted gross income, half their Social Security benefits and nontaxable interest. Above that threshold, they may have to pay income tax on up to 50% of their benefits, with the revenue going to the Social Security retirement trust fund. Those with combined incomes of at least $34,000 per individual, or $44,000 per couple, could pay income tax on up to an additional 35% of their benefits, with those funds going to Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, known as Medicare Part A. Eliminating the levy on Social Security benefits would reduce taxes by an average of $550, though lower-income households would see little to no benefit next year, according to the Tax Policy Center. However, the proposal would harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The tax is expected to bring in about $94 billion in revenue this year. Eliminating the tax would increase federal deficits by between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion through 2035, a committee analysis found. The Social Security retirement trust fund would be depleted more than a year earlier, and Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund would run dry six years earlier. Many seniors could ultimately be hurt if Social Security and Medicare’s trust funds run dry sooner and benefits have to be cut. Trump is calling for more tariffs if he returns to the White House. While Harris has not talked about her trade plans specifically, the Biden-Harris administration kept a lot of Trump-era tariffs in place and has increased some of those duties. During speeches and interviews conducted earlier this spring, Trump called for adding a tariff of at least 10% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. Together, those tariffs could cost a typical middle-income household $1,700 a year, according to an estimate published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in May. This week, Trump suggested that the across-the-board tariff could be as high as 20%. “We’re going to have 10 to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years,” he said during a speech in North Carolina on Wednesday. Trump has repeatedly claimed that new tariffs will bring back jobs and raise revenue for the country. But economists generally agree that tariffs are a costly way to boost some US manufacturers. In April, Moody’s estimated that even if Trump cushioned the blow from tariffs with tax cuts, his trade proposals would cost the US economy 675,000 jobs, worsen inflation and shrink gross domestic product by 0.6 percentage points. Plus, tariffs are paid by US importers rather than foreign countries as Trump often suggests. Americans have paid more than $242 billion to date for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods during his administration, according to US Customs and Border Protection. In March, Trump also suggested he would put a new 100% tariff on all cars made outside the US if he wins another term. Most of the Trump-era tariffs remain. In May, the Biden-Harris administration put a plan in place to raise tariffs on certain Chinese-made products, including steel and aluminum, legacy semiconductors and electric vehicles, over the next two years. Trump and Harris have differing views on how to handle the expiration of more than $3.4 trillion in individual tax cuts next year. The former president has said that one of his main goals would be extending the sweeping array of tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of the signature achievements of his first term. The individual income and estate tax reductions expire at the end of next year. He has promised more tax cuts for people of all incomes, as well as for businesses, at campaign rallies. “To get to economic relief to workers and families, we will make additional tax cuts,” he said in Wednesday’s speech. “That’s what gave us the great economy. We’ll make tax cuts additionally. We’ll make them permanent.” The highest-income households would receive more than 45% of the benefits if the expiring provisions of the TCJA are extended, according to an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. In addition, Trump would like to lower the corporate tax rate to 15% from the 21% set by the 2017 tax cuts – though he acknowledged in an interview last month with Bloomberg Businessweek that reducing it that much would be hard. Most of the corporate tax cuts in the law are permanent. Harris, on the other hand, said that she will continue President Joe Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. The vice president has also slammed Trump for wanting to extend all of the 2017 tax cuts. “Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations,” she said Friday. “I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans.” Harris unveiledon Friday a plan to cut taxes for the middle-class and lower-income Americans as part of her economic policy rollout. It would offer tax relief for more than 100 million Americans. Much of the plan revives or extends temporary measures that Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of Biden’s term. Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement, however, was only in effect in 2021. Biden and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were unable to extend it – in part because of the hefty price tag. The plan would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. And it would restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only for 2021. Plus, the vice president’s package calls for extending the more generous Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhancement, which was made available through the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, has helped push sign-ups for Obamacare coverage to record levels. Harris’ plan does not specify how long these costly provisions would be in effect. Both Harris and Trump have put a focus on addressing the prices of groceries and other everyday items for Americans. During Trump’s economic speech on Wednesday, he said he plans to sign an executive order on his first day back in the Oval Office directing all agency heads and Cabinet secretaries to “use every tool and authority at their disposal to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices rapidly down.” “You just watch. They’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast,” he said. One of his strategies to bring down prices, he said, is to “eliminate every single costly job-killing regulation.” But he didn’t provide specifics during his speech. Trump has also has repeatedly said he will bring down prices by boosting oil and gas production. But prices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and impacted by things out of the president’s control, like Russia’s war on Ukraine or OPEC’s recent decisions to cut oil production. Plus, US oil production has reached record levels under Biden. “We’re going to drill, baby, drill. That’s going to bring down prices of everything,” he said on Thursday. Harris has called for a federal ban on price gouging in an effort to target corporations and lower grocery prices, though her campaign has released few details about the proposal. Some progressives have blamed corporate greed for fueling high prices. The idea is that companies use elevated inflation rates as an excuse to price gouge customers while they bring in record profit margins. Harris argues that big grocery chains have seen their production costs flatten but have kept prices high. But research released in May by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found little evidence that price gouging was the main culprit of rising inflation. While prices remain high,inflation has already slowed after reaching about 9% in 2022. The Consumer Price Index recently fell to below 3%, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates next month. Harris announced Friday a three-section plan to address the nation’s lack of affordable housing. Part of the package builds on proposals that Biden has already unveiled. The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan, which would be implemented during Harris’ first term, according to the campaign, would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year. According to the Harris campaign, the plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds. Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. In addition, Harris wants to create a new $40 billion innovation fund to spur innovative housing construction – twice the size of a proposed fund previously announced by the Biden administration. The fund would look to empower local governments, developers and builders to construct more housing that’s affordable and to support new methods of construction financing. Harris would also seek to repurpose some federal land for affordable housing, similar to proposals floated by Biden and Trump. The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. Trump has also touted using federal land to help alleviate the housing shortage – noting it in two campaign events this week. “We’re going to open up tracts of federal land for housing construction,” he said in a news conference Thursday. “We desperately need housing for people who can’t afford what’s going on now.” In addition, the Republican National Committee platform says that the party will “promote homeownership with tax incentives and support for first-time buyers and cut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs,” as well as “reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation.” Harris also announced a plan Friday that builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs. She is calling to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January. (The three major insulin manufacturers in the US offer price caps or savings programs that lower the cost of insulin to $35 for many patients – a move Biden pushed for in his State of the Union address last year.) Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration just announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026. Medicare gained this historic power through the Inflation Reduction Act. The vice president would also crack down on drugmakers who block competition and abusive practices by pharmacy benefit managers, who serve as middlemen between drug manufacturers and insurers – though the plan doesn’t specify how she would do this. In addition, Harris said she would work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign. Harris has overseen the Biden administration’s efforts to remove medical debt from credit reports. This headline and story have been updated with additional information."
Harris leans into populism with proposal for middle-class and lower-income tax relief | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:51 PM EDT, Fri August 16, 2024",2024-08-16T11:00:56.712Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/politics/harris-middle-class-tax-cuts-economic-policy/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday unveiled a populist economic agenda, proposing a new plan to provide tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class and lower-income Americans as she builds out the details of her governing agenda weeks after locking down the Democratic presidential nomination. The vice president proposed her economic platform — which includes measures aimed at making housing, groceries, health care and child rearing more affordable — in a speech in battleground North Carolina. It comes as her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, seeks to pin blame on Harris for the spike in inflation since she and President Joe Biden took office. Harris’ proposals largely build on Biden’s economic platform, reviving or extending temporary measures that congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of Biden’s term. Harris said she would “build on the foundations” of economic progress made by the Biden administration. “Still, we know that many Americans don’t yet feel that progress in their daily lives. Costs are still too high, and on a deeper level, for many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard just to be able to get ahead,” she said. She said a “defining goal of her presidency” would be to build what she called an “opportunity economy” for the middle class. She also vowed to rein in the rising prices of goods like groceries and take on price gouging. “As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans,” she said. “I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy and playing by the rules. But some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case.” Before his departure from the 2024 race last month, Biden struggled to articulate and defend his economic record. Harris is seeking to sell an amped-up series of progressive proposals with a more forward-looking message — one that pledges to strengthen the middle class and take on big businesses that she says bear the blame for rising costs. The Democratic nominee’s release of her economic agenda comes days before Democrats gather in Chicago for the party’s convention, where they will seek to draw contrasts between Harris’ vision and Trump’s economic record. Harris on Friday took aim at Trump’s economic proposals — particularly his calls for 10% to 20% tariffs on imported goods, costs that experts say companies would pass on to consumers by raising prices. The vice president said Trump’s proposals would “devastate the middle class, punish working people and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans.” “He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries. That will devastate Americans. It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs. A Trump tax on gas. A Trump tax on food. A Trump tax on clothing. A Trump tax on over-the-counter medication,” Harris said. “At this moment when prices are too high, he would make them even higher.” Harris’ new proposals would require congressional approval, and she has not specified how she’d pay for her costly wish list at a time when the federal debt is swiftly rising – other than saying she would ask the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share. Those details will come later, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, as Harris’ team plans a series of rollouts on economic policies centered on specific themes. All told, the package could increase deficits by $1.7 trillion over a decade, or $2 trillion if the temporary housing provisions were made permanent, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The watchdog group noted that certain details are lacking for a full analysis. Harris’ plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021. Biden and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have been unsuccessful in their efforts to partially revive it – in part because of its hefty price tag. A bipartisan bill that would have temporarily beefed up the child tax credit passed the House earlier this year but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. The proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life. That’s when a family’s expenses, such as cribs, diapers and car seats, can be at their highest and when many parents have to take time off from their jobs, the campaign noted. The agenda also calls for restoring the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only in effect for 2021. The vice president’s package calls for extending the more generous Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhancement, which was made available through the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, has helped push sign-ups for Obamacare coverage to record levels. Harris’ proposed plan does not specify how long these costly provisions would be in effect. Her focus on the child tax credit comes as she faces constant attacks from the Trump campaign, particularly the GOP vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, for being anti-family. Vance told CBS News over the weekend that he wants to increase the child tax credit to $5,000 per child. Former President Donald Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 doubled the child tax credit to the current $2,000 – though that enhancement is set to expire at the end of next year, along with the law’s other individual income tax provisions. Along with the tax credits, Harris’ economic agenda addressed housing, food and health care costs, building on Biden administration efforts. CNN previously reported that it includes a four-year plan to lower housing costs, including $25,000 in down payment assistance and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homeowners and actions aimed at spurring the construction of new housing, including tax incentives for building starter homes and affordable rental units. The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. She also called for a federal ban on price gouging to lower grocery prices and everyday costs, though her campaign has released few details about the proposal. Harris argues that big grocery chains have seen their production costs flatten and profits grow but have kept prices high. As for making health care more affordable, Harris wants to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration just announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in billions of dollars in savings for Medicare and senior citizens. In addition, Harris said she would work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. Harris has overseen the Biden administration’s efforts to remove medical debt from credit reports. This story has been updated with additional information."
Harris’ plan to stop price gouging could create more problems than it solves | CNN Business,"Updated 7:27 PM EDT, Fri August 16, 2024",2024-08-16T21:55:18.121Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/business/harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation/index.html,"Food prices have surged by more than 20% under the Biden-Harris administration, leaving many voters eager to stretch their dollars further at the grocery store. On Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris said she has a solution: a federal ban on price gouging across the food industry. “My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules,” Harris said at a campaign event. There’s just one issue: Harris’ proposal could create more problems than the one it’s trying to solve, some economists say. Gavin Roberts studied anti-price gouging laws some states passed during the pandemic. One of the biggest effects he observed, especially at grocery stores, was that these laws motivated people “to go buy goods more than they would if prices had risen.” When prices are high, in most cases, the best policy action in response is actually taking no action, Roberts, the chair of Weber State University’s economics department, told CNN. That would cause consumers who are deterred by, say, high prices of beef, to instead purchase another type of meat or protein. That helps keep beef on the grocery store shelves for people who want it enough to pay the higher prices. And while Harris claims her proposal “will help the food industry become more competitive,” Roberts said it would do just the opposite. “It’s more likely to maintain that status quo,” he said because it would keep new competition from moving in to take advantage of the bigger profit margins — competition that could have helped lower prices in the long run. Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration, shared Roberts’ view that anti-price gouging laws could inadvertently harm consumers. “This is not sensible policy, and I think the biggest hope is that it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality,” he told the New York Times. “There’s no upside here, and there is some downside.” Instead of pursuing anti-price gouging policies, Roberts recommended that Harris investigate what, if anything, is stopping new parties from entering concentrated industries. To his point, a campaign fact sheet said that Harris also plans to make more resources available for “the federal government to identify and take on price-fixing and other anti-competitive practices in the food and grocery industries.” Campaign staff declined to comment on critiques of Harris’ proposed price-gouging ban, pointing CNN to Harris’ speech and the fact sheet shared ahead of it. The jury is still out on the extent to which price gouging has contributed to inflation over the last few years. Research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve suggests alleged corporate price gouging was not a primary catalyst for the inflation surge that began in 2021, while progressive-leaning think tanks have published research that suggests there’s a more direct link. Until late last year, companies routinely said on their quarterly earnings calls with investors that customers continued to pay for goods even as businesses hiked prices. That’s because demand stayed high, fueled by bigger paychecks and pandemic stimulus that padded savings accounts. So many economists contend corporate profits were juiced by that thing you learned in Econ 101: supply and demand – not corporate greed (alone, anyway). In any event, the inflation Americans have had to contend with over the past few years is the product of a confluence of events that include the war in Ukraine, government spending and pandemic-related disruptions across the economy. The unprecedented stress on supply chains in the thick of the pandemic, for example, contributed significantly to inflation’s rise in early 2021. And the Harris proposal had its supporters, as well. Lindsay Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive think tank, applauded the plan. “I definitely don’t think that the price gouging statute will result in shortages,” she told CNN, adding that it would give government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission more authority to “crack down on bad actors” charging consumers higher prices. “It’s good to see this aggressive approach,” she said."
Harris has a plan to fix one of America’s biggest economic problems. Here’s what it means for you | CNN Business,"Updated 7:16 PM EDT, Fri August 16, 2024",2024-08-16T11:58:19.398Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/business/harris-housing-plan/index.html,"Americans across the political spectrum can agree on this: Rent is expensive, and buying a home can feel nearly impossible. America’s housing affordability crisis has a number of origins, but it largely stems from two key factors that you learned in Econ 101: supply and demand. The supply of homes on the market is extraordinarily low, as sellers hang onto their houses, waiting on the sidelines out of fear that historically high mortgage rates will make their next place to live too expensive. Demand exploded during the pandemic and it never slowed down, despite high prices and rates. Although there are signs that the worst of the housing affordability nightmare may be over, the market remains tight. That’s why housing a top issue for voters in the 2024 presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday unveiled her plan to help make homes more affordable. Although analysts cheered some of her plans to assist buyers, some feared that parts of Harris’ plan may exacerbate the problems in the market. The plan, which builds on proposals that President Joe Biden has already announced, promises: Adding more homes to the market through incentives would certainly help, multiple economists agreed. Adding housing to the market will increase inventory and should help drive prices down. But capping rent was met with skepticism. “What I’ve seen is three parts substance and one part symbolism,” said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, “The substance is increasing or focusing on supply conditions via the financial channel. It’s a good, solid proposal that’s forward-looking and can actually be accomplished. The symbolism is more organized around price caps on rents.” Capping rent increases at 5%, which is something that President Joe Biden proposed in July, is likely a position that will be popular with the public, Brusuelas said. However, renters already have disinflation working in their favor, he added. The Consumer Price Index data for July, released Wednesday, that showed the “rent of shelter” index was up 5.1% annually, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But rents have been falling lately — so much that landlords are adding sweeteners like free parking and free months of rent to try to attract new tenants. That means the price cap will be ineffective, Brusuelas said. The rent caps are the “ugly” part of Harris’ plan, said Lanhee Chen, director of domestic policy studies at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University and a past CNN opinion contributor who worked on campaigns for Republicans, including Utah Senator Mitt Romney. “What is effectively a federal rent-control measure … was a bad idea when President Biden proposed it a few weeks ago,” said Chen. “There also appears to be another giveaway to local governments disguised as an “innovation fund” without any apparent accountability for results.” Chen also raised concern about down-payment support, which may sound attractive to buyers but could stimulate demand and drive housing costs higher. Brusuelas agreed that the plans to help first-time homebuyers could strike a chord with Gen Z voters, but its overall effect on the market remains unclear. But the “substance” of Harris’ plan is the far more critical proposal to add 3 million housing units, Brusuelas said. Long before the pandemic and the supply chain issues and rise in remote work rocketed the nation’s real estate industry, chronically low inventory served as a bottleneck and helped fuel higher prices and worsen affordability. The proposal released Thursday from the Harris campaign “is the only proposal that I’ve seen that directly addresses the concerns around the supply of housing,” Brusuelas said. “There’s going to need to be a concerted effort on the part of the federal, state and local governments to increase supply, because we’re about 3 million homes short.” Chen agreed that adding supply was the best part of Harris’ plan. “There’s bipartisan support for repurposing federal lands for construction of affordable housing, and the concept of creating the right tax and economic incentives for builders to construct more new housing,” Chen said. “I have some concerns about how these incentives will be targeted but there’s no question that these ‘supply-side’ reforms are long overdue.” Former President Donald Trump has also touted using federal land to help alleviate the housing shortage. “We’re going to open up tracts of federal land for housing construction,” he said in a news conference Thursday. “We desperately need housing for people who can’t afford what’s going on now.” In addition, the Republican National Committee platform says that the party will “promote homeownership with tax incentives and support for first-time buyers and cut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs,” as well as “reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation.” Jeffrey Zabel, a Tufts University professor of economics, said he was cautiously optimistic about Harris’ plan. But he said making the promise a reality will be difficult. “While this is a step in the right direction, let’s wait and see what they can actually implement,” Zabel said. “It is easy to make these proposals and another thing to actually implement them. And even if they can get this done, there is much more that needs to be done to bring housing supply back into equilibrium.”"
Tulsi Gabbard and a seasoned Trump impersonator: How Trump and Harris are preparing for their first head-to-head debate | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:12 PM EDT, Sat August 17, 2024",2024-08-16T22:49:30.383Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/politics/trump-harris-debate-preparations/index.html,"The first presidential debate of 2024 upended the race for the White House, effectively terminated the reelection aspirations of President Joe Biden and perhaps forever altered the direction of the country. With so much potentially at risk at next month’s debate – which will be the first time former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris encounter each other at close range – the planning for the high-stakes showdown has already begun. Harris held her first formal debate training session earlier this week at Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, DC, she attended nearly four decades ago, and she is working closely with a seasoned Trump stand-in. Trump, meanwhile, has enlisted one of the vice president’s ex-rivals to help with the preparations: Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 in a crowded field that also included Harris. After much back and forth, Trump and Harris agreed last week to the September 10 debate previously arranged by the campaigns of Trump and Biden. ABC, the host network, announced Friday it will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The political landscape in the United States and the fortunes of the country’s two major parties have drastically shifted in the weeks since the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden on June 27. The president’s lackluster performance that night shattered the confidence of his party and its donors, who in turn put immense pressure on Biden to drop out of the race. He eventually did on July 21 and endorsed Harris, giving the Democratic Party a new standard bearer and a sorely needed shot in the arm. Swing state polls and national surveys show a race that has quickly tightened amid surging enthusiasm for Harris within her own party and new consideration from voters once put off by a Biden-Trump rematch. Trump has struggled to cope with a reality he seems to believe he brought to fruition by beating Biden in their head-to-head showdown. “I should have been a little bit easier,” Trump said at a news conferenceThursday. “Somebody said, ‘Your debate performance was horrible.’ I said, ‘Why?’ ‘Because you forced him out of government.’“ The race to prepare Harris, who has not stepped onto a debate stage since facing Trump’s former running mate Mike Pence in 2020, is underway and will intensify after the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago.  A team of Democratic advisers joined Harris at Howard earlier this week, including Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign, several people familiar with the planning told CNN. Karen Dunn, another longtime Clinton adviser who helped Harris prepare for her vice presidential debate in 2020, is also taking part in the preparation efforts, people familiar with the planning said. Former Harris aides Rohini Kosoglu and Sean Clegg are also involved with the effort, according to a person familiar with the prep. The Washington Post was first to report the debate preparations involving Reines. The New York Times first reported on the involvement of Kosoglu and Clegg. Trump, meanwhile, has revived the approach deployed ahead of his June debate with Biden, engaging in less formal policy sessions with close aides, advisers and allies in between campaign appearances and rounds of golf. Gabbard’s involvement, first reported Friday by the New York Times, was confirmed to CNN by Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, has found a home in Trump’s orbit and was even briefly considered as a potential running mate. Trump’s interest in Gabbard as he prepares to face Harris next month stems in part from the notable exchanges the former congresswoman had with the vice president during their 2020 race. Harris in one debate criticized Gabbard for her foreign policy views while Gabbard in another challenged Harris’ record on criminal justice. Seen mostly as a gadfly and an oddity during her Democratic primary run in 2019, Gabbard’s attack on Harris’ record as a prosecutor may have been her largest direct impact on the race. Given how much attention was on her attorney general record at the time, Harris had prepared for the attack, and by tracking comments Gabbard was making in interviews, aides to the then-California senator were able to predict not just that Gabbard would be the one to make the attack, but almost the wording of the question. They admitted afterward that they were shocked by just how much Gabbard was able to rattle Harris, and later said that it helped lock Harris into a tailspin her campaign never recovered from. As he prepared to face Biden, Trump invited several of the Republicans he considered for his running mate to discuss issues and potential talking points. Gabbard now joins that mix. The former president “does not need traditional debate prep but will continue to meet with respected policy advisors and effective communicators like Tulsi Gabbard, who successfully dominated Kamala Harris on the debate stage,” Leavitt said. Trump has pushed for additional debates and had agreed to two others with Fox News and NBC. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and Harris’ vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, agreed Thursday to an October 1 debate hosted by CBS News. Like Trump, Vance has called on Walz to agree to more, arguing for “as many debates as we possibly can.” A senior campaign adviser said Harris is open to a second debate, but the details will not be settled until the first debate is in the books. Publicly, though, the campaign has said otherwise. In a statement Thursday, Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said, “The debate about debates is over.”"
Obama ‘Hope’ poster artist creates ‘Forward’ Kamala Harris design | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:15 PM EDT, Fri August 16, 2024",2024-08-16T15:38:53.333Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/politics/kamala-harris-forward-shepard-fairey/index.html,"The artist behind the iconic “Hope” poster that became a prominent symbol of Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign has created similar artwork for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid. Shepard Fairey’s new poster, titled “Forward,” features the Democratic nominee in shades of blue, contrasted by red lipstick. Harris is depicted wearing a pearl earring and necklace. “’We are not going back.’ These words from Kamala Harris summarize the moment we are in, and in order not to go back, we must go FORWARD!” Fairey said in a news release announcing the poster. Fairey also offered an endorsement of Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate, adding that “they are our best chance to push back on encroaching fascism and threats to democracy, and our best chance for creating the world we all desire and deserve.” Years after the “Hope” poster, Fairey said Obama didn’t live up to his promise, telling Esquire in 2015 that “there have been a lot of things that he’s compromised on that I never would have expected.” And in the next election, despite calling Donald Trump “dangerous,” Fairey did not create artwork for his opponent Hillary Clinton, and told CNN in 2016 that he didn’t find Clinton “inspiring enough” to illustrate. Fairey then went on to draw three posters in protest of Trump ahead of his inauguration. The posters, titled “We the People,” featured Muslim, Latina, and African-American women. Although Fairey did not create artwork endorsing Joe Biden in 2020, the artist partnered with climate advocacy group Greenpeace USA on a poster that called on Biden — just days into his presidency — to deliver on his climate campaign promises. The poster, titled “Which Future Will You Deliver?,” featured a drawing of Biden in front of two scenarios: one in which the world is on fire because of the effects of fossil fuels and the other depicting a cleaner Earth.

Analysis: Trump’s fury over Harris’ switch with Biden is increasingly driving his campaign | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:02 AM EDT, Fri August 16, 2024",2024-08-16T04:00:02.344Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/politics/trump-fury-harris-switch-campaign-analysis/index.html,"Deep into his ranting news conference on Thursday, former President Donald Trump told a truth that explained everything : “I’m very angry at her.” He was referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, whose late entry into the general election race has left him bitter, disoriented, and mourning the loss of the old campaign — the one he was winning against President Joe Biden. Trump’s discombobulation was laid bare in a self-pitying and raging stream of consciousness delivered at his New Jersey golf club that raised serious questions about the future trajectory of his quest to return to power. The ex-president insulted his way into the Oval Office in 2016 — when his often-unhinged soliloquies that shattered all the rules of decorum and politics delighted grassroots Republican voters craving an anti-establishment revolution. But eight years on, the now-familiar act is getting tired, a reality that’s been thrown into sharp relief now that Trump is facing a new campaign against younger, more energetic opponent rather than a re-run against 81-year-old Biden. The former president is driving his strategists to distraction by refusing to stay focused on the issues — like the economy — that could help him prevail in November. He keeps missing chances to prod Harris’ vulnerabilities, allowing the vice president the space to power up her campaign and erase Biden’s polling deficits. Almost every Trump event now feels like damage control for a previous one that went off the rails. Thursday’s news conference was a do-over for Wednesday’s trip to North Carolina, when the ex-president mocked his own aides for demanding that he give an “intellectual” speech on the economy and instead went his own way, focusing on insulting his opponent. Trump’s team did their best for him on Thursday. Someone went to a local supermarket and stocked up on groceries, including Cheerios, tubs of coffee and ketchup, and provided Trump with charts showing the high cost of goods in the Biden era. But their boss didn’t even get to the end of his first point before veering into a furious aside while falsely accusing Democrats of acting illegally by replacing Biden with Harris. “It was a coup by people that wanted him out, and they didn’t do it the way, not the way they’re supposed to do it. $129 more on energy, and $241 more. This is all per month on rent,” Trump said, running two thoughts together in his fury. As if trying to keep himself on course, the former president sometimes followed with his finger on the text of his remarks inside a ring binder. But the argument going on in his head and the text on the paper again diverged. “We have wars breaking out in the Middle East. We have the horrible war going on with Ukraine and Russia. All these things would have never happened if I was president. Would have never, ever happened, and they didn’t happen. Since Harris took office, car insurance is up 55%,” Trump said, in another dizzying shift in direction. As his remarks stretched into a second hour, a squadron of flies assembled, likely attracted by several packs of breakfast sausages sweating in the summer heat. The bizarre spectacle only heightened the incongruity of using Trump’s private golf club as the backdrop for an event meant to illustrate the pain faced by millions of Americans at grocery checkouts. The former president bristled when asked about advice from prominent Republicans — including his former primary foe Nikki Haley, that he should turn from personal attacks on Harris towards the issues many voters care about. Trump also seemed almost wounded at the mockery by Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country. I’m very angry at her that she weaponized the justice system against me and other people —- very angry at her,” Trump said. “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks. I don’t have a lot of respect for her. I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she’ll be a terrible president.” The former president still has millions of devoted supporters. And he remains in striking distance of one of the most stunning comebacks in American politics and becoming only the second defeated one-term president to return to office. And while his outrageous behavior is exactly the reason many of his followers love him, it risks further alienating moderate, suburban swing state voters who cost him the 2020 election and will be vital in what is shaping up as a close fight. The mangling of Trump’s rhetoric throughout his news conference eloquently expressed the utter rage that has been evident in all of the public appearances since Biden left the race, and Harris transformed it with big enthusiastic rallies and huge crowds. After Biden was effectively pushed out of the race after a disastrous debate performance validated fears of voters about his acuity and capacity to serve a second term, Trump’s inability to focus is raising questions about his own fitness for a return to office. “Donald Trump is not the Donald Trump of 2016, he seemed slowed down, he seems meandering, he seems low energy and he really is struggling to make a point,” said former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, who broke with the ex-president after he refused to accept his defeat in 2020. “He is somebody who is not performing at the caliber he once was and that might have worked when he was up against Joe Biden — the contrast did make him appear at times stronger and more vibrant. It’s not working against Kamala Harris who is the younger candidate and the one with more energy,” she said on CNN’s “AC360.” Scott Jennings, a CNN political commentator, who worked in the George W. Bush White House, approved of Trump’s impulse in taking about high food prices that are hounding many Americans. But he told Anderson Cooper that Trump had gone “way off the beaten path” in his news conference. “He’s the only one who can make the decision to get focused and stay focused … it’s really on his shoulders because he is the star of the show.” Jennings added that Trump is “going to have to decide how comfortable he is doing it that way for the rest of the election.” The former president, however, is showing no signs that he is ready to listen to advice, telling reporters “Now you’ll say he ranted and raved … I’m a very calm person, believe it or not.” But proving the opposite, Trump on Thursday dove down multiple rabbit holes — venting about Hillary Clinton’s emails as if he had been transported back to the 2016 election, relating bizarre conversations with people calling him “Sir,” musing about “bird cemeteries” he claims are caused by wind farms, lauding his own “great relationship” with China’s President Xi Jinping and fuming at prosecutors who charged him with seeking to overturn the 2020 election and of hoarding classified documents. The Harris campaign is relishing the spectacle of Trump’s almost daily meltdowns. After the New Jersey appearance, the vice president’s team released what is said was a “Statement on Trump’s … Whatever that was.” The poignancy of Biden’s eclipse by the Harris campaign was on display Thursday when the president and the vice president appeared at a joint formal event for the first time since he shelved his reelection bid. Harris led pro-Biden cheers in suburban Maryland as the pair highlighted a landmark deal with big pharmaceutical firms that will cut the cost of certain drugs for seniors. “It is my eternal and great, great, great honor, I have to tell you, to serve with this most extraordinary human being and American and leader, our president, Joe Biden,” she said. Biden appeared moved by his reception and declared that Harris would make “one hell of a president.” The event underscored how the vice president is seeking to share credit for some of the Biden administration’s greatest successes even as she seeks to frustrate Trump’s effort to tie her to the policies that helped fuel inflation and to exploit the economic frustration of many working Americans. On Friday, the vice president is due to deliver an economic speech in North Carolina that will be seen as a reply to the former president’s remarks in the critical swing state on Wednesday. She is expected to propose new restrictions to thwart what she views as price gouging by supermarket giants and a plan to lower housing costs including $25,000 in down payment assistance for first time homebuyers. The thematic backdrop of the new plans appears to be a populist effort to portray Harris as a lifelong champion of working Americans against powerful wealthy corporate interests. As the vice president and former prosecutor and senator put it in highlighting the pharmaceutical deal: “My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs.” But the mechanics of Harris’ plans will be controversial — critics are already accusing her of backing the kind of price controls that have often worked poorly elsewhere. There is therefore plenty of scope for Trump to advance effective arguments against his new opponent. Yet an ex-president who has always believed he’s his own best advocate, now seems to lack the coherence to do so. “I have to do it my way,” Trump said Thursday."

Gwen Walz told participants in a “Utah Women for Kamala” call that she met the governor when they were both teachers at Alliance High School in Nebraska, and said at one point they shared a classroom. Walz said their shared background as teachers gives them a shared set of values, including that “every child deserves a chance” and the “importance of respecting others” — themes her husband leans into on the campaign trail. Walz also touched on her experience using fertility treatments to have their first child, Hope, a part of her family’s background that the governor frequently references while campaigning. Walz similarly used her story to contrast the Harris campaign’s position on reproductive rights to the Trump campaign. “If Trump had his way, I would have never become a mom. I can’t imagine that. And if Vance had his way, that would make me a second-class citizen,” she said.

Trump made more than 20 false claims during the more than hour-long address. These are highlights from his remarks: Inflation: Flanked by tables filled with grocery store products and prices to indicate the impacts of inflation, Trump highlighted rising costs in a wide breadth of industries, rattling off statistics on increases in rents, mortgage costs, groceries, insurance premiums, electricity and energy prices in a news conference that lasted over an hour.  He attacked Harris’ proposal for a federal ban on price gouging to lower costs on grocery items and other everyday costs as “communist price control” and predicted her proposal would lead to “food shortages, rationing, hunger, dramatically more inflation.” Trump reiterated his promise to reduce prices by increasing domestic oil production, which he pegged as the leading driver of inflation. He also pledged to reduce “energy and electricity prices” by “at least half” in the first year of his administration. Trump lingered on the rising cost of electricity, and reflected on his conversation with Tesla founder Elon Musk, who he said stressed the importance of cheap electricity to facilitate the growth of the artificial intelligence industry. Service workers: Trump insisted the Biden administration has hurt service workers by approving additional Internal Revenue Service personnel, and blamed Harris for allowing the agency to “go after people that make tips” after she endorsed the elimination of taxes on tips to service workers last week, echoing a policy he has touted previously. “They’re lying when they say that, you know, this is what they want to do. Because their legislation, which everyone knows, and their executive orders, were extremely tough,” he said. Union comments: While taking questions from reporters, Trump was asked about a comment he made in the conversation with Musk where he appeared to endorse the firing of striking workers, a comment strongly condemned by union organizers. When asked if he’s comfortable with companies threatening to fire workers on strike, Trump said he wants companies to “get workers that are going to love them” without addressing the concerns from unions.  “I want companies to get workers that are going to love them and work for a wage it lets the company make a profit so they can go and expand,” he said. When pressed about pushback from union organizers, including Teamsters’ union head Sean O’Brien, a Trump supporter who called the comment “economic terrorism,” Trump again did not address the concerns from union organizers but praised O’Brien as “a great guy” and observed workers fired by Musk when he took over Twitter were not on strike. “They weren’t organizing against Elon. He let them go because he was having a lot of problems in California,” Trump said. “And Sean O’Brien is a great guy from the Teamsters,” he said. “Sean is great. I think Sean would understand it better than anybody.” Legendary singer and actress Barbra Streisand called Vice President Kamala Harris a “joyful warrior” while announcing her support for the Harris-Walz ticket during a “Jewish Women for Kamala” call Thursday evening. The EGOT-winner also slammed Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance her in remarks, saying the former president “cares only about himself” and “insults any woman who questions him, calling them nasty.” CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed reporting. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday held an event at his Bedminster golf club with Republican mega-donor Miriam Adelson focused on combatting antisemitism.  Trump repeated his attacks on Jewish people who vote for Democrats, and his claim that Jewish Americans “vote by habit for Democrats.” “The Democrats are really against you now,” Trump said. Trump bashed Vice President Kamala Harris and accused her of pandering to the more progressive wing of her party that has been critical of Israel and its handling of its war in Gaza.  “The toxic poison of antisemitism now courses through the veins of the radical Democrat party … And instead of expunging this hatred, Kamla Harris is pandering to it,” Trump said. Trump again bashed the protests that took place recently in Washington DC, where US flags and depictions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were burned. The White House condemned the protests.  Donald Trump’s latest financial disclosure documents released Thursday show he made millions from licensing deals and book royalties capitalizing on his fame, alongside significant civil judgements against the former president in New York. The disclosure, which totaled more than 250 pages, offers a window into the president’s extensive finances, including everything from his real estate business to his investments, income and debts. The release from the Federal Election Commission marks the first public update of his finances in a year. The documents are a reminder of Trump’s business interests all across the globe – including dozens of registered trademarks in China as well as ones in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ukraine and Israel, among many others. It also reveals tidbits about how the president keeps his fortune, from millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency to a six-figure investment in gold bars. Trump has consistently bucked the tradition among major party candidates of releasing his tax returns to the public, and the financial disclosure reports offer an incomplete picture because filers are only required to disclose income and assets in broad ranges. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Read more about the disclosure reports Locked in a tight race for the White House with Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump is eager to show voters how he’ll handle the economy if elected. Trump held two speeches this week centered on the economy and his policies, but he has yet to release a detailed economic plan. On the campaign trail, the former president has largely focused his economic priorities on lowering taxes, increasing tariffs and lowering prices for consumers. Trump repeatedly slams the Biden-Harris administration for high inflation and has pledged to bring down prices immediately. In reality, a president has few tools to address rising prices unilaterally. It’s the job of the Federal Reserve to set interest rates. Here’s what we know so far about Trump’s economic plans: Read more about Trump’s economic proposals The Democratic National Convention unveiled a picture of the stage to be used next week in Chicago. Former President Donald Trump said he wants to see a government response to the apparent hack-and-leak of campaign documents that he previously blamed on Iran. When asked about the hack Thursday, Trump told reporters he’s “not happy with it” and that the government “shouldn’t let that happen.” The FBI said in a statement following the hack that it is investigating the incident. The US government has not officially named a culprit behind the cyberattack.  The FBI and other investigators suspect the hackers were able to compromise the personal email account of longtime Republican and Trump operative Roger Stone, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN Tuesday. The hacking incident, which occurred in June, set off a scramble in the Trump campaign, the FBI and Microsoft, which spotted the intrusion attempts, to contain the incident and to determine if there was a broader cyber threat from Iran. Speaking at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Pennsylvania on Thursday, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance cast Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as a liar who is unfit to be vice president. Vance argued his attacks are not disparaging Walz’s 24 years of service, but rather his dishonesty, and said Vice President Kamala Harris demonstrated “poor judgment” in standing by her Democratic running mate.  Some context: Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, has repeatedly criticized Walz over a comment he made several years ago about weapons of war, and also has accused him of ducking service in Iraq. Walz — who was extensively trained with weapons but never deployed to a combat zone as part of his service — said in 2018 that he handled assault weapons “in war.” Harris’ campaign acknowledged Saturday he “misspoke” at the time. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year, and retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. He was elected in November 2006. Vance has suggested Walz “dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.” Vance’s attacks on Walz’s honesty came on the same day his running mate, former President Donald Trump, gave an address full of falsehoods in New Jersey. The Secret Service has begun bolstering Donald Trump’s security detail and plans to surround the former president with bulletproof glass at campaign rallies.  A senior official told CNN that an increased number of agents and certain technological changes are also part of the bulked-up measures, though they declined to provide more details for security reasons.  The measures are being implemented in the wake of the near-assassination of Trump at a rally last month in Butler, Pennsylvania. Ballistic glass is commonly used for the protection of current presidents and is moved into place by the Department of Defense, which has an extensive transportation operation, including planes. For Trump, the Secret Service will strategically place the glass around the country in areas where he is expected to visit, because the agency doesn’t have its own aircraft, the official told CNN.  Ballistic glass is generally used for outdoor events, whereas indoor events usually don’t require such a measure, because individuals are screened before entering. The official told CNN that the glass could be used in either setting depending on the security at each location. A Secret Service spokesperson told CNN the agency could not comment on specifics for security reasons. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Black, Asian American and Hispanic workers experienced historic employment gains and record-low unemployment levels during his presidency. There is some truth to his claims – depending on certain economic data points – however, by and large, those achievements have been exceeded during President Joe Biden’s presidency. The unemployment rate for Black, Hispanic and Asian workers hit their lowest rates on record in 2019 (at least since the government has been issuing data on them – the data for African Americans and Hispanics goes back to the early 1970s, while data for Asians only goes back to 2000). Trump inherited a positive trend that continued during his tenure. The unemployment rate for all three groups had fallen substantially under President Barack Obama from the recession-era levels of 2009. Trump did not mention Thursday that the records were bested under Biden.  Former President Donald Trump spoke Thursday about his response during the 2016 election to his supporters’ “lock her up” chants about his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He said: “Everybody said ‘lock her up, lock her up,’ and I used to go ‘easy, just easy, easy,’ then we won.” He proceeded to explain that he decided it would be “terrible” to imprison Clinton, though “that’s what they wanna do with me.”  Facts First: Trump’s claim that he said “easy, just easy” in response to the “lock her up” chants is misleading at best. During numerous campaign rallies in 2016, Trump paused his remarks and went silent as his supporters chanted “lock her up,” giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated the words “lock her up” himself.  Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime.   “For what she’s done, they should lock her up,” Trump said after the crowd chanted “lock her up” at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina.  “‘Lock her up’ is right,” he said at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania.   Trump also explicitly called for Clinton’s imprisonment using different phrasing.  “Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,” he said in a June 2016 speech in California. “She has to go to jail,” he repeated in an October 2016 speech in Florida. And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton said, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Trump responded, “Because you’d be in jail.”  Trump softened his rhetoric shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn’t want to hurt her and didn’t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to “lock her up.”  “You should lock her up, I’ll tell you,” he said at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted “lock them up” in relation to the Biden family, Trump said, “You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary.”  Former President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not encourage Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal during their meeting last month. Trump said at a press conference at his home in Bedminster, New Jersey, that he hasn’t talked to Netanyahu since then, denying reports they’ve spoken recently. He said he told the Israeli prime minister to “get your victory” and “get this over with.” Trump has long been a strong supporter of Israel and the prime minister. He has increased his outreach to Jewish voters in recent days by touting his support of the Jewish state. Trump has previously said Israel must “finish what they started” regarding its military operation in Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to announce what her campaign is describing as a four-year plan to lower housing costs, including $25,000 in downpayment assistance for first time homeowners and actions aimed at spurring the construction of new housing, including tax incentives for building starter homes.  Harris plans to announce the plan as part of a broader economic policy speech in North Carolina on Friday. As CNN has previously reported, the vice president is also announcing a federal ban on price gouging aimed at lowering grocery costs.  Campaign officials also said she plans to address prescription drug prices in her policy rollout on Friday. That had been the focus of a Thursday event in Maryland, where Harris and President Joe Biden appeared together on stage for the first time since the president dropped out of the 2024 race.  High costs of housing and food have been some of the most stubborn economic challenges for the Biden-Harris administration, as Biden has received low marks on his handling of the economy more broadly. White House officials in recent days have touted falling inflation but also acknowledged that prices for many goods remain too high, creating a disconnect between bright spots int he economy and public sentiment.  At his news conference on Thursday, former President Donald Trump touted a trade deal he struck with China, claiming he got China to buy $50 billion worth of American products.   Facts First: The claim that China bought $50 billion worth of American product as a result of a trade deal is false. Trump is referring to what is known as the Phase One deal he struck with Beijing in December 2019. While the deal required China to buy $50 billion worth of American agricultural products by the end of 2021, Beijing did not live up to its commitment. Even as overall inflation across the US economy has cooled, car insurance remains a huge pain point for drivers in the US. Since President Biden took office, car insurance costs have gone up by more than 50%, which Trump said. Compared to last year alone, consumers paid almost 19% more for car insurance, according to July Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday. That marked the third-largest jump in prices over the past year across all goods and categories that CPI tracks. Still, that’s an improvement from March, when car insurance rates were up 22.2% annually. The last time car insurance rates rose that much on an annual basis was in 1976.

They want to put me in prison.” Trump went on to maintain that he has done “nothing wrong” in reference to his many criminal cases. “It’s all crooked politics and really crooked judges,” he said. Asked whether, if elected, he would order his attorney general to no longer pursue the federal cases against him, Trump said they were “nonsense cases” but did not answer the question directly. “I don’t want to talk about it. They’re nonsense cases,” he said. Remember: The federal classified documents case against Trump was dismissed last month, but Trump still faces charges connected to his involvement in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Washington, DC, federal court. This post has been updated with additional comments from Trump on his legal situation. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said Thursday that a focus on lowering consumer prices in Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic agenda would be most helpful in sending a message to voters in battleground states. “Just today, we’re announcing the first round of negotiations with big pharmaceutical companies to get them to lower the price of prescription drugs that people need to stay alive,” Baldwin said, referring to historic legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The senator said “that’s just one example” of efforts by Democrats to address cost-of-living issues, and that the Harris campaign will need to continue focusing on those policies. Key senate race: Baldwin, who is taking on Republican businessman Eric Hovde in a Senate race viewed as crucial to partisan control of the chamber, was visiting a farm in New London as part of a tour across rural Wisconsin. She met with constituents to discuss issues ranging from farming to medical care and touted her work on bipartisan farming legislation during the visit, which included a listening session in a barn and a hayride under heavy rainfall. Attending the DNC: Baldwin — who skipped a rally for President Joe Biden in Wisconsin after his disastrous late-June debate, citing scheduling conflicts — told reporters she would be in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday and Thursday. At his news conference on Thursday, former President Donald Trump repeated his claim that foreign countries are “bringing people from mental institutions and insane asylums into the United States and their population for the mentally ill is way down. They’re in the United States, they’re dumping them in the United States.” Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that foreign governments are “bringing” former mental health patients to the US as migrants. Last year, Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.  Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.  Trump has sometimes tried to support a related claim, about foreign countries supposedly releasing prisoners to come to the US as migrants, by claiming that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.  Former President Donald Trump said that he feels like he is “entitled” to make personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. “I’m very angry at her that she’d weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her,” Trump said at a news conference in New Jersey on Thursday. “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.” Trump’s answer comes as CNN reported some allies have privately expressed serious concerns about the former president’s recent inability to stay on message and discuss policy. The former president reiterated that it is important he win the presidency and shot back that Harris has lodged personal attacks against him: “She actually called me weird.” On Wednesday, Trump’s running mate JD Vance defended Trump in response to a question about personal attacks. Vance said the former president has “earned the right” to run the campaign he desires. He said the reason why people like Trump is because he’s “unfiltered and he lets the American people see who he is.” Vice President Kamala Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to portray themselves as the “underdog” in the presidential race in a taped conversation released by the campaign on Thursday. The conversation, which took place while the two were in Michigan for a campaign rally last week, featured Harris and Walz discussing their backgrounds, families, favorite food and music, while also expressing their shared vision for the campaign. Harris and Walz leaned into his experience as a football coach to draw analogies for how they see the race. Later in the conversation, Walz contrasted their campaign’s optimistic message with former President Donald Trump’s campaign message, which he said is “exploiting the differences” between people. He again framed their campaign as behind in the race. A CNN polling average of five head-to-head surveys released in August found Harris and Trump locked in a close race with no clear leader in the contest.  Taco talk: Harris and Walz also shared details of their personal lives outside of politics, including a discussion on tacos that highlighted some differences between the California native and her Minnesotan running mate. The video began mid-conversation as Walz told Harris he likes “white guy tacos.”  When Walz said he does not put any flavoring on his tacos, Harris made an exclamation of surprise, before laughing along with others in the room. “They said to be careful and let her know this, that black pepper is the top of the spice level in Minnesota,” Walz replied. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday referenced a conversation he shared with Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk on Monday, streamed online on audio only. Throughout the conversation, Musk asked Trump softball questions that allowed the former president to stick to his talking points, including on immigration and the economy. He repeated parts of his campaign stump speech and was not challenged by Musk on any of his false claims. Their conversation covered a broad array of topics — including lengthy portions on energy policy, climate change and the threat of nuclear warfare; immigration, with Trump promising the “largest deportation in the history of this country”; federal government spending, with Musk proposing a commission to look for ways to make cuts; and more. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday repeated his claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.  Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.  As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.  The economy is one of the top voter issuers this election, so it’s no wonder why former President Donald Trump dedicated a lot of his press conference Thursday to talking about it. There’s just one problem: It’s not entirely clear where the numbers he’s citing come from or what period they refer to. For instance, “Kamala’s price hikes,” he said, are costing the typical American household $28,000. CNN was not able to immediately verify the source of his statement that he claimed comes from “government numbers.” It’s also unclear when that $28,000, if true, was incurred by households. For example, was it over the course of the Biden-Harris administration? Just over the past year? Trump also added to the confusion saying inflation costing “the average American family $1,100 every single month.” Much like in his economic pitch to Americans on Wednesday, former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said he would drive prices down quickly if he’s elected for a second term. If only it were that easy. Consumer price inflation, or the rate of change in prices, is expected of a healthy, growing economy. The Federal Reserve, which is tasked with stabilizing prices, targets inflation to be at a 2% annual rate over the long term. That’s seen as a manageable pace of price increases that nudges people to spend their money. On the other hand, if prices are declining outright, known as deflation, then that can be disastrous because it disincentivizes people from spending, which makes up the vast majority of the US economy. If you expect prices to drop in the future, why spend now when you can spend less in the coming months? Deflation usually occurs during a steep economic downturn, which is what happened for a few months during the Great Recession. It’s a symptom of an ailing economy. Former President Trump falsely claimed that mortgage rates have shot up to 10% after they were 2% when he left office. Mortgage rates did start 2021 at a record low, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to 2.65%, according to Freddie Mac. Trump, however, did not provide important context around that historic number: The economy was still weakened and recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark federal funds rate to practically 0% to help prop up the economy. Current 30-year mortgage rates are not at 10%, nor have they approached that in recent years. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 7.79% in October 2023, a 23-year high. As of Thursday, that average rate was 6.49%.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is canceling his planned campaign events in Chicago during the week of the Democratic National Convention next week and instead will testify in court defending his ballot access in Pennsylvania and New York, a campaign spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. Kennedy is currently appealing a decision in New York that blocked his ballot access in that state, following a trial in which he testified in person. Kennedy is also facing a legal challenge in Pennsylvania over his residency, an issue at the heart of the New York ballot access case. On Thursday, Former President Donald Trump, speaking of migration under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, repeated his claim that more than 20 million people have entered the country and that many of them are from prisons and mental health facilities.   Facts First: Trump’s “20 million” figure is false, a major exaggeration. The total number of “encounters” nationwide from February 2021 through June 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was about 10 million — and an “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. In addition, there is no basis for Trump’s claim that “many” of these migrants have come in from jails, prisons or mental health facilities.  Even if you added the estimated number of Biden-era “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans said in May was nearly two million, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in late June after Trump used those figures.  The “encounters” figures can’t be described as figures of people successfully entering the US. Some encounters involve people who are deemed inadmissible at legal ports and are refused permission to enter. Also, the same person can be “encountered” multiple times if they keep returning to the border to try again — which is what happened in many cases under Biden when the Title 42 rapid-expulsion authority invoked by Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic was in place into May 2023.  In 2023, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes — the Breitbart article that has not been corroborated. Even if Venezuela in particular had indeed freed prisoners to allow people to try to migrate to the US, that would be insufficient proof for Trump’s claim that some substantial number of Biden-era migrants are from prisons. Former President Donald Trump claimed in his Thursday news conference that there was no inflation during his presidency.  Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Inflation was low during his presidency, but not nothing.  The Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump’s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday repeated his claim that there has been “record inflation” under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. The current inflation rate, 2.9% in July, is nowhere near the all-time US record of 23.7%, set in 1920. Trump could fairly say that the inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but even that rate was nowhere near the all-time high, and it has since plummeted.  Former President Donald Trump claimed on Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris was appointed as President Joe Biden’s “border czar” and that she was in charge of the border.   Facts First: This is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate and was never the official in charge of the border. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.  Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.  A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries (he also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.” Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far. Speaking in front of a table of packaged foods, former President Donald Trump used his Thursday press conference to draw attention to food inflation. “Grocery prices have skyrocketed,” Trump said, referring to since President Biden took office in January 2021. Compared to then, Americans paid 21% more for their groceries last month, according to Consumer Price Index data. But price pressures are fading. Grocery prices rose at an annual pace of 1.1% last month, according to the latest CPI data released Wednesday. That’s a huge improvement from last July, when grocery prices were rising at an annual pace of 3.6%. But prices are growing at a very fast pace for some individual items. For instance, frozen beverages and eggs cost more than 19% in July compared to a year ago. Hot dog prices are also up nearly 10% for the year ended in July. Former President Donald Trump is once again claiming that voters are now faring worse since he left office in 2020. Trump is speaking at a news conference in New Jersey following his remarks yesterday on the economy. On both sides of the podium, various grocery items are on display behind the former president. He said the cost of items like food and car insurance has increased. He attacked President Joe Biden’s handling of the economy and tried to connect it to Harris, pointing to her role and record as the vice president, painting her as “radical left.” Trump claimed that Harris’ economic policies “have totally failed and caused really a catastrophe for our country.” Edible stagecraft: The food surrounding Trump, including sausages and other perishables, has been sitting out in the mid-80-degree weather and attracting flies, which occasionally landed on the former president. Trump seems pleased with the array, at one point remarking on “what a nice job” his campaign had done putting it together. He also said he might take some of the food “back to my cottage.” This post has been updated with more details on the scene at Trump’s event in New Jersey. Vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday he hopes Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drops out and endorses Donald Trump, mentioning how many in the former president’s orbit believe his continued campaign is beneficial to Vice President Kamala Harris. However, Vance said that he would not “trade important jobs in the government” for Kennedy’s endorsement, as it would be unethical. Vance also argued Kennedy is “much closer on the issues” to Trump than to Harris, including on foreign policy and what he called “medical freedom.” Kennedy said Thursday morning on X that he has “no plans” to endorse Harris and that he cannot reconcile “Harris’s Democratic Party” with his values. “I hope he gets out. I hope he endorses President Trump. I have no idea what he’ll do,” Vance said. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered remarks from Prince George’s County, Maryland on Thursday, sharing the stage for the first joint public event since Biden withdrew from the 2024 race and threw his support behind Harris. Introducing Biden for the first time since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris offered effusive praise for Biden, telling a raucous crowd, “I could speak all afternoon about the person I’m standing on this stage with – our extraordinary president Joe Biden.”  Throughout Harris’ remarks, the crowd erupted in chants of “Thank you, Joe,” which continued after Biden took the stage following Harris’ introduction. Here are highlights from the speech: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to call for a federal ban on price gouging to lower grocery prices and everyday costs for Americans in her first economic policy speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday. The proposal is part of Harris’ efforts to prevent corporations in the food and grocery industries from hiking prices on consumers and is one component of a larger plan she will roll out to tackle high costs and inflation, according to the Harris campaign. As part of her first 100 days in office, the vice president’s campaign said she would implement a plan to keep costs down. This plan includes authorizing the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and implement harsh penalties on companies that violate the federal ban, resources that can detect price-fixing, and more support for small businesses to potentially grow into competitors of large companies. Harris’ policy speech comes as the economy remains a critical issue for voters. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released last week found that Americans trust former President Donald Trump over Harris to handle the economy – but opinions were closely split, with 51% saying Trump would be better at handling the economy while 48% said Harris. Read the full story. A new Pew Research Center poll finds no clear leader nationally in the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, amid “clear signs that Harris has energized Democratic voters.” In Pew’s latest poll, 46% of registered voters support Harris, 45% support Trump, and 7% support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a shift from Pew’s July polling, when Trump held a 4-point edge over President Joe Biden. Similarly sized majorities of both Harris supporters and Trump supporters now say they’re strong backers of their chosen candidate (64% of Trump supporters and 62% of Harris supporters say this). In July there was more of a gap: just 43% of Biden supporters said they supported their chosen candidate strongly, compared with 63% of Trump supporters. The poll finds most of Harris’ gains coming at the expense of Kennedy. The vast majority of Biden’s former supporters now support Harris (97%) and Trump also has retained most of his July supporters (95%). But just 39% of voters who supported Kennedy in July still say they’re backing him, Pew finds, with 39% now backing Harris, and 20% now backing Trump. The poll did not test a head-to-head version of the race without Kennedy included. Pew finds that Harris has improved on Biden’s performance with voters in a number of key subgroups, with Trump’s support remaining largely stable since July: The Pew Research Center poll surveyed 7,569 registered voters on Aug. 5-11, using a nationally representative online panel. Results from the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/- 1.4 percentage points. As the economic policy positions of the Harris-Walz ticket start to come into view, they’re increasingly converging with those of her Republican opponents: Donald Trump and JD Vance.  Over the weekend, Vance told CBS News he would support expanding the Child Tax Credit to $5,000 per child, while acknowledging a difficult road to secure support on Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans earlier this month blocked an expansion of the child tax credit.  Harris’ allies say she continues to support a larger child tax credit, which earlier this year she suggested should return to the amount temporary established under the American Rescue Plan of up to $3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 for children between 6 and 17. The Harris campaign declined to say where her position on the CTC would eventually land.  Two sources close to Harris suggested that, while she would lay out a set of new economic proposals during her remarks on Friday, they would be “additive” to what the Biden administration has done thus far, not wholesale revisions of those policies. But with Harris holding more centrist views than the party’s left flank that drove much of the early Biden agenda, the sources suggested that seemingly proposals to lower costs through government programs could be coupled with tax cuts elsewhere.  To be sure, Harris over the weekend proposed eliminating tips on wages during a rally in Las Vegas, where one-third of workers are employed by the leisure and hospitality industry. That policy was first floated by Trump during a rally in the same location back in June, marking the second time in a week that the opposing political parties have found themselves on common policy footing.  Former President Donald Trump posted a new TikTok, also shared on Truth Social, in which he mispronounced Vice President Kamala Harris’ first name as “Camila” while bashing her on the economy.  The Trump campaign has sought to push their economic message this week and contrasts Trump’s economic policies with Harris’.  Trump claimed in the TikTok that “credit card debt is at an all-time high and that basically the prices of things have never been like this ever before.” “If you want to bring the prices down, if you want to have a good life, vote for Trump,” Trump said in the video, which was recorded on his plane. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said Corey Lewandowski, who was Trump’s campaign manager in 2016 before leaving in June 2016, would be joining his campaign as a senior adviser.  Trump added that, “Others, likewise, are joining us. They’ll be announced soon!” CNN previously reported Lewandowski would be joining Trump’s campaign.  Trump also praised his two campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.  “The Enthusiasm is GREAT, and the Management Team, headed up by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, is THE BEST. Again, these 82 days will go down as the Most Important in Campaign History, and November 5th will be the Most Important Day in the History of our Country. We are a Nation in Decline, but we will soon be a Great Nation again! MAGA2024,” Trump posted. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday that a Trump-Vance administration would use “every law enforcement tool” at its disposal to “get illegal immigration under control” — but he doesn’t know if the National Guard would be necessary to conduct the mass deportations former President Donald Trump has promised. Vance said he likens questions about how the Trump administration would deport millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States to taking bites out of a large sandwich. In the analogy, Vance said the administration would tackle the problem one step at a time. The first approach before deportations, Vance said, is to get “illegal immigration as close to zero as physically possible.” “I don’t know that you need to use the National Guard, but we are going to use every law enforcement tool at our disposal to get illegal immigration under control,” Vance said. Last weekend, Vance told ABC that mass deportations should take a “sequential approach” with “what’s achievable,” suggesting 1 million people and moving from there. The Democratic Party committee dedicated to state legislative races on Thursday announced an additional six-figure investment in the key battleground state of Arizona, feeling that they’re closer than ever to having a Democratic trifecta in the Grand Canyon State. Arizona Democrats need to flip two seats in both the state House and Senate to have a majority and pass their priorities, which they say are ensuring abortion rights, tackling housing affordability, investing in public education, and addressing the state’s water shortage crisis. On a virtual call Thursday, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee highlighted eight House and four Senate candidates in Arizona that they argued “today represent the strongest opportunities to flip both chambers in one of the toughest battleground states” and announced that it would be investing more than $200,000 to support the slate of candidates.  The DLCC said it has already invested $131,000 in Arizona for this election cycle ahead of today’s announcement. President Joe Biden has stepped up to the microphones at the event in Maryland about his administration’s historic effort to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Biden started by reflecting on the fact that he’s been trying to accomplish legislation on the issue since he was a freshman US senator in 1973. “I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long, long time,” the president told the crowd. Biden said the fight against big pharmaceutical companies is critical because Americans pay more for their medications than “any advanced nation in the world.” Despite the long-running effort to change the policy, drug companies successfully blocked efforts to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for years, the president said. The president said that while a month’s supply of a drug like insulin for a diabetes patient could cost hundreds of dollars a month, now that price will be capped at $35 for Medicare recipients. Biden said “every American” should qualify for that lowered price, and said he’ll work to ensure that during his remaining time in office. “Kamala, when she’s president, is going to make sure, if we don’t get it done,” he added. Biden noted that Democrats passed the existing legislation without support from Republicans in Congress, and suggested the presidential election could determine whether it will remain law. “The guy we’re running against … they’re fighting to get rid of what we just passed,” the president said. This post has been updated with additional comments from Biden’s speech. President Joe Biden got a warm welcome during today’s remarks at a community college in Maryland, his first joint event with Vice President Kamala Harris since he announced he was not seeking reelection. The president and vice president walked out on the stage together. “There’s a lot of love in this room for our president,” she said. Harris praised Biden, saying “few leaders in our nation have done more” on many issues including health care and prescription drug costs, which is an accomplishment that Biden has touted throughout this term. “Thank you Joe!” the crowd chanted. Later on in her remarks, Harris said it was her “great honor” to serve with Biden, who she called an “extraordinary human being.” Biden at the beginning of his remarks said that Harris is “going to make one hell of a president.” President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are holding their first joint event since Biden left the 2024 presidential race last month. During their remarks in Maryland, they are expected to tout the results of their historic Medicare drug price negotiations, as Harris prepares to pitch her vision to voters at the Democratic National Convention next week. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign declined invitations to additional September debates with Donald Trump and JD Vance in a statement on Thursday. Harris campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said in the statement that “the debate about debates is over.” He confirmed Harris will participate in a debate with Trump hosted by ABC on September 10 and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will participate in a debate with Vance hosted by CBS on October 1. Harris is open to an additional debate with Trump in October, a senior campaign adviser said, but the details will not be settled until the first debate is in the books.  The statement comes after Vance said on Wednesday he accepted invitations from CBS to participate in its debate and from CNN for an additional debate in September.  At a news conference last week, Trump agreed to participate in the ABC debate with Harris and said he’d also accepted debate invitations from Fox News and NBC for additional debates in September. CBS News will allow other networks to simulcast its October 1 vice presidential debate between GOP Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, a network spokesperson told CNN. The decision follows previous agreements this year from CNN and ABC to allow other networks to simulcast their respective presidential debates after the candidates bypassed the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. “CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan of “Face the Nation” will moderate the October 1 debate between Vance and Walz, the network said. The vice presidential candidates have also been invited to a debate on CNN, which Vance has already accepted. CNN’s 90-minute debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in June was watched by 51.3 million television viewers across 22 networks, in what was the most-watched CNN program in history.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is trying out a new attack strategy ahead of former President Donald Trump’s news conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, later today, which the campaign referred to as “another public meltdown.” The campaign blasted out a mock media advisory arguing Trump “intends to deliver another self-obsessed rant full of his own personal grievances to distract from his toxic Project 2025 agenda, unpopular running mate, and increasing detachment from the reality of the voters who will decide this election.” Trump’s remarks, Harris’ campaign said, “will not be artificial intelligence, but they certainly will lack intelligence.” That’s a dig at the former president after he spread a false conspiracy theory about Harris’ Detroit crowd size and claimed a photo was created with artificial intelligence. They also hit Trump for not campaigning in battleground states, even though he hit the trail in North Carolina on Wednesday. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held a five-day campaign blitz through key states last week. Trump is expected to hold the news conference in Bedminster at 4:30 p.m. ET. Donald Trump showed up in battleground North Carolina for a big speech on the economy – and one of his unhinged rallies broke out. But amid the insults, trash talk, rage and lies, the former president blundered into the thing he’d been seeking for days: a strategy to take on Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president took the stage Wednesday with Republican commentators pining for signs that he’d stabilized after more than three weeks of fury and disorientation after President Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 race. Anyone hoping for an elusive Trump pivot would have been disappointed, as they almost always are, as he branded Harris “crazy” and “not smart,” while lampooning her laugh with sexist attacks and turning up the heat of his immigration demagoguery. Trump’s still uncontrolled bitterness that he’s no longer running against Biden stole the headlines from a speech that his campaign billed as a serious exercise devoted to the economy – the issue that voters care about most. But his remarks, at least the scripted version of them, offered the first signs that the Trump campaign is beginning to settle on a coherent, albeit extreme and divisive, plan to react to a new general election foe. The event, therefore, offered a preview of how the race to Election Day will unfold after the Democratic National Convention next week. The new approach, if Trump ever musters the discipline to implement it in a concentrated way, is deeply personal and designed to destroy the idea that Harris, just the second woman to head a major party presidential ticket, is competent to serve. It involves blaming her for the scourge of inflation and high grocery prices that haunted Biden’s administration, under the new title of “Kamalanomics.” Read the full analysis. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday that he has agreed to the October 1 vice presidential debate on CBS that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted on Wednesday.  Vance also said he accepted CNN’s debate invitation on September 18. CNN has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment. When it comes to the rules of the vice presidential debates, Vance said his team didn’t “really didn’t ask or require much” and that he told his staff to “agree to whatever” they have to. He said he first heard about both the CBS and CNN debates on Wednesday and that he and his team “just wanted to make sure that we had an opportunity to do a real exchange of views.” Vance added that he believes the Harris campaign is “trying to produce a movie” rather than run a political campaign.  This post has been updated with additional details from Vance. Vice President Kamala Harris is attempting to do something Democratic presidential hopefuls haven’t done in 16 years: win North Carolina. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explains why the state has seen an influx of campaign focus from both parties. Former President Donald Trump is meeting with GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson today at his Bedminster Golf Club ahead of speaking at a “fighting antisemitism” event, according to a source familiar with the plans. The meeting comes after the New York Times reported Trump “stunned” Adelson when he sent a tirade of text messages through an aide that accused her “of having RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, running the group and saying her late husband wouldn’t have tolerated it,” according to the Times.  Some background: Miriam’s late husband Sheldon Adelson, the chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands and a major donor to Republican politicians, died in January 2021 following complications related to his cancer treatment, his company said. He was 87. Adelson spent his fortune – pegged at $35 billion by Forbes – to become an influential behind-the-scenes-player in Washington, working to shape US policy toward Israel, help guide Republican Party strategy and lobby against threats posed to his business interests. CNN’s Jordan Valinsky and Fredreka Schouten contributed reporting to this post.  Former President Donald Trump is expected to make new additions to his campaign imminently, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN, including the addition of his first 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. It was not immediately clear what his role would be. Lewandowski served as Trump’s campaign manager from June of 2015 until he was fired a year later amid a series of negative stories and replaced with Paul Manafort.   Sources stressed the campaign team, co-managed by Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, would not be replaced, but that Lewandowski would be brought on to help navigate the changed political landscape. “As we head into the home stretch of this election, we are continuing to add to our impressive campaign team,” Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement to CNN. “Corey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Tim Murtaugh are all veterans of prior Trump campaigns and their unmatched experience will help President Trump prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.” Some context: The additions come after a change at the top of the Democratic ticket has brought a burst of enthusiasm and a boost in the polls for his new rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. Earlier this month, the campaign brought on another long time Trump ally, Taylor Budowich, as a senior adviser to the campaign. Budowich has been the head of the super PAC, MAGA, Inc., for the last two years. Trump’s campaign has downplayed Harris’s significance, arguing that despite the change in the dynamics of the race, the “fundamentals” of the campaign have remained the same. But allies of the former President have grown increasingly agitated in recent weeks, as they’ve watched Trump unleash a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even they acknowledge have been unproductive. Some have privately expressed serious concern that the former president’s recent inability to stay on message has wasted an early opportunity to blunt the momentum of his new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.  Privately, they’ve complained at the state of the campaign—arguing that things need to change. When Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz first ran for Congress in 2006, his campaign repeatedly made false statements about the details of his 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. According to court and police records connected to the incident, Walz admitted in court that he had been drinking when he was pulled over for driving 96 mph in a 55 mph zone in Nebraska. Walz was then transported by a state trooper to a local hospital for a blood test, showing he had a blood alcohol level of .128, well above the state’s legal limit of 0.1 at the time. But in 2006, his campaign repeatedly told the press that he had not been drinking that night, claiming that his failed field sobriety test was due to a misunderstanding related to hearing loss from his time in the National Guard. The campaign also claimed that Walz was allowed to drive himself to jail that night. None of that was true. A CNN KFile review of statements made by the Walz campaign at the time reveals numerous discrepancies between how the campaign described the events and the facts of what actually took place that night. Read more about Walz’s DWI arrest. One month ago, battleground North Carolina was slipping away from Democrats. Now, with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, the state is competitive once again. “Folks were feeling so downtrodden and they just didn’t feel like we could win again,” said Gena Singleton, a longtime party activist and leader of the Burke County Democrats. “All of a sudden, we were on the upswing and people want to be a part of it.” Few states have offered Democratic presidential hopefuls the number of disappointments the Tar Heel state has in recent cycles. It has been 16 years since Barack Obama delivered a North Carolina surprise in 2008 – the first and only time a Democratic candidate for the White House has carried the state in nearly five decades. The question now is whether Harris will be able to drive up turnout in urban and fast-growing suburban areas in the state, particularly around Wake County’s Raleigh and Mecklenburg County’s Charlotte. Of the 836,000 voters the state has added since 2012, more than a third are in those two counties, which continue to add new residents every day. Biden took both four years ago by about a 2-to-1 margin. Even before Biden dropped out, Democrats viewed North Carolina as their best offensive opportunity. In 2020, Trump beat Biden by about 74,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast. The margin of victory of 1.3 points – less than half his spread four years earlier – was the narrowest of any state Trump won. “I think a lot of people are tired of him,” Barrette, who grew up in a family of Republicans but has become a loyal Democrat, said of Trump. “They really want somebody else and the Democrats are offering that this year. People are noticing and they’re willing to give Kamala Harris a chance.” Former president Donald Trump’s attorneys are asking the judge in his New York hush money case to postpone his sentencing until after the presidential election in November, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Trump’s sentencing is currently scheduled for September 18. Here’s a look at the three other cases Trump is facing. A CNN Poll of Polls average of general election polling continues to find no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, with Harris holding 50% support and Trump 49% support in an average of recent polls testing the head-to-head matchup. The latest Poll of Polls incorporates five head-to-head surveys released in August, all of which show a race within the margin of error. This marks the first time a Poll of Polls this year shows a numeric advantage for the Democratic candidate, but both the average and the individual polls comprising it continue to indicate a very close race. The latest update to the average incorporates a Fox News poll released Wednesday evening that finds the state of the race little changed from July, with the Trump ticket taking 50% to the Harris ticket’s 49%. Echoing other recent polling, Fox does find a shift in enthusiasm metrics, with an equal 68% of both Harris and Trump supporters now saying they’re extremely motivated to vote. Last month, 66% of Trump backers and 61% of Biden backers called themselves extremely motivated. In the Fox poll, 63% of Harris supporters and 77% of Trump supporters say their choice is primarily motivated by support for their chosen candidate, rather than as a vote against their opponent. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he has no plans to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in response to reports his campaign approached the Harris campaign about a role in her administration in exchange for an endorsement.  In a lengthy social media post on X, Kennedy attacked Harris and the Democratic Party, whom he has frequently criticized since leaving the party to run as an independent last year. The post comes after multiple outlets, including CNN, reported that Harris’ campaign did not take up the Kennedy campaign’s offer to meet to discuss the possibility of Kennedy serving in a potential Harris administration should she win, in exchange for him endorsing her. Kennedy and former President Donald Trump met in person in Milwaukee, where they discussed Kennedy potentially endorsing Trump in exchange for a role in his administration. Voters in some battleground states will find it easier to cast ballots this year than in previous presidential elections — while in other pivotal states, voters will face new obstacles, according to a report released Thursday by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. Many of the changes to states’ election rules are focused on the protocols for mail ballots, with some states creating new limits on access to ballot drop boxes and tightening various deadlines in the process. Other states have sought to lower barriers to mail voting. Among the closely watched states that have made voting harder since 2020, according to the Brennan Center’s analysis, are North Carolina and Florida. North Carolina: A 2023 law moving up the state’s deadline for when mail ballots must be received by election officials would have affected 11,600 ballots, the Brennan Center said, had the law been in place in 2020. Previously, mail ballots received up to three days after the election could be accepted, but the new law — enacted by the GOP legislature over the veto of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper — makes 7:30 p.m. on Election Day the receipt deadline. Additionally, a requirement that photo ID be shown in order to vote in North Carolina will be in effect for the first time in a presidential election. Florida: Voters will face new obstacles for casting mail ballots due to a 2021 law that constrained the use of ballot drop boxes and limited the assistance voters can receive from others, among other new regulations. Read more details from the report on voting in battleground states. Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina on Thursday said he and President Joe Biden talked as the president was leaving the race and that he is in a “good place.” CNN reported on Thursday that Biden is still smarting from the push to end his reelection bid and has not spoken with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who played a key role in the effort to convince Biden to step aside, since his decision to abandon his candidacy. The president has made clear to those close to him that he was particularly unhappy with her. Sources stopped short of using the word “grudge” – but said Biden would not soon forget those who appeared to be most active in pushing him aside. Discussing his understanding of Biden’s mood right now, Clyburn told CNN’s John Berman, “he’s in a good mood. I’d suspect that he is not happy with some of the public statements and public actions that were taken in this whole issue, but I noticed on yesterday that he joked about inviting people to the White House because he’s looking for a job.” He added, “I think he is in a real good place because Joe Biden knows that he’s book ending a tremendous record here that no president of the United States could ever match.” When asked about former President Donald Trump’s comments at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference that Vice President Kamala Harris “happened to turn Black,” Clyburn said Trump is a “slow learner.” Clyburn also praised Harris, saying “this lady has a great record” and “I do believe she is going to be successful in this campaign.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ appearance with President Joe Biden on Thursday to tout efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs offers an early preview of how she plans to navigate his unpopular economic record, according to people familiar with her plans. Harris is caught in something of a political bind. While individual parts of Biden’s record are popular, he is broadly seen by voters as performing poorly on the economy. For that reason, aides don’t expect Harris to carry the banner of “Bidenomics,” lumping everything together in a manner that has proven unsuccessful from a messaging perspective. Instead, her approach will be more focused on individuals and their economic needs. She is expected to highlight areas of Biden’s record that enjoy broad support among voters, while advocating for a raft of additional policies that would lower the costs of healthcare, food and housing. That includes lowering the cost of medicines, the main focus of Thursday’s event in Maryland. Polls have shown steps like capping the price of insulin and cutting the cost of Medicare drugs are popular.  Advisers say Harris’ vision for the economy doesn’t deviate in major ways from Biden’s, and the economic speech she plans to deliver Friday will track closely with many of the priorities of the current administration. The difference, people familiar with her plans say, will be in emphasis. For example, she plans to hone in on price gouging during her speech Friday, calling for a federal ban on the practice. She’ll also aggressively call out companies for setting excessing prices. She is expected to also lay out plans for housing and drug prices — with an emphasis on how they would affect middle class Americans, and Americans with children. A day after former President Donald Trump launched attacks insulting Vice President Kamala Harris’ laugh and intelligence, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn — a staunch Harris ally — rebuked Trump’s rhetoric, calling it “the sounds of a desperate man.” Clyburn told CNN that Harris has a “great record,” adding that “she is studiously prepared for this job.” Clyburn described Harris’ campaign as “taking off like a rocket ship since becoming the presumptive nominee,” attributing the growing support behind her candidacy to her record as vice president. He said that vice presidents “develop a record for the public to see, and they let the public know that if given the opportunity, what you have seen in my record is the kind of approach you will see me give to governing.” The South Carolina Democrat also addressed Trump’s recent controversial comments that Harris “happened to turn Black” at a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists. “If he did not know that she was Black, he is a slow learner,” Clyburn said, adding that she attended an historically Black university and was a member of an historically Black sorority. President Joe Biden is still smarting from having been forced to abandon his reelection campaign more than three weeks ago and has made clear to those close to him that he was particularly unhappy with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom he has not spoken since his decision to abandon his candidacy. Sources stopped short of using the word “grudge” – but said Biden would not soon forget those who appeared to be most active in pushing him aside. While he has appreciated the warm embrace of Democrats following his decision, there have also been moments of eye-rolling after public tributes from certain party members who most actively tried to push him from the race. The process that led him to exit the campaign left the president alternately embittered and relieved, according to people familiar with his mindset, who say Biden is still processing the events that led to his ouster as the Democratic standard bearer even as he firmly believes that he made the right choice. Another source familiar with the matter said that Biden was unhappy at the time, but “is not spending time ruminating” about it. White House spokesman Andrew Bates disputed the characterization that Biden was still dwelling on his unhappiness with Pelosi, saying it was “not accurate” and that the president’s attention is “on the future, not the past.” While the 81-year-old president holds some regrets about how it unfolded, Biden is now also enlivened by the opportunity to burnish his legacy without having to run a bruising campaign against former President Donald Trump. Read more about Biden’s focus on his legacy here. If you’re wondering where the presidential candidates will be on Thursday, here’s where you can expect to hear from them. The vice-presidential candidates will also make appearances at various events throughout the day. Our reporters will bring you the latest right here. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign reached out to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to arrange a meeting about a possible role in her administration if he drops out of the race and endorses her, a Kennedy campaign official and a Democratic official told CNN. The Washington Post first reported the outreach. The approach from Kennedy’s team occurred last week, and no meeting between the two candidates materialized, the Kennedy campaign official told CNN. The effort to meet comes weeks after Kennedy and Trump met in person during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the two discussed a potential role for Kennedy in the Trump’s administration in exchange for an endorsement. Kennedy campaign staff also attempted to reach out to intermediaries for Ron Klain, former White House chief of staff for President Biden, but those efforts were fruitless, the Kennedy campaign official said. While Kennedy continues to make progress on ballot access, arrange campaign events and make media appearances, the Kennedy campaign official told CNN he remains open to dropping out of the race if he believes he can serve the country another way. Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN that Kennedy “is willing to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the possibility of a unity government.” CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. Democrats have strongly combatted Kennedy’s campaign since the beginning of the year through ads labeling Kennedy a “spoiler” and highlighting his ties to GOP megadonor Timothy Mellon, who has contributed to an outside group backing Kennedy and a separate group backing Trump. The Democratic National Committee and a super PAC ran by Democratic allies have filed objections to Kennedy’s ballot access in several states. “No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement,” DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said in a statement to CNN.   President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks today “on the progress they are making to lower costs for the American people,” according to the White House. The event, at Prince George’s County Community College in Maryland, will be their first public joint appearance since Biden withdrew from the presidential race last month. Kamala Harris may be done with Medicare for All, but Medicare for All — with a new nudge from former President Donald Trump — isn’t done with her. The Trump campaign on Wednesday attacked Harris over her past support of a single-payer, government-run health care system long championed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Medicare for All gained broad support among progressive Democrats, especially those with eyes on the White House, before and during the early stages of the party’s 2020 presidential primary. Harris’ team said recently that she no longer backs the plan, which fell out of vogue with Democrats as Joe Biden surged to the nomination four years ago as one of the few candidates to vocally oppose it. Instead, he campaigned on improving and expanding the Affordable Care Act, which he has focused on during his term and Harris has supported as his vice president. But Harris has not addressed the question herself, touting the Biden administration’s record while trying to avoid any relitigation of the years-old fight, and putting out word now only through campaign aides. Now, Trump is reviving the debate as he seeks to paint Harris as both a radical liberal and a flip flopper. The Trump camp’s focus on Medicare for All is emerging as the centerpiece of a wider strategy to use Harris’ 2020 primary positions against her now, less than 90 days before the general election. Read more about Harris’ previous stance on Medicare for All."
Harris to announce 4-year plan to lower housing costs | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:07 PM EDT, Thu August 15, 2024",2024-08-15T22:46:58.913Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/kamala-harris-plan-housing-costs/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris plans to announce Friday what her campaign is describing as a four-year plan to lower housing costs, including $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homeowners and actions aimed at spurring the construction of new housing, including tax incentives for building starter homes. Harris intends to announce this plan as a part of a broader economic policy speech in North Carolina. As CNN has previously reported, the vice president is also announcing a proposal for a federal ban on price gouging aimed at lowering grocery costs. Campaign officials had also said that she plans to address on Friday prescription drug prices in her policy rollout. That had been the focus of a Thursday event in Maryland, where Harris and President Joe Biden appeared together on stage for the first time since the president dropped out of the 2024 race. High costs of housing and food have been some of the most stubborn economic challenges for the Biden-Harris administration, as Biden has received low marks on his handling of the economy more broadly. White House officials in recent days have touted falling inflation but also acknowledged that prices for many goods remain too high, creating a disconnect between bright spots in the economy and public sentiment. “We hear you. The president hears you. The vice president hears you,” Council of Economic Advisers chairman Jared Bernstein said Wednesday in a White House news briefing when asked about Americans who do not believe the economy is in better shape now than when Biden first took office. Parts of Harris’ three-section plan build on proposals that Biden has already unveiled. The plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time home buyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time home buyers. The plan, which would be implemented during Harris’ first term, according to the campaign, would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year. According to the Harris campaign, the plan would allow for over 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation home buyers, to access the funds. “Many Americans work hard at their jobs, save, and pay their rent on time month after month,” the campaign said. “But they can’t save enough after paying their rent and other bills to save for a down payment—denying them a shot at owning a home and building wealth.” The vice president is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing. “There’s a serious housing shortage across America and it’s driving prices up,” the campaign said. In addition, Harris wants to create a new $40 billion innovation fund to spur innovative housing construction – twice the size of a proposed fund previously announced by the Biden administration. The fund would look to empower local governments, developers and builders to construct more housing that’s affordable and to support new methods of construction financing. Harris would also seek to repurpose some federal land for affordable housing, similar to proposals floated by Biden and former President Donald Trump. The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes. Addressing the nation’s affordable housing crisis has also been on Biden’s radar, with the president unveiling new proposals to tackle it in his State of the Union address in March. He announced two new tax credits aimed at improving affordability and increasing the availability of homes on the market for purchase or rent. One $10,000 refundable tax credit is designed to help middle class homebuyers close a deal on their first home. The other $10,000 tax credit is aimed at pushing middle class people to put their starter homes on the market. Additionally, the president called on Congress to pass legislation that he says could result in the building and renovation of more than 2 million homes to close the housing supply gap and lower housing costs. Last month, Biden called for withdrawing tax credits from landlords who raise rent by more than 5% per year. The Biden administration has also urged federal agencies to review whether surplus federally owned l﻿and could be used to build affordable homes. Trump touted a similar proposal in two campaign events this week. “We’re going to open up tracts of federal land for housing construction,” he said in a news conference Thursday. “We desperately need housing for people who can’t afford what’s going on now.” In addition, the Republican National Committee platform says that the party will “promote homeownership with tax incentives and support for first-time buyers and cut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs,” as well as “reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation.” This story has been updated with additional details."
"Biden, still smarting from his 2024 exit, turns his attention to Harris – and his own legacy | CNN Politics","Updated 3:20 PM EDT, Thu August 15, 2024",2024-08-15T10:00:03.449Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/joe-biden-legacy-kamala-harris-2024/index.html,"President Joe Biden is still smarting from having been forced to abandon his reelection campaign more than three weeks ago and has made clear to those close to him that he was particularly unhappy with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom he has not spoken since his decision to abandon his candidacy. Sources stopped short of using the word “grudge” – but said Biden would not soon forget those who appeared to be most active in pushing him aside. While he has appreciated the warm embrace of Democrats following his decision, there have also been moments of eye-rolling after public tributes from certain party members who most actively tried to push him from the race. The process that led him to exit the campaign left the president alternately embittered and relieved, according to people familiar with his mindset, who say Biden is still processing the events that led to his ouster as the Democratic standard bearer even as he firmly believes that he made the right choice. Another source familiar with the matter said that Biden was unhappy at the time, but “is not spending time ruminating” about it. White House spokesman Andrew Bates disputed the characterization that Biden was still dwelling on his unhappiness with Pelosi, saying it was “not accurate” and that the president’s attention is “on the future, not the past.” While the 81-year-old president holds some regrets about how it unfolded, Biden is now also enlivened by the opportunity to burnish his legacy without having to run a bruising campaign against former President Donald Trump. And if Biden harbors any lingering hard feelings, he has been clear about one thing: He holds no hard feelings toward his vice president, Kamala Harris, who has swiftly replaced him atop the Democratic ticket. Biden has told people he is proud of both how Harris rose to the occasion to replace him on the ticket and how the party rallied behind her — in no small part because he quickly endorsed her as his chosen successor. Biden and Harris made their first official joint appearance in their new roles as lame duck president and Democratic nominee Thursday for an event focused on drug costs. The two were effusive in their praise for one another during the event. “There’s a lot of love in this room for our president, and I think it’s for many, many reasons,” Harris said, as supporters chanted: “Thank you, Joe.” Speaking after his vice president, Biden said Harris will make “one hell of a president.” Since dropping out last month, an unambiguous mandate has been articulated to West Wing and former Biden campaign officials alike: Anyone who was working – until a handful of weeks ago – to reelect the president should now channel that same energy into helping elect Harris. While Biden’s team has always included the vice president’s office in coordination on strategy, policy, and messaging, sources described a new internal dynamic in which more input is sought from top Harris aides, including her chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, whose role has become more integrated with the West Wing. Voles previously met one-on-one with chief of staff Jeff Zients regularly, but now the two meet daily, a source familiar with the matter said. Zients also checks in regularly with Harris. The West Wing, a source familiar with the dynamic said, is “more deferential to the vice president’s side. Before, it would’ve been, ‘The president is announcing X thing,’ … Now, it’s more of a conversation to make sure it makes sense for her, too.” One senior White House official said there is almost an “overcommunication” with the vice president’s team on all matters to ensure there are “no surprises, no mistakes, no crossed wires.” Biden, for his part, has indicated that he is game to do a lot of things in the final stretch of the general election that might be helpful for Harris, sources said, including campaigning heavily in Pennsylvania, a key battleground where he was born. Sources said Biden was likely to try to help rally Harris coalitions with whom he’s enjoyed popularity: among union workers, senior citizens and rural Americans. The president saw Harris as having remained unflinchingly loyal even as a flood of Democrats were calling on him to drop out of the 2024 race over the course of July – or, as in Pelosi’s case, were publicly articulating their concerns. People close to Harris say she “stayed in her lane” and refused to engage in the inbound calls her team fielded from lawmakers, strategists and donors expressing support for her to replace Biden on the ballot. “[Harris] intentionally or unintentionally played it perfectly, which gave him the room to endorse her,” said a top Democrat close to the West Wing and the vice president’s office. “He’s willing to do whatever he needs to do to help her.” Thursday’s event on drug costs will highlight an agenda item that’s been central to Biden’s term that Harris is expected to tout as the cost of living remains of high concern to voters. In the last three weeks, Harris has been carefully assessing where to break with Biden on policy and messaging. She ditched his team’s doom-and-gloom message focused on January 6, 2021, and the danger Trump poses to the country, in favor of a message centered more on optimism and joyfulness. And when she releases her economic plan in the coming days, she’ll need to balance her own proximity to the Biden administration’s policies, sources say, with the general discontent among the electorate with Biden’s record on the economy. Biden’s pledge to help Harris win is genuine, according to people he’s spoken to, in no small part because he regards her success as a key part of his own legacy. There is a stark understanding in the White House that that legacy is intrinsically tied to Harris’ success, and Biden has repeatedly warned that a second Trump administration could unravel some of his signature achievements. Still, Biden hasn’t entirely let go of asking himself what would have happened if he hadn’t botched the CNN debate in June that ultimately hastened his exit from the race. He continues to insist his subpar performance was due to illness and nothing more, and has pointed to polls that he said showed a tight race with Trump. At one point in the immediate aftermath of his decision to step aside, there were early discussions of the president possibly attending Harris’ convention speech next Thursday to watch her formally accept the party’s nomination. But those talks did not advance, and Biden is not expected to participate in the Chicago event past his primetime speaking slot on Monday evening. Officials say plans for how Biden will hit the campaign trail with and for Harris are still being finalized and are likely to take shape after Labor Day. He is expected to attend additional joint events with Harris and will also fundraise for her campaign in the coming weeks, a Biden adviser said. The president, a former Democratic official said, could be used by Harris’ campaign as a “validator, a foil, and a special guest,” suggesting that Biden and Harris’ team will be strategic about what he chooses to weigh in on – and could also give her cover on policy areas where she seeks to create some daylight. However actively the president chooses to be a surrogate for his former running mate, it will be just a part of the president’s final five-plus months left in office. Almost immediately after ending his campaign, Biden asked that his top aides start drafting an agenda for the rest of his time in office. “The very day – it was a Sunday that the president decided not to run for reelection – he pulled together the senior team here at the White House and asked us what’s the plan for the next 180 days to finish as strong as we started?” White House chief of staff Jeff Zients told political appointees on a call last week, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. Zients added that Biden was focused on continued implementation of legislation – but also new policy. The abrupt end to Biden’s political ambitions came as a surprise to many inside the White House, which had not developed alternate plans should he drop out. It took staffers some time to recalibrate their approach, which will see Biden engaging in more limited domestic travel – save for stumping for Harris – and spending more time overseas to cement his foreign policy legacy. “You can expect to see very busy months of activity, of summits and trips to ensure that we do everything we can to leave it on the field,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told political appointees on the call, adding that there would be “high-level summits both here and abroad.” While White House officials have been tight-lipped about any potential travels abroad, some privately point to Europe as an obvious destination to highlight his work strengthening the NATO alliance and the US defense of Ukraine. They also point to increased engagement with India and Africa, where Biden has prioritized building partnerships that would decrease their reliance on China and counter Beijing’s soft power around the world. Biden visited India when it hosted the 2023 Group of 20 Summit but has not delivered on a promise to visit the African continent. As the 2024 G20 in Brazil approaches, Biden must weigh the potential for a final face-to-face with China’s Xi Jinping. He’s known the leader, whom he recently called a “dictator,” for decades and warned him against aggression in the Indo-Pacific. Aides have discussed adding other stops to the trip to Brazil. For now, however, the president’s schedule has been far lighter than it was when he was still a candidate. No longer obliged to demonstrate his vigor and acumen to a skeptical public, he has traveled less often and held fewer public events at the White House, opting instead for closed-door meetings with his team. Staying out of the limelight has also been a strategic move aimed at giving Harris space in the nascent weeks of her campaign, sources said. “Everyone’s been talking about how she needs to define herself. Him taking a step aside and letting her be the center of attention is letting her define herself. She has the headlines, she’s communicating directly and capturing people,” a source familiar with the dynamic said. Since suspending his reelection campaign, Biden has largely stayed behind closed doors, receiving briefings, holding meetings and calling global counterparts amid significant tension in the Middle East. He has spent all or part of 14 of the last 24 days at one of his Delaware homes or at Camp David. Notably, he joined the vice president at Joint Base Andrews as they welcomed a historic release of prisoners from Russia, a key accomplishment he said underscored his work toward rebuilding alliances abroad. On Wednesday, Biden dropped by a White House conference for digital creators, where he showed he was willing to find some rueful humor in recent events. “You break through in ways that I think you’re going to change the entire dynamic of the way in which we communicate. And that’s why I invited you to the White House – because I’m looking for a job,” he said. CNN’s Michael Williams contributed to this report."
Vance and Walz set for vice presidential debate on October 1 | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:08 PM EDT, Thu August 15, 2024",2024-08-15T13:56:58.070Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/vance-walz-vice-presidential-debate/index.html,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and his Democratic counterpart, Tim Walz, are set to participate in a debate hosted by CBS on October 1 after the Ohio senator accepted the invitation Thursday, a day after the Minnesota governor did the same. Vance also accepted CNN’s invitation for a vice presidential debate this fall, but the Kamala Harris campaign declined a second onstage showdown between the two running mates. “The debate about debates is over. Donald Trump’s campaign accepted our proposal for three debates — two presidential and a vice presidential debate,” Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said in a statement Thursday. Harris and Trump have agreed to meet for a presidential debate on ABC on September 10. Trump has also agreed to debates on Fox News and NBC. Harris is open to an additional debate with the former president in October, a senior campaign adviser told CNN, but the details will not be settled until the first debate is in the books. Traditionally, there has only been one vice presidential debate in an election cycle, though Vance on Thursday called for holding “as many debates as we possibly can.” He responded on social media to the news that his Republican counterpart had committed to a sole debate by saying, “Tim Walz refuses to deploy!” (Vance has accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard to run for Congress.) A CNN spokesperson said Thursday that the network had invited both Vance and Walz for a fall debate. “We are always in communication with the campaigns around opportunities for the American public to hear from leading candidates for President and Vice President of the United States,” the spokesperson said. Vance, whom Trump named as his running mate last month, said earlier Thursday on social media that he was “looking forward” to debating Walz. “The American people deserve as many debates as possible, which is why President Trump has challenged Kamala to three of them already. Not only do I accept the CBS debate on October 1st, I accept the CNN debate on September 18th as well. I look forward to seeing you at both!” he wrote. Walz, who joined Harris on the Democratic ticket last week, accepted the CBS invitation Wednesday, writing on social media, “See you on October 1, JD.” CBS News offered the candidates two dates in September and two dates in October as options for a debate in New York City. Speaking to reporters Thursday after a campaign stop outside Pittsburgh, Vance called for more debates while accusing Walz and his ticket mate Harris of running “from every media interview.” “I think we ought to do as many debates as we possibly can,” he said in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. “President Trump has invited Kamala Harris to do three debates. She’s only agreed to one. Tim Walz, I guess we agreed to do a debate on October 1,” the senator said. “CNN wants to do a debate in mid-September. And I said, ‘Yes, absolutely,’ because the American people deserve it.” Asked by CNN about the rules for the vice presidential debates, Vance said that his team didn’t “really didn’t ask or require much.” “We just wanted to make sure that we had an opportunity to do a real exchange of views,” Vance said. “That was my only directive, and I told my staff, ‘Agree to whatever we have to agree to,’ because I think it’s important, again, to be able to stand before the American people and actually ask for their vote, not just pretend it’s going to be given to you.” In May, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Harris accepted an invitation from CBS to debate Trump’s future running mate on either July 23 or August 13. Trump said on his Truth Social platform at the time that his campaign had accepted an invitation for his future running mate to participate in a Fox News debate. Following Biden’s exit and Harris’ rapid ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket, Vance expressed disappointment that he wouldn’t get the chance to face off against Harris onstage. “I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s gonna get to debate her? I’m kind of pissed off about that, if I’m being honest with you,” Vance said at a hometown rally in Middletown, Ohio, last month."
Renewed energy in Trump-Harris race puts North Carolina back on battleground map | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Thu August 15, 2024",2024-08-15T10:00:02.318Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/north-carolina-battleground-state/index.html,"One month ago, battleground North Carolina was slipping away from Democrats. Now, with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, the state is competitive once again. “Folks were feeling so downtrodden and they just didn’t feel like we could win again,” said Gena Singleton, a longtime party activist and leader of the Burke County Democrats. “All of a sudden, we were on the upswing and people want to be a part of it.” But don’t just take Singleton’s word for it. Since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris last month, former President Donald Trump has made two trips to North Carolina, invested millions in new ads seeking to define Harris and feverishly worked to build up his campaign’s political organization across the state. “We’re going to beat her,” Trump told supporters in Asheville Wednesday during a blistering speech aimed at his rival. “They may then get a third candidate, who knows?” Few states have offered Democratic presidential hopefuls the number of disappointments the Tar Heel state has in recent cycles. It has been 16 years since Barack Obama delivered a North Carolina surprise in 2008 – the first and only time a Democratic candidate for the White House has carried the state in nearly five decades. The question now is whether Harris will be able to drive up turnout in urban and fast-growing suburban areas in the state, particularly around Wake County’s Raleigh and Mecklenburg County’s Charlotte. Of the 836,000 voters the state has added since 2012, more than a third are in those two counties, which continue to add new residents every day. Biden took both four years ago by about a 2-to-1 margin. “Whenever people say we’re not competitive as a Democratic state, that’s not true,” said Grayson Barrette, born and raised in western North Carolina, pointing to how Democrats have won seven of the last eight races for governor. “We’re the truest definition of a 50/50 state.” Even before Biden dropped out, Democrats viewed North Carolina as their best offensive opportunity. In 2020, Trump beat Biden by about 74,000 votes out of 5.4 million cast. The margin of victory of 1.3 points – less than half his spread four years earlier – was the narrowest of any state Trump won. “I think a lot of people are tired of him,” Barrette, who grew up in a family of Republicans but has become a loyal Democrat, said of Trump. “They really want somebody else and the Democrats are offering that this year. People are noticing and they’re willing to give Kamala Harris a chance.” Both campaigns have spent millions in advertising in recent weeks, as Harris and Trump have rushed to define the vice president. The Harris campaign has spent $2.5 million in ads, on top of $13.5 million in earlier spending by the Biden campaign. The Trump campaign has spent $4 million, including more than $1 million on a pair of ads targeting Harris on border policy. On the ground, Harris has opened more than 20 offices, with five more opening next week, according to her campaign. Harris will make her eighth visit to the state this year when she gives a speech on economic policy in Raleigh on Friday. “We’ve had a whole lot of new energy and a lot of excitement – it’s almost electric,” said Kathie Kline, who leads the Buncombe County Democratic Party. “Our volunteer inquiries increased – quadrupled – almost overnight, as soon as we got the news that Kamala Harris was going to be on the ticket.” Trump’s Asheville rally, also focused on economic policy, comes a few weeks after he visited Charlotte in one of his first events since Harris become the nominee. The former president’s campaign has opened more than a dozen offices since June, said North Carolina GOP spokesman Matt Mercer. Though Democrats hold a narrow advantage over Republicans in voter registrations, that lead has declined over the last two presidential cycles as the number of Republicans and unaffiliated voters has grown. As of August 10, the state has 2.4 million registered Democrats, nearly 2.3 million Republicans and 2.8 million unaffiliated voters. Mercer credited the party infrastructure with helping to reduce Democrats’ voter registration advantage by 500,000 people since the 2016 election. The “fundamentals” of running a statewide race in North Carolina haven’t changed, he said. Hours before the former president was set to arrive in Asheville Wednesday, crowds of Trump supporters filled the downtown streets. Harris may have injected new energy into the race, but vast stretches of western North Carolina are still squarely Trump country. “I’m going to work as hard as I can to get Donald Trump elected,” said Elise Negrin, who retired to North Carolina seven years ago from Long Island, New York. “We’re very excited.” Lines of Trump admirers stretched down the block in downtown Asheville, a deep-blue enclave in a deep-red swath of the state. “It’s hard to say what’s going to happen,” said Terri Garren, who drove about 30 minutes to attend her first Trump rally. “I just hope and pray that America wakes up.” As she waited on Wednesday, she said she was concerned about the economy and illegal immigration and believes the hype over Harris is overblown. “A lot of the love for that side will diminish,” Garren said. “Or it ought to.” She was standing near other Trump supporters who were also attending their first campaign event for the former president. They believe the race could be shaping up to be tighter than they imagined, so they wanted to show their support. “It is a battleground state. He barely won last time,” said Angela Rice, who drove about an hour to get to Asheville to see Trump. “We were not out in force in the last campaign. This is our first rally, so if it got us out, I’m hoping it got more people out.” Waiting for hours in line, she said, was the least she could do. “If he’s willing to take a bullet for me,” Rice said, “then I can come out and support him.

Harris to call for federal ban on price gouging to lower costs in first economic policy speech | CNN Politics,"Published 12:37 AM EDT, Thu August 15, 2024",2024-08-15T04:37:50.698Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/harris-price-gouging-ban-economic-policy-speech/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday is expected to call for a federal ban on price gouging to lower grocery prices and everyday costs for Americans in her first economic policy speech in Raleigh, North Carolina. The proposal is part of Harris’ efforts to prevent corporations in the food and grocery industries from hiking prices on consumers and is one component of a larger plan she will roll out to tackle high costs and inflation, according to a news release from the Harris campaign. As part of her first 100 days in office, the vice president’s campaign said she would implement a plan to keep costs down that includes authorizing the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and implement harsh penalties on companies that violate the federal ban, resources that can detect price-fixing, and more support for small businesses to potentially grow into competitors of large companies. Harris’ policy speech comes as the economy remains a critical issue for voters. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released last week found that Americans trust former President Donald Trump over Harris to handle the economy – but opinions were closely split, with 51% saying Trump would be better at handling the economy while 48% said Harris. Harris on Saturday backed the elimination of taxes on tips for hospitality and service workers, endorsing a policy first suggested by Trump. The proposal was one of the first notable policies the vice president has offered since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket last month. In her speech, Harris will draw a contrast between her and Trump’s economic agendas and argue that his plan would increase inflation and costs for middle-class families. She will also make the case that former president’s economic policy will impose hidden tariffs on everyday household items. Ahead of Trump’s economic speech on Wednesday in Asheville, North Carolina, the Harris campaign blasted the former president over his agenda. “No matter what he says, one thing is certain: Trump has no plan, no vision, and no meaningful interest in helping build up the middle class. We already know who Trump’(s) Project 2025 economic agenda is designed to benefit: Donald Trump and his wealthy friends,” the campaign said in a news release. The campaign also criticized Trump’s record during his presidency, arguing he “cost the country millions of jobs, left us on the brink of a recession, and gave massive handouts to billionaires and big corporations.” While prices still remain high for Americans, the Harris campaign touted the Consumer Price Index released on Wednesday, a key report measuring inflation that showed price hikes slowed more than expected in July and, for the first time in more than three years, landed below 3%. “Inflation is at its lowest in over three years and our economy is strong,” Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement. “Donald Trump’s agenda would take us backwards, giving tax handouts to the same big corporations that are price gouging Americans, while raising prices on the middle class by $2,500 and driving our economy into a recession.” During her remarks, the campaign said, Harris will highlight her “lifelong commitment to fighting for the middle class,” and make clear to voters that lowering costs will be a “day one priority.”"
"Analysis: Trump has the inklings of a plan to take on Harris, but he seems unable to implement it | CNN Politics","Published 12:00 AM EDT, Thu August 15, 2024",2024-08-15T04:00:02.594Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/trump-attacks-harris-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump showed up in battleground North Carolina for a big speech on the economy – and one of his unhinged rallies broke out. But amid the insults, trash talk, rage and lies, the former president blundered into the thing he’d been seeking for days: a strategy to take on Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president took the stage Wednesday with Republican commentators pining for signs that he’d stabilized after more than three weeks of fury and disorientation after President Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 race. Anyone hoping for an elusive Trump pivot would have been disappointed, as they almost always are, as he branded Harris “crazy” and “not smart,” while lampooning her laugh with sexist attacks and turning up the heat of his immigration demagoguery. Trump’s still uncontrolled bitterness that he’s no longer running against Biden stole the headlines from a speech that his campaign billed as a serious exercise devoted to the economy – the issue that voters care about most. But his remarks, at least the scripted version of them, offered the first signs that the Trump campaign is beginning to settle on a coherent, albeit extreme and divisive, plan to react to a new general election foe. The event, therefore, offered a preview of how the race to Election Day will unfold after the Democratic National Convention next week. The new approach, if Trump ever musters the discipline to implement it in a concentrated way, is deeply personal and designed to destroy the idea that Harris, just the second woman to head a major party presidential ticket, is competent to serve. It involves blaming her for the scourge of inflation and high grocery prices that haunted Biden’s administration, under the new title of “Kamalanomics.” With Harris expected to lay out her own economic plan on Friday, Trump’s team also wants to frustrate any effort by the vice president to bill her candidacy as a fresh start for economic policy. Trump also stepped up efforts to paint Harris as an extreme liberal – a strategy that has sometimes worked for Republican presidential campaigns in the past – at a time when conservative media is making comparisons between her and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Trump is also portraying Harris as a flip flopper who backed away from past positions on energy and health care but who would return to what he says is her radical past if elected. It’s an attempt to shatter public trust in the new Democratic nominee and builds on his previous questioning of her identifying as a Black woman, as well as a South Asian American. In the words of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, Harris is a “chameleon” who changes her politics and racial identify to suit her quest for power. The former president is also doubling down on the politics of fear, conjuring what he claims are catastrophes at home and abroad that would unfold if Harris were president – from World War III to a Great Depression. Mixing in his dystopian vision on immigration and crime, Trump is tapping into insecurity among Americans struggling to afford a decent lifestyle and who may be alarmed that US enemies like China and Russia are on the march. But the question for Trump as Harris surges is how much he’s already hurt himself with his tantrums and false claims that Biden’s replacement on the Democratic ticket represents some kind of coup. New polls are showing just how dramatically Harris has transformed the election. The vice president has uncorked an explosion of enthusiasm in a party that was demoralized just three weeks ago. And she’s repairing the holes in the Democratic coalition that threatened to doom Biden’s second term hopes among minority and young voters especially. Trump’s approach, showcasing his volcanic temperament and vicious personal style, seems a strange way to win over the suburban, female and moderate voters in battleground states who have become even more critical to the result in November now that Harris has returned the race to an effective tie. The nastiness of Trump’s attacks may come across as deeply offensive to some female voters. For instance, Trump on Wednesday again mocked Harris’ laugh – using it to suggest that she is unfit for the presidency. “What happened to her laugh? I haven’t heard that laugh in about a week,” he said. “That’s why they keep her off the stage,” he added, calling her laugh that “of a crazy person” and “career-threatening.” And for most of Trump’s speech on Wednesday, he appeared to still be playing to the base voters who adore him rather than trying to appeal to a more centrist audience. Indeed, he even mocked the idea of giving a serious speech — perhaps annoyed by Republican former office holders – like former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Trump’s erstwhile primary foe, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who pleaded with him to focus. “This is a little different day, this isn’t a rally,” Trump told his crowd. “They wanted to do a speech on the economy so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today.” Even though his frequent digressions defused the impact of any clear attack on Harris, Trump’s Wednesday remarks represented his most expansive attempt yet to try to neutralize her threat. And they are likely to be quickly picked up by his conservative media boosters as the anti-Harris campaign accelerates. — Trump gave notice that he intends to diminish Harris’ achievements, intellect and character. “She’s not a brilliant person. She’s not a smart person. She is not very smart, but it is crazy, isn’t it? Isn’t it crazy? She was so disrespected just a few weeks ago, and now it’s like Kamala, Kamala!” he said. — The former president is also targeting Harris as an extreme left-winger somehow alien to the politics of most Americans. “On November 6, she will be a San Francisco liberal again, destroying everything in sight,” he said. — Trump is seeking to close off any attempt by Harris to distinguish herself from the policies of the Biden administration. “Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority. But day one for Kamala was three-and-a-half years ago. Why hasn’t she done it?” he said.  “By the way, they are a team — she is trying to throw him overboard … no, no, they are a team.” — Allied to this effort is an attempt to saddle Harris with direct blame for the economic struggles of many working Americans. “Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris (and) crooked Joe than you were during the Trump administration? Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe?” Trump said. And returning to personal attacks, Trump promised not to “let this incompetent socialist lunatic keep breaking our economy for four more years.” — The campaign is arguing Harris will return to her previous policies after disavowing them, for instance, by banning fracking or by seeking a single-payer health care system. “For every position the fake new Kamala takes … the real Kamala said the exact opposite,” Trump claimed. — Republicans have been falsely branding Harris a “border czar” ever since she was tapped by Biden to work to tackle some of the social and financial conditions in Central American nations that form the root causes of migration. This will be a centerpiece of the new bid to take down the Democratic nominee. “The migrants that Harris let in are raping our women and hurting our children and now Kamala wants to let them pillage Social Security,” Trump claimed baselessly. The former president seemed far more interested in passages of the speech that insulted his opponent than the details of his own economic policy. But in laying out his plans for tax cuts, massive tariffs and slashing regulations, he made himself an easy target for the Harris campaign. “Trump has no plan, no vision, and no meaningful interest in helping build up the middle class,” the campaign said in a statement. It also laid out a contrast of what it said were two “very different” economic agendas that voters will chose between in November: “One that builds up the middle class, versus one that helps billionaires and big corporations at working families’ expense.” Many Republicans believe that voter dismay over high prices in recent years gives Trump a priceless chance to reclaim the presidency. But his antics on Wednesday suggest that he’s fully capable of squandering the opening."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris is attempting to do something Democratic presidential hopefuls haven’t done in 16 years, win North Carolina. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explains why the state has seen an influx of campaign focus from both parties. A spokesperson for Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance is pushing back on the implications of a clip circulating online from an interview the Ohio Republican did in 2020 where he appeared to respond affirmatively to a podcast host saying the “purpose of a postmenopausal female” is to help raise children.  Vance’s own story of being raised by his grandmother amid his mother’s struggles with addiction is central to his best-selling 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” as well as his campaign trail rhetoric. Vance spoke of his new experience living within a multigenerational family structure in an April 2020 podcast episode hosted by Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital, an investment firm founded by close Vance ally Peter Thiel. Vance emphasized the impact of Usha’s parents being present in their family’s life, saying it makes his son a “much better human being to have exposure” to his loving grandparents, adding “the evidence on this, by the way is like, super clear.” Weinstein then cut in to say, “that’s the whole purpose of the post menopausal,” to which Vance could be heard saying “yes,” before Weinstein ended the sentence saying, “female, in theory.” Vance did not respond further before the host asked a different question. Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk accused the media of “dishonestly putting words in JD’s mouth” as a clip of the 2020 exchange has circulated on X.  Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, an Air Force veteran who served with Gov. Tim Walz in Congress, on Wednesday called the vice presidential candidate “one of the strongest champions for veterans benefits” and defended him against GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s attacks. Vance claimed Walz misrepresented his military record and evaded an overseas deployment. On Wednesday, Lieu pointed out that the military has to approve retirement and argued that the only response to Walz’s military service is saying “Thank you.” Lieu, who served on active duty and in the reserve for the Air Force, told CNN that Walz is the “best asset” to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and that Walz will “definitely” address veterans’ issues during his speech to the Democratic National Convention next week. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign reached out to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to arrange a meeting about a possible role in her administration if he drops out of the race and endorses her, a Kennedy campaign official and a Democratic official told CNN. The Washington Post first reported the outreach. The approach from Kennedy’s team occurred last week, and no meeting between the two candidates materialized, the Kennedy campaign official told CNN. The effort to meet comes weeks after Kennedy and Trump met in person during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the two discussed a potential role for Kennedy in the Trump’s administration in exchange for an endorsement. Kennedy campaign staff also attempted to reach out to intermediaries for Ron Klain, former White House chief of staff for President Biden, but those efforts were fruitless, the Kennedy campaign official said. While Kennedy continues to make progress on ballot access, arrange campaign events and make media appearances, the Kennedy campaign official told CNN he remains open to dropping out of the race if he believes he can serve the country another way. Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN that Kennedy “is willing to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the possibility of a unity government.” CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. Democrats have strongly combatted Kennedy’s campaign since the beginning of the year through ads labeling Kennedy a “spoiler” and highlighting his ties to GOP megadonor Timothy Mellon, who has contributed to an outside group backing Kennedy and a separate group backing Trump. The Democratic National Committee and a super PAC ran by Democratic allies have filed objections to Kennedy’s ballot access in several states. “No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement,” DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said in a statement to CNN.   President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks “on the progress they are making to lower costs for the American people” on Thursday, according to the White House. The event, at Prince George’s County Community College in Maryland, will be their first public joint appearance since Biden withdrew from the presidential race last month. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance would not yet commit to debating his Democratic opponent Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on October 1, saying he wants to go over the debate’s rules and setup first.  “Look Laura, we want to actually look at the debates, look at the moderators, talk about the rules a little bit,” he told Fox News’ host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday night. CBS News on Wednesday offered Walz and Vance two dates in September and two dates in October. Walz responded to the invitation on social media, writing, “See you on October 1, JD.” Vance told Fox News that while he is “certainly going to debate Tim Walz,” because his team only got notice from CBS hours ago, “we’re going to talk to them and figure out when we can debate.”  He said that he wants to do more than one debate and suggested that he wants to face off against Walz earlier than October. Vance said that while he “strongly” suspects he’ll be at the October 1 debate, he argued against a debate without an audience. The Donald Trump-Joe Biden debate did not have a live audience. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would keep the Affordable Care Act in place “unless we can do something much better.” Trump, who previously promised to repeal Obamacare and sought to weaken it while in office, told his supporters that he’ll push forward a new healthcare policy proposal if it means “less expensive and better health care for you.” “(Vice President Kamala Harris) goes around saying, ‘Oh, he’s going to get rid of the health-’ No, no, I’m going to keep it unless we can come up with something that’s better for you and less expensive for you. Otherwise, we’re not doing it,” he said.  Campaigning for a second term, Trump has more recently made promises to improve the ACA but has not elaborated on how he’d accomplish that. As the economic policy positions of the Harris-Walz ticket start to come into view, they’re increasingly converging with those of her Republican opponents: Donald Trump and JD Vance.  Over the weekend, Vance told CBS News he would support expanding the Child Tax Credit to $5,000 per child, while acknowledging a difficult road to secure support on Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans earlier this month blocked an expansion of the child tax credit.  Harris’ allies say she continues to support a larger child tax credit, which earlier this year she suggested should return to the amount temporary established under the American Rescue Plan of up to $3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 for children between 6 and 17. The Harris campaign declined to say where her position on the CTC would eventually land.  Two sources close to Harris suggested that, while she would lay out a set of new economic proposals during her remarks on Friday, they would be “additive” to what the Biden administration has done thus far, not wholesale revisions of those policies. But with Harris holding more centrist views than the party’s left flank that drove much of the early Biden agenda, the sources suggested that seemingly proposals to lower costs through government programs could be coupled with tax cuts elsewhere.  To be sure, Harris over the weekend proposed eliminating tips on wages during a rally in Las Vegas, where one-third of workers are employed by the leisure and hospitality industry. That policy was first floated by Trump during a rally in the same location back in June, marking the second time in a week that the opposing political parties have found themselves on common policy footing.  Former President Donald Trump delivered a Wednesday speech that was laden with false claims he has made before. One of them was about insulin prices for seniors. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, claimed in the North Carolina address that Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential election, and President Joe Biden are lying when they tout their success in bringing insulin prices for Medicare recipients down to $35 per month (per prescription). Trump claimed that they are taking credit for his own work. Trump could fairly say he played a role in lowering insulin costs and that Biden and Harris do not deserve sole credit. The Biden-era federal government has acknowledged that Biden’s mandatory $35 monthly cap “closely aligns with” the voluntary $35 monthly cap in the Trump-created program that was announced in 2020 and launched in the final month of the Trump presidency in 2021. Read more about other false claims made Wednesday by the former president The 2020 presidential election took days to be decided, but it’s possible that 2024 could take even longer, thanks to a specific voting process used in two states that aren’t typically the focus of national political campaigns. Maine and Alaska each use ranked choice voting to determine the winners of their electoral votes for president, and with independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the ballot in Maine and aiming to qualify for access in Alaska, it’s more likely that this process will come into play. Under the system, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If someone wins a majority of first-choice votes, that candidate is elected. But if not, voters’ other choices are used to determine a winner. First, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. The votes that had gone to that candidate are then redistributed to the second choices listed on those voters’ ballots. The process continues until a winner with majority support emerges. Advocates for ranked choice voting argue that the process minimizes the issue of “spoiler” candidates by allowing voters to support both the candidate they like best and a candidate more likely to win. But one of the downsides of the system is that it can take some time to get a final result. In Maine, for example, if no candidate wins a majority on election night, election officials must gather vote data from across the entire state and deliver it a central location in the state capital, where the actual tabulation takes place. That process could take more than a week, the Maine secretary of state’s office told CNN in 2020. Read more about how ranked choice voting works Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz again attacked former President Donald Trump at a fundraiser in Denver on Wednesday for promoting a false conspiracy theory that images of the crowd sizes at a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan last week were created by artificial intelligence, according to a pool report.  Walz spoke at a fundraiser for Harris hosted by software entrepreneur Tim Gill and again talked about the new experience of addressing large crowds at rallies since joining the ticket.  The comment echoes a similar remark Walz made at a fundraiser in Newport Beach, California, on Tuesday.  Walz is attending another fundraiser in Boston this evening, part of a cross-country swing this week that will take him to Rhode Island and New York tomorrow. Vice President Kamala Harris stopped by Howard University in Washington, DC, on Monday, a source familiar with the vice president’s schedule told CNN on Wednesday. She welcomed new students to her alma mater ahead of the fall semester, according to a student in attendance.  Harris has remained largely out of sight this week. She’s been receiving briefings and conducting internal meetings with staff this week behind closed doors, per her official office. On Monday, she recorded video remarks for the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees’ (AFSCME) 46th International Convention.  Harris spoke outside the university’s Cramton Auditorium while on campus, according to a brief video shared with CNN. She resumes a public schedule on Thursday when she’s set to share the stage with President Joe Biden in Prince George’s County to discuss the administration’s efforts to lower costs — the first public joint event the two will hold since Biden withdrew from the presidential race last month. CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign, the vice president’s office and Howard University for additional comment. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed an appeal on Wednesday seeking to reverse a New York court decision that denied his ballot access petition in the state earlier this week. Kennedy’s lawyers filed the appeal after a judge ruled he used a “sham” address when listing a New York residence on his petition despite living in California. The ruling, if it stands, could have implications for Kennedy’s ballot access in other states where he faces challenges concerning the listing of his New York residency on the petition, including in battleground Pennsylvania. In a statement, Kennedy’s senior ballot access counsel Paul Rossi argued New York’s residency requirements for ballot access applications were wrongly applied to block Kennedy from the ballot. Clear Choice, the group behind the challenge to his New York petition, said Kennedy didn’t understand the facts of the case. “Based on Kennedy’s own testimony and evidence, he does not reside, has never resided, and will not reside in the future at 84 Croton Lake Road in Katonah,” said Pete Kavanaugh, the founder of Clear Choice. “No appeal will change those facts.” This post was updated with a statement from Clear Choice. More than three weeks after dropping out of the 2024 race, President Joe Biden on Wednesday joked about “looking for a job” at an event at the White House where he was addressing digital creators. The conference comes as Biden’s campaign team built a significant digital ground game that failed to gain traction under his candidacy but has significantly taken off under Kamala Harris’ campaign with the same staff. The strategy for both was to meet viewers where they are — including on social media, where many young people get their news.  Biden recognized the role that creators are playing in the media ecosystem. “I have a bunch of grandchildren, and with all due respect, they don’t read the same newspapers and watch the same television I do. They listen to all of you. I want to welcome you here to the White House — and I’m glad you’re here,” he said, holding a microphone in his hand as he walked around the stage.  “You are the source of news, and more people want to go into your business than the other these days. When I retire, where do you think I’m going? I got contacts,” he joked.  Vice presidential nominee JD Vance said that Donald Trump has “earned the right” to run the campaign he desires, in response to a question from CNN about whether he agrees with those urging the former president to focus less on personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris and more on policy and messaging. “To the people who say that Donald Trump should do something different, they had an opportunity to make Donald Trump do something different by challenging him over three separate primaries, every single one of which he won. So, I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to run the campaign that he wants to run,” Vance said. This comes as CNN reported some allies have privately expressed serious concerns about the former president’s recent inability to stay on message. But Vance argued that he and Trump are making the case against Harris on policy. Vance’s own attacks on Harris today largely focused on policy and criticizing her ascension to becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, after President Joe Biden dropped out, as well as her failure to take questions from the media. “Everything about her campaign is fake, a fake joy that comes from being promoted to a new position instead of using the position you already have to do your job and make the lives of the citizens of this country better,” Vance said. If there’s one thing both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris can agree on, it’s that the US housing market is dealing with an affordability crisis. The former president at a rally on Wednesday said that the “colossal influx of migrants is driving rent absolutely through the roof.” More migrants are not driving rents higher. But it is true that renters have been increasingly burdened over the past year, according to a recent report from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. The situation, of course, varies by location. In markets where apartment construction isn’t keeping up with demand, and there’s already a shortage of available units, such as New York City and Honolulu, apartments remain out of reach for many. However, in markets where apartment construction is picking up, such as in the Tampa Bay region over the past year, rents have actually been falling. And high interest rates have further constrained buyers, with elevated mortgage rates potentially adding hundreds of dollars a month to the costs of purchasing and keeping a home. The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office said it has identified the man who allegedly broke into Donald Trump’s Virginia campaign office earlier this week as Toby Shane Kessler, according to a news release from the sheriff’s office.   Shortly after 8 p.m. ET, Kessler, 39, spent a “brief period of time” in the office, the release said, and did not leave anything behind when he left. Officers still have not yet determined if he took anything with him.  Investigators say Kessler has a history of criminal behavior and has “no fixed address.” They say he has a California driver’s license. Kessler “appears to have been in the Washington metropolitan area at least since 2018,” according to the release. The sheriff’s office says it is working with other law enforcement agencies to find Kessler. Earlier this week, the sheriff’s office said it was called Sunday for a burglary at the office, which is being leased by the Trump campaign and operates as the headquarters of the Virginia 10th District Republican Committee.  Investigators released stills of surveillance video that show the suspect, now identified as Kessler, inside the campaign office wearing dark clothing, a dark cap and a backpack. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, blamed the ongoing struggles of Americans on Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday as the presumptive Democratic nominee prepares to rollout an economic policy agenda later this week. During a Q&A with press after his remarks to Michigan voters, Vance was asked about a report this morning showing a key inflation indicator, the Consumer Price Index, being at its lowest rate in more than three years. After the reporter asked the question, the crowd responded with jeers, a reaction that Vance noted “says it all.” Pushing back on Harris’s insistence that she’ll begin to tackle affordability issues on the first day of her presidency, Vance argued Harris has been “well under control of government policy for three and a half years,” while President Biden has been “at home.” “She says she wants to tackle the affordability crisis on day one. And then, on the other hand, she’ll say, well, we’ve already got inflation under control. Well, which is it, Kamala?” he asked. Harris’s campaign on Wednesday touted the CPI report as an indicator that “our economy is strong.” Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will combat inflation by “terminating Kamala’s green new scam,” referencing the climate change proposal called the Green New Deal. He said he will use the unspent funds on infrastructure and the government. The former president then went on to tout his policies when he was in office. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in a social media post he has agreed to participate in a vice presidential debate with his Republican counterpart Ohio Sen. JD Vance on CBS News on October 1. Walz responded to a social media post from CBS News detailing its invitation to both campaigns for a vice-presidential debate with two dates in September and two dates in October as options.  In response, Walz wrote, “See you on October 1, JD.” Walz’s campaign later confirmed that he accepted the invitation. A campaign official said Walz is looking forward to debating Vance “if he shows up.” Vance did not answer questions yelled from reporters on if he has accepted an invitation from CBS for its vice presidential debate.  CNN is reaching out to the Trump-Vance campaign. This post has been updated with details from Walz’s campaign. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday attacked Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the rollout of her economic proposal later this week, arguing that she would ensure the economy would get worse. He suggested that Harris’s economy proposal would be a “copy of my plan,” pointing to her also backing the elimination of taxes on tips for service workers – a policy proposal he announced back in June.  “When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan this week, probably will be a copy of my plan, because basically that’s what she does,” he said. He accused Harris of not tackling inflation and bringing down prices while serving as vice president.  “Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a ‘Day One’ priority. Think of it, for her, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. Why hasn’t she done it?” he said. Former President Donald Trump said his administration would cut energy and electricity prices by “at least half.” He said if he is elected, he expected that it will take up to a maximum of 18 months. “And if it doesn’t work out, you’ll say, ‘Oh well, I voted for him, I still got them down a lot,’” Trump said. The former president is speaking at an event about his economic policy in North Carolina. He has focused much of his remarks on the rising costs of goods and the effects of inflation, something many Americans have said is important to them in this election. He also railed against clean energy, like wind energy, and vowed to push America back to fossil fuels and amp up drilling — a common rallying cry at his events. Trump and his allies have falsely claimed before that more drilling would bring the cost of gas and other goods down. Former President Donald Trump criticized what he called Vice President Kamala Harris’ “fake economic plans.” He went on to ask the crowd: “What happened to her laugh? I haven’t heard that laugh in about a week.” “That’s why they keep her off the stage,” he said, calling Harris’ laugh that “of a crazy person” and saying that it is “career-threatening.” “That’s the laugh of a person with some big problems,” Trump said. He also attacked Harris as unintelligent, saying it’s the reason why she hasn’t sat for any interviews recently or held a news conference.  In a speech that was meant to focus on the economy, Trump went off topic several times, including attacking Harris’ running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for signing a bill that mandates school districts and charter schools provide free menstrual products in all restrooms for students grades 4-12. “Kamala Harris wants to be in charge of the entire US economy but neither she nor her running mate — Isn’t he a beauty, isn’t he? He signed a bill. He wants tampons in boys’ bathrooms. I don’t think so,” Trump said. This post has been updated with additional remarks from Trump. In his economic pitch to Americans on Wednesday, former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump said he would “rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again,” if he’s elected for a second term. If only it were that easy. Consumer price inflation, or the rate of change in prices, is expected of a healthy, growing economy. The Federal Reserve, which is tasked with stabilizing prices, targets inflation to be at a 2% annual rate over the long term. That’s seen as a manageable pace of price increases that nudges people to spend their money. On the other hand, if prices are declining outright, known as deflation, then that can be disastrous because it disincentivizes people from spending, which makes up the vast majority of the US economy. If you expect prices to drop in the future, why spend now when you can spend less in the coming months? Deflation usually occurs during a steep economic downturn, which is what happened for a few months during the Great Recession. It’s a symptom of an ailing economy. At a rally Wednesday in North Carolina, former President Donald Trump said car insurance prices were going through the roof. He’s right. Car insurance rates are up 18.6% for the 12 months ended in July, according to Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday. That marked the third-largest jump in prices over the past year across all goods and categories that CPI tracks. Still, that’s an improvement from March, when car insurance rates were up 22.2% annually. The last time car insurance rates rose that much on an annual basis was in 1976. However, with cars themselves, consumers are paying lower prices. That means price increases didn’t just slow down, car prices actually dropped. Used car prices fell by 10.9% over the past year, marking the third-largest drop in prices across all goods and categories that the CPI tracks. Rental and new cars also got cheaper, with prices falling by 6.2% and 4.4%, respectively. Former President Donald Trump claimed that Americans would be better off financially if he is elected to another term. Trump was speaking at an event centered around the economy in Asheville, North Carolina on Wednesday. The former president did not offer any specific examples of policies that would achieve these claims. His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is expected to unveil her economic plan on Friday. A new Pew Research Center poll finds no clear leader nationally in the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, amid “clear signs that Harris has energized Democratic voters.” In Pew’s latest poll, 46% of registered voters support Harris, 45% support Trump, and 7% support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a shift from Pew’s July polling, when Trump held a 4-point edge over President Joe Biden. Similarly sized majorities of both Harris supporters and Trump supporters now say they’re strong backers of their chosen candidate (64% of Trump supporters and 62% of Harris supporters say this). In July there was more of a gap: just 43% of Biden supporters said they supported their chosen candidate strongly, compared with 63% of Trump supporters. The poll finds most of Harris’ gains coming at the expense of Kennedy. The vast majority of Biden’s former supporters now support Harris (97%) and Trump also has retained most of his July supporters (95%). But just 39% of voters who supported Kennedy in July still say they’re backing him, Pew finds, with 39% now backing Harris, and 20% now backing Trump. The poll did not test a head-to-head version of the race without Kennedy included. Pew finds that Harris has improved on Biden’s performance with voters in a number of key subgroups, with Trump’s support remaining largely stable since July: The Pew Research Center poll surveyed 7,569 registered voters on Aug. 5-11, using a nationally representative online panel. Results from the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/- 1.4 percentage points. Vice President Kamala Harris has a narrow advantage over former president Donald Trump among likely voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, according to a Quinnipiac University poll of the state’s presidential race released Wednesday. In a head-to-head matchup, Harris takes 50% to Trump’s 47% among likely voters. When additional candidates are included, Harris takes 48% to Trump’s 45%, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. taking 4%. Other recent polling of the state has similarly shown a close race. In the Quinnipiac poll, 70% of Trump supporters and 66% of Harris supporters say they’re “very enthusiastic” about supporting their chosen candidate. Likely voters pick the economy (32%) and preserving democracy in the US (25%) as their top issues, followed by immigration at 10%. The poll also tests the upcoming US Senate race, finding Democratic Sen. Bob Casey currently leading Republican David McCormick, 52% to 44%, among likely voters. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will roll through Pennsylvania on a bus tour Sunday, just days before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. More about the poll: Quinnipiac survey 1,738 likely voters in Pennsylvania on Aug. 8-12, using live interviewers to call both landlines and cell phones. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of +/- 2.4 percentage points. Kamala Harris may be done with Medicare for All, but Medicare for All — with a new nudge from former President Donald Trump — isn’t done with her. The Trump campaign on Wednesday attacked Harris over her past support of a single-payer, government-run health care system long championed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Medicare for All gained broad support among progressive Democrats, especially those with eyes on the White House, before and during the early stages of the party’s 2020 presidential primary. Harris’ team said recently that she no longer backs the plan, which fell out of vogue with Democrats as Joe Biden surged to the nomination four years ago as one of the few candidates to vocally oppose it. Instead, he campaigned on improving and expanding the Affordable Care Act, which he has focused on during his term and Harris has supported as his vice president. But Harris has not addressed the question herself, touting the Biden administration’s record while trying to avoid any relitigation of the years-old fight, and putting out word now only through campaign aides. Now, Trump is reviving the debate as he seeks to paint Harris as both a radical liberal and a flip flopper. The Trump camp’s focus on Medicare for All is emerging as the centerpiece of a wider strategy to use Harris’ 2020 primary positions against her now, less than 90 days before the general election. Read more about Harris’ previous stance on Medicare for All. The Harris campaign blasted former President Donald Trump’s economic agenda ahead of his visit to Asheville, North Carolina, where he is expected to speak on the economy. The campaign criticized Trump’s record as president, arguing he “cost the country millions of jobs, left us on the brink of a recession, and gave massive handouts to billionaires and big corporations.” The campaign stressed that voters have a choice between two “very different” economic agendas in November: Harris is expected to roll out her economic policy agenda on Friday in Raleigh. She said it would be focused on bringing down costs and strengthening the economy. Remember: The economy remains a critical issue for voters. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released last week found that Americans trust Trump over Harris to handle the economy – but it is closely split. 51% say Trump would be better at handling the economy, while 48% favor Harris on the issue. Some of those most eager to quiet Donald Trump are those who want to him back in the Oval Office. Appearing dazed and flustered by an unfamiliar and fast-changing political landscape, Trump in response has unleashed a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even close allies and donors acknowledge as unproductive. Some have privately expressed serious concerns that the former president’s recent inability to stay on message has wasted an early opportunity to blunt the momentum of his new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. For Trump, staying on message has rarely been easy, as illustrated by the former president’s return to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, where he was once a towering figure. Ahead of his Monday interview with Elon Musk, Trump’s account posted for the first time in a year, featuring a series of slickly edited videos that articulated the case for another Trump presidency in a way that regularly eludes the candidate himself. One post asked, “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” That question strikes at the heart of his campaign’s message to voters – but Trump failed to pose it until near the end of his two-hour conversation with Musk, during which he aired familiar grievances about the 2020 election, commented on Harris’ beauty on Time Magazine’s latest cover, remained fixated on President Joe Biden and, according to a CNN tally, told at least 20 falsehoods. Read more about the frustrations some Trump allies here. A group of Republican state attorneys general sued the Biden administration Tuesday over a federal effort to expand access to voter registration.  The lawsuit targets an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in March 2021 that directed the heads of all federal agencies to submit proposals for their respective agencies to promote voter registration and participation through various points of contact with the public. The president issued the order as GOP-led statehouses were pushing voter suppression legislation in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The nine Republican attorneys general who filed the lawsuit in federal court argue that Biden exceeded his authority when he issued the directive, which they also say violates the US Constitution and “undermines the voter registration systems set up by the States.” The states also claim that the executive order was “motivated by a partisan desire to unfairly increase the Democrat vote.” They argue that the executive order and its implementation have caused them “pocketbook injuries, procedural harms, and harms to the States’ sovereign interests” by allegedly trampling on their own “ability to regulate voter registration.”  The lawsuit points to some of the different agencies that have implemented the directive, including the Treasury Department, which had planned to “include information about registration and voter participation in its direct deposit campaigns for Americans who receive Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and other federal benefit payments,” according to a 2021 White House fact sheet.  The states that brought the lawsuit are Montana, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Carolina. The case has been assigned to US District Judge Daniel D. Crabtree, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the lawsuit. Read more about this lawsuit and next steps here. This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access. Here are the states with abortion measures: Read more about the ballot measures. The Harris campaign is touting the Consumer Price Index released on Wednesday, a key report measuring inflation that showed price hikes slowed more than expected in July, landing below 3% for the first time in more than three years.  Harris is expected to deliver her economic policy rollout on Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina. Costello said the vice president will make “building up the middle class the defining goal of her presidency.” “She will lower costs by taking on greedy corporations that are overcharging consumers, ban hidden fees, and cap unfair rent increases and prescription drug costs,” he added. The speaker lineup for next week’s Democratic National Convention is coming into sharper focus as organizers finalize their plans.  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is expected to speak during prime time on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the plans, the same evening as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the vice presidential nominee. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is expected to speak on Tuesday evening. Both were under consideration to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, though they were ultimately passed over for Walz. CNN has previously reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will each speak during the proceedings. President Joe Biden will deliver his address on Monday. The Trump campaign has announced that former President Donald Trump will hold a news conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday, August 15 at 4:40 p.m. ET. Last week, Trump held his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential pick. The former president repeatedly slammed his opponent and made a string of false and often confusing claims about her running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is poised to return to his Nebraska roots on Saturday to headline a Democratic campaign event, two people familiar with the visit tell CNN, shining a light on the fight for the state’s critical swing electoral vote.  Walz, a Nebraska native who moved to Minnesota nearly three decades ago, is scheduled to visit Omaha at a weekend rally. It marks the first time Walz has visited the state since joining Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket. Nebraska is one of two states – along with Maine – that divide Electoral College votes by congressional district, rather than statewide, winner-take-all rules. President Joe Biden carried the electoral vote from the state’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020. Former President Donald Trump has been pushing Nebraska Republicans to change the state’s election law. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, has said he was open to calling a special legislative session dedicated to making his state’s presidential contest a winner-take-all affair, all but assuring that Trump would collect the full lot of electoral votes. But Pillen has said he would do so only “when there is sufficient support in the legislature to pass it.” Nebraska Republican officials have not closed the door to trying to change the rules this year, even with less than three months remaining until Election Day. The Nebraska Examiner was first to report the Walz visit to Omaha. Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW), blasted former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk for threatening to intimidate workers who go on strike during their conversation on the social media platform X on Monday night. The UAW, which recently endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, filed separate charges against Trump and Musk to the National Labor Relations Board after their discussion on X. During the interview, the pair discussed a potential role for Musk in Trump’s administration should he get reelected. Trump called Musk “the cutter,” and praised Musk for his anti-union stances. “I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike – I won’t mention the name of the company – but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. Every one of you is gone,” Trump said. Musk could be heard laughing and replying “yeah.” Fain noted that “it is federal law that workers have a right to strike and you cannot be fired for striking.” He also called Trump’s campaign “completely weird” and asked, “Who takes pride in firing workers?” He said Trump “was a disaster for working class people” while president. Fain said Harris and her running mate, Gov, Tim Walz, would “stand up for working class people.” CNN’s David Goldman contributed reporting to this post. The Harris-Walz campaign reiterated Kamala Harris’ earlier commitment to participate in an interview before the end of August, amid continuing attacks from the Trump campaign and their allies for not participating in interviews since becoming the Democratic standard bearer.  “She’s the vice president,” Michael Tyler, Harris-Walz campaign communications director, told CNN. “She can handle the questions.” “You hear her take questions as she’s out on the stump, and she said last week, we’re going to be having a sit down interview here before the end of the month,” said Tyler, who argued that that Harris has spent her time “communicating directly with the voters” at campaign events instead of in the media.  He reiterated that reporters would have the opportunity to “have a deep dive conversation” with the vice president “by the end of the month and during the rest of the campaign.” When asked whether Harris would commit to a press conference by the end of the month in addition to the interview, Tyler said “we will commit to directly engage with the voters that are actually going to decide this election.” This comes as former President Donald Trump announced today that he will hold another news conference on Thursday. Two new polls released Wednesday find rising Democratic enthusiasm about this year’s presidential election, helping to close the partisan enthusiasm gap that existed earlier this year when the race was between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.  In a new Monmouth University poll, 85% of Democratic registered voters say they’re enthusiastic about the race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, up from just 46% who said in June that they were enthusiastic about a Trump-Biden rematch. GOP voters’ enthusiasm for the current matchup stands at 71%, unchanged from their feelings about the Biden-Trump contest in June. Just 8% of registered voters are now so-called “double haters” with negative impressions of both Trump and Harris, the poll finds – by contrast, 17% currently have negative views of both Trump and Biden. In a new AP-NORC poll, 63% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning adults say they’d be excited if Harris were elected president, compared with 57% of Republican-aligned adults who say the same about Trump. In March, just 40% of Democratic-aligned Americans said they would be excited about a Biden victory. The AP-NORC poll finds that, asked to compare the two candidates, more Americans see Harris than Trump as someone who’s committed to democracy (48% to 28%), disciplined (47% to 28%), honest (43% to 24%), has the right vision for the country (42% to 35%) and cares about people like them (42% to 30%), with closer divides over which candidate is more capable of handling a crisis (41% say Harris, 38% Trump) and who is better described as a strong leader (40% say Trump, 37% Harris). In the AP-NORC poll, Harris is trusted over Trump to handle abortion policy (51% say they trust her to do a better job of handling the issue, to 27% who say Trump), issues relating to race and racial equality (51% to 26%), and health care (46% to 31%), with Trump trusted over Harris to handle the economy (45% Trump to 38% Harris), immigration (46% to 36%) and the war in Gaza (36% to 31%). Americans are evenly split on whether Trump or Harris would better handle crime or the war in Ukraine. Recent polling has varied on voters’ relative assessments of Harris and Trump to handle the economy, although several show Harris making up some ground against Trump relative to Biden’s standing on the issue. Neither the Monmouth poll nor the AP-NORC poll directly tests a match-up between Harris and Trump. The Monmouth poll asks a series of separate questions about voters’ likelihood of voting for each candidate, which should not be combined or treated as a horserace question. The Muslim community leader who appeared alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at several events told CNN in a statement he does not have a “personal relationship” with Walz and explained previously sharing antisemitic content on Facebook by saying he sometimes shares links on social media “without fully looking at them.”  Asad Zaman, a Minnesota imam and executive director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, echoed the Harris campaign’s statement on the nature of the relationship between him and Walz in a series of answers to questions emailed to him by CNN.  When asked about previous social media posts in which he shared a neo-Nazi propaganda film and a Hamas news release, Zaman attributed sharing the posts to a tendency to “pass along social media items without fully looking at them.”  When asked about his opinions on the Harris-Walz campaign’s stance toward the Israel-Hamas war, Zaman said he wasn’t familiar with its views on the conflict but expressed solidarity for those experiencing “enormous human suffering.”  Some background: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a campaign event in 2018 praised Zaman as a “master teacher” and briefly touched on their shared history, according to video newly revealed by the Washington Examiner. In a statement to CNN, Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said that Walz and Zaman do not have a “personal relationship.” Donald Trump heads to North Carolina today for a campaign event and Kamala Harris will make a competing visit to the state on Friday, putting a spotlight on a presidential battleground that has been a top target for both parties this cycle.  Though North Carolina has voted Republican in 10 out of the last 11 presidential elections, Democrats have consistently run close there, and both parties are pouring resources into the state.  According to AdImpact data, the state has seen $25.8 million in ad spending so far, including TV and digital ads. Here’s how that breaks down: Much of it – $13.5 million – has come from the Biden campaign, as it made early messaging investments before Biden dropped out of the race. As of today, including that Biden spending, Democrats have outspent Republicans in North Carolina by about $18.8 million to $7 million. In addition, the Trump campaign has run about $4 million worth of advertising in North Carolina so far, while the Harris campaign has spent about $2.5 million there. A pro-Harris super PAC, FF PAC, has also contributed to the advertising flood, spending about $2.3 million, while MAGA Inc., a leading pro-Trump super PAC, has spent just over $500,000 in the state. And both parties have reserved tens of millions worth of airtime in the coming months as they prepare to contest the important battleground state. The Trump campaign on Wednesday attacked Vice President Kamala Harris for reversing her position on the progressive policy proposal “Medicare for All,” which she supported as a 2020 presidential candidate but is no longer backing today.  Some context: As a 2020 presidential candidate, Harris unveiled a “Medicare for All” plan that would have put the US on the path toward a government-backed health insurance system but stopped short of completely eliminating private insurance. The Harris campaign says the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for the ballot in Maine, a spokesperson for Maine’s Secretary of State told CNN on Wednesday. Remember: On Monday, the office of Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced they would consider a challenge to Kennedy’s petition from a Maine voter. But after the hearing was scheduled, the voter withdrew the objection, Bellow’s office announced yesterday. When asked for clarification on the status of Kennedy’s petition, a spokesperson for Bellows told CNN that Kennedy will appear on Maine’s ballot in November. Why this matters: By appearing on the ballot, Kennedy could complicate the dynamics over the race for Maine’s electoral votes, particularly the sole electoral vote awarded to the winner of Maine’s 2nd congressional district, a competitive district that Trump won in the 2020 election.  Including Maine, Kennedy has gained ballot access in 19 states. Earlier this week, a New York judge ruled that Kennedy’s ballot-access petition in the state was invalid, delivering the first major blow to the independent presidential candidate’s bid for nationwide access. In a statement following the decision Monday, Kennedy said he plans to appeal the ruling in federal court. In total, Kennedy is eligible to receive 236 electoral college votes.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, defended his military record during remarks in Los Angeles on Tuesday, saying he is “damn proud” of his service in the Army National Guard. Speaking to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union convention, Walz addressed attacks from Republicans, including GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance, who have claimed he misrepresented his military record and falsely suggested he evaded an overseas deployment. Some context: Walz’s defense of his record comes after Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign acknowledged Saturday he “misspoke” during a 2018 campaign event when he said he handled assault weapons “in war.” After the Harris campaign shared a video of the 2018 remarks last week, Vance, who served in the Marine Corps, accused Walz of “stolen valor.” In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, Vance defended his attacks on Walz by arguing he is criticizing Walz’s statements about his record, rather than his actions while serving. Local and federal law enforcement officials say Chicago is prepared to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention next week while ensuring the safety and security of attendees and residents alike.  When asked about the security lapse that led to the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last month, Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer said the department is learning all the time, but there is no comparison between the two events. “This is a whole-of-government approach we’ve been planning for this convention for well over a year. So, we can’t compare the two,” he said. Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling also noted the yearlong training officers have embarked on with federal, state, and county partners to ensure that the venue will be secure while promising that police resources will be present “in every single neighborhood.” “We will not deplete resources from our neighborhoods to simply put in the area where the Democratic National Convention is being held,” said Snelling. Snelling also emphasized the importance of allowing protesters the space and time to express their First Amendment rights but stopped short of saying there would be no arrests. Preventative measures including street closures and parking restrictions will be in place, especially near the United Center, where the convention will be held. Voters keep telling pollsters that their economic insecurities are the biggest issue in the 2024 election. So, it’s a knock on both parties that none of their candidates have yet found a decisive way to address those fears. But both nominees will make new attempts to convince Americans they can deliver prosperity in the next three days. Former President Donald Trump will try to make a case against Kamala Harris’ role in the Biden economy today in North Carolina. The vice president will chase his jet fumes down to the critical swing state on Friday, with the first major policy speech of her campaign, which aides say will provide answers on how she will lower prices. The US economy has recovered more strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic than many other developed nations. But for decades, many Americans have felt squeezed, and 21st-century presidents have all struggled to deal with the political consequences of inequality fostered by globalization. Trump, who found fertile political ground amid economic blight in 2016, has this year spent more time flinging insults, race-baiting, and whining about his personal grievances than rolling out detailed plans to help workers. His hyperbole — like a warning of a looming Great Depression – lacks seriousness. And the nostalgic revisionism of his economic management during his first term ignores the reality that his major initiative — a huge tax cut — did far more to benefit the wealthy than working Americans. President Joe Biden dedicated his domestic agenda to restoring economic fairness and sought to revive manufacturing and repair the country’s crumbling infrastructure. But his big spending plans helped fuel the inflation that has hurt so many Americans. And he often looked like he was chiding voters for not giving him credit for his legislative successes as they struggled through tough times. Read the full analysis. The Harris campaign is launching a $90 million paid media buy throughout key battleground states for the last three weeks of August aimed at sharpening the contrast with former President Donald Trump.  The campaign said the ads will lean into the vice president’s personal story, her career as a prosecutor in California, her commitment to standing up to powerful interests and contrast Trump’s “dangerous, extreme agenda” as they seek to court undecided voters. They believe running an aggressive paid media campaign over the course of the next few weeks will ensure their message will help cement the choice for battleground voters ahead of “Get Out the Vote” efforts starting in the fall. The ad buy will reach seven swing states and will expand the Harris’ team spending to smaller markets they have not yet reached, such as Marquette, Wisconsin, Alpena, Michigan and Erie, Pennsylvania.  Ads will be targeted on radio, digital platforms and television including high-impact programming watched by voters they are looking to motivate to the polls, such as “The Bachelorette,” “Big Brother,” “The Daily Show,” “Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta” and “The Simpsons.” Remember: In July, the campaign said it raked in $310 million in its fundraising efforts and has $377 million cash on hand. Here’s a brief overview of what to expect from today’s campaign schedule. 2024 presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump will speak about the economy at an event in Asheville, North Carolina, at 4 p.m. ET. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance will also be in Byron Center, Michigan, where he will speak at 2 p.m. ET. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will speak at a Harris-Walz campaign event in Denver, Colorado, around 2.20 p.m. ET. He will then also speak at a campaign reception in Boston, Massachusetts. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris does not have any events planned for today. Kamala Harris is officially the Democratic presidential nominee, but Donald Trump is continuing to describe the vice president’s elevation to the top of her party’s ticket as “unconstitutional” and accusing her of taking part in a “coup.” No serious effort to challenge Harris’ status as the Democratic nominee is underway. But some of Trump’s critics warn that the former president could be laying the groundwork to question the outcome of the 2024 election if he loses a second time. Democrats are set to gather next week in Chicago for a national convention at which they’ll rally around Harris as their new standard-bearer after President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek reelection. The Democratic National Committee made it official last week: Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are the party nominees for president and vice president, respectively. Convention delegates held a virtual roll call ahead of the convention, with Harris receiving 99% support from the participating delegates. Republicans have acknowledged that after the DNC vote, there is no longer any path to challenge Harris’ placement on ballots. But that hasn’t stopped Trump – now facing a much closer race, polls show, than the one he’d led against Biden – from complaining about Harris’ ascension, which took place after Biden had swept the Democratic presidential primaries earlier this year. One of Trump’s intraparty foes said the former president’s efforts to question the legitimacy of Harris as the Democratic nominee could be a way to lay the groundwork to question the legitimacy of this year’s election. “And I think this is why people need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again,” he added. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will roll through Pennsylvania on a bus tour Sunday, dropping in on the crucial battleground state just days before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It’s a move that underscores how aggressively the Harris-Walz ticket plans to compete for Pennsylvania and its 19 Electoral College votes. The pair’s first rally shortly after Walz was announced as Harris’ running mate was in Philadelphia, the commonwealth’s largest city, and they embarked on a dayslong tour of battleground states shortly after. Sunday’s tour, which is scheduled to begin in Pittsburgh, will mark the first time that Harris, Walz and their respective spouses – second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz – will appear on the campaign trail together. The goal, according to the campaign, is to have a cluster of intimate events with voters, ranging from canvass kick-offs to stops at local retail shops. The campaign has 36 coordinated offices and 300 staffers in Pennsylvania, which Harris has already visited seven times this year. The campaign has touted a robust volunteer operation: Some 43,000 people have signed up to volunteer in the Keystone State since Harris announced her candidacy last month. The Harris campaign is also discussing holding a rally Tuesday in Milwaukee in the battleground state of Wisconsin, just about 90 miles from the site of the Democratic convention in Chicago, according to a source involved in the talks. Read more about their tour through the swing state here. Former President Donald Trump said his voice was “somewhat different and strange” during his Monday night conversation with Elon Musk on X because of technical issues. At several points in the interview, Trump’s speech sounded as if he had a lisp or was slurring his words. When CNN previously asked whether there was an explanation, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said: “Must be your hearing.” On Tuesday night, Musk uploaded a version of their conversation to X that he said had “higher quality audio.” Second gentleman Doug Emhoff criticized the federal judge who oversaw the classified documents case against Donald Trump at a fundraiser in Los Angeles on Tuesday, suggesting she would be a judge Trump would consider appointing to the Supreme Court to his “bidding” if he’s reelected. At a private event benefitting Vice President Kamala Harris’ joint fundraising committee, Emhoff stressed the stakes of the election, arguing that if Trump defeats Harris, he could fill the next set of Supreme Court vacancies with judges who “don’t follow any precedent,” singling out as an example Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the Trump classified documents case before dismissing it last month. Emhoff’s comments come as Harris has sought to distance herself from commenting on Trump’s legal cases. At multiple rallies in battleground states last week, she quieted down chants from members of the audience to “lock him up,” referring to Trump, by insisting Democrats should focus on defeating Trump at the ballot box. The fundraiser, hosted by investment banker Stephen Paul and his wife Nancy Paul at their Beverly Hills home, raised over $3 million, Emhoff told the crowd. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar will beat back a primary challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, CNN projects, all but guaranteeing that the four original members of the “squad” of progressive House Democrats will be on the ballot this November. First elected in 2018, Omar, who also beat Samuels last cycle, has now defended her 5th District seat in three consecutive primary elections. Two other original “squad” members, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both eased to renomination earlier this year, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts is unopposed in her primary next month. Omar’s victory is a salve for progressives, especially those critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, after a pair of high-profile losses to moderate Democratic primary challengers heavily backed by big-spending pro-Israel outside groups. Those organizations, which spearheaded the unseating of “squad” members Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, did not invest in Omar’s Minneapolis-area district, a deep blue enclave where Democrats tend to run up the score in statewide elections. Read the full story. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley urged Republicans and former President Donald Trump to “quit whining” about Vice President Kamala Harris and instead focus on the voters. The Trump campaign has repeatedly criticized Harris for not doing a media interview since starting her White House bid. Haley reiterated that she wants to see the Trump campaign win, “but the campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes. It’s not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It’s not going to win talking about whether she is dumb. It’s not — you can’t win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they’re smart.”  Trump has attacked Harris’ racial identity and spread a false conspiracy theory about Harris’ crowd size. “Now we’re 80-plus days to make sure that there is not a President Kamala Harris. And the way to do that is let’s focus, let’s get to work,” Haley said. Asked if she would serve in a Trump adminstration, Haley said: “No, I’m not interested in serving in the administration. I said that on the campaign. This was never about a position for me. This was never about something else. I ran because i love this country so much.”  Wisconsin Republicans will nominate businessman Eric Hovde to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, CNN projects, in a contest seen as crucial to the battle for control of the narrowly divided Senate. Both Hovde and Baldwin are projected to advance in their respective primaries Tuesday – with Hovde overcoming nominal opposition from two little-known candidates and Baldwin unopposed. Their wins set up one of the year’s marquee Senate races, in a state that is also poised to be a major presidential battleground. Recent polling has given Baldwin the edge in her quest for a third term. A New York Times/Sienna College poll from earlier this month found the senator leading Hovde 51% to 43% among registered voters. Hovde, in Madison on Tuesday, acknowledged the surge of Democratic energy after Vice President Kamala Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket once a Joe Biden stepped down – a change that could also damage the prospects of down-ballot Republicans. Read more about the November matchup. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a campaign event in 2018 praised a Muslim cleric and leader in the Muslim community who has spread antisemitic content on Facebook, according to video newly revealed by the Washington Examiner.  The video features Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, speaking at an event hosted by the Muslim American Society of Minnesota during his first gubernatorial campaign, according to the Washington Examiner. In the video, Walz praises Imam Asad Zaman, executive director of the organization hosting the event, as a “master teacher” and briefly touches on their shared history.  Walz’s appearance alongside the Muslim cleric, one of several in recent years, came after Zaman had shared a link to a neo-Nazi propaganda film in 2015 portraying Adolf Hitler in a positive light. Zaman had also shared a Hamas press release in 2016 mourning the death of a Muslim politician in Bangladesh who was executed after being found guilty of war crimes. In the wake of the October 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel, Zaman has shared anti-Israel posts on social media. On the day of the attacks, he expressed solidarity for Palestinians “against Israeli attacks” while sharing a statement from the Muslim American Society of Minnesota condemning “Israel’s recent unprovoked attacks.” Earlier that day, Zaman shared a post arguing “Palestine has the right to defend itself.” In a statement to CNN, Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said that Walz and Zaman do not have a “personal relationship.”  “The Governor and he do not have a personal relationship. Governor Walz strongly condemns Hamas terrorism,” Hitt told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Zaman and the Muslim American Society of Minnesota for comment.   Read more about Walz’ past appearances with Zaman here. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, is digging in on his attacks against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz’s military record, as the Minnesota governor defended himself during a campaign event in Los Angeles today. Earlier today, Walz said, “I am damn proud of my service to this country, and I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person’s service record.” Walz caught heat from Vance last week for saying in 2018 that he handled assault weapons “in war.” Harris’ campaign acknowledged Saturday he “misspoke” during this event. As CNN reported, Vance also accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq. Vance defended his comments earlier this week, telling CNN’s Dana Bash: “I’m not criticizing Tim Walz’s service; I’m criticizing the fact that he lied about his service for political gain.” The Trump campaign on Tuesday said it had raised $1 million off of the conversation former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk had on X Spaces the night before.  The campaign touted the reach of the interview and said 25 million X users listened to the interview from start to finish and that there were roughly 1.5 million concurrent listeners during the live stream.  The start of the conversation was delayed by more than 40 minutes on Monday night because of technical issues, and Musk and Trump engaged in a friendly conversation in which they praised each other and Trump repeated many of his campaign talking points. The former president made at least 20 false claims during the over two-hour conversation, CNN reported. “President Trump will do everything he can to bring his unscripted message directly to the people, something the fake news media refuses to do. While Kamala Harris enjoys the luxury of hiding from the press, President Trump accepted Elon’s invitation to have an unfiltered conversation about his America First policies with voters and people around the world,” Cheung said.

RFK Jr. reached out to Harris campaign about administration role in exchange for endorsement | CNN Politics,"Published 9:21 PM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-15T01:21:42.865Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/rfk-jr-harris-administration-role/index.html,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign reached out to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to arrange a meeting about a possible role in her administration if he drops out of the race and endorses her, a Kennedy campaign official and a Democratic official told CNN. The approach from Kennedy’s team occurred last week, and no meeting between the two candidates materialized, the Kennedy campaign official told CNN. The effort to meet comes weeks after Kennedy and former President Donald Trump met in person during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the two discussed a possible role for Kennedy in a potential Trump administration in exchange for an endorsement. Kennedy campaign staff also attempted to reach out to intermediaries for Ron Klain, former White House chief of staff for President Joe Biden, but those efforts were fruitless, the Kennedy campaign official said. While Kennedy continues to make progress on ballot access, arrange campaign events and make media appearances, the campaign official told CNN he remains open to dropping out of the race if he believes he can serve the country another way. Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN that Kennedy “is willing to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the possibility of a unity government.” CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. The Washington Post first reported the outreach. Democrats have strongly combatted Kennedy’s campaign since the beginning of the year through ads labeling Kennedy a “spoiler” and highlighting his ties to GOP megadonor Timothy Mellon, who has contributed to an outside group backing Kennedy and a separate group backing Trump. The Democratic National Committee and a super PAC ran by Democratic allies have filed objections to Kennedy’s ballot access in several states. “No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement,” DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said Wednesday in a statement to CNN."
Fact check: Trump falsely accuses Biden and Harris of lying about $35 insulin | CNN Politics,"Published 7:05 PM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-14T23:05:43.594Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/fact-check-insulin-trump-biden-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump delivered a Wednesday speech that was laden with false claims he has made before. One of them was about insulin prices for seniors. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, claimed in the North Carolina address that Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential election, and President Joe Biden are lying when they tout their success in bringing insulin prices for Medicare recipients down to $35 per month (per prescription). Trump claimed that they are taking credit for his own work. Trump said: “Kamala and Joe tried to take credit for $35 insulin. You know that? You know who did that? I did that. I did that. I did the insulin, and it kicked in. And you know, I remember when I did it – it had to be a statute, it was a certain statute that took a certain period of time – I said, ‘I hope I’m elected because somebody’s going to get a lot of credit for doing what I got done.’ I got it done, $35 insulin. And now they take credit for it. It’s terrible. Terrible.” He complained that they had not thanked him for his work, then said, “Instead, they say, ‘We brought insulin in at $35.’ It’s a lie.” Facts First: Trump’s narrative is false. He did create a $35-per-month cap on insulin for some people on Medicare, through a voluntary program that prescription drug plans could choose to participate in, but did not sign a statute (a law) to secure the future of the program. Biden and Harris did get a statute passed – and that law created a permanent $35-per-month Medicare insulin policy that went far beyond Trump’s. The law ensured that all 3.4 million-plus insulin users on Medicare, not just some of them, got $35-per-month insulin. It did so through a mandatory cap that not only covers more people than Trump’s voluntary cap did but also applies to a greater number of insulin products than Trump’s did and stays in effect at a level of individual drug spending at which Trump’s cap disappeared. Trump could fairly say he played a role in lowering insulin costs and that Biden and Harris do not deserve sole credit. The Biden-era federal government has acknowledged that Biden’s mandatory $35 monthly cap “closely aligns with” the voluntary $35 monthly cap in the Trump-created program that was announced in 2020 and launched in the final month of the Trump presidency in 2021. But Trump’s attempt to create the impression that Biden and Harris are simply seizing credit for his policy is inaccurate. The Biden administration’s policy goes beyond Trump’s policy in multiple ways, in addition to the fact that it was enshrined by legislation. The Biden policy applies the $35-per-month cap to every insulin user in Medicare Part D, while the Trump policy didn’t; the Biden policy applies the $35 cap to Medicare Part B, while the Trump policy was only for Medicare Part D; the Biden policy requires a $35 cap on all covered insulin products, while the Trump policy only required it on some; and the Biden policy eliminates insulin payments for patients at the “catastrophic” level of drug spending, while the $35 cap didn’t exist at the “catastrophic” level under the Trump policy. You can read more details here. Trump made a variety of other false claims in the Wednesday speech. Here is a brief fact check of 13 of those claims, many of which have been previously debunked. (This is not a complete list.) - He claimed that the price of bacon “went up by four or five times” under Biden and Harris. It’s actually up 18%, nowhere near the 300% or 400% spike Trump is claiming. - He claimed that Harris’ policy proposals will result in people’s taxes quadrupling. Experts say there is no basis for this claim. - Speaking of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he claimed Biden is “letting him have the whole thing.” In fact, Biden has led an international effort to help Ukraine fight Russia; Russia has to date been able to seize about 18% of Ukraine’s territory, nowhere near the entire country. - He said Covid-19 was “ending all over the world, it was pretty much ending” when Biden and Harris took office in January 2021. It was not. - He said his tax cuts were the largest ever. They were not. - He said he took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China through his tariffs on Chinese products, and that no previous president had taken in “10 cents” from tariffs on China. Both claims are wrong. Study after study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs, and the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office. - He said Biden appointed Harris as “border czar” and put her in charge of the border. In reality, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been in charge of border security under Biden; Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment, asking her to lead diplomacy with Central American countries in an attempt to address the “root causes” of their citizens’ migration. - He said he built 571 miles of border wall. Official government statistics show it was 458 miles, most of it﻿ replacement barrier. - He said he built more border wall “than I said I was going to build.” In fact, he repeatedly said during his 2016 campaign that “we need” 1,000 miles of wall, far more than he ended up building. - He said he forced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, to deploy the National Guard during civil unrest in Minneapolis in 2020. In fact, Walz deployed the National Guard before Trump pressured him to do so. - He said Venezuela is “taking all of their criminals” and people from mental institutions and “bringing” them to the US. Experts say there is no evidence for this claim. - He said Houston has the only refinery in the world that can handle Venezuelan oil. Various other refineries in the US refine Venezuelan oil."
Kamala Harris’ complicated history with Medicare for All becomes a Trump campaign attack line | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:14 PM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-14T18:17:30.428Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all/index.html,"Kamala Harris may be done with Medicare for All, but Medicare for All – with a new nudge from former President Donald Trump – isn’t done with her. The Trump campaign on Wednesday attacked Harris over her past support for a move to the single-payer, government-run health care system long championed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Medicare for All gained broad support among progressive Democrats, especially those with eyes on the White House, before and during the early stages of the party’s 2020 presidential primary. Harris’ team said recently that she no longer backs the plan, which fell out of vogue with Democrats as Joe Biden surged to the nomination four years ago as one of the few candidates to vocally oppose it. Instead, he campaigned on improving and expanding the Affordable Care Act, which he has focused on during his term and Harris has supported as his vice president. But Harris has not addressed the question herself, touting the Biden administration’s record while trying avoid any relitigation of the years-old fight, and putting out word now only through campaign aides. Now, Trump is reviving the debate as he seeks to paint Harris as both a radical liberal and a flip flopper. “Kamala Harris’ spokespeople are once again alleging she has flip flopped on her positions – this time saying she no longer supports socialist Medicare for All,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday, calling on Harris “to explain why she is running from every liberal policy she has ever supported.” The Trump camp’s focus on Medicare for All is emerging as the centerpiece of a wider strategy to use Harris’ 2020 primary positions against her now, less than 90 days before the general election. Harris dropped out of the Democratic primary before the first votes were cast, but her campaign that year frequently jousted with Sanders and reporters trying to pin down her position on the plan, which would eliminate private insurance plans and replace them with a government-funded and operated single-payer system. That debate quieted when Biden consolidated the party on his way to winning the nomination and, eventually, the presidency with Harris as his running mate. Trump – who repeatedly attempted to repeal ACA, also known as Obamacare, without success and to significant electoral backlash – has never spelled out a clear plan of his own. “She wants to outlaw private health insurance,” Trump said in late July at the conservative Turning Point Action’s Believers’ Summit in West Palm Beach. “A lot of people have private health insurance. They want to keep it that way. It’s phenomenal.” Harris responded the next day at a fundraiser in Massachusetts, raising Trump’s 2017 campaign to end Obamacare. “He intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions,” Harris said. “You guys remember what that was? It was real. Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.” The Harris campaign, in response to CNN, pointed to the record high number of Americans now enrolled in Obamacare and other initiatives, including moves to lower prescription drug prices. “Vice President Harris believes real leadership means bringing all sides together to build consensus. It is that approach that made it possible for the Biden-Harris administration to achieve bipartisan breakthroughs on everything from infrastructure to gun violence prevention,” campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said. “As President, she will take that same pragmatic approach, focusing on common-sense solutions for the sake of progress.” Harris’ relationship with Medicare for All was always tinged with a certain skepticism. As a US senator in September 2017, Harris signed on as a co-sponsor to Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation. Speaking at the unveiling of the bill on Capitol Hill, she made the business-friendly case for change. “Let’s give the taxpayer of the United States a better return on their investment,” Harris said. “Why? Because Medicare for All stands for the proposition that all Americans from the day of birth, throughout their lives, will have access to health care.” At a January 2019 CNN town hall, Harris appeared to fully embrace the system, telling a questioner from the audience she would be willing to cut out private insurers as part of the transition. She argued that insurers are motivated by profit, dump paperwork on patients and delay care, saying, “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.” “We need to have Medicare for All,” Harris said, adding that it was an issue she felt “very strongly” about. Her remarks drew immediate criticism from Republicans and sidelong glances from Sanders allies who repeatedly questioned her fidelity to what would be, even its most ardent supporters acknowledge, a radical remaking of the US health care system. Harris’ campaign responded clumsily to the backlash. One Harris adviser, a day after the town hall, told CNN that, despite what she had said, Harris was open to a variety of plans being drafted by congressional Democrats, including those that kept some role for the industry. Both the adviser and her spokesman at the time, Ian Sams, insisted that her interest in different legislation, all of it moving to a more progressive system, should not be described as a flip-flop. “Medicare for All is the plan that she believes will solve the problem and get all Americans covered. Period,” Sams told CNN at the time. “She has co-sponsored other pieces of legislation that she sees as a path to getting us there, but this is the plan she is running on.” Harris’s words at the town hall, followed by her adviser’s subsequent effort to pump the brakes, focused the spotlight on long-simmering internal Democratic tensions over the future of American health care, an issue they had successfully united over in defense of Obamacare during Trump’s first year in office. The back-and-forth between Harris’ team and more staunchly progressive campaigns, including Sanders’ and that of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, dominated stretches of the primary. By the summer, though, with lingering questions about her position undermining her campaign, Harris released her own health care plan. Made public shortly before the second debate of the primary cycle, the Harris proposal kept a role for private insurance companies within the health care system – a significant departure from Sanders’ Medicare for All bill. Harris called for transitioning to a Medicare for All-type system over a decade – longer than the four-year transition period favored by Sanders. “This isn’t about pursuing an ideology,” Harris said. “This is about delivering for the American people.” The Harris plan would have expanded the existing Medicare system, which consists of the traditional Medicare program but also provides a private insurance option called Medicare Advantage. “We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.” The shift came, in part, due to increasing pressure from labor leaders who did not want to forfeit the desirable plans they had fought for and won from employers at the bargaining table. It also allowed Harris to make the pitch for a new system without, as she explained it then, raising taxes – another sore spot with parts of the electorate. Sanders immediately challenged Harris’ description of her plan as proper Medicare for All. “I like Kamala. She’s a friend of mine, but her plan is not Medicare for All,” Sanders told CNN ahead of the debates. “What Medicare for All understands is that health care is a human right and the function of a sane health care system is not to make sure that insurance companies and drug companies make tens of billions of dollars in profit.” A senior policy adviser to Sanders called Harris’ rejiggered plan “bad policy” and “bad politics,” warning it “vastly expands the ability for private insurance corporations to profit from over-billing and denying care to vulnerable patients who need it the most.” For all the political drama, the debate over health care in the Democratic primary petered out over the course of 2019, as the 2020 Iowa caucuses approached and the crowded field of candidates jockeyed for position. Harris, though, never quite found out what Democrats made of her proposal. She dropped out of the race in December 2019, citing diminished “financial resources,” about two months before the caucuses took place. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
Harris and Walz to take bus tour through Pennsylvania ahead of Democratic convention | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:26 AM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-14T10:00:00.959Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/pennsylvania-harris-walz-bus-tour/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will roll through Pennsylvania on a bus tour Sunday, dropping in on the crucial battleground state just days before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It’s a move that underscores how aggressively the Harris-Walz ticket plans to compete for Pennsylvania and its 19 Electoral College votes. The pair’s first rally shortly after Walz was announced as Harris’ running mate was in Philadelphia, the commonwealth’s largest city, and they embarked on a dayslong tour of battleground states shortly after. Sunday’s tour, which is scheduled to begin in Pittsburgh, will mark the first time that Harris, Walz and their respective spouses – second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz – will appear on the campaign trail together since they shared the stage in Philadelphia last week. The goal, according to the campaign, is to have a cluster of intimate events with voters, ranging from canvass kick-offs to stops at local retail shops. The campaign has 36 coordinated offices and 300 staffers in Pennsylvania, which Harris has already visited seven times this year. The campaign has touted a robust volunteer operation: Some 43,000 people have signed up to volunteer in the Keystone State since Harris announced her candidacy last month. The Harris campaign is also discussing holding a rally Tuesday in Milwaukee in the battleground state of Wisconsin, just about 90 miles from the site of the Democratic convention in Chicago, according to a source involved in the talks. Harris’ ascendancy to the top of Democratic ticket appears to have united the party and returned the race against former President Donald Trump to a neck-and-neck contest. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan make up Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states that Trump won in 2016 only see them flip to Joe Biden four years later. Trump, meanwhile, is set to hold a campaign rally Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, marking his second visit to the commonwealth since surviving a July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, located an hour north of Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania has seen a flood of advertising in the weeks since Biden dropped out and upended the 2024 presidential race. Seven battleground states have been the focus of more than $212 million in ad spending over that stretch, with Pennsylvania accounting for $70.6 million of that total. And across those seven battlegrounds, Republicans lead Democrats in ad spending, by about $109 million to $99 million. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Sunday’s bus tour will be the first time the candidates and their spouses will appear together since a rally in Philadelphia last week."
Emhoff hits Aileen Cannon as a judge who would ‘do Trump’s bidding’ while warning of possible future Trump SCOTUS nominees | CNN Politics,"Published 7:48 AM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-14T11:48:42.145Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/doug-emhoff-aileen-cannon/index.html,"Second gentleman Doug Emhoff criticized the federal judge who oversaw the classified documents case against Donald Trump at a fundraiser in Los Angeles on Tuesday, suggesting Trump would consider appointing her to the Supreme Court to do his “bidding” if he’s reelected. At a private event benefiting Vice President Kamala Harris’ joint fundraising committee, Emhoff stressed the stakes of the election, arguing that if Trump defeats Harris, he could fill the next set of Supreme Court vacancies with judges who “don’t follow any precedent,” singling out District Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the Trump classified documents case before dismissing it last month. “(Trump)’s unfit to serve, he can’t get anywhere near the White House. But if somehow they win, they can actually appoint two or three more justices,” Emhoff said. “And they’re going to be, like, in the Aileen Cannon, they don’t follow any precedent, they’re just going to do Trump’s bidding type. And they’re going to be young, and they’re going to be on that bench for 30 or 40 years.” Emhoff’s comments are notable because Harris has sought to distance herself from commenting on Trump’s legal cases. At multiple rallies in battleground states last week, she quieted down chants from members of the audience to “lock him up,” referring to Trump, by insisting Democrats should focus on defeating Trump at the ballot box. The fundraiser, hosted by investment banker Stephen Paul and his wife Nancy Paul at their Beverly Hills home, raised over $3 million, Emhoff told the crowd. Emhoff asked the crowd to support the campaign beyond offering financial support, noting “there’s a lot of lawyers here” and suggesting Republicans will engage in “shenanigans” around the election, without elaborating on what he meant. “Let’s continue to raise the money, volunteer. I know there’s a lot of lawyers here, so there’s lots of — you know they’re going to do lots of shenanigans. They’re already talking about that,” Emhoff said. “So we gotta win, we gotta protect the win. So we’re gonna need lawyers. We’re gonna need volunteers.” Emhoff’s most well-received line of the night came in attacking Trump for his age, calling him “disintegrating” and “degraded,” pointing to his conversation on X with Elon Musk in which it appeared as if he were slurring his words. “She is strong and she can smell weakness, and Trump is weak. Let’s be honest, this fake tough guy act, this bullying, it’s all falling apart,” he said. “And he’s also just disintegrating. You can see that. You can hear it last night. He’s literally, like I’ve said, he is a degraded version of an already horrible person,” he continued, prompting laughs and applause from the crowd."
Trump’s continued attacks on Harris’ rise stir fears he could question election outcome if he loses in November | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:08 AM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-14T09:30:02.317Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/donald-trump-harris-election-outcome-denial/index.html,"Kamala Harris is officially the Democratic presidential nominee, but Donald Trump is continuing to describe the vice president’s elevation to the top of her party’s ticket as “unconstitutional” and accusing her of taking part in a “coup.” No serious effort to challenge Harris’ status as the Democratic nominee is underway. But some of Trump’s critics warn that the former president could be laying the groundwork to question the outcome of the 2024 election if he loses a second time. Democrats are set to gather next week in Chicago for a national convention at which they’ll rally around Harris as their new standard-bearer after President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek reelection. The Democratic National Committee made it official last week: Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are the party nominees for president and vice president, respectively. Convention delegates held a virtual roll call ahead of the convention, with Harris receiving 99% support from the participating delegates. Republicans have acknowledged that after the DNC vote, there is no longer any path to challenge Harris’ placement on ballots. “When the DNC nominated her they were still within the timeframe to submit the required documentation to each of the states to place her name (and Walz’s) on the ballot. The fact that the DNC nominated her has ended any challenge in this regard,” a person familiar with the Trump campaign’s plans told CNN. But that hasn’t stopped Trump – now facing a much closer race, polls show, than the one he’d led against Biden – from complaining about Harris’ ascension, which took place after Biden had swept the Democratic presidential primaries earlier this year. One of Trump’s intraparty foes said the former president’s efforts to question the legitimacy of Harris as the Democratic nominee could be a way to lay the groundwork to question the legitimacy of this year’s election. “We know one thing for sure: Trump never loses. And so if he’s not declared the winner of 2024, as in 2020, it must be because he was treated unfairly yet again; it was stolen yet again,” John Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser and has since become a vocal critic of the former president, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins last week. “I don’t think he knows exactly what his theory is going to be this time to explain how he was denied winning the election, so he’s trotting out a number of things,” Bolton said. “And I think this is why people need to start thinking more now about how to deny Trump the ability, the day after the election, if he loses, to try and throw the process into chaos again.” In a conversation with X owner Elon Musk that was broadcast on the social media platform Monday night, Trump said Harris’ elevation was “a scam” and accused top Democrats of forcing Biden out of the 2024 race. “This was a coup of a president of the United States. He didn’t want to leave, and they said, ‘We can do it the nice way, or we can do it the hard way,’” Trump claimed. He also criticized Democrats in a news conference last week, stating that Harris taking over from Biden “seems to me, actually, unconstitutional. Perhaps it’s not.” House Speaker Mike Johnson similarly claimed that Harris would face legal hurdles that have not materialized. The Louisiana Republican told CNN’s Jake Tapper on July 21 – the day Biden dropped out – that Democrats would face “real problems” and “legal hurdles” that would be litigated in a number of states. “In some of these states, it’s a real hurdle. They have a real problem with replacing the nominee at the top of the ticket,” Johnson said. The next day, as it became clear that Harris would face no serious opposition on her path to the Democratic nomination, Johnson would not specify which laws Democrats would allegedly break with Harris atop the ticket. “I said that we have 50 different systems in each of the states when it comes to presidential elections and choosing electors and all the rest, and in some of the states, there are impediments to just switching someone out like that,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. “This is not the way the system is supposed to work,” he said. “There’s a reason it’s unprecedented. You don’t just, you know, steamroll the rules in the process because you decide that your candidate is no longer suitable. That’s what’s happened here.” According to a CNN survey in July, however, election authorities in at least 48 states, both Republicans and Democrats, said that there were no obstacles that would prevent Harris from getting on their ballots once she became the Democratic nominee. Election authorities in the other two states, Florida and Montana, did not respond to requests for comment, but a review of those states’ ballot access rules suggests Harris is not likely to face an issue there either. Legal experts also told CNN that the courts would be unlikely to go along with lawsuits that sought to challenge the addition of a new name on the top of the Democratic ticket. “As a legal matter, it is up to the convention to nominate a candidate. And all the legal precedent is on courts deferring to the party’s choice for its nominee and then giving the voters the choice,” Ben Ginsberg, a Republican campaign attorney who has served as general counsel for several previous GOP nominees, said last month."
Analysis: Whoever can finally coin an effective economic message could win the White House | CNN Politics,"Published 12:02 AM EDT, Wed August 14, 2024",2024-08-14T04:02:38.692Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/trump-harris-economic-message-analysis/index.html,"Voters keep telling pollsters that their economic insecurities are the biggest issue in the 2024 election. So, it’s a knock on both parties that none of their candidates have yet found a decisive way to address those fears. But both nominees will make new attempts to convince Americans they can deliver prosperity in the next three days. Former President Donald Trump will try to make a case against Kamala Harris’ role in the Biden economy on Wednesday in North Carolina. The vice president will chase his jet fumes down to the critical swing state on Friday, with the first major policy speech of her campaign, which aides say will provide answers on how she will lower prices. The US economy has recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic more strongly than those of many other developed nations. But for decades, many Americans have felt squeezed, and 21st century presidents have all struggled to deal with the political consequences of inequality fostered by globalization. Trump, who found fertile political ground amid economic blight in 2016, has this year spent more time flinging insults, race baiting and whining about his personal grievances than rolling out detailed plans to help workers. His hyperbole — like warning of a looming Great Depression – lacks seriousness. And his nostalgic revisionism of his economic management during his first term ignores the reality that his major initiative — a huge tax cut — did far more to benefit the wealthy than working Americans. President Joe Biden dedicated his domestic agenda to restoring economic fairness and sought to revive manufacturing and repair the country’s crumbling infrastructure. But his big spending plans helped fuel the inflation that has hurt so many Americans. And he often looked like he was chiding voters for not giving him credit for his legislative successes as they struggled through tough times. Harris has so far spoken only in the broadest of terms about how she would bring down prices and convince Americans that an economy that is comparatively healthy is about to deliver for them. The vice president is riding a tide of euphoria in her party and has erased Biden’s polling deficit against Trump. But she still faces a treacherous road. As the effective incumbent in this race, Harris is vulnerable to any sudden shifts in the economic outlook. Trump immediately proclaimed a “Kamala crash” after a one-day plunge in stock markets last week. He’s not been as vocal as stocks have recouped most of their gains since. But conflicting economic signals set the stage for a precarious few months for the vice president. On Tuesday alone, the duality in the economy that voters know so well was underscored by new data showing that the Producer Price Index, a measure of wholesale inflation, slowed in July. But at the same time, Home Depot warned consumers were growing bearish. Voters looking for more clarity on the economy may start to get answers this week because the dynamics of the transformed campaign are forcing Trump and Harris to get specific. The Republican nominee’s camp is racing to tie its new opponent to Biden’s perceived failures before Harris gets a chance to define herself. “Hard-working Americans are suffering because of the Harris-Biden Administration’s dangerously liberal policies,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement announcing his appearance in Asheville, North Carolina, for a major speech on the economy on Wednesday afternoon. “Prices are excruciatingly high, and the cost of living has soared — leaving those on a fixed-income, unsure of how they are going to afford a basic standard of living in the future.” Harris is moving quickly to fill in uncertainty over how she’d run the economy from the Oval Office. The vice president has traveled frequently to support Biden-Harris administration policies in the last four years but has not yet put her personal touch on policy. She will be at the president’s side on Thursday in suburban Maryland for their first formal joint appearance since he left the race, where they will discuss the steps they are taking to lower prices for the American people. The next day, Harris will deliver a major speech in Raleigh on her economic plans, which her campaign said would address lowering costs for middle class families and focus on “corporate price-gouging.” It’s not hard to conjure up simple campaign themes that might help Trump bounce back after being caught off guard by the Democratic switch from Biden to Harris. Republican operatives are visibly frustrated that the former president hasn’t ditched his personal obsessions and behavior, which alienate critical suburban voters in battleground states, to focus on the economy, the border and global challenges. “You’ve got to focus,” CNN political commentator Scott Jennings said Monday, channeling a message to Trump though an appearance with Anderson Cooper. “You’re not going to win the race fighting with the other campaign about crowd size and stuff that’s not really on the minds of most Americans. People are still in a sour mood about the country. People think the country is off track. They are still mad about food prices. They are still mad about the economic anxiety in their lives.” Another Republican strategist, Brad Todd, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt Tuesday that “the problem is former President Donald Trump has to focus his message when he’s in front of the camera and he’s a big, big part of how the campaign communicates. He’s got to tighten it up and he’s got to focus it on what voters would get if Kamala Harris wins.” Todd was echoing former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who had this warning for Trump on Fox News on Monday: “Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her (positions).” In a chummy two-hour chat with tech titan Elon Musk on Monday, Trump did strike some economic arguments on inflation and energy production. “The election’s coming up and the people want to hear about the economy and the fact that they can’t buy groceries,” the former president said. It was not long, however, before he was diving down a rabbit hole and boasting about his redesign of new Air Force One jets and marveling at the number of listeners to their live stream. Musk made more convincing arguments on the economy than Trump. And on the campaign trail, Trump’s vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has kept a far tighter focus on the economy. Harris’ three-week political honeymoon shows no sign of ending and it is likely to get a further boost next week when the Democratic National Convention takes place in Chicago. The event will be dedicated to building up Harris’ image and fleshing out her appeal to middle class Americans — especially on economic issues. And she will benefit from the efforts of her party’s two most gifted orators, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. The 42nd and 44th presidents could be especially helpful. In 2012, Clinton delivered a spellbinding address that made clear arguments that Obama had struggled to effectively make himself as he ran for reelection. Obama – who was trying to balance a desire to take credit for an economic rebound after the Great Recession with concern that would anger voters still far from thrilled about the state of the economy – gratefully dubbed his Democratic predecessor “the secretary of explaining stuff.” Democrats are encouraged by some anecdotal signs that Harris’ surge has begun to ease Democratic vulnerabilities over the economy. In a CNN poll published in early July, before Biden dropped out, the economy was easily the issue most important to voters. And 51% of them trusted Trump to handle the issue and only 32% chose Biden. But in a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll last week, Harris had narrowed the gap considerably, trailing the former president by only 3 points on the issue. A New York Times/Siena College poll over the weekend also showed that she has reduced the deficit to Trump on the economy in key swing states. But with Trump seeking an opening to define her negatively — especially on the economy — Harris must act fast. While her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is relishing laying into Trump — accusing him of crashing the economy by mismanaging the Covid-19 pandemic, for example — Harris is making strategic adjustments. She’s already infuriated Trump by adopting his scheme to end federal taxes on tips — a play by both candidates for service workers in the battleground of Nevada. And she’s subtly shifting the tone. “Look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it,” Harris said in Phoenix over the weekend, noting that as attorney general of California she had taken on price-fixing schemes. “When I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. “All of this is to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle-class and working families first.” That empathy with a dash of populism could help Harris mitigate Trump’s edge on the election’s most critical issue — especially in the vital Blue Wall States of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. She hopes it will pave her way to the Oval Office."

The platform’s goal is to reach the millions of Republican voters who “continue to reject the chaos, division and violence of Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda.” The virtual rally, which included thousands of lifelong Republicans, was hosted by Olivia Troye, a former Trump-Pence administration national security official. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz voted in person in his home state’s primary on Tuesday before traveling to California for campaign events, his spokesperson Teddy Tschann told CNN. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz taunted former President Donald Trump at a fundraiser in Newport Beach, California, for promoting a conspiracy theory that images of attendees at a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan last week were created by artificial intelligence. Walz attended the fundraiser after making his first solo campaign appearance at a government employees union in Los Angeles earlier today. Tuesday’s appearance was his first in a string of fundraisers across the country this week. Walz slammed Trump’s policy agenda during his remarks, arguing “no one is asking for the crap he’s asking for,” and again ridiculed Trump for not campaigning in battleground states as Harris and Walz toured those states last week, suggesting his age may be a factor. Walz acknowledged his role in coining a new Democratic talking point when he labeled Trump and other Republicans as “weird.” He stressed that the label is meant only for Republican politicians, rather than Republican voters, and offered a note of caution in using the label, suggesting that he doesn’t want to attack behaviors from Republican officials that don’t have an impact. Walz also attacked his Republican counterpart, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, by attempting to undercut Vance’s claim to small-town roots by pointing out his Ivy League background. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested he supported eliminating federal income and payroll taxes on tips, clarifying that the proposal he first floated in June would cover both levies.  “We’re looking at doing the full bore,” Trump said in an interview with Spectrum News 1 in North Carolina when asked if he supported eliminating both federal income and payroll taxes.  Such a measure would require congressional approval. Federal payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, total 15.3% — half of which is paid by employers. If both federal income and payroll taxes were eliminated, it would lower revenue by $150 billion to $250 billion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  Vice President Kamala Harris has since embraced a similar proposal. But a Harris campaign official previously told CNN that under her proposal, tips would remain subject to payroll taxes. A larger share of workers who receive tips would benefit if payroll taxes were also eliminated since more than one-third of them don’t earn enough to owe federal income taxes, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. Both Trump and Harris announced their proposals in Las Vegas, Nevada — a key swing state where many residents work in the hospitality industry. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley urged Republicans and former President Donald Trump to “quit whining” about Vice President Kamala Harris and instead focus on the voters. The Trump campaign has repeatedly criticized Harris for not doing a media interview since starting her White House bid. Haley reiterated that she wants to see the Trump campaign win, “but the campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes. It’s not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It’s not going to win talking about whether she is dumb. It’s not — you can’t win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they’re smart.”  Trump has attacked Harris’ racial identity and spread a false conspiracy theory about Harris’ crowd size. “Now we’re 80-plus days to make sure that there is not a President Kamala Harris. And the way to do that is let’s focus, let’s get to work,” Haley said. Asked if she would serve in a Trump adminstration, Haley said: Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers Union (UAW), blasted former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk for threatening to intimidate workers who go on strike during their conversation on the social media platform X on Monday night. The UAW, which recently endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, filed separate charges against Trump and Musk to the National Labor Relations Board after their discussion on X. During the interview, the pair discussed a potential role for Musk in Trump’s administration should he get reelected. Trump called Musk “the cutter,” and praised Musk for his anti-union stances. “I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike – I won’t mention the name of the company – but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. Every one of you is gone,” Trump said. Musk could be heard laughing and replying “yeah.” Fain noted that “it is federal law that workers have a right to strike and you cannot be fired for striking.” He also called Trump’s campaign “completely weird” and asked, “Who takes pride in firing workers?” He said Trump “was a disaster for working class people” while president. Fain said Harris and her running mate, Gov, Tim Walz, would “stand up for working class people.” CNN’s David Goldman contributed to this report. Wisconsin Republicans will nominate businessman Eric Hovde to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, CNN projects, in a contest seen as crucial to the battle for control of the narrowly divided Senate. Both Hovde and Baldwin are projected to advance in their respective primaries Tuesday – with Hovde overcoming nominal opposition from two little-known candidates and Baldwin unopposed. Their wins set up one of the year’s marquee Senate races, in a state that is also poised to be a major presidential battleground. Recent polling has given Baldwin the edge in her quest for a third term. A New York Times/Sienna College poll from earlier this month found the senator leading Hovde 51% to 43% among registered voters. Hovde, in Madison on Tuesday, acknowledged the surge of Democratic energy after Vice President Kamala Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket once a Joe Biden stepped down – a change that could also damage the prospects of down-ballot Republicans. Read more about the November matchup here In the hours after President Joe Biden’s historic decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race last month, journalists across three major US newsrooms began receiving emails from an anonymous person claiming to have tantalizing new information about the election.  The individual, who identified themself only as “Robert,” sent a trove of private documents from inside Donald Trump’s campaign operation to journalists at Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Beginning on July 22, Politico reported, it began receiving emails from an AOL email address that contained internal communications from a senior Trump campaign official and a research dossier the campaign had put together on Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The dossier included what the Trump campaign identified as Vance’s potential vulnerabilities. Politico was also sent portions of a research document about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who had been among the contenders to join Trump on the GOP ticket. The Times and The Post later reported that they, too, had been sent a similar cache, including a 271-page document on Vance dated Feb. 23 and labeled “privileged & confidential,” that the outlets said was based on publicly available information. But despite receiving the sensitive campaign files, the three outlets opted to not publish reporting on the trove they’d been handed, even as the the person suggested they still had a variety of additional documents “from [Trump’s] legal and court documents to internal campaign discussions.” Read more about the decision by news outlets here. The Muslim community leader who appeared alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at several events told CNN in a statement he does not have a “personal relationship” with Walz and explained previously sharing antisemitic content on Facebook by saying he sometimes shares links on social media “without fully looking at them.”  Asad Zaman, a Minnesota imam and executive director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, echoed the Harris campaign’s statement on the nature of the relationship between him and Walz in a series of answers to questions emailed to him by CNN.  When asked about previous social media posts in which he shared a neo-Nazi propaganda film and a Hamas news release, Zaman attributed sharing the posts to a tendency to “pass along social media items without fully looking at them.”  When asked about his opinions on the Harris-Walz campaign’s stance toward the Israel-Hamas war, Zaman said he wasn’t familiar with its views on the conflict but expressed solidarity for those experiencing “enormous human suffering.”  Some background: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a campaign event in 2018 praised Zaman as a “master teacher” and briefly touched on their shared history, according to video newly revealed by the Washington Examiner. In a statement to CNN, Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said that Walz and Zaman do not have a “personal relationship.” Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday he had been briefed about the hack on his campaign when asked if the FBI had briefed him and what the agency had told him about the breach.  Trump’s campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked. Politico reported earlier Saturday that it had received emails from an anonymous account with documents from inside Trump’s campaign operation. Trump claimed in a post on Truth Social later that day that his campaign was informed by Microsoft that it had been hacked by the Iranian government.  It is not clear whether Iran was responsible for the hack. The Iranian mission to the United Nations said it does “not accord any credence to such reports.” Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin touted Democrats’ education agenda to Wisconsin teachers on Tuesday, speaking to a round table of educators on the same day voters cast ballots in the statewide primary elections, including in the race for Baldwin’s seat.  The senator engaged with teachers and social workers for nearly an hour, hearing their personal experiences on issues including staffing shortages, teacher pay and school funding. She asked questions and took notes by hand throughout the roundtable. Baldwin vowed to continue to fight to increase funding for public education and protect the Department of Education from the “existential threat of Donald Trump and Eric Hovde,” referencing her likely Republican opponent in the state’s competitive Senate race. Hovde has been endorsed by Trump in Wisconsin’s Republican Senate primary in his race against two GOP challengers. Polls close in the state at 8 p.m. central time. Baldwin, a two-term senator, is unopposed in her primary. Some of those most eager to quiet Donald Trump are those who want to him back in the Oval Office. Appearing dazed and flustered by an unfamiliar and fast-changing political landscape, Trump in response has unleashed a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even close allies and donors acknowledge as unproductive. Some have privately expressed serious concerns that the former president’s recent inability to stay on message has wasted an early opportunity to blunt the momentum of his new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. For Trump, staying on message has rarely been easy, as illustrated by the former president’s return to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, where he was once a towering figure. Ahead of his Monday interview with Elon Musk, Trump’s account posted for the first time in a year, featuring a series of slickly edited videos that articulated the case for another Trump presidency in a way that regularly eludes the candidate himself. One post asked, “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” That question strikes at the heart of his campaign’s message to voters – but Trump failed to pose it until near the end of his two-hour conversation with Musk, during which he aired familiar grievances about the 2020 election, commented on Harris’ beauty on Time Magazine’s latest cover, remained fixated on President Joe Biden and, according to a CNN tally, told at least 20 falsehoods. Read more about the frustrations some Trump allies here. The Harris-Walz campaign is discussing holding a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday during the Democratic National Convention, according to a source involved in the discussions.  With Milwaukee just 90 miles from the site of the DNC, the move is seen as an opportunity to log a visit to a critical battleground state during an unscheduled portion of the convention’s programming. The New York Times first reported news of the rally. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, is digging in on his attacks against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz’s military record, as the Minnesota governor defended himself during a campaign event in Los Angeles today. Earlier today, Walz said, “I am damn proud of my service to this country, and I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person’s service record.” Walz caught heat from Vance last week for saying in 2018 that he handled assault weapons “in war.” Harris’ campaign acknowledged Saturday he “misspoke” during this event. As CNN reported, Vance also accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq. Vance defended his comments earlier this week, telling CNN’s Dana Bash: “I’m not criticizing Tim Walz’s service; I’m criticizing the fact that he lied about his service for political gain.” Georgia’s Secretary of State announced on Tuesday that independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West have submitted enough valid signatures to qualify, the next step toward appearing on the ballot in the key battleground state. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office announced it verified both Kennedy and West, along with Party for Socialism and Liberation candidate Claudia De La Cruz, have submitted more than the minimum 7,500 valid signatures needed to qualify for the state’s ballot in November.  Both West and Kennedy face objections to their petitions backed by the Georgia Democratic Party that allege both candidates incorrectly submitted their petitions by filing under their own names, rather than their slates of electors as required by Georgia election law. The Georgia Democratic Party also alleges West did not file his petition before the state’s independent candidate filing deadline. In the statement, Raffensperger’s office said hearings on the challenges will take place next week. An administrative law judge will determine whether Kennedy and West appear on the ballot following the hearings. While Kennedy and West have yet to qualify for the ballot in Georgia, their presence on the ballot could alter the dynamics of the contest in a state where President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by less than 12,000 votes. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is doing very well financially for someone who just turned 40, new federal disclosures reveal. The Ohio senator, whom former President Donald Trump chose as his running mate last month, has roughly between $4 million and $11 million in assets to his name, with only $750,000 to $1.5 million in liabilities. He owns a home, has a stake in two businesses and has three 529 education savings accounts for his children. His biggest single asset is his Schwab brokerage account, which he values between roughly $2.2 million and $7.5 million – with investments largely in passively managed exchange-traded stock and bond funds. Outside of that, while hardly his largest holding, Vance does include among his assets $250,000 to $500,000 worth of bitcoin. With Trump promising to implement crypto-friendly policies if elected, it’s unclear how that will affect his holdings, but it does stand out in a portfolio made up largely of diversified ETFs. Vance’s financial disclosure form was released Tuesday by the Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Election Commission. CNN has reached out to the Vance campaign for comment about the new disclosure. CNN’s Steve Contorno, Kit Maher and David Wright contributed to this report. Read more about what else Vance’s disclosures show here. This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter-measures aimed at restricting abortion access. Here are the states with abortion measures: Read more about the ballot measures as voters prepare to weigh in this fall Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz highlighted his union ties while pitching Vice President Kamala Harris and himself to the largest government workers union in the country on Tuesday, noting the rarity of a former teachers’ union member appearing on a major party presidential ticket.  Walz, a former public school teacher, touted Harris’ record in helping organized labor and his own support of unions as governor, saying Harris as president will sign two labor-friendly bills, PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, while drawing a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump, who he called a “scab.”  Walz also slammed Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, for not supporting organized labor while in Congress.  “I’ll tell you his running mate, I don’t know if that was a value add to this campaign or not, but he’s one of four senators, four, that has never cast a vote on a pro-worker bill in his life. Not once. A stopped clock’s right twice a day. This guy can’t get it right once, not once for workers,” he said. Walz pointed to Project 2025, the presidential transition project organized by Republican allies from which the Trump campaign has sought to distance itself, as evidence that Trump will “eliminate AFSCME and all public sector unions” and roll back child labor laws.  Nearly two years after Elon Musk bought Twitter and turned it into X, the billionaire is leveraging its power as a source of real-time news for millions of users to try to sway the outcome of the 2024 presidential election in favor of former President Donald Trump. Social media platforms have played a role in past elections: campaigns have used them to build support, foreign actors have used them in efforts to interfere in election outcomes and the industry was criticized in 2020 for restricting access to reports of Hunter Biden’s laptop. And some tech leaders have spoken out about their preferred candidate for the White House. But the major platforms themselves, and especially their owners, typically do not try to affect how users will vote, save for ensuring people have basic, accurate information about voting and removing influence operations that seek to covertly manipulate people. Musk, by contrast, has turned the platform he purchased for $44 billion into his own personal, political messaging machine, seeking to influence his more than 190 million followers and, in some cases, sharing false claims from the very top. Musk announced his official endorsement for Trump in a post last month that received 2.3 million likes. And on Monday, he hosted Trump for a friendly, 2-plus-hour livestreamedconversation on X, in which he allowed the former president to make at least 20 false claims about everything from crime and immigration to tax cuts, without pushback. Trump used the conversation to fundraise, with his campaign team posting on X ahead of the event that “we’re asking YOU to make this President Trump’s BIGGEST FUNDRAISING DAY EVER!” X used the opportunity to send a notification – which featured Trump’s profile photo – to users encouraging them to buy a subscription to the platform. CNN has reached out to X and the Trump campaign for comment. Read more about how Musk is using X to support Trump here. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, defended his military record during remarks in Los Angeles on Tuesday, saying he is “damn proud” of his service in the Army National Guard. Speaking to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union convention, Walz addressed attacks from Republicans, including GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance, who have claimed he misrepresented his military record and falsely suggested he evaded an overseas deployment. Some context: Walz’s defense of his record comes after Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign acknowledged Saturday he “misspoke” during a 2018 campaign event when he said he handled assault weapons “in war.” After the Harris campaign shared a video of the 2018 remarks last week, Vance, who served in the Marine Corps, accused Walz of “stolen valor.” In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, Vance defended his attacks on Walz by arguing he is criticizing Walz’s statements about his record, rather than his actions while serving. Missouri voters will be deciding the future of abortion in their state through a statewide constitutional amendment on the ballot in November that would remove the state’s current ban on abortion. The ballot initiative would still allow abortion to be restricted after fetal viability except to protect the life or health of the mother, according to a Tuesday news release from Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft. Missouri’s law currently bans abortions except in medical emergencies. This initiative coincides with similar measures that will appear on various state ballots, including Florida, Nevada, Arizona, New York and others. Similar constitutional amendments have been successful on other ballots around the country in Republican-dominated states, including Kansas and Ohio. Rachel Sweet, the campaign manager for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, an organization that gathered signatures to place the initiative on the ballot, called the move “a major step forward for our campaign and for Missourians.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a campaign event in 2018 praised a Muslim cleric and leader in the Muslim community who has spread antisemitic content on Facebook, according to video newly revealed by the Washington Examiner.  The video features Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, speaking at an event hosted by the Muslim American Society of Minnesota during his first gubernatorial campaign, according to the Washington Examiner. In the video, Walz praises Imam Asad Zaman, executive director of the organization hosting the event, as a “master teacher” and briefly touches on their shared history.  Walz’s appearance alongside the Muslim cleric, one of several in recent years, came after Zaman had shared a link to a neo-Nazi propaganda film in 2015 portraying Adolf Hitler in a positive light. Zaman had also shared a Hamas press release in 2016 mourning the death of a Muslim politician in Bangladesh who was executed after being found guilty of war crimes. In the wake of the October 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel, Zaman has shared anti-Israel posts on social media. On the day of the attacks, he expressed solidarity for Palestinians “against Israeli attacks” while sharing a statement from the Muslim American Society of Minnesota condemning “Israel’s recent unprovoked attacks.” Earlier that day, Zaman shared a post arguing “Palestine has the right to defend itself.” In a statement to CNN, Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said that Walz and Zaman do not have a “personal relationship.”  “The Governor and he do not have a personal relationship. Governor Walz strongly condemns Hamas terrorism,” Hitt told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Zaman and the Muslim American Society of Minnesota for comment.   Read more about Walz’ past appearances with Zaman here. Julia Louis-Dreyfus will host a panel during the Democratic National Convention with the Democratic Governors Association to put a spotlight on female governors, the actress’ publicist confirmed to CNN. Louis-Dreyfus – who played the first fictional female vice president of the United States on HBO’s Emmy-winning “Veep” – is a longtime Democratic supporter and has spoken out publicly on women’s issues throughout her career. (HBO, like CNN, is owned by parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.) The panel, on August 21 during the week of the DNC in Chicago, will feature the country’s eight Democratic women governors: Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek. The “Seinfeld” star noted her excitement to moderate the panel at the DNC. Louis-Dreyfus – who won the Emmy for outstanding lead actress six times in a row for playing Selina Meyer on “Veep” – has seen a major resurgence with viewers re-discovering the show after President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this summer as the Democratic presidential candidate. As if life was imitating art, fans have noted the real-life similarities to the scripted show in which Louis-Dreyfus played the first female vice president who then became the first female president. CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report. The Trump campaign on Tuesday said it had raised $1 million off of the conversation former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk had on X Spaces the night before.  The campaign touted the reach of the interview and said 25 million X users listened to the interview from start to finish and that there were roughly 1.5 million concurrent listeners during the live stream.  The start of the conversation was delayed by more than 40 minutes on Monday night because of technical issues, and Musk and Trump engaged in a friendly conversation in which they praised each other and Trump repeated many of his campaign talking points. The former president made at least 20 false claims during the over two-hour conversation, CNN reported. “President Trump will do everything he can to bring his unscripted message directly to the people, something the fake news media refuses to do. While Kamala Harris enjoys the luxury of hiding from the press, President Trump accepted Elon’s invitation to have an unfiltered conversation about his America First policies with voters and people around the world,” Cheung said.  With less than 100 days until Election Day, the GOP and Democratic presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week as they look to make their pitch to voters. Here are scheduled campaign events to look out for the rest of the week: The Maine voter who filed a challenge objecting to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ballot access petition withdrew his objection the day before a schedule hearing on the challenge, Maine’s Secretary of State announced on Tuesday. The voter submitted a withdrawal request on Monday to Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows after her office announced Monday it would hold a hearing on the objection scheduled for Wednesday. Bellows dismissed the challenge following the withdrawal, according to the statement for her office. A New York judge ruled Monday that Kennedy’s ballot-access petition in the state is invalid, delivering the first major blow to the independent presidential candidate’s bid for nationwide ballot access. A pro-Kamala Harris group seeking to combat third party candidates has organized challenges in Pennsylvania and Illinois. Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in 17 states thus far, making him eligible for 220 electoral votes. His campaign says it’s completed signature gathering in every state and Washington, DC. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Tuesday shared a dehumanizing anti-immigrant meme that said “Your neighborhood under Trump” with a photo of a house with an American flag, and then “Your neighborhood under Kamala” with a photo of a crowd of dozens of migrants who had recently arrived in New York City. The account describes itself as the “Official War Room account of the 2024 Trump campaign.” The caption of the meme was, “Import the third world, Become the third world!” The photo, taken earlier this month, depicts dozens of migrants who had just arrived in New York City and are waiting to secure temporary housing, according to Getty Images.  Trump regularly spews anti-immigrant rhetoric on the campaign trail and claims the US has become a “third world country” under President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. The description of the meme has been updated in the headline and post.  Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday pointed to Vice President Kamala Harris’ past support of a ban on fracking — something a Harris campaign official said last month she no longer supports.  Harris enthusiastically supported a ban on fracking during her 2020 presidential campaign, telling CNN during a 2019 town hall, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.” Fracking is the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations – and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. A Harris campaign official said last month she no longer supports a fracking ban. Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally on Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  Trump also posted earlier in the day, “KAMALA HARRIS GOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE WAY ON HER LIFELONG POLICIES REGARDING ENERGY, HEALTHCARE, CRIME, AND BORDER. WHAT A JOKE SHE IS!!!” Former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who faced pressure from Donald Trump to find fraud in the 2020 election, on Tuesday announced that he’s endorsing the former president for reelection and GOP Senate nominee Kari Lake, arguing that “differences aside, there is too much on the line.” CNN reported that Trump had called Ducey after the 2020 election to discuss the results, pressuring him to find fraud in the Arizona presidential election. Trump had publicly attacked Ducey for the state’s certification of the 2020 presidential election results, in which he lost Arizona to Joe Biden by less than 11,000 votes. Lake, a former local news anchor, ran and lost the race to fill term-limited Ducey’s governor’s seat in 2022. The Trump supporter and election denier more recently won her Senate primary last month to face off against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in one of this fall’s most important races in the battle for control of the chamber. “Differences aside, there is too much on the line and only a Republican in the White House and a majority in the House and US Senate can ensure it,” Ducey wrote Tuesday. Ducey added that the border must be secured, inflation tamed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made permanent, and that “America must be respected around the globe and World War III must be avoided.” Local and federal law enforcement officials say Chicago is prepared to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention next week while ensuring the safety and security of attendees and residents alike.  When asked about the security lapse that led to the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last month, Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer said the department is learning all the time, but there is no comparison between the two events. “This is a whole-of-government approach we’ve been planning for this convention for well over a year. So, we can’t compare the two,” he said. Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling also noted the yearlong training officers have embarked on with federal, state, and county partners to ensure that the event venue will be secure while promising that police resources will be present “in every single neighborhood.” “We will not deplete resources from our neighborhoods to simply put in the area where the Democratic National Convention is being held,” said Snelling. Snelling also emphasized the importance of allowing protesters the space and time to express their First Amendment rights but stopped short of saying there would be no arrests. Preventative measures including street closures and parking restrictions will be in place, especially near the United Center, where the convention will be held. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Tuesday continued to pressure Vice President Kamala Harris to answer more questions from reporters. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung pointed to Trump’s two-hour conversation with Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk. However, Musk is not a reporter and asked Trump softball questions on comfortable topics that allowed the former president to repeat his main campaign talking points. Trump also repeated many falsehoods and his claims went unchallenged by Musk, who has endorsed and praised Trump. The spokesperson added, “Team Kamala has now reverted back to what Team Biden was known for — a bunch of whiners and complainers with a low-energy candidate unable to engage with the press or media.” Investigators are sorting through a barrage of tips in their efforts to identify the suspect behind the break-in at former President Donald Trump’s campaign office in Virginia, a person familiar with the investigation told CNN. That person said local law enforcement hasn’t found evidence yet that the incident was politically motivated. The investigation by the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office is still in its initial phases. Investigators have focused on determining whether anything was stolen from the campaign office in Ashburn and whether the suspect left behind any surveillance equipment, the person told CNN. Trump’s Virginia office is on the first floor of a quiet brick office building one hour outside of Washington, DC. A manager of that building told CNN that there wasn’t any damage from the break-in.  The sheriff’s office received a call Sunday night about a burglary at the campaign office, which also serves as the headquarters of the Virginia 10th District Republican Committee. The sheriff’s office has released images from surveillance video showing the suspect wearing dark clothing and a cap and carrying a backpack.  Investigators are using facial recognition technology to try to identify the suspect and are working to understand his motive, the source said. Thomas Julia, a spokesperson for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, said investigators have received “tons” of tips about the break-in but declined to comment further. The United Auto Workers union on Tuesday filed federal labor charges against former President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk for threatening to intimidate workers who go on strike. During Trump’s interview on X Monday night with Musk, who is also the principal owner of the social media platform, the pair discussed a potential role for Musk in Trump’s administration should he get reelected. Trump called Musk “the cutter,” and praised Musk for his anti-union stances. “I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike – I won’t mention the name of the company – but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. Every one of you is gone,” Trump said. Musk could be heard laughing and replying “yeah.” The UAW, which recently endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, filed separate charges against Trump and Musk Monday to the National Labor Relations Board. The charges claim the former president and the Tesla CEO had “interfered with, restrained or coerced employees” who were exercising their right to organize against the company, “suggesting he would fire employees engaged in protected concerted activity, including striking.” Read more about the charges here. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday complained about news coverage of the conversation he and Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk had on the platform Monday night. The virtual event kicked off after a more than 40-minute delay because of technical difficulties.  Trump is saying the servers crashed “because of the tremendous volume” but Musk claimed a distributed denial-of-service attack had overwhelmed the company’s servers. It is unclear what the technical issue was. “DDOS,” or distributed denial of service, is a common attack method in which hackers flood a site with phony traffic to overwhelm its systems and attempt to knock it offline. Early Tuesday, however, Musk also blamed mistakes by X’s staff for the snafu that prevented people from joining the stream in a post on the platform. Musk didn’t specify what kind of mistakes he believed X staffers made or how a DDOS attack would have targeted a specific stream but not brought down the rest of the X platform, which remained operational during the Trump stream meltdown. Republican Senate Candidate Eric Hovde downplayed the impact that the momentum of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign may have on down-ballot races in battleground Wisconsin. Hovde, who is favored to win the GOP primary to face Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, called the energy surrounding Harris, “temporary enthusiasm.” Harris campaigned last week in western Wisconsin with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “I think everybody on the Democratic side was very depressed about realizing how bad Joe Biden was from a mental capacity standpoint. So of course, you’re going to get that kind of bump. But look, I feel there’s enormous amount of energy on the Republican side,” he said, pointing to real issues that Americans are struggling with related to consumer credit and loans and food and housing costs. Asked by CNN about the potential impact on his race if former President Donald Trump, who has already endorsed him, continues to slip in the polls in the battleground state, Hovde answered, “my race from day one has been about running for the US Senate and my race. I appreciate President Trump’s support, and I’m supportive of his campaign.” The Wisconsin businessman, who has trailed Baldwin in statewide polling, said he’s “not getting caught up in the polls at all,” pointing to how Trump won the state in 2016 after appearing to be behind Hillary Clinton. GOP Rep. Larry Bucshon of Indiana dismissed concerns about whether Project 2025 will impact the election or heavily influence voters – pointing to the former President Donald Trump’s disavowal of the set of conservative policy proposals.  Project 2025 is a 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation. It has attracted significant media attention, with plans listed under the “Mandate for Leadership” section including banning pornography, reversing federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, excluding the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act and making it harder for transgender adults to transition, The project has featured prominently in Vice President Kamala Harris’ stump speeches as she has made the case against another Trump presidency “I don’t think it’ll have an effect at all, honestly. I think, though, I think the Democrats will continue to use it, but I don’t think that will have a substantial impact,” Buschson told reporters. New Mexico Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján defended vice presidential candidate Tim Walz after the Harris campaign acknowledged the Minnesota governor misspoke when he said he had carried weapons “in war.” Luján said the upfront approach contrasts with the Republican candidates, former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Luján said Walz’s admission highlights the difference “between their side and our side,” and he noted “there should be no mistake about his service to our country as well.” The senator also commented on Monday’s conversation that Elon Musk conducted with Trump on X, which he said demonstrates why Trump will not be reelected.   “The more that Elon Musk interviews the former president, the less that I have to talk about the previous president, ‘cause they’re going to do all the talking for us, and then to show the American people why the former president will not be president of the United States ever again,” he said. In the four weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out and upended the 2024 presidential race, both parties have unleashed a flood of advertising, blitzing national airwaves and battleground states with total of nearly $300 million in spending, including TV and digital ads. During that crucial stretch, including reservations through this Sunday — four weeks since Biden withdrew, from July 21 to August 18 — Democrats have outspent Republicans by about $173 million to about $119 million, according to AdImpact data. Seven battleground states have been the focus of more than $212 of that ad spending, and Pennsylvania leads all others by a wide margin, accounting for $70.6 million of the total. And across those seven key battleground states over the four-week stretch since Biden dropped out, Republicans lead Democrats in ad spending, by about $109 million to $99 million. Here’s the breakdown of ad spend in other states: Connecticut, Vermont, Minnesota, and Wisconsin will hold their primaries for congressional and statewide offices on Tuesday.  Here are some of the key races to watch for: Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday will deliver her first policy speech “focused on her plan to lower costs for middle-class families and take on corporate price-gouging” in Raleigh, North Carolina, according to Harris-Walz campaign senior spokesperson Kevin Munoz. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Harris said the rollout of her policy platform will “be focused on the economy and what we need to do to bring down costs and also strengthen the economy.” The world’s richest man and its once-and-possibly future most-powerful man agreed on almost everything. Tech titan Elon Musk threw open his X platform on Monday night, offering Donald Trump a pipeline free of fact checks for his falsehoods, conspiracy theories and extremism as he tries to slow the rise of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The chat represented yet another extraordinary chapter in a presidential campaign that has defied logic with its stunning twists in recent weeks, including an assassination attempt against Trump and President Joe Biden’s ending of his reelection bid. The former president has been floundering, struggling to cope with the new Democratic nominee’s soaring start. At times, during their expansive chat, Musk seemed to be using the power of his profile and platform to coach Trump on how to mount a better argument against Harris. “She’s a believer in being radical left,” Trump said at one point of a Democratic foe who has erased his polling advantage in only three weeks as a candidate. And the former president, who attempted to overturn an election he lost, baselessly claimed that Biden had been illegally ousted to make way for Harris. Musk agreed with Trump that Harris was a radical leftist and flattered his guest by implying that he was strong and his Democratic opponents were weak. He referred to America’s enemies and said: Musk has already endorsed Trump, and he was leaving no doubt on Monday night that he wants to see him win a second term. “You are the path to prosperity. And I think Kamala is the opposite,” he told Trump. Read the full story. Advisers to former President Donald Trump celebrated his conversation with X owner and billionaire Elon Musk, touting the viewership. Following the interview on Monday night, Musk claimed it reached 1 billion views. “Combined views of the conversation with @realDonaldTrump and subsequent discussion by other accounts now ~1 billion,” Musk said on X. Trump’s advisers have said talks like Monday’s are meant to reach nontraditional voters — specifically first-time voters and low propensity voters who don’t engage in politics in a typical fashion, but who the campaign believes they can draw out to vote for Trump in November. However, some allies to the former president question the decision for him to sit for unscripted, and often off message, conversations, like the one on Monday with Musk. “Did he get a lot of views, yes, but did he focus on policy issues? Not really,” one source close to Trump said. In recent days, allies have both privately and publicly lamented Trump’s inability or unwillingness to focus on the issues they believe will help him win the election — immigration, inflation and crime, instead of personal attacks and conspiracy theories. As a venture capitalist, JD Vance repeatedly touted his guiding principles for investing in a company: A business should not only turn a profit, it should also help American communities. That’s why, he said, he invested in AppHarvest, a startup that promised a high-tech future for farming and for the workers of Eastern Kentucky. Over a four-year span, Vance was an early investor, board member and public pitchman for the indoor-agriculture company. “It’s not just a good investment opportunity, it’s a great business that’s making a big difference in the world,” Vance proclaimed in a Fox Business interview on the day the company went public in February 2021. Last year, facing hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, AppHarvest declared bankruptcy. The rise and fall of the company, and Vance’s role in it, cuts against his image as a champion for the working class — an image that helped catapult him to the top of the Republican ticket as Donald Trump’s running mate. A CNN review of public documents, and interviews with a dozen former workers, shows that AppHarvest not only failed as a business after pursuing rapid growth, but also provided a grim job experience for many of the working-class Kentuckians Vance has vowed to help. AppHarvest employees said they were forced to work in grueling conditions inside the company’s greenhouse, where temperatures often soared into the triple digits. Complaints filed with the US Department of Labor and a Kentucky regulator between 2020 and 2023 show that workers alleged they were given insufficient water breaks and weren’t provided adequate safety gear. Some workers said they suffered heat exhaustion or injuries, though state inspectors did not find violations. Read more about the allegations here. Tuesday’s Senate primary in Wisconsin is set to formalize a matchup that has been in general election mode for months, as the parties contest one of the most competitive 2024 Senate races. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is seeking her third term in the perennial battleground state, and she’s likely to face off against Eric Hovde, a Republican businessman with the backing of the national party, who has poured at least $13 million from his personal fortune into his bid, according to the latest FEC data available. Already, the race has seen nearly $66 million in ad spending, with Democrats outspending Republicans by about $40 million to $26 million. Both sides have been active early, flooding the airwaves with ads promoting each candidate and attacking their rival. One of the ads promotes Baldwin’s work on legislation to lower health care costs. Another launched last week highlights her work on legislation to provide health care to veterans suffering from exposure to toxic burn pits, an effort that has been highlighted by several vulnerable Democratic incumbents in their campaign ads. Baldwin and her allies, meanwhile, have also been on offense, running waves of aggressive attack spots branding Hovde as a carpetbagger, criticizing his rhetoric, and slamming his policy positions. On the other side, Hovde has put his millions to work, airing ads that seek to introduce him to Wisconsin voters, touting his connections to the state as he looks to blunt Democratic criticism while laying out a conservative vision with a focus on economic issues and immigration. Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who owns X, spoke for more than two hours on the social media platform on Monday night. The former president fielded friendly questions that steered him toward campaign talking points, while slamming Vice President Kamala Harris’ stances on the economy and immigration. Here are some highlights: Most of the falsehoods Donald Trump uttered in his conversation with Elon Musk on X on Monday were claims that have been repeatedly debunked before, some for years. Inflation: Trump said, “I think we have the worst inflation we’ve had in 100 years. They say it’s 48 years, I don’t believe it.” Facts First: Trump framed this as an opinion, but it’s baseless – wrong in two different ways. First, even when the inflation rate hit its Biden-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022, that 9.1% rate was the highest since 1981 – between 40 and 41 years prior, certainly not “100 years” and not even “48 years.” Second, inflation has declined sharply since the June 2022 peak, and the most recent available rate at the time he spoke, for July 2024, was 3.2% – a rate that, the Biden presidency aside, was exceeded as recently as 2011. Harris and prisoners: Trump claimed “(Harris) wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention, and some of these guys are really bad. That just came out today.” Facts First: This is false. There is no basis for the claim that Harris “wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention.” Trump appeared to be referring to news stories in conservative media that reported that Harris had said in 2019, while unsuccessfully running in the Democratic presidential primary, that she wanted to close privately-run immigration detention centers.  Migration numbers: Trump claimed that, under Biden and Harris, “you have millions of people coming in a month.” Facts First: This is false. There has not been any month under the Biden-Harris administration where even close to “millions” of people entered the country illegally. In the peak month during this administration for what the government calls border “encounters,” December 2023, there were 370,890 encounters. Even if you factor in so-called “gotaways,” people who evaded the Border Patrol to sneak into the country, there is no basis for the claim that “millions” of people are entering in a single month. Trump’s tax cuts: Trump repeated his claim that his signature tax cuts, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, were “the largest tax cut” ever provided. Facts First: Trump is wrong. Analyses have found that his tax cut law was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars. Multiple lies: Trump also made false and misleading claims about global warming, the Biden administration and Trump’s legal cases, the situation before Right to Try, military equipment and Afghanistan, China’s purchases of Iranian oil, Iran and funding for “terror” groups, Europe trade, Ukraine aid, the 2020 election, deportations to Central America, migration and “the Congo,” Venezuela, and crime. Read the full list of fact checks. Kamala Harris has quickly erased several of the advantages Donald Trump enjoyed over Joe Biden when it comes to the key personal attributes voters prize in a president. But the most formidable personal quality voters see in the former president – his perceived strength – still looms as a critical obstacle Harris must overcome to win the White House. Voters have long viewed Trump as a strong leader, capable of keeping them safe, and as they grew more skeptical about Biden’s physical and mental capacity, Trump’s advantage grew to towering proportions this year. But Harris’ energy and strong, confident speaking style at her boisterous rallies over just the past three weeks ago have stirred optimism among Democrats that she can reset the debate over strength and neutralize, or at least reduce, Trump’s traditional edge on that measure. Harris will need to rebut an intensifying Republican effort to portray her as weak. That offensive is likely to center on issues relating to Americans’ physical security, including crime, immigration and national defense. The two sides are already hotly contesting the terrain of strength. Spokespeople for the Trump campaign routinely describe Harris as weak; the principal super PAC backing Trump recently released an ad describing her positions on criminal justice issues as “dangerously liberal.” In an interview on Fox News, Trump implied that Harris’ gender made her too soft to stand up to other world leaders. “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy,” Trump insisted. “They’re gonna walk all over her.” Harris, in turn, is airing an ad in swing states that touts her credentials on the two issues Republicans are most determined to use against her. “Kamala Harris has spent decades fighting violent crime,” the ad begins, before concluding: “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” Read the full analysis. Former President Barack Obama is expected to deliver a primetime address on Tuesday of next week’s Democratic Convention, according to two people familiar with the planning.  That makes for three presidents that delegates will hear from during their gathering in Chicago: Obama, former President Bill Clinton and President Joe Biden, who will speak on the first night of the proceedings on Monday.  Planning for the convention was still underway and speaking slots could change, sources said. Biden’s address is still in the works, according to a source, but will obviously be a markedly different address than he would have expected to deliver three weeks ago, when he was still the Democratic standard bearer. Law enforcement officers are investigating a break-in late Sunday at former President Donald Trump’s campaign office in Ashburn, Virginia, in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office said it was called around 9 p.m. Sunday for a burglary at the office, which is being leased by the Trump campaign and also operates as the headquarters of the Virginia 10th District Republican Committee. Investigators say they have surveillance video showing the burglary suspect inside the campaign office wearing dark clothing, a dark cap and a backpack. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Read the full story. Donald Trump’s campaign, which has whiffed in its early attacks on Kamala Harris’ new presidential campaign, will grapple this week for a more effective foothold after the vice president transformed an election of stunning surprises. The ex-president has deployed some of his most trusted political tools — targeting racial identity, creating alternative realities, flinging insults and gaslighting. On Sunday he spread a new false conspiracy theory over the size of Harris’ rally crowd in Michigan last week. But his efforts to bring down his new adversary and her policy of ignoring his provocations have so far highlighted his own liabilities more than hers and emphasized the way Harris could offer a new choice for voters. When the ex-president called Harris “dumb” at a Montana rally Friday night or falsely claimed last month that she “happened to turn Black,” he may have delighted his base voters. But those kinds of comments risk alienating women and swing-state voters, as well as reversing the gains he has made among minorities that he’d proudly highlighted for months. Trump’s campaign was also forced on Saturday to deny a report in The New York Times that he’d privately referred to Harris as a “b*tch” as he bemoaned her momentum. Trump’s undisciplined news conference last week and a weekend of venting also suggest that the Republican nominee is far from coming to terms with the shift in a race that seemed to be heading in his direction three weeks ago when bullish Republicans left their convention predicting a landslide. But a swing-state tour by Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, conjured euphoria not experienced by Democrats in years. It left Trump fuming that his victory in his debate with President Joe Biden only led to a new battle — one he’s more in danger of losing. Read the full analysis."
Both Trump and Harris want to eliminate taxes on tips. This is how it could affect workers | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:59 PM EDT, Tue August 13, 2024",2024-08-12T22:51:20.883Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/no-tip-tax-trump-harris/index.html,"With the presidential campaign heating up, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are making a play for service and hospitality workers’ votes by promising to eliminate taxes on tips. But the move likely wouldn’t help many tipped workers, largely because a sizable share don’t earn enough to pay federal income taxes, experts say. Neither Trump, who announced the idea at a Las Vegas rally in June, nor Harris, who voiced her support for the policy in Las Vegas on Saturday, have released detailed proposals, which would have to go through Congress. Among the questions are how much tipped income would be free of taxes, whether any guardrails would be put in place to prevent fraud and abuse and whether both federal income and payroll taxes would be eliminated. Harris would couple her plan to eliminate taxes on tips with a push for Congress to raise the minimum wage, a Harris campaign official said. Also, the proposal would include an income limit and prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation to try to take advantage of the policy. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes. Trump on Tuesday suggested he supported eliminating federal income and payroll taxes on tips, clarifying that his proposal would cover both levies. “We’re looking at doing the full bore,” Trump said in an interview with Spectrum News 1 in North Carolina when asked if he supported eliminating both federal income and payroll taxes. Such a measure would require congressional approval. Soon after Trump promised in June to get rid of taxes on tips, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill titled “No Tax on Tips Act,” which would allow workers to deduct tips paid by cash, check, credit card and debit card on their federal income taxes. However, it would not eliminate federal payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare and total 15.3%, half of which is paid by employers. The legislation is supported by Democratic Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, a key swing state where many residents work in the hospitality industry. Other bills introduced in the House include different provisions, such as eliminating both federal income and payroll taxes or placing a cap on the amount of tip income that could be excluded from taxes. About 4 million people worked in tipped occupations in 2023, or about 2.5% of all employment, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University, a policy research center. They include waiters, bartenders, for-hire drivers, food delivery workers, hairdressers and hotel staffers, among others. More establishments, such as quick-service restaurants, have added tipping options in recent years. The federal minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour, but they must make at least the federal hourly minimum wage of $7.25 or their employers have to cover the difference. Many states and municipalities have higher minimum wages and minimum tipped wages, while some states have eliminated lower minimum wages for tipped workers. Tipped workers are typically younger and lower paid. Their typical weekly wage in 2023 was $538, including tips, compared with $1,000 for non-tipped workers, according to the Budget Lab. That means many earn too little to owe federal income taxes – 37% of tipped workers fell into this category in 2022, the Budget Lab found. “If you don’t pay income tax right now, it’s not going to help you very much,” Ernie Tedeschi, the Budget Lab’s director of economics and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Biden administration, said of the proposals to end taxes on tips. What’s more, nearly two-thirds of tipped restaurant workers would not benefit from the proposals since they don’t earn enough to pay federal income taxes, according to an analysis by One Fair Wage, an advocacy group. The proposals wouldn’t do much for low- and moderate-income workers in general. Even among workers at the bottom of the income ladder making less than $17.66 an hour, only 5% are in tipped jobs, the Budget Lab found. “This is good politics, but bad policy,” said Erica York, senior economist and research director at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. York expressed concern that eliminating taxes on tips would be overly complicated and unfair to workers other than the “tiny slice” who would benefit. “The fact the Harris campaign is talking about guardrails and income limits gives you a hint there might be some problems,” York said. “It fails on equity grounds and neutrality.” Also, it’s unclear how employers and customers could react to such a policy change. For instance, if more workers flock to tipped jobs, employers could try to pay them less in wages, Tedeschi said. Or companies could try to shift more positions – such as ones that rely on commissions – to tipped jobs. And customers, many of whom already have tipping fatigue, might resist and tip less. The powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Nevada, however, said it supports ending taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers, as well as raising the federal minimum wage. Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge praised Harris, whom the union endorsed last week, saying in a statement Saturday that she “acknowledged the hard working men and women of the hospitality industry.” However, when Trump floated the proposal in June, Pappageorge said, “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.” The union changed its position because there are now bills in Congress that have support from Nevada senators and representatives, including two lawmakers who were former Culinary Union members, said Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson. This “enables hospitality workers to have a seat at the table as conversations around the bill continue to develop,” she told CNN. Removing federal taxes on tips would also increase the federal budget deficit, though the amount would depend on what provisions the legislation contains. Just excluding tips from federal income taxes could reduce revenues by at least $107 billion over 10 years, according to the Tax Foundation. If both federal income and payroll taxes were eliminated, it would lower revenue by $150 billion to $250 billion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Just getting rid of federal income taxes on tips would lead to a loss of about half that size. This story has been updated with additional information."
"Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar will defeat primary challenger, CNN projects, breaking ‘squad’ losing streak | CNN Politics","Updated 10:52 PM EDT, Tue August 13, 2024",2024-08-14T02:47:15.657Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/politics/ilhan-omar-minnesota-primary-election/index.html,"Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar will beat back a primary challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, CNN projects, all but guaranteeing that the four original members of the “squad” of progressive House Democrats will be on the ballot this November. First elected in 2018, Omar, who also beat Samuels last cycle, has now defended her 5th District seat in three consecutive primary elections. Two other original “squad” members, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both eased to renomination earlier this year, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts is unopposed in her primary next month. Omar’s victory is a salve for progressives, especially those critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, after a pair of high-profile losses to moderate Democratic primary challengers heavily backed by big-spending pro-Israel outside groups. Those organizations, which spearheaded the unseating of “squad” members Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, did not invest in Omar’s Minneapolis-area district, a deep blue enclave where Democrats tend to run up the score in statewide elections. By its closing days, the race had seen just around $3 million in ad spending, with Omar’s campaign accounts contributing $2.75 million on their own. The United Democracy Project, a super PAC aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that has spent tens of millions targeting other progressive Democrats this cycle, did not engage in the race. AIPAC directly spent about $25,000 on a digital ad campaign last year targeting Omar – an outspoken critic of Israel – but has not been active in the 2024 contest. In her campaign ads, Omar touted her progressive policy successes, promoted her work in Congress and highlighted the need to protect abortion rights. “Abortion bans, attacks on IVF. Extremist Republicans are putting our rights and freedoms on the line,” says a woman featured in one of Omar’s spots. “My daughter can have fewer rights than me. I’m thankful, hopeful, because Ilhan Omar is in Congress.” Another ad ticked through her legislative efforts. “She passed the Meals Act to feed school kids and brought $54 million right here to our community to create food security, affordable housing, health care, access, environmental projects and living wage jobs,” the narrator says. Most of the political drama around Omar this cycle involved her defense of campus protesters against the war in Gaza, her own daughter among them. “I think it is really unfortunate that people don’t care about the fact that all Jewish kids should be kept safe, and that we should not have to tolerate antisemitism or bigotry for all Jewish students, whether they’re pro-genocide or anti-genocide,” Omar told reporters during a visit this spring to New York City, prompting immediate pushback to the claim that some Jewish people are “pro-genocide.” Citing reports on the alleged harassment of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and other Arab Americans, Omar, in a response to criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, accused the group of hypocrisy. “This is the pro-genocide I was talking about,” Omar posted on social media, “can you condemn this like I have condemned antisemitism and bigotry of all kind? With limited airtime, Samuels leveled sharp attacks against Omar, accusing her of undercutting the Democratic Party – a similar attack to the one used against Bowman and Bush, but without the amplification of a multimillion-dollar spending spree. “Ilhan Omar has gone missing on the issues that matter most for us,” one Samuels ad charged. “Omar advocated abolishing the police with gun violence surging, and voted against President Biden’s plan to rebuild roads and bridges and expand public transportation and EV charging networks. We deserve better.” Omar has frequently been accused of baking antisemitism into her criticism of Israel, which well preceded the October 7 Hamas attacks and the monthslong assault on Gaza that followed. She was the unnamed subject of a House resolution condemning “anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry” in 2019. That followed a social media exchange in which she suggested that Israel’s foreign allies were motivated by money, writing, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby.” Omar, though she has never backed off her criticism of the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians, apologized for the post, saying she did not mean to offend her “constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole.” “This is why I unequivocally apologize,” Omar said. Two years ago, she eked out an unexpectedly tight primary victory over Samuels, who came within some 2,500 votes of ousting her. But while other progressive elected officials have frequently been confronted with bigger spending challenges from more polished candidates after similar close calls, Omar was mostly an afterthought on the primary circuit this year after taking the 2022 race as a warning and amping up her campaign apparatus. She also again enjoyed the support of Minnesota’s junior senator, Tina Smith, along with Omar’s predecessor in Congress, former Rep. Keith Ellison, now the state’s attorney general. On her website, Omar also highlighted – in block quotation – supportive words from President Joe Biden. “Congresswoman Omar, I want thank you for being here,” Biden said during a 2023 visit to Minnesota. “You never stop working to level the playing field for everybody. And you make sure no child goes hungry.”"
Analysis: Musk tries to help Trump halt the Harris surge | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:31 AM EDT, Tue August 13, 2024",2024-08-13T04:17:51.137Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/politics/musk-trump-harris-analysis/index.html,"The world’s richest man and its once-and-possibly future most powerful man agreed on almost everything. Tech titan Elon Musk threw open his X platform on Monday night, offering Donald Trump a pipeline free of fact checks for his falsehoods, conspiracy theories and extremism as he tries to slow the rise of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The chat represented yet another extraordinary chapter in a presidential campaign that has defied logic with its stunning twists in recent weeks, including an assassination attempt against Trump and President Joe Biden’s ending of his reelection bid. The former president has been floundering – struggling to cope with the soaring start by the new Democratic nominee. At times, during their expansive chat, Musk seemed to be using the power of his profile and platform to coach Trump on how to mount a better argument against Harris. “She’s a believer in being radical left,” Trump said at one point of a Democratic foe who has erased his polling advantage in only three weeks as a candidate. And the former president, who attempted to overturn an election he lost, baselessly claimed that Biden had been illegally ousted to make way for Harris. “She hasn’t done an interview since this whole scam started, and say what you want, this was a coup. This was a coup of a president of the United States,” Trump fumed. Musk agreed with Trump that Harris was a radical leftist and flattered his guest by implying that he was strong and his Democratic opponents were weak. He referred to America’s enemies and said, “Do they fear the American president, or is it someone they do not respect and do not fear? Let’s look at the footage of the assassination. Like, okay, you know, President Trump is like, don’t mess with me.” Musk has already endorsed Trump, and he was leaving no doubt on Monday night that he wants to see him win a second term. “You are the path to prosperity. And I think Kamala is the opposite,” he told Trump. Musk, who has huge business interests in securing favorable treatment from the next administration, provided the Republican nominee an audience of at least 1.3 million concurrent listeners at the worst moment of his campaign so far. And he predicted at least 100 million people would consume the content in the coming days. At times during the event, Trump — who spent months hammering Biden over his age, stutter and struggles to sometimes complete sentences — appeared to be lisping or slurring his words. It was not clear whether an audio issue was to blame. Asked for an explanation, the ex-president’s campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said: “Must be your hearing.” The chummy conversation between the tycoon and the former president also showed what each man had to gain. Musk was able to impress upon a possible future president, who is known for transactional leadership, his own views on immigration, the economy, curtailing government regulation and tax cuts. Musk’s companies, including SpaceX, a key player in the US space program, and Tesla, which makes electric vehicles, can be impacted by changes in government policy. The entire conversation was rife with potential conflicts of interest. No ordinary American would ever have a similar opportunity to have the ear of a possible future president. At one point, Musk even offered to take a position in the US government — perhaps as part of an efficiency commission to slash the administrative state. Trump said he’d “love it” if Musk got involved, noting the multi-billionaire is a great “cutter.” Trump gained plenty from his investment of more than two hours of his time. Musk didn’t challenge him on any of his lies and misrepresentations – for instance, his prediction that 60 million undocumented migrants would invade the United States if he lost in November. During the talk, Musk downplayed the threat from global warming while defending his pioneering electric vehicle empire. Trump, meanwhile, warned about the threat from “nuclear warming,” which he said posed a greater danger than “global warming.” It was not clear if he was trying to refer to nuclear power – which Musk argued was “not as scary as people think.” The encounter was a powerful example of the way that presidential politics has been transformed by social media and the splintering of traditional journalism. Trump may not have been president without Twitter, as his emergence as a political force in 2016 coincided with the site’s heyday. His skills at exploiting the new medium like no other politician made that year’s presidential election a unique combination of a man and his moment. Eight years on, under the leadership of Musk, who preaches unfettered free speech, X has dismantled many of the safeguards against the propagation of falsehoods and conspiracy theories on the site. It is, therefore, a perfect venue for the ex-president to escape the constraints of traditional media and to spin his web of alternative reality — which is hugely popular among his millions of supporters. Republicans are complaining about what they say is flattering media coverage of the nascent Harris run. But few candidates have had an easier ride than the Republican nominee got on X on Monday night. In a sign of the international political questions raised by the evolution of X, a European commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote to Musk to warn him that he must prevent the “amplification of harmful content,” which could be accessed by consumers inside the bloc. Cheung warned on X that the EU should “mind their own business instead of trying to meddle in the US Presidential election,” in an exchange that appeared to auger poorly for already testy relations between the Trump team and Musk and Europe. Trump spooled out countless falsehoods and exaggerations on Monday night, including over the numbers of migrants who crossed the border, the extent of the inflation crisis that has now cooled, his legal troubles, the current administration’s energy policy and his familiar claim that foreign nations were dumping their prisoners across the southern US border. There is no doubt that many of Trump’s voters, listening in or hearing highlights of the conversation in the coming days, will agree with what much of the former president said in a way that underscores his political viability even after Harris transformed the race. At points, Trump did make a more coherent and focused argument for a second term than he has in recent days, when he has appeared to be discombobulated by the shift in a race he believed he was primed to win against Biden. He and Musk accused the current president and the vice president of adopting spending policies that fueled the inflation that has been painful for millions of Americans. But Trump’s constant meanderings and amplification of conspiracy theories also demonstrated why many voters disdain him and why there are questions about his appeal to suburban and women voters in battleground states. Early on, it seemed as though the session would become a fresh metaphor for Trump’s misfires, as it was delayed by technical glitches. Musk claimed that a distributed denial-of-service attack was to blame, although it was not possible to immediately confirm that bad actors had been responsible. “There is a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say,” Musk said. The Harris campaign was quick to respond, posting a Trump Truth Social post from last year that lambasted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over the troubled start to his primary campaign in a glitchy Twitter Spaces event with Musk. The event marked Trump’s return to X, formerly known as Twitter, from which he was banned by the site’s previous owners after the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by his mob. His account was restored by Musk. Anyone who listened to the full two-hour conversation would have learned more about Musk’s evolving political views – and his growing willingness to use his power and wealth to express them – than anything fresh about Trump. But the ex-president was gushingly grateful for a new friend in a time of political need. “You’re an amazing guy, you’ve done an incredible job. You are a great inspiration to people,” Trump said before saying goodbye."
Analysis: How Harris is reversing Biden’s biggest weakness in the campaign | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 AM EDT, Tue August 13, 2024",2024-08-13T04:00:02.550Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/politics/harris-trump-strength-analysis/index.html,"Kamala Harris has quickly erased several of the advantages Donald Trump enjoyed over Joe Biden when it comes to the key personal attributes voters prize in a president. But the most formidable personal quality voters see in the former president – his perceived strength – still looms as a critical obstacle Harris must overcome to win the White House. Voters have long viewed Trump as a strong leader, capable of keeping them safe, and as they grew more skeptical about Biden’s physical and mental capacity, Trump’s advantage grew to towering proportions this year. But Harris’ energy and strong, confident speaking style at her boisterous rallies over just the past three weeks ago have stirred optimism among Democrats that she can reset the debate over strength and neutralize, or at least reduce, Trump’s traditional edge on that measure. “American politics over the last decade has been defined by a frame that Donald Trump has imposed on it and has worked to his benefit, which is this strength frame,” said Democratic pollster Evan Roth Smith, who is leading the ongoing “Blueprint” project to measure voter attitudes about key themes in the 2024 presidential race. “Kamala Harris entering the picture and the sea change that has occurred in this race … has [produced] this sigh of deep relief among voters that maybe we can close this chapter in American history. And that includes discarding the political frame around strength that Donald Trump imposed on our politics. Not just the man himself, but the frame.” But to do that, it’s likely Harris will need to rebut an intensifying Republican effort to portray her as weak. That offensive is likely to center on issues relating to Americans’ physical security, including crime, immigration and national defense. Trump’s plan for blunting Harris’ momentum, some Democrats believe, could reprise elements of the 1988 presidential campaign that George H.W. Bush, and his fearsome campaign manager Lee Atwater, ran to devastatingly portray his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, as a weak, soft-on crime liberal. “If they decide to go in that direction and they use all the tools at their disposal, and they lie as much as Trump does every day, then it could be a very powerful attack,” said long-time Democratic consultant Tad Devine, who served as a senior strategist in the Dukakis campaign. “I think the Harris campaign has to be prepared for it.” The two sides are already hotly contesting the terrain of strength. Spokespeople for the Trump campaign routinely describe Harris as weak; the principal super PAC backing Trump recently released an ad describing her positions on criminal justice issues as “dangerously liberal.” In an interview on Fox News, Trump implied that Harris’ gender made her too soft to stand up to other world leaders. “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy,” Trump insisted. “They’re gonna walk all over her.” Harris, in turn, is airing an ad in swing states that touts her credentials on the two issues Republicans are most determined to use against her. “Kamala Harris has spent decades fighting violent crime,” the ad begins, before concluding: “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” Convincing Americans that the vice president is weak is so important for Republicans partly because, on a variety of important personal attributes, multiple polls show that voters are judging Harris more favorably than they did Biden — and, in many instances, more favorably than they do Trump. In a national Marquette Law School poll released last week, for instance, nearly 3-in-5 voters said they believed Harris has the right temperament to succeed as president. That was more than the just over one-half who had said the same about Biden in a Marquette poll this spring, and well above the roughly two-fifths in the new survey who said Trump had the right temperament to succeed. Similarly in that Marquette survey, only 35% of voters said Harris has “behaved corruptly.” That was well below not only the 61% who said the same of Trump but also the 44% who applied that description to Biden. Most dramatically, Harris’ entry into the race and Biden’s departure have largely flipped the debate about age. Polls all year have shown that a significant share of voters were dubious that Trump was still up to the job — a perception perhaps fueled by his frequent verbal flubs on the campaign trail, such as confusing Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley when talking about the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol. But those doubts about the former president’s capacity were almost completely overshadowed by the much broader concerns about Biden’s. With Harris in the race, however, suddenly it’s Trump’s age that stands out. In the Marquette Poll, nearly 3-in-5 of those surveyed agreed that Trump is too old to be president. That wasn’t nearly as many as the 4-in-5 who said that about Biden the last time Marquette asked the question in May, but it dwarfed the roughly 1-in-8 who expressed those concerns about Harris now. Other personal comparisons with Trump are also benefiting Harris. In a CBS News survey earlier this month, nearly 7-in-10 voters described her as energetic, well above the roughly 6-in-10 who applied that label to Trump. In the New York Times/Siena College polls of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin released over the weekend, significantly more voters in each of those critical swing states described Harris than Trump as intelligent and honest; more voters in each state said Trump had a clear vision for the country’s future, but in all three more than half said Harris did as well. But amid the long-standing questions about his temperament, honesty and ethics, and the more recent doubts about his age and mental capacity, the trump card for Trump has always been the perception that he’s a strong leader. Even before Biden’s disastrous performance in the June debate – where he struggled to finish sentences and sometimes appeared disoriented – far more voters described Trump than Biden as strong. Trump led Biden by nearly 20 percentage points on that measure in a Gallup Poll this spring. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who conducted surveys for Biden’s 2020 campaign, said his strength deficit to Trump had become a nearly insurmountable obstacle for his 2024 campaign. “This was a toxic conversation about age, effectiveness and strength,” Lake said. “We desperately needed to pivot what was the character dimension of this race, which was age and weakness vs. strength.” Biden’s campaign scheduled the unusual June debate in part to dispel those concerns. Instead, the debate catastrophically reinforced them, and Trump’s defiant response to the assassination attempt against him the next month only solidified the comparison. “Trump was the very picture of strength after his assassination attempt when he shook his fist, and Biden was the very picture of weakness after his blank stare during long stretches of the debate,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres. After the debate, Ayres told me he believed that to beat Biden, Trump would need to do little more than contrast those two images in television ads for the remainder of the campaign. With Harris replacing Biden, Ayres believes “the entire core comparisons” that had been boosting Trump “have been upended.” As a multiracial woman, Harris blunts Trump’s advantage against Biden in seeming to embody change, Ayres said. The strength argument has grown more complicated too, he believes: “Now it’s more of a male and female dynamic, but it doesn’t have the same sense of strength vs. weakness.” Lake also believes Harris can scramble the contrast on strength that had been benefiting Trump so much against Biden. “Ironically,” Lake said, for many voters “Joe Biden was like the female candidate – empathetic but perhaps weaker. Donald Trump was the male candidate.” Lake said the contrast between the two men invoked the old idea of Democrats as “the mommy party” and Republicans as “the daddy party.” “A bunch of blue-collar women felt safer with the daddy party than the mommy party,” Lake said. “The difference now is [Harris] is seen as tough as nails.” In the first round of polls since Harris replaced Biden, voters have been much more likely to view her than him as strong. In a late July New York Times/Siena national poll, the early August CBS survey and last week’s national Marquette Poll, almost exactly half of voters in each case described her as a strong leader or tough. That’s slightly more than the share who described Biden as strong in Gallup polling just a few weeks before his victory in 2020. But analysts in both parties say it’s premature for Democrats to assume from these initial polls that Harris has crossed the threshold of strength that voters expect in a president. For one thing, more voters in each survey described Trump as strong or tough (though the difference between them was smallest in the Marquette poll, the most recent). The surveys have also found a huge gender gap in the assessments of whether Harris and Trump are strong. Detailed results provided by Marquette show that while White women were only slightly more likely to describe Trump than Harris as strong, Trump’s advantage over her on that measure exceeded 25 percentage points among White men. In the July New York Times/Siena poll, only about one-sixth of White men without a college degree said they would describe Harris as a strong leader, according to results provided by Siena. Likewise, in the CBS poll, while the share of women of all races who called Trump “tough” was just 10 percentage points greater than the share who saw Harris that way, Trump’s advantage among men reached nearly 30 points. These assessments could make it difficult for Harris to maintain the minimum level of support among men she’ll likely need to win. Most important, voters have reached these initial assessments of Harris’ strength before Republicans have really begun their campaign to portray her as weak. On Monday, MAGA Inc, the principal super PAC backing Trump, released plans for a $100 million ad campaign over the next several weeks intended to persuade voters that Harris is a “soft-on-crime radical who is too dangerous for the White House,” according to a memo first reported in Politico. Devine, the long-time Democratic consultant, knows how powerfully such Republican arguments can land. In the 1988 campaign, Republicans pilloried Dukakis as soft on crime by highlighting the case of Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who committed a rape and assault while temporarily freed from jail under a Massachusetts “furlough” program. The ads focused on Horton, a Black man, drew widespread criticism for evoking racial stereotypes, but they were critical in helping Bush erase the large lead the Massachusetts governor enjoyed early in the summer of 1988. “The attacks against Dukakis took hold and we didn’t respond to them in the way we should have, as quickly as possible,” Devine said. Ayres, like many Republicans, believes Harris remains exposed to challenges over her record on crime as district attorney in San Francisco and attorney general in California, and her role on immigration policy in the Biden administration. “I think she’s incredibly vulnerable to far-left wing mindset that voters associate with ‘unsafe,’” Ayres said. “San Francisco is a mess. It’s an example of what liberal governance does — won’t get homeless off the street, crime running rampant, liberal prosecutors won’t go after criminals. That whole gestalt.” But Devine, like other Democrats, is cautiously optimistic that Republican attempts to portray Harris as weak on crime (and immigration) won’t cut as sharply as their attacks against Dukakis a generation ago. For starters, Devine noted, the backdrop is different: while violent crime (especially the murder rate) was steadily rising through the late 1980s, it has more recently been receding from its pandemic highs, with the first months of 2024 showing especially steep declines. One law enforcement analyst recently told CNN that 2024 could see the largest ever one-year decline in murders. Harris also has defenses unavailable to Dukakis: She can point to criminals or drug traffickers that she convicted (as she does in her new ad). In an analysis released earlier this month, the Blueprint project said that the biographical fact that most improved voters’ views of Harris was that “she prosecuted sex traffickers and other men who abused women, putting them behind bars.” (Harris highlights those experiences in her stump speech, too.) Roth Smith, the Blueprint project director, also argues that the vice president can demonstrate toughness not only through her record prosecuting violent criminals but also her lawsuits against powerful corporations. “Kamala Harris’ ability to say – ‘I put these bastards in a court room before and I will do it again’ – I think that’s important,” he said. “The American people are not looking for an economic technician right now. They are looking for someone who can wield the battle ax of the federal government a little bit against these people who are seen as taking advantage of American consumers.” At their convention last month, Republicans celebrated a very traditional definition of strength. They stressed Trump’s physical bravery and defiance after the assassination attempt and surrounded him with symbols of hyper-masculinity such as professional wrestler Hulk Hogan (who ripped off his shirt on stage), musician Kid Rock and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White. As the recent polls suggest, these conventionally masculine totems of strength still strike a chord with a large swathe of Americans, particularly men but also many working-class White women. But Lake, the Democratic pollster, pointed out that what Trump’s admirers see as strength, other voters, especially women, often see as “divisiveness, ego … even toxic masculinity.” If voters don’t consider Harris strong enough to keep them safe, they are not likely to worry much about those downsides of Trump’s brand of strength. But if voters ultimately view Harris as someone qualified to protect them in a dangerous world, the more corrosive elements of Trump’s leadership style may loom larger and transform his bristling definition  of strength into an electoral weakness."
These Pennsylvania voters illustrate Harris’ suburban challenge | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:02 PM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-12T17:11:57.993Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/harris-suburban-challenge-pennsylvania/index.html,"Carol Carty misses something in today’s Republican Party and searches for it in her music choices. “I was young when (Ronald) Reagan was around, but I really miss the ’80s,” Carty said. “I do. I’m now turning on ‘80s songs to go back to the ‘80s more than ever. I do feel like, in my lifetime, the Republican Party has changed with Donald Trump and not in a good way.” Carty is an attorney who lives just across the Philadelphia line in suburban Montgomery County. “It was very Republican when I was growing up,” Carty said in an interview in her Bala Cynwyd home. “And it is Democratic now.” Carty pines for the GOP that drew her in at the age of 18: a party defined by lower taxes, less regulation, respect for the courts and the Constitution. She wishes the GOP would support reasonable gun safety measures, and let women – not politicians or judges – make difficult decisions about reproductive rights. “A ‘Never Trump’ Republican,” Carty said. “That is how I would best label myself.” And yet as recently as a few weeks ago, she planned to vote for Trump — and it’s not out of the question that she still might. She backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. So why the openness to Trump this year? Carty is exasperated with Biden over inflation, immigration and more. She watched the June debate and found herself in a place for eight years she thought impossible. “When Biden was on the ticket, I was going to vote for Trump,” Carty said. “Now it is a harder call, just because I am not a fan of Donald Trump. … I want to give Kamala Harris a chance because she deserves that chance.” Carty is part of a CNN project, All Over the Map, to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who are members of key voting blocs and who live in critical areas within the battleground states. Her views are telling, all the more so because they were shared by other supporters of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Reagan Republicans in our group. Harris’ ascendance on the Democratic ticket is shaking up the race in the pivotal suburbs. But the belief that she is to the left of Biden creates a quandary for Republicans who do not want Trump back in the White House but have policy and personal doubts about Harris. “I definitely want to learn more,” Carty said. “I want to hear from Kamala Harris, what exactly have you been doing as vice president? Not what the administration has been doing in general. … What were her goals? Did she achieve them?” That Carty isn’t ready to commit to Harris despite her profound disagreements with Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is a snapshot of the vice president’s suburban challenge: her path to victory is clearer if she can win over a good share of moderate Republicans who voted for Biden because they viewed him as a centrist or disagreed with Trump’s reaction to the Covid pandemic or were exhausted by his tweets and other chaos – or all of that. In Carty’s case, Harris may be getting an assist from Trump’s running mate. “I’m not a cat lady,” Carty said, some toys belonging to her 5-year-old daughter stacked in the corner of the room. “I was a childless dog lady. Because I didn’t meet the right person until I was over 40 years old. And it’s by the grace of God that we naturally had a child. So I could very well be one of those childless women and I found the comment insensitive and narrow-minded,” she said, alluding to 2021 remarks from Vance. Carty objects to Trump’s conduct on January 6, 2021, and his constant attacks on judges and courts. “We have to remember the Constitution,” she said. “Does he really promote domestic tranquility?” And whereas Vance has been a disappointment to Carty, she’s pleased with Harris’ pick to share the ticket. “She just picked an excellent running mate,” Carty said of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “So I am going to listen to them. I’m going to really hear what they have to say. … So I have a reason. Essentially not to vote for Donald Trump. He’s like the last resort.” While Carty has her reservations, and looks forward to a Trump-Harris debate, she notices a clear shift in recent conversations with friends. “Definitely I have more friends saying they’re leaning toward Harris,” Carty said. Cynthia Sabatini lives in Delaware County. Like Carty, she remembers when the suburbs were very different. “My street was rock-ribbed Republican,” Sabatini said in an interview at her home in Media, Pennsylvania. “Now you have to shake a stick to find the Republican.” The suburban shift, at the presidential level anyway, began earlier than most Republicans tend to remember. George H.W. Bush was the last Republican to carry the suburban Philadelphia collar counties in a presidential race – back in 1988. But the Democratic advantage has become more lopsided in recent years, and in 2020, was especially pronounced. “I watch his campaign rallies,” Sabatini said of Trump. “It is all about him. It is not about the country.” Close elections are complicated, and it is overly simplistic to focus on any one subgroup. But one of several to watch, in the battleground states decided by narrow margins, are voters who describe themselves, like Sabatini, as “never Trump.” In 2016, she wrote in a Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine. Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania that year. In 2020, Sabatini voted for Biden because, she said, “I didn’t want to see Trump elected after the chaos of the previous four years.” Biden won Pennsylvania and the White House. “I didn’t vote for him in 2016,” Sabatini said of Trump. “I didn’t vote for him in 2020. And I don’t plan to vote for him in 2024.” The question is, will she vote for Harris or cast another write-in ballot? “I promised myself I will keep an open mind,” she said. Sabatini said she has read things that worry her about the vice president. She mentioned immigration policy, and reports Harris is tough on her staff. “I have some preconceived notions about her,” she said. “I want to find out for myself if the rap on her, as I read it, is correct.” So far, Sabatini said Harris “certainly has injected enthusiasm into the Democratic base and she brings an energy that certainly Biden couldn’t bring to the campaign. … There’s been, you know, quite a pleasant surprise.” But Sabatini said she needs to hear more, on economic policy, on immigration and on leadership. “I am particularly interested in the debates,” she said. “I want to see up close and personal how she answers the questions put to her.” Joan London is, like Sabatini, inclined at the moment to write in a Republican she finds acceptable. “If Donald Trump or JD Vance really says something so outrageously offensive beyond some of the things that he has said, that could drive me to vote for Vice President Harris,” said London, an attorney whose clients include municipal governments in Berks County, a more rural, Republican County just outside Philadelphia’s suburban collar. “But it is highly unlikely,” London said. “She just doesn’t represent my values and my beliefs about policy.” London became a Republican at the age of 18, inspired by Reagan. But she switched her registration to independent earlier this year, repulsed by Trump. Just before the switch, she cast a GOP primary vote for Haley. There was “zero chance” she would vote for Trump anyway. But London said the Vance “cat lady” comments made her even more proud to have left Trump’s GOP. She is married, no children or pets. Her home is decorated with family photos – her husband, her sister and her niece. “I’ve led a very full life that way, and to say I don’t have a stake in the future of the country, I had some difficulty with that,” London said of Vance’s comments. “All I could think of Senator Vance is, are you going to tell Condoleezza Rice or Ann Coulter or Elizabeth Dole they are miserable cat ladies? I don’t think so.” Michael Pesce, too, has questions and looks forward to debates and other campaign events to see how Harris steps out of Biden’s shadow and lays out her own ideas. But Pesce is one Reagan Repubican ready to commit, because his opposition to Trump is unwavering. The Vance picked “reaffirmed” his take on Trump. “He could have gone with somebody who was more centrist but he went with someone who is a sycophant, who is exactly like him,” Pesce said in an interview in Newtown, part of Bucks County. “Do I want JD Vance to be my president? It’s more of the same, so no.” When Biden stepped aside, Pesce wished for “more of an open debate in the Democratic Party as to who they were going to run. But it is what it is.” “I’m still not going to vote for Trump regardless,” Pesce said. “I’m not excited about voting for Kamala Harris, but it’s better than the alternative.” When we first met Pesce three months ago, just after his GOP primary vote for Haley, he said he would support Biden despite reservations about some policies and about his age. After the June debate, Pesce was quick to say he thought Democrats should look for a new candidate. “No way,” is how he puts Biden’s chances of winning Pennsylvania after his debate performance. “There would have been no way.” Harris, he believes, has a chance and like the others we visited with, Pesce said the vibe of the campaign has changed completely. “I think having a younger candidate is going to make a difference,” Pesce said. “I think the energy she’s brought to the campaign, the fact that she’s a woman and women’s rights are going to be a big deal here in Pennsylvania. And I think that’s kind of where Pennsylvania will go.”"
Democrats in competitive House races want Harris’ momentum without running toward her | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:41 PM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-12T08:00:02.364Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/democrats-house-races-harris-momentum/index.html,"Democratic Rep. Susie Lee of Nevada is in the fight of her political life as she tries to hold onto her seat in one of the most competitive House races in the country. Lee, who prides herself on focusing on local issues and staying away from the top of her party’s ticket, says that her region has seen a 400% increase in volunteers since Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, injecting a critical surge in her House race that was always going to come down to turnout. “That type of enthusiasm, increased volunteerism, that is what is going to get us over the finish line,” Lee told CNN. But just because Harris has potentially enticed voters off the couch and to the table, does not mean Democrats like Lee, whose race could determine whether her party regains control of the House of Representatives, are planning to change their message and further align themselves with Harris. “I will continue to run the race the way I’ve always run my race, which is focusing on hyper-local issues,” the Nevada Democrat added. In conversations with nearly a dozen Democratic lawmakers and candidates running in competitive races across the country, a common theme emerged. With Harris and her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats have felt a tangible bump of energy in their districts, through spikes in volunteers, donations and event turnout. But that hasn’t resulted in a shift in campaign strategy, with most in nail-bitter races still wanting to keep the top of the ticket at an arm’s length from the campaigns they have built around local issues. Southeast of Lee, former Arizona legislator Kirsten Engel is trying to flip a Republican district in Arizona that partially rests on the US-Mexico border and described the recent grassroots enthusiasm she is experiencing inspired by Harris as “undeniable.” Engel sees Harris as an effective advocate on abortion rights but said she will continue to call out both parties when it comes to handling border security and immigration reform. “Neither party has done well by Arizona and the border,” Engel said. “The Trump administration separated families at the border. The Biden administration was very late to realizing, you know, the crisis at the border.” The pair of Democrats said the distancing from their party on the border would happen regardless of who was at the top of the ticket, dismissing Republican attempts to label Harris as the “border czar” and criticizing Republicans for blocking a bipartisan border package in Congress that could have had real impact. Candidates in places like western Pennsylvania however have had more Harris-specific questions, particularly on her previous position to ban fracking, the primary mode of extracting gas for energy in battleground states – including Pennsylvania, which provides crucial jobs throughout the Rust Belt. A Harris campaign official said last month she no longer supports a fracking ban, but Democrats acknowledge that Harris will need to make that case directly to voters and quickly build inroads with key unions and constituencies that President Joe Biden had fostered for decades. Rep. Chris Deluzio, who supports Harris, told CNN he was glad to see that she has moved away from her previous position on fracking. “I’m glad to hear her say that’s not what she intends to do. That’s not what this administration has done. I think it’s important to continue the work that President Biden has done to frankly help our energy security and help us meet our climate goals,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN. “I know that is a priority for a lot of folks in the building trades and those industries around here, and they certainly have made their views very clearly known all the way to the top,” he added. The Republican campaign arm has seized on some of her past positions from his first presidential run, including fracking, as they’ve attempted to develop a strategy to target Democrats in tough races. But that hasn’t meant Republican lawmakers have stayed on message, with some resorting to calling her a “DEI hire.” Others remain blunter in their distancing from the party, and by extension Harris. Democrat Rudy Salas, who is looking to flip a competitive Republican-held district in California that Biden carried in 2020, told CNN that campaigning with Harris is “not like a make-or-break thing” and is one of a number of Democrats across the country who plan to skip the convention. He sees the energy that Harris has brought to the race as up to him to capture but doesn’t plan on shifting his message away from local issues. Roughly three hours south of Salinas, Democrat Will Rollins is singing a different tune. As a former federal prosecutor running to unseat GOP Rep. Ken Calvert of California, Rollins sees Harris’ background as the state’s attorney general as a huge boost for his campaign. He said Harris’ refrain on the stump of being a prosecutor who has taken on perpetrators of all kinds who knows Trump’s type, is the exact theme he is trying to use against his opponent, and he often starts his events with parroting some of her signature lines. “I wish I had seen her line before we filmed all of our ads,” Rollins said. “I mean, I try to work it into my own remarks, at least in the same theme because I do think it really resonates with swing voters.” And given the surge in donations his campaign has seen in the last month and increased following on social media, Rollins said he had the budget to hire a videographer to help with his social media team, part of his strategized attempts to attract young voters to his campaign as a result of the organic content the Harris campaign has been providing that he says led to an increase in his own social media platforms across the board. “It’s definitely part of a targeted effort to get young people out to vote, which I definitely believe she will help me do in a way that nobody else could,” Rollins said of Harris. In selecting Walz, the Harris campaign provided many down ballot Democrats running in competitive races with a welcomed partner. Rep. Ann Kuster of New Hampshire, who chairs the New Democrat Coalition, a large group of moderate Democrats running in battleground districts, told CNN she had been fielding a flood of calls from lawmakers who wanted to campaign with the Minnesota governor. Walz previously served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans. “I think he is going to be spectacular for us,” Kuster told CNN. “He can go into those districts and campaign with us. You have to be able to communicate. Tim is the person who can do that. He has walked the walk.” Lawmakers and candidates pointed to Walz’s history as an educator, specifically a football coach, and his ability to bring businesses to his state as governor as some aspects of his record they plan to highlight. Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, who served with Walz in Congress said the governor is about “basic, you know, meat-and-potatoes politics,” adding, “I think he is going to bring a lot of stability to the next administration.” Meanwhile Republicans, led by Donald Trump’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance stepped up his attacks on Walz’s portrayal of his military career, accusing him of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005. Across the country, lawmakers and candidates attribute the palpable on the ground surge in enthusiasm to Harris being the historic messenger that Biden could not be. Beyond being a historic nominee, Harris also provides fresh energy to a party that spent three weeks in turmoil after Biden’s disastrous debate performance raised serious questions about his mental acuity. While Democrats championed Biden’s record, it felt like, according to Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, “those people were having to explain, explain, explain.” Now, Hayes says, the grassroots enthusiasm is palpable: “I wouldn’t have expected it to last this long but every day it’s just building upon itself.” With Biden not seeking reelection, Democrats no longer have to spend time deflecting attacks from their Republican opponents about Biden’s age and defending their support of him. That relief has been felt most palpably, candidates and campaign officials say, through the surge in volunteers for door knocking. Democrat Sue Altman, who is looking to unseat Republican Rep. Thomas Kean Jr. of New Jersey, attributed the doubled turnout she saw at a recent door knocking event in part to voters no longer feeling concerned about Biden and excited by the prospect of Harris. Instead of being motivated by “fear and trepidation” she said, her voters are showing up fueled by “hope, exuberance and joy.” “I think there was a lot of nervousness about Biden’s ability to make the case against Trump,” Altman told CNN. “And now, with Harris at the top of the ticket, I think we’ve proven we could meet the moment when our presidential candidate wasn’t ready to run again.” Altman was not the only Democrat to see turnout increase during a party-wide effort to mobilize volunteers across battleground districts. The Democratic House campaign arm saw its highest number of doors knocked in a single week this cycle and had a 58% increase in volunteers during the week to mark 100 days until the November election. Democrat Shomari Figures, who is running in a newly drawn Alabama district that he calls “the birthplace of the civil rights movement,” said Harris’ candidacy and her potential to be not only the nation’s first female president, but first Black and South Asian female president, carries extra importance for him and his voters. Home to the iconic civil rights leader Rosa Parks, the Montgomery bus boycott and where Martin Luther King Jr. had his first pastoral assignment, Figures said, “The historical context here is, I think, significantly different.” “When you see a Black woman at the top of the ticket, you know, especially given the historical role that Black women played in the civil rights movement, it just means a little more in this district and in this state,” he added. “We’ve seen that reflected in the response here lately.” This story has been updated with additional developments."
A hair salon owner says law enforcement entered her business without permission during a Kamala Harris event last month | CNN,"Updated 12:26 PM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-12T15:55:02.350Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/us/massachusetts-hair-salon-harris-rally-break-in/index.html,"A Massachusetts hair salon owner said members of law enforcement entered her business without permission and used the bathroom during a campaign event held by Vice President Kamala Harris last month, CNN affiliate Spectrum News 1 Worcester reported. “Violated, disrespected,” and “totally blown away” is how owner Alicia Powers said she felt about the incident in an interview with Spectrum News 1 Worcester. It is not clear what law enforcement agency may be responsible for the incident. The Secret Service regularly works with local and state law enforcement agencies to help secure events attended by those the agency is assigned to protect. Powers told the affiliate a representative from the US Secret Service reached out to apologize, but the agency has not confirmed one of its agents was responsible. “The U.S. Secret Service works closely with our partners in the business community to carry out our protective and investigative missions. The Secret Service has since communicated with the affected business owner. We hold these relationships in the highest regard and our personnel would not enter, or instruct our partners to enter, a business without the owner’s permission,” US Secret Service spokesperson Melissa McKenzie said in a statement to CNN Sunday. Harris’ event was held at The Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield on July 27. The venue is next to Powers’ salon. CNN has reached out to Powers for comment. In video obtained by Spectrum News 1 Worcester, a person is seen taping something on the lens of a camera located on the salon’s front porch. CNN has reached out to the Berkshire County Sheriff’s Office and the Berkshire County District Attorney’s Office for comment. “I don’t have more than what’s all ready been reported by other news agencies,” Capt. Matthew Hill with the Pittsfield Police Department said in a statement to CNN Monday. “As was reported, the Pittsfield Police Department had no involvement in this. When he first became aware of this incident, PPD Chief Dawley immediately contacted the agencies involved & informed them,” he added. “Chief Dawley personally contacted the owner last week & she had nothing but positive compliments to say about the PPD, how we handled it, our quick responses and follow-ups.” “The only footage we have seen are the same two videos that have been circulating around social media.”"
"Harris endorses eliminating taxes on tips, touting policy first proposed by Trump | CNN Politics","Published 9:28 AM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-12T13:28:39.442Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/taxes-on-tips-eliminate-proposal-harris/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris has backed the elimination of taxes on tips for hospitality and service workers, endorsing a policy first suggested by former President Donald Trump. Harris’ support came ahead of an economic plan rollout this week and It also came as the vice president seeks to coalesce support from the sizable coalition of service industry workers in the key battleground state of Nevada. Speaking to a crowd of thousands at a Saturday rally in Las Vegas, which included members of a local culinary workers union, Harris promised to advance policies to benefit working families, pointing to the elimination of taxes on tips as an example. “It is my promise to everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fighting for working families of America including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers,” she said. Trump, who first proposed the idea at his own Las Vegas campaign rally in June, accused Harris of copying him. “Kamala Harris, whose ‘Honeymoon’ period is ENDING, and is starting to get hammered in the Polls, just copied my NO TAXES ON TIPS Policy,” Trump posted on his Truth Social social media platform. The difference is, she won’t do it, she just wants it for Political Purposes! This was a TRUMP idea - She has no ideas, she can only steal from me. Remember, Kamala has proposed the LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN HISTORY - It won’t happen. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” After Trump’s proposal in June, Culinary Union Local 226’s secretary-treasurer Ted Pappageorge pushed back on his promise: “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.” Harris on Saturday recognized members of the union in attendance at the rally, one day after Culinary Union Local 226 officially endorsed Harris. The proposal is among the first notable policies offered by Harris since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket last month. Speaking to reporters in Arizona earlier Saturday, Harris said she plans to roll out her policy platform this week, noting it’ll be focused on “what we need to do to bring down costs and also strengthen the economy.” The Harris campaign expounded on her endorsement of eliminating taxes on tips for hospitality and service workers, saying in a statement that she “would work with Congress” on a proposal that would set income limits and include measures to prevent fraud. A Harris campaign official said her plan to eliminate taxes on tips would come alongside a push for Congress to raise the minimum wage. “On Saturday, Vice President Harris said as president, she would push for the elimination of taxes on tips,” the official said in a statement. “The proposal would require legislation. As President, she would work with Congress to craft a proposal that comes with an income limit and with strict requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of the policy.” “Vice President Harris would push for the proposal alongside an increase in the minimum wage,” she continued."
Analysis: The 2024 campaign will now turn on whether Trump can blunt Harris’ soaring start | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:57 AM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-12T04:00:02.407Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/trump-harris-2024-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump’s campaign, which has whiffed in its early attacks on Kamala Harris’ new presidential campaign, will grapple this week for a more effective foothold after the vice president transformed an election of stunning surprises. The ex-president has deployed some of his most trusted political tools — targeting racial identity, creating alternative realities, flinging insults and gaslighting. On Sunday, for instance, he spread a new false conspiracy theory over the size of Harris’ rally crowd in Michigan last week. But his efforts to bring down his new adversary and her policy of ignoring his provocations have so far more highlighted his own liabilities than hers and emphasized the way Harris could offer a new choice for voters. When the ex-president called Harris “dumb” at a Montana rally Friday night or falsely claimed last month that she “happened to turn Black,” he may have delighted his base voters. But those kinds of comments risk alienating women and swing-state voters, as well as reversing the gains he has made among minorities that he’d proudly highlighted for months. Trump’s campaign was also forced on Saturday to deny a report in The New York Times that he’d privately referred to Harris as a “b*tch” as he bemoaned her momentum. Trump’s undisciplined news conference last week and a weekend of venting also suggest that the Republican nominee is far from coming to terms with the shift in a race that seemed to be heading in his direction three weeks ago when bullish Republicans left their convention predicting a landslide. But a swing-state tour by Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, conjured euphoria not experienced by Democrats in years. It left Trump fuming that his victory in his debate with President Joe Biden only led to a new battle — one he’s more in danger of losing. In three weeks, Harris has created a potential turning point — offering voters a burst of optimism after a dark period in modern history with her mantra that Americans “don’t want to go back” to the chaos and acrimony of Trump’s term. Her approach is working — for now — in returning the race to a neck-and-neck contest. Polling averages show her reversing Biden’s deficits. A New York Times/Siena College survey released Saturday, for example, showed no clear leader in the vital swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — a closer race than when Biden topped the ticket. The poll has no bearing on November’s result. But it encapsulated the swift shift in the campaign, and the Trump team felt obliged to release a memo claiming the surveys had “the clear intent and purpose of depressing support” for the former president. The success of the new Democratic ticket in not just repelling Trump’s initial attacks, but also in using them to expose what Harris views as extremism, has created an unexpected problem for his team. Harris’ assumption of the Democratic torch and Biden’s withdrawal from the race three weeks ago have elevated her party to a place that would have appeared impossible a week ahead of its national convention in Chicago. But Trump is now up against a party that is energized, reversing one of his biggest advantages when Biden led the ticket. And freshness and hope are once again proving to be powerful political forces. But campaigns are never static, and while Harris may benefit from a condensed run-up to November, there are still nearly three months to go. Trump remains a formidable political force and a vicious opponent. And having united his party behind him, especially in the wake of last month’s assassination attempt, he should still benefit from structural factors, including voters’ pessimism about the economy, that would normally be expected to help shape the election. The former president is expected to zero in on this issue on Wednesday in North Carolina with a speech his campaign says will focus on how “hard-working Americans are suffering because of the Harris-Biden administration’s dangerously liberal policies” and prices that are “excruciatingly high.” Assuming he sticks to that script, his appearance — in a state Democrats are hoping to put back in play — will begin to test whether a focus on fundamental issues will counter the initial wave of enthusiasm for Harris’ candidacy. Trump has also announced that he will give an interview Monday evening to Elon Musk on the automotive and space pioneer’s X platform. Trump is heavily criticizing the vice president for having avoided exposure to unscripted moments in news conferences or interviews. And she will face rising questions over when to provide more specificity on the policies she would adopt as president at home and abroad. Harris told reporters Saturday that she’d begin to lay out a policy framework on the economy this week. As a one-day stock market plunge showed last week, she is vulnerable to adverse economic news that could sway Americans who are feeling insecure. The vice president seems conscious that a new stage of her nascent campaign is beckoning after last week’s tour de force with Walz. “What we know is, the stakes are so high. And we can take nothing for granted in this moment,” she said at a San Francisco fundraiser Sunday. “It’s really been a good couple weeks, but we have a lot of work to do.” Trump sent his vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, onto Sunday talk shows to try to quell the Harris wave. The Ohio Republican painted the vice president and Walz as extreme liberals, staked out tough border policies, and accused Harris of complicity in Biden administration policies that left Americans hostage to high prices. He pressed the GOP attack on Walz that alleges, without decisive evidence, that he retired after nearly a quarter of a century in the Army National Guard to avoid deploying to Iraq. (CNN has reported that Walz filed to run for Congress in February 2005 — before his unit was notified it could deploy to Iraq.) Vance suggested to CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that his ticket was were running against an undefined opponent but one that bore even more responsibility for the policies of the last four years than Biden. “What’s different about it is that we’re running against a different person who a lot of Americans just don’t know,” Vance said. “I think we have to remind people that President Trump delivered lower prices, lower inflation, a prosperous and peaceful world, and also a secure border, and Kamala Harris’ policies have produced the exact opposite. Now, that was an easier case to make when Joe Biden was in there because people associate Joe Biden with the policies.” Yet he was forced to answer for the ex-president’s often self-defeating comments. On “State of the Union,” for example, Vance wriggled to avoid contradicting Trump’s claim that Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, was not Black. “I believe that Kamala Harris is whatever she says she is,” Vance said. “But I believe, importantly, that President Trump is right that she’s a chameleon.” On CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Vance struggled to clarify an impression left by the ex-president last week that he might be open to restricting the sending of mifepristone, a widely used abortion drug, to patients through the mail. The issue plays into Democratic efforts to make Trump pay a price for the overturning of the nationwide right to abortion by the Supreme Court majority that he built. And on ABC’s “This Week,” Vance found himself in the difficult position of being asked to condemn Trump’s 2022 hosting of White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, who recently launched a racial attack on the Ohio senator’s wife, Usha. Vance described Fuentes as a “total loser” but said that the “one thing I like about Donald Trump … is that he actually will talk to anybody.” The Trump campaign did secure a concession from the Harris campaign on Saturday over one aspect of Walz’s military record. A campaign spokesperson told CNN the Minnesota governor “misspoke” in a video from 2018 in which he said he handled assault weapons “in war.” But seeking to use Walz to expose Harris’ decision-making seems unlikely to make the critical difference for voters who must ultimately chose between Harris and Trump. Therefore, a debate expected between Trump and Harris on ABC on September 10 looms as a pivotal new moment in the campaign. (Trump is insisting that their first showdown will in fact take place on Fox a week earlier, but Harris has so far agreed to only a single debate.) Earlier in her vice presidency, Harris stumbled several times in interviews and interactions with the press. And Trump’s team has been trying to goad her into more unscripted moments. While she appears to have evolved as a political performer, there’s no reason for her aides to expose her to risks when her campaign is soaring, especially ahead of next week’s Chicago convention, when party image-makers will have a near media monopoly as they seek to introduce her to undecided voters during prime time. But Harris will not be able to avoid deeper scrutiny for much longer — and nor should she, considering she’s running for president. She told reporters recently she was looking at doing a major interview by the end of the month. Her stump speech is aspirational and in line with Democratic orthodoxy, but she speaks in broad strokes. Since becoming the nominee, she’s offered no insight into her thinking on a fractious world full of rising threats to US power from adversaries like Russia and China. Her campaign has used the time instead to try to tackle political pitfalls, such as by releasing an ad branding her as tough on border issues and positioning Trump as a blockage against effectively curtailing undocumented migration. Given Trump’s unpopularity, simply being a younger and more optimistic antidote to a dystopian national vision could be enough for Harris to win the election. But until she performs strongly in an uncontrolled public situation, questions about her political dexterity will hang over her prospects — especially since her 2020 primary campaign quickly faded as her political liabilities became more obvious. But as Trump has shown in recent days, he still hasn’t worked out a way to respond to the suddenly changed circumstances of the campaign."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to travel to Chicago for campaign events and interviews during this month’s Democratic National Convention, a campaign spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.  Kennedy is slated to hold multiple campaign events in the Chicago area the same week Democrats will converge on the city in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear told CNN. The Chicago appearances will mark his campaign’s first public events since early July, when Kennedy attended an agriculture roundtable in Maine. Since then, he has made public appearances at conferences or events organized by outside groups.  Kennedy was initially scheduled to campaign in Wisconsin ahead of the Republican National Committee in Milwaukee last month, but his campaign canceled his appearances at the last minute. Kennedy did travel to Wisconsin that week for private meetings, including with former President Donald Trump.  Donald Trump falsely claimed in a series of social media posts Sunday that “nobody” attended Vice President Kamala Harris’ Michigan rally last week — and said his Democratic rival should be “disqualified” over a “fake crowd picture.” The former president appeared to have fallen for a far-right conspiracy theory — one easily disproved by photos and videos captured by attendees and media showing thousands of supporters at the event at an airport hangar near Detroit. Trump, who regularly draws large crowds of his own, has long been fixated on audience size, with his speeches often filled with exaggerated boasts about the turnout. The former president, on his social media website Truth Social, made the fabricated claim that Harris had been “turned in” by an airport maintenance worker who “noticed the fake crowd picture.” He then said Harris should be “disqualified” from the 2024 election “because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!” However, photos and videos of the event — including videos captured with CNN’s cameras — reflect a sizable audience for Harris’ Wednesday event. The crowd filled a large hangar and spilled onto the sprawling tarmac where Air Force Two had stopped. Two large risers and many rows of chairs were outside, as well as several giant screens for the outdoor crowd that couldn’t see the rally stage. Read more about Trump’s false claims here. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Vice President Kamala Harris and compared the election to the Olympics during remarks at a San Francisco campaign fundraiser Sunday. Pelosi, who spoke before Harris and received a standing ovation upon walking to the lectern, began her remarks by saying, “Isn’t this a day to take pride in our candidate for president?” The powerful California Democrat made an analogy between elections and the Olympics, noting that the difference between gold, silver and bronze can come down to seconds. “Elections are that close,” she said, according to reporters in the room. Harris “makes us all so proud,” Pelosi added, describing the vice president as a person of “great strength” and someone who is “politically very astute.” CNN has previously reported that the former speaker privately told President Joe Biden that polling showed he could not beat former President Donald Trump and that his run could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning back the House. Pelosi said last week she has not spoken to Biden, a longtime ally, since he dropped out of the race. The event in San Francisco, which Harris’ campaign said brought in more than $12 million, featured a number of other high-profile attendees, including: Vice President Kamala Harris told donors in San Francisco on Sunday that the real work of her campaign was yet to come, following a blitz of rallies in battleground states, The Democratic presidential nominee told the crowd of 700 donors that she’s “never been one to really believe in the polls, whether they’re up or they’re down.”  As she reflected on her five-city battleground tour, which concluded Saturday in Las Vegas, Harris shared some “notes from the field” with her audience. Americans “don’t want to go back,” she said, noting how some rally attendees have chanted “Not going back!” at her events. And while she called the energy surrounding her campaign “undeniable,” she emphasized the importance of maintaining voters’ enthusiasm. “The press and our opponents like to focus on our crowd size, and, yes, the crowds are large,” she said, adding it was more important that rally attendees are signing up for volunteer shifts. “It’s really been a good couple weeks, but we have a lot of work to do,” Harris said to laughs. Harris’ campaign said the San Francisco event brought in more than $12 million. Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance is defending former President Donald Trump’s attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, falsely claiming Walz has “supported taking children from their parents if the parents don’t consent to gender reassignment,” which Vance described as “kidnapping” in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” As CNN has reported, Walz in 2023 signed an executive order that directed Minnesota agencies to do whatever they could to protect and support Minnesotans seeking gender-affirming health care services. Walz also signed “trans refuge” legislation that safeguarded access to such care. Part of the law states, “A court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this state” and “has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care.” Vance’s comments in the interview came in response to ABC’s Jonathan Karl highlighting Trump’s false claim that Walz had signed legislation that would let the state kidnap children. “Tim Walz gets on his high horse about, ‘Mind your own damn business.’ One way of minding your own damn business,” Vance said, “is to not try to take my children away from me if I have different world views than you.”  Karl noted that Walz “has not signed a law allowing a state to kidnap children to change their gender identity.” “What I just explained to you, I would describe as kidnapping,” Vance said. “He has absolutely done this stuff.”  “That’s crazy, c’mon,” Karl said. “It’s not what he’s done.” CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. Vice presidential nominee JD Vance said in multiple interviews that aired Sunday that a Trump administration would not use the FDA to block access to the abortion drug mifepristone and that individual states should make decisions on abortion policy. Vance told CNN’s Dana Bash that if he was reelected, former President Donald Trump would not seek to block the drug. However, Vance said the former president would “let states make the decision on abortion policy” — a position he acknowledged would lead to a patchwork of policies, including blue states with fewer restrictions and red states with more. In another interview that aired Sunday, CBS’ Margaret Brennan pointed out to Vance that it was only after Roe v. Wade was overturned that the Supreme Court took up the case challenging the FDA’s approach to regulating mifepristone. In June, the court ultimately ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups behind the lawsuit did not have standing to sue.  “When states and voters in those states make decisions, we of course want the states and the federal government to respect those decisions. And that’s what President Trump has said … We need to get out of the culture war side of the abortion issue,” Vance said on “Face the Nation.” “We need to let the states decide their specific abortion policy.”  Brennan noted that Vance, as a senator, signed a letter to the Justice Department demanding it shut down all mail-order abortion operations under the Comstock Act.  “We just want the FDA to make sure that doctors are prescribing this in a safe way. That’s all that we ever said, and I believe that that is how President Trump feels about this is, again, you want the states to make these determinations,” Vance said. The five-member state election board in Georgia last week passed controversial new rules less than 90 days before Election Day, which critics say could potentially delay certification of the election results if a county’s election board chooses to do so. Georgia’s 16 electoral votes are crucial for both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the state by more than 10,000 votes. Here’s what to know about the rules that were approved by the board this week that will reshape election protocols in the Peach State: Read more about these changes and others and how they came about here. Vice presidential nominee JD Vance said he would like to see the child tax credit expanded to $5,000 per child.  “I think we’d love to see it at a higher dollar value, and I think President (Donald) Trump and I have proposed that,” Vance told CBS’ Face the Nation in an interview airing Sunday. “I’d love to see a child tax credit that’s $5,000 per child, but you of course have to work with Congress to see how possible and viable that is.” Vance said he wants a “broad-based family policy and a broad-based Child Tax Credit,” arguing it shouldn’t be based on income.  “You don’t want a different policy for higher-income families. You just want to have a pro-family child tax credit,” Vance continued. Vance said he opposes “one model of child care,” and that the credit should also apply to grandparents who raise grandchildren, as his did, as well as to single parents.  Pressed on whether the credit should apply to same-sex couples, Vance said, “All families would be included, of course.” Vance also claimed that “the child tax credit has languished thanks to the Biden administration because (Vice President Kamala) Harris has failed to show fundamental leadership.” He has previously falsely claimed that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit. She has actually called for years to increase it. Earlier this month, Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan tax package that would have temporarily expanded the child tax credit, which Vance described in the CBS interview as a “show vote.” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance should “put your money where your mouth is” on supporting children and families following his past “childless cat lady” comments Vance, in his 2021 criticism of “childless” Democrats running the country, specifically mentioned Harris, who is a stepmother, and Buttigieg, who would soon afterward adopt children with his husband. In a CNN interview that aired Sunday, Vance said, “of course” he acknowledges the families of Harris and Buttigieg and argued his comments were taken out of context. Buttigieg countered that Vance only acknowledged his family’s legitimacy because “I think he kind of felt shamed into it.” During his 2022 Senate run in Ohio, Vance said he would’ve voted “no” on the Respect for Marriage Act, the landmark federal protections for same-sex and interracial couples signed by President Joe Biden. “I don’t know exactly what his vision of us not having a family looks like, but I know that it’s not pro-family for me,” Buttigieg said. CNN has reached out to Vance’s campaign for comment. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow defended Democratic vice presidential candidate and fellow veteran Gov. Tim Walz on Sunday amid criticism from Republicans over his military record.   Crow, who has served combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he has a “special place in his heart for fellow privates,” noting that Walz enlisted as a private, just like Crow, and “worked his way up” from the bottom. Walz has recently faced scrutiny over his military service record with critics, including Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of embellishing his military experience. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, but his retirement in 2005 has prompted criticism from some Republicans who suggest he did so to avoid deploying to Iraq.   Asked about reports that some National Guardsmen say they felt left behind by Walz, Crow pushed back, saying “overwhelmingly the people that served with Tim Walz said that he served with distinction,” while noting that military units are “like families.”  “And they don’t always get along, people have personal grievances, people are angry with each other and it’s very sad to see that,” Crow said. Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance said mass deportations of undocumented immigrants in the United States, promised in a potential second Trump administration, should start with “what’s achievable,” proposing an initial goal of a million deportations. “I think it’s interesting that people focus on, ‘Well, how do you deport 18 million people?’ Let’s start with 1 million. That’s where Kamala Harris has failed. And then we can go from there,” Vance said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “The first thing you have to do is stop the bleeding,” Vance continued. “Stop the open border. Get Kamala Harris out of there and actually reimplement the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy, rebuild or finish Donald Trump’s border wall.” “You take a sequential approach to it. You are gonna have to deport some people. If you’re not willing to deport a lot of people, you’re not willing to have a border,” he said. Trump has told Time magazine he would target 15 million to 20 million people in the United States who are undocumented. At one point in the “This Week” interview, ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Vance, “Are people going to knock on doors and ask people for their papers? I mean, what are you going to do?” GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance said talking to someone doesn’t mean you “endorse their views,” referring to former President Donald Trump’s 2022 dinner with White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. In an interview aired Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Vance said he likes how Trump “will talk to anybody. But just because you talk to somebody, doesn’t mean you endorse their views.” His remarks come after Fuentes leveled racist attacks last month against Vance’s wife Usha. “Look, if these guys want attack me, or attack my views, my policy views, my personality, come after me, but don’t attack my wife, she’s out of your league,” he said. On CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Vance said he “of course” disavows Fuentes, whom he described as a “total loser,” according to a transcript released before the interview aired Sunday.  Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday refrained from criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy reversals, instead saying that the Democratic presidential nominee “has to run her campaign.” “I’m sure she is … talking to all kinds of people to come up with an agenda that will lead to victory in November,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Harris and Sanders have expressed differing positions on issues such as “Medicare for All,” certain elements of immigration policy and fracking. Sanders said he believed “the contrast is very clear” when comparing Harris’ policies with those of former president Donald Trump, but stressed that his policy ideas, including the expansion of Medicare, poll very well. Vice President Kamala Harris is capitalizing on the power of strong imagery to sustain the momentum surrounding her candidacy in hopes of building a cultural movement for the Democratic ticket in ways that long eluded President Joe Biden. Harris is taking a page out of the former president’s own playbook — and drawing his ire in the process. The surge in interest in her campaign has led to a rapid scaling-up of Harris’ infrastructure. Merchandise has exploded online. Harris’ crowds are filled with supporters wearing shirts, buttons and hats of all varieties — a scene far more comparable to a Trump rally than a Biden one. Large crowds of supporters have already greeted Harris in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. In Wisconsin last week, some supporters abandoned their cars on the roadside a mile from the event site and walked the rest of the distance. “It’s not as if anybody cares about crowd sizes or anything,” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz quipped Friday night, praising the audience at a packed rally outside Phoenix. Getting Trump’s attention: Harris’ large crowds are now a pivotal part of the new plan to defeat Trump. On Sunday, Trump falsely claimed that Harris had “nobody” waiting for her at her Detroit airport hangar rally—which was attended by thousands—and that photos of the crowd in front of Air Force Two and at other speeches were created using artificial intelligence. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!” Trump said on social media. “She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the ‘crowd’ looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches.” At a Thursday news conference, Trump said, “I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size, and they never say the crowd was big.” This post was updated with additional information. Read more about Harris’ strategy for the Oval Office here. President Joe Biden will “do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most” to get Vice President Kamala Harris elected to the Oval Office. In a CBS News interview that aired Sunday, Biden said he will be on the campaign trail for Harris in multiple states, including putting together a “tour of Pennsylvania” with the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, who had been among the top contenders to be Harris’ vice presidential pick. Biden said he talks to Harris “frequently,” and that he thinks the Harris-Walz pair is “a hell of a team.” Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary and a former Naval Reserve officer, said that Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz does not need to further correct the record on his military career after GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance again criticized the Democratic governor over the weekend. A Harris campaign spokesperson told CNN on Saturday that Walz “misspoke” in a newly resurfaced video from 2018 in which he said he handled assault weapons “in war.” Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. He deployed with his unit to Italy in 2003 in support of the US war effort in Afghanistan but did not deploy to a combat zone as part of his service. “Remember, you can retire at 20 years. Tim Walz served for 24. And the fact that they have to go back to find a clip from 2018 to find the one time that he slipped up when he talks about the weapons of war that he carried and said something instead about carrying a weapon in war — it’s kind of an exception that proves the rule, in terms of how hard you have to look to find Tim Walz saying anything that isn’t precise and accurate,” said Buttigieg, who served six years as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserves including a six-month deployment to Afghanistan. Watch: Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance continued his attacks on Democratic rival Tim Walz, contending that the Minnesota governor is “lying about his own record” of military service. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash that aired Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Vance criticized the Minnesota governor for once claiming to have carried weapons “in war” (a Harris campaign spokesperson on Saturday said Walz misspoke) and for failing to correct descriptions of him in the past as having served in combat. Walz and Vance are both military veterans, unlike their running mates. Vance served four years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring to run for Congress in 2005, a campaign during which he faced similar accusations about how he described his service. He deployed with his unit to Italy in 2003 in support of the US war effort in Afghanistan but did not deploy to a combat zone as part of his service. Read more about Vance’s interview on CNN here. Former President Donald Trump on Sunday said his two fundraisers in Montana and Wyoming this weekend raised $28 million for his campaign.  “Great visit to Montana and Wyoming, where I am leading BIG,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “… Anyway, the two day visit raised $28,000,000 for our very successful Presidential Campaign. Thank you to a truly beautiful part of the World!” President Joe Biden had banked on June’s presidential debate turning around a race that was slipping away from him. Now, Donald Trump may be laying a similar bet after reversing himself by agreeing to debate on ABC next month as his new Democratic opponent enjoys surging momentum. Trump clearly doesn’t believe he’ll suffer the kind of debacle that ended Biden’s campaign, but his decision — and call for another two debates on NBC and Fox, which Vice President Kamala Harris has not agreed to — tells an emerging truth about the election. After a barnstorming week for Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Trump suddenly looks like old news — a crushing new experience for an ex-president who prides himself on driving the narrative. A huge test for both candidates: The build-up to the debate on September 10, assuming it goes ahead, will be intense, and the truncated nature of the new campaign means it could create another historic pivot point on the dwindling road to the White House. Already, Trump is playing his idiosyncratic expectations game of denigrating the skills of his opponent, who could be the first Black woman and South Asian president. At a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort Thursday, he compared Harris unfavorably with Biden, who he’d long argued lacked the mental acuity to serve. “She’s actually not as smart as he is. I don’t think he’s very smart either, by the way. I’m not a big fan of his brain,” Trump said. The clash also looms as an extreme test for Harris. The vice president has a mixed record in debates — she performed strongly in such events early in her failed 2020 presidential campaign. But at others, she struggled. And her most unflattering moments in office have come when she’s been asked to explain her positions or answer tough questions in major interviews. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “misspoke” in a newly resurfaced video from 2018 in which he said he handled assault weapons “in war,” a Harris campaign spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. Walz’s military record has been heavily scrutinized by Republicans, including GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance, in the days after being tapped as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate on Monday. Vance has accused Walz of “stolen valor,” pointing to a video from 2018 circulated by the Harris campaign this week of Walz referring to weapons “that I carried in war” while explaining his support for an assault weapons ban. “We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,” Walz said in the video. Lauren Hitt, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said in a statement the governor misspoke in the clip. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way,” Hitt said in the statement. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, most recently in the Minnesota National Guard, before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. He deployed with his unit to Italy in 2003 in support of the US war effort in Afghanistan, but did not deploy to a combat zone as part of his service. Vice President Kamala Harris, quoting her mother, told a group of newly sworn-in commissioners for a White House initiative for Hispanics that their work on education and economic opportunity would be done in the context of their communities. It went viral. First, as a criticism of Harris on right-wing social media accounts, including @RNCResearch, the rapid response account of the Republican National Committee. But slowly, then all at once — around the time she became the presumptive Democratic nominee — it was co-opted by her supporters, who remixed and reposted the meme and catapulted Harris onto the “for you page” for TikTok users across the country and globe. For years as vice president, Harris has been quietly laying the digital groundwork behind the scenes — meeting with young voters, social media influencers and several grassroots organizations. Now, with less than 90 days until the November election, the Harris campaign has made subtle shifts to capitalize on the momentum around her candidacy — and translate her growing social media following into votes. Since President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed his vice president for the Democratic nomination 20 days ago, the Harris campaign’s digital structure and strategy have largely stayed the same, sources say. But there have been subtle shifts to better reflect the younger nominee at the top of the ticket. Read more here on Harris’ viral social media posts."
Trump spreads false conspiracy theory about Harris’ Detroit crowd size | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:43 PM EDT, Sun August 11, 2024",2024-08-11T21:30:42.513Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/politics/trump-harris-crowd-size-conspiracy-theory/index.html,"Donald Trump falsely claimed in a series of social media posts Sunday that “nobody” attended Vice President Kamala Harris’ Michigan rally last week — and said his Democratic rival should be “disqualified” over a “fake crowd picture.” The former president appeared to have fallen for a far-right conspiracy theory — one easily disproved by photos and videos captured by attendees and media showing thousands of supporters at the event at an airport hangar near Detroit. The false claims about attendance at Harris’ event come as Trump navigates the contours of a changed presidential race, with the vice president riding a wave of new Democratic enthusiasm after replacing President Joe Biden atop the ticket. The GOP nominee, who regularly draws large crowds of his own, has long been fixated on audience size, with his speeches often filled with exaggerated boasts about the turnout. Trump, on his social media website Truth Social, made the fabricated claim that Harris had been “turned in” by an airport maintenance worker who “noticed the fake crowd picture.” He then said Harris should be “disqualified” from the 2024 election “because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!” However, photos and videos of the event — including videos captured with CNN’s cameras — reflect a sizable audience for Harris’ Wednesday event. The crowd filled a large hangar and spilled onto the sprawling tarmac where Air Force Two had stopped. Two large risers and many rows of chairs were outside, as were several giant screens for the outdoor crowd that couldn’t see the rally stage. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said on LinkedIn that he analyzed the photo with two models designed to detect patterns associated with AI-generated images. Both models found no evidence of AI generation, he said, adding that “the text on the signs and plane [showed] none of the usual signs of generative AI.” “While the lack of evidence of manipulation is not evidence the image is real,” he said, “we find no evidence that this image is AI-generated or digitally altered.” David Plouffe, a Harris campaign senior adviser, wrote on X: “These are not conspiratorial rantings from the deepest recesses of the internet. The author could have the nuclear codes and be responsible for decisions that will affect us all for decades.” Trump on Sunday shared a screenshot of an X post that featured two photos: one shared on X by a Harris staffer that showed thousands of people greeting Harris’ plane; another zoomed in on the curved, reflective side of one of Air Force Two’s engines in which the crowd isn’t clear. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “She was turned in by a maintenance worker at the airport when he noticed the fake crowd picture, but there was nobody there, later confirmed by the reflection of the mirror like finish on the Vice Presidential Plane.” “She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the ‘crowd’ looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches,” Trump added. “She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!” Trump has twice been indicted over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He falsely claimed in another post, “Look, we caught her with a fake ‘crowd.’ There was nobody there!” In reaction to Trump’s false claims, rally attendees and Harris staffers were sharing their own photos from the event on social media Sunday afternoon. Lavora Barnes, chairwoman of the Michigan Democratic Party, shared on X a photo from the event showing her speaking to a large crowd before Harris was introduced. Barnes joked that she was “honored that whoever made the AI image of 15,000 excited Democrats welcoming” Harris and running mate Tim Walz to Detroit “was kind enough to include me at the lectern.” “That AI crowd was really loud, my ears just stopped ringing from their imaginary cheering,” Barnes said.

Harris leans on the trappings of her office — and Trump’s own playbook — in quest to win the White House | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:56 PM EDT, Sun August 11, 2024",2024-08-11T10:00:02.359Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/politics/harris-campaign-vice-presidency-trump/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris is capitalizing on the trappings of office — and the power of strong imagery — to sustain the momentum surrounding her candidacy in hopes of building a cultural movement for the Democratic ticket in ways that long eluded President Joe Biden. In her quest to defeat Donald Trump, she’s also taking a page out of the former president’s playbook — and drawing his ire in the process. She didn’t just walk onto the stage for one of her biggest rallies of the year last week outside Detroit. Instead, her team allowed anticipation to grow as Air Force Two slowly taxied into view of a crowded airport hanger, with strains of Beyoncé’s “Run the World” pulsing through the air. The choreography matched closely the types of events Trump held as president, his walk-out song “God Bless the USA” now replaced by another Beyoncé song, “Freedom,” as Harris stepped from her plane. For Trump, the images provoked disbelief. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?” he asked on Truth Social on Sunday, falsely suggesting Harris had “NOBODY” waiting for her at the airport. Trump’s wild claims underscored what has become a dominant theme of the recast 2024 election: For Democrats, Harris has generated a level of enthusiasm – and stagecraft – not seen for years. “We’ve got a hot ticket,” said Danielle Tucker, a loyal Democrat, taking in the scene as she and her friends waited for Harris and running mate Tim Walz to make their entrance at the Detroit-area rally. “We’ve got a ticket that brings us joy – before it was just a lot of darkness going on.” Deploying presidential optics is nothing new for an incumbent seeking reelection. During Trump’s first term, he held countless rallies across the country using (a slightly larger) Air Force One. The iconic blue-and-white planes, emblazoned with the words “United States of America,” convey without parallel the power of incumbency. Even out of office, Trump has sought to harness presidential imagery to convey a sense of authority. His team refers to his private Boeing 757 as “Trump Force One.” The words “former president” are almost never used by his aides, who refer to him as 45, for his order in the line of US presidents. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, sought to harness a moment of executive imagery this week when he walked across a tarmac in Wisconsin to view Air Force Two up close. He told reporters he “wanted to check out my future plane” and later posted a photo of him striding away from the familiar white-and-blue jet. As Harris seeks to become the first woman to serve as the American commander in chief, allowing voters to see her in a powerful role is a central part of the strategy to elect her to a still more powerful one. “We’re going to do this!” Harris told a crowd Friday night in Arizona, basking in thunderous applause at the end of her weeklong run through battleground states. “We’re going to do this!” Even before Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race, Harris had been a regular presence by his side during official events. She joined him in hosting Democratic governors at the White House and has been on the line for his phone conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When Netanyahu visited Washington last month, she hosted him for a separate meeting in her office — not unusual for a visiting foreign leader. Afterward, however, she emerged to deliver her own statement to the press, backed by a row of American flags. Harris’ team is prepared for impromptu moments to showcase her existing role in the White House. In the hours after the multicountry prisoner exchange with Russia, Harris delivered last-minute remarks on a tarmac in Houston from a lectern bearing the vice presidential seal, a stand not typically seen at the airport when the president or vice president travels. Harris has been honing her political skills in other ways since entering the White House alongside Biden in 2021. After a somewhat rocky beginning, plagued by stories of internal dysfunction, her operation steadied. She travels frequently to promote administration priorities and meet local officials for roundtables. The energy with which she has ascended to the Democratic nomination has impressed many in the party, who had become accustomed to watching Biden’s appearances with lingering concern about verbal or physical stumbles. Harris’ strategy is not a particularly risky one. She has yet to sit for an interview, though she told reporters Thursday she has asked aides to put one on the schedule before the end of the month. Unlike Trump, whose speeches extend more than an hour with frequent tangents, she is a scripted presence onstage. That has not dampened enthusiasm among her large crowds of supporters, which by the thousands have already greeted Harris in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. In Wisconsin last week, some supporters abandoned their cars on the roadside a mile from the event site and walked the rest of the distance. “It’s not as if anybody cares about crowd sizes or anything,” Walz quipped Friday night, praising the audience at a packed rally outside Phoenix. Those crowds are now a pivotal part of the new plan to defeat Trump. It’s gotten the former president’s attention. “Oh, give me a break,” he groaned at a news conference Thursday when asked if he was worried about the size of Harris’ crowds, before launching into a lengthy answer that only underscored the attention he’s been paying to her events. “I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size, and they never say the crowd was big,” he complained. When Biden and Harris challenged Trump in 2020, the pandemic prevented large rallies, aside from toward the end of the campaign when they stood on stages far away as supporters — often by the hundreds — watched from their cars. Over the past year, Biden struggled mightily to build crowds. Some of his official events were attended by fewer than 100 people. A week before Biden stepped aside from the race, his campaign struggled to fill a high school gymnasium for a rally in Detroit. An urgent text message was sent to all Democratic staffers from congressional and state campaigns to help fill the seats, an aide said. In the first weeks of her candidacy, Harris has seen a dramatic spike in interest. The campaign has utilized veteran Democratic advance staffer Greg Hale, who has helped manage the optics of several presidential campaigns and was on hand at some of Harris’ rallies over the past week. The surge in interest has led to a rapid scaling-up of the campaign’s infrastructure. Merchandise has exploded online. Harris’ crowds are filled with supporters wearing shirts, buttons and hats of all varieties — a scene far more comparable to a Trump rally than a Biden one. “We were all nervous about the president. We were all going to vote for him, but we were a little afraid about the opposition,” said Sheila Sigro, a beautician from Livonia, Michigan, who waited for more than seven hours to see Harris on Wednesday. “When the big switch happened,” she added, “we saw the momentum within hours and now everyone is much, much better, with their enthusiasm and their optimism and their energy.” Harris’ debut as Democrats’ standard bearer has drawn comparisons to Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, with its underpinnings of optimism and large, enthusiastic crowds. It is perhaps not a coincidence that many veterans of that effort are now working for Harris, brought into the fold shortly after Biden withdrew from the contest. David Plouffe, who managed Obama’s first campaign, is now serving as a senior adviser in Harris’ campaign. Veterans of Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign brought onto Harris’ team include Stephanie Cutter and Mitch Stewart. They have been incorporated into a structure still helmed by Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair whom Harris asked to continue in the role when she took over. The reinforced campaign team was in place last week as Harris launched her most intensive stretch of rallies alongside her new running mate. “I think in the last couple of weeks you’ve seen people in the Democratic Party, people in the private sector, a lot of excitement. People want to get involved and help, which is great. And I’m one of those people,” Plouffe said on CNN. This story has been updated with new reporting."
Vance looks to turn tables on Walz | CNN Politics,"Updated 2:23 PM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-11T13:00:02.361Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/politics/vance-interview-walz-trump-harris-cnntv/index.html,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance sought to turn the tables on Democratic rival Tim Walz, asserting that the Minnesota governor is the one being “weird.” In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash that aired Sunday, the Ohio senator pointed to Walz shaking his wife’s hand before hugging her onstage at the rally in Philadelphia at which Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled him as her running mate. Vance accused the Democratic ticket of “a little bit of projection,” contrasting how he’d hugged and kissed his own wife after his first speech as the Republican vice presidential nominee. “Tim Walz gave his wife a nice, firm Midwestern handshake, and then tried to sort of awkwardly correct for it,” Vance said. “I think what it is, is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren’t comfortable in their own skin, because they’re uncomfortable with their policy positions for the American people,” he said. “And so they’re name-calling instead of actually telling the American people how they’re going to make their lives better. I think that’s weird, Dana, but look, they can call me whatever they want to.” Asked whether he was suggesting the governor doesn’t have affection for his wife, Vance said Walz “acted weird, which he did, on a national stage in front of his wife.” Vance’s comments come as Democrats seize on a message that stems from Walz — weeks before his selection as Harris’ ticket mate — describing former President Donald Trump and Vance as “just weird” in an interview on MSNBC. In his “State of the Union” interview, Vance dismissed the taunt as “fundamentally schoolyard bully stuff.” The characterization of Vance as “weird” was fueled in part by comments he made in a 2021 interview, claiming that the United States is run by “childless cat ladies.” He specifically mentioned Harris, who is a stepmother, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who would soon afterward adopt children with his husband. Vance said “of course” he acknowledges the families of Harris and Buttigieg, and argued his comments were taken out of context. With less than three months until Election Day, Trump and Vance are confronting a wildly different race than the one they faced last month, when Trump tapped Vance as his running mate and Republicans gathered in Milwaukee for the party’s convention. President Joe Biden’s departure and replacement as Democratic nominee by Harris has led to a much tighter presidential race than the one polls showed Trump leading for much of 2024. Vance acknowledged in the interview that “it is different.” “But what’s different about it is we’re running against a different person who a lot of Americans just don’t know,” he said. The Ohio senator said Republicans’ goal is to contrast the policies Trump stood for during his term in office with those of the Biden-Harris administration. “Now that was an easier case to make when Joe Biden was in there, because people associate Joe Biden with the policies. But I think Kamala Harris clearly owns the policies of the Biden-Harris administration, especially when we consider the fact that as we’ve all learned in the last few months, Joe Biden clearly isn’t capable of doing the job,” Vance said. He also claimed that Harris “really has been the one calling the shots” in the Biden White House. “I mean, how could she not? I think Joe Biden doesn’t really know where he is,” Vance said. Vance also accused Walz of “lying about his own record” of military service in the interview. He criticized the Minnesota governor for once claiming to have carried weapons “in war” — a Harris campaign spokesperson said Walz misspoke — and for failing to correct descriptions of him in the past as having served in wars. “I’m not criticizing Tim Walz’s service; I’m criticizing the fact that he lied about his service for political gain,” Vance said, accusing Walz of “scandalous behavior.” “It’s not right to misstate or embellish what you’ve done, and I think that’s what he did,” Vance said. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. He deployed with his unit to Italy in 2003 in support of the US’ war effort in Afghanistan but did not deploy to a combat zone as part of his service. Vance pointed out that retired Command Sgt. Maj. Doug Julin, who was Walz’s superior and is a longtime critic of the Minnesota governor, told CNN’s Laura Coates on Friday that Walz dodged his deployment to Iraq by retiring months before he would have been deployed to Iraq. Notice of the deployment came in the fall of 2004, before Walz retired, Julin said. “He knew he was going to Iraq,” Vance said. “He decided to quit — to retire; whatever word you want to use … because he wanted to run for Congress. He lied about that. He said that when he decided to retire, he did not know he was going to Iraq. That is another untruth, as even his senior military officer said. “I’m not criticizing his service. I’m criticizing dishonesty — dishonesty spoken in favor and for the purpose of political benefit.” He also said Harris’ choice of Walz is “a serious lapse in judgment.” “And I don’t want to hear from a campaign spokesperson of Kamala Harris; I want to hear Kamala Harris herself address what I just said,” Vance said. “He said he served in war, and he didn’t. That is a dishonesty. … The truth is that Tim Walz didn’t tell the truth, and importantly, Dana, this is about Kamala Harris’ judgment.” Vance said if reelected, Trump would not seek to block access to the abortion drug mifepristone. However, he said the former president would “let states make the decision on abortion policy” — a position he acknowledged would lead to a patchwork of policies, including blue states with fewer restrictions and red states with more. Asked about Kate Cox, the Texas woman who had to leave the state to receive an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a rare and deadly genetic condition, Vance said, “My heart breaks for this woman.” He said Trump is “not trying to prevent women who have nonviable pregnancies from getting access to the medical care that they need.” “But what President Trump has said is that we’re going to let voters make these decisions. … You’ve got to let the voters make these decisions,” Vance said. “I think that we have to let voters decide, and when they speak their mind, you have to be respectful.” Vance said he was personally “not passing judgment on what those laws should be.” Vance said he agrees with Trump’s comment in a news conference last week that presidents should “have at least a say” over Federal Reserve policy — a position that would undercut the central bank’s historical autonomy. “The political leadership of this country should have more say over the monetary policy of this country. I agree with him. That should fundamentally be a political decision. Agree or disagree, we should have America’s elected leaders having input about the most important decisions confronting our country,” Vance said. “Whether the country goes to war; what our interest rates are — these are important questions that American democracy should have important answers for,” he said. “I think all President Trump was saying was that look, it’s kind of weird that you have so many bureaucrats making so many important decisions. If the American people don’t like our interest rate policy, they should elect somebody different to change that policy. Nothing should be above democratic debate in this country when it comes to the big questions confronting the United States.” After Trump set off controversy by questioning the racial heritage of Harris – whose parents were immigrants from Jamaica and India – Vance said he believes Harris “is whatever she says she is.” However, he again cast Harris as a political “chameleon,” arguing that was the point Trump was attempting to make with his false comments at the recent National Association of Black Journalists convention. “She’s not running a political campaign. She’s running a movie. She only speaks to voters behind a teleprompter. Everything is scripted. She doesn’t have her policy positions out there,” Vance said. He also pointed to liberal positions Harris took during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary – a race she dropped out of in 2019, before the first votes were cast. “She hasn’t answered why she wanted to ban fracking but now she doesn’t; she wanted to defund the police but now she doesn’t; she wanted to open the border but now she doesn’t,” Vance said. “She should have to answer for why she presents a different set of policies to one audience and a different set of policies to another audience,” he said. “And I think that’s what President Trump was getting at. This is a fundamentally fake person. She’s different depending on who she’s in front of.”"
"When Trump attacks Harris’ racial identity, these Americans say it’s personal | CNN","Published 11:00 AM EDT, Sun August 11, 2024",2024-08-11T15:00:03.277Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/us/racial-identity-trump-harris-multiracial-reaction/index.html,"Sean Webb didn’t expect to be sitting at his keyboard, sharing painful childhood memories. But that’s what the 35-year-old employment specialist in Denver found himself doing recently. In a series of Facebook posts, Webb wrote about how invisible he once felt when standardized test forms forced him to select a race by checking just one box. He wrote about the first, harsh moment when he realized others saw him differently than he saw himself – describing how a classmate once berated him with questions insisting he was Chinese or Japanese (He isn’t). And he wrote about the time when his high school civics class once spent an entire period debating whether he was a US citizen (He is). Webb’s mom is Filipina. His dad grew up in Appalachia. He’s inherited those identities. He takes pride in them. Sometimes, his feelings about them may even go unsaid. But Webb says he felt like he had to speak out and share his reflections on Facebook after hearing recent remarks from former President Donald Trump. Trump was taking aim at Vice President Kamala Harris before an audience at the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention, but his words hit Webb hard. “Is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump said, falsely claiming his political rival for the presidency “happened to turn Black” a few years ago. “It felt like a direct attack against me and against other mixed-race people,” Webb says. “Especially his comment that implied that Vice President Harris should have to choose one or the other, and that you can’t be both. That’s my lived experience. You really must be both. Both sides of me inform my experience.” It’s an experience that an increasingly large number of people in the United States can relate to. Webb, Harris and more than 33 million other multiracial Americans are, by some measures, part of the nation’s fastest growing demographic group. And for many of them, former President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on Harris’ identity feel particularly personal. There’s little doubt that Trump’s comments were in some part reflective of the country’s changing demographic realities, says Martha S. Jones, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Results from the 2020 Census revealed the country is more racially and ethnically diverse than ever. The number of people in the US who identify as two or more races grew a stunning 276% between 2010 and 2020, according to Census figures, though experts say that jump may largely be the result of better measurement of the existing population. But when it comes to thinking about the scale of the shift, Jones says she’d estimate it differently. Yes, there are more than 33 million people who identified as two or more races in the census. But imagine, she says, the vast network of people connected with them — parents, spouses, other family members, even friends. “There’s a math to do that says this is not (33 million) people, this is a hundred million people,” says Jones, who’s working on a memoir about her family’s own multiracial history. That all adds up, Jones says, to a country where many are likely to bristle at Trump’s framing of the issue, because their own lived experiences have shown them a different and more fluid reality. Of course, multiracial Americans aren’t a monolithic group –— the umbrella term encompasses a vast array of beliefs, cultural backgrounds and lived experiences. And some wouldn’t describe themselves as multiracial or mixed race, preferring different terminology. For her part, Harris has brushed off Trump’s criticism as “the same old show.” Referencing his remarks at a speech in Houston that same day, she slammed Trump’s “divisiveness and… disrespect” and added that “the American people deserve better.” Harris’ father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. In addition to honoring her South Asian heritage, she attended a historically Black university and has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate. That hasn’t stopped Trump from doubling down and sharing numerous social media posts painting her as a political opportunist as he calls her racial identity into question. On Thursday, he told reporters he thought she was “disrespectful” to both sides of her heritage. The former president’s surrogates and supporters have also defended and repeated his false claims, arguing that Harris has only recently embraced her Black identity. Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance, himself the father of three biracial children, told CNN last week that Trump’s comments didn’t give him pause at all. “Look, all he said is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon,” Vance said. “She’s only Black when it’s time to get elected,” said Michaelah Montgomery, a Black GOP activist, drawing cheers from the crowd at a recent Trump rally in Georgia. “While you’re touting her as a savior for Black people, she identifies as an Asian woman. She chose her side, and it wasn’t ours.” Model and media personality Amber Rose, who is biracial and a fervent Trump supporter, echoed that point in a recent interview, drawing a contrast between her own approach to racial identity. “I have a Black mom and a White dad. And you know, for me, people get mad at me because I identify as biracial. I don’t pick a side. I don’t say I’m a Black woman. I don’t say I’m a white woman. I don’t feel like either. I feel like both,” she said. “And so I think the confusing part with Kamala is she really promoted herself as an Indian woman, and she picked a side essentially.  Even though she’s biracial, she picked a side. And now all of the sudden she wants the Black vote. And it’s like, ‘Oh, I’m a Black woman now’ … It seems disingenuous.” Angela Lee was dreading the ripple effects when she first heard Trump’s remarks last week. The 38-year-old nonprofit executive director in Pasadena, California, says she’s played the video of Trump over and over in disbelief. Lee identifies as Afro-Latina. She immediately thought about her two young daughters, who are Black and Puerto Rican, like her, and Korean, like their dad. Her heart sank as she imagined how they’d feel if someone said something like that to them on the playground. “There’s a permission that was given in what he said, for other people to continue that conversation,” she says. “It gives me a stomachache.” Lee says she’s offended by the implication that Harris is denying her Blackness if she emphasizes her Indian heritage at certain points. In a recent post on Truth Social, for example, Trump shared a video of Harris cooking alongside Indian American actress Mindy Kaling and slammed the vice president as a “stone cold phony.” Lee says Trump’s interpretation is “completely incorrect.” “The reality is, as mixed-race folks, when we show up in spaces, depending on the room, we are constantly taking the temperature. Does this space require me to be more Black? Does this space require me to be more Latina?” she says. “In that space, she was cooking Indian food with another South Asian, so of course she’s going to talk about her Indian heritage, because that’s what that moment required of her.” Trump, Lee says, keeps raising the kinds of accusations she knows all too well. “In high school, kids would tell me to my face that I wasn’t Black enough because of the lifestyle that my family and I lived, or the way that I spoke. … Or I was told I wasn’t Latino enough because my hair couldn’t be slicked back in a bun. Whatever it was, there was something about my presentation that negated my racial identity in their eyes,” she says. “And it’s painful.” When asked to describe his race, Anthony McDowell generally has a go-to response: “Human.” McDowell, 50, of Houston, also took to Facebook when he heard Trump’s recent comments, sharing a snapshot of more than a dozen family members with a caption. “My mixed family. So I can identify as white, Asian, or even Asian American. See how that works.” McDowell’s mom is Vietnamese. His dad was the first generation in his Irish family born in the United States. “My sister-in-law’s Black. My wife is Hispanic. Two of my sons are blonde hair, blue eyes. … When we go places, when people see us all, they think we’re like a church group, or we’re just like friends hanging out, when we’re actually a family. We’ve been called the United Nations of families.” But since Trump’s 2016 campaign for the presidency began, McDowell says the pride he feels in his family’s diversity has been accompanied by a sense of dread amid what he says is growing hostility they’ve faced. “I’m scared for my mother whenever she goes somewhere by herself,” he says. “I have even been told to go back to my country, and I’m like, ‘I was born here.’ I was born in Texas. I was born in Houston. This is my country. I served it. My mom’s a citizen.” And in this divisive and decisive political moment, McDowell says his fears are intensifying. He worries about the “great replacement theory” rhetoric from some on the far right who he says seem to be threatened by racial diversity. “I just want people to love other people. But it doesn’t seem like they see it that way,” he says. “They think that people are coming here to take everything from them, and no one’s doing that.” Depending how the election goes, McDowell says he’s prepared to sell everything and move overseas to protect his family. “I know this is a great country. I served in the military. I did my time for our country,” he says. “But it’s just gotten so fearful and so hateful lately.” Despite his misgivings about Trump’s recent comments, and the painful personal memories they evoked, Sean Webb says he’s feeling hopeful about the future. There are many things that excite him about Harris’ candidacy, including her mixed-race heritage. That part of her background, he says, helps make her even more qualified for the presidency, as she can draw on experiences navigating and embracing different cultures. “I know she understands the feeling of coming from two worlds, and possibly being pulled between the two,” he says. “But she very clearly puts forward that she is both.” And Webb says another event is also inspiring his optimism. While watching this year’s Olympics, Webb says he’s also been struck by another reality. “Especially on the gymnastics teams, on Team USA, you see every demographic representation,” he says. “And I think that’s what’s really beautiful, and what America should be, and what makes us strong.”"
An 81-year-old chiefs fan dreamed of meeting Patrick Mahomes before she ‘croaks.’ | CNN,"Updated 11:25 AM EDT, Mon August 12, 2024",2024-08-11T11:01:47.536Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/11/us/chiefs-fan-dreamed-of-meeting-mahomes/index.html,"Kayren Spain, 81, describes herself as a “football fanatic.” Since the early days of her childhood growing up in Alabama, the sport has been a consistent theme in her life. From Johnny Unitas to Cam Newton, she has always had an affinity for quarterbacks. But none have been greater than her obsession with Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. After discovering Mahomes through a video of Henry Winkler meeting him, she fell in love with Mahomes’ wit in interviews and his skills on the field. Spain said she loves his humility, appreciates he is not a showboater but most importantly, “He plays ball like I have never seen.” Elizabeth Carter, one of Spain’s daughters, said her mother has always been a deeply passionate person. “She was very passionate about her motherhood and creating a home for her kids,” Carter said. Spain goes the extra mile as a fan. A few years ago, she took up sewing and has started to make her own Mahomes-themed clothing. And her devotion to the quarterback led her to create the goal of meeting him before she “croaks.” Inspired by Mahomes and Winkler’s friendship, formed after the celebrities met on the sidelines of a Chiefs game, Spain launched a social media campaign in February 2023 to gather attention toward her dream of meeting her favorite athlete. She began posting daily videos on several social media platforms, with the hope she would one day meet her idol in person. Her family immediately began cheering her on. What surprised Kim Carter, another of Spain’s daughters, was how devoted she was to the campaign. Spain had previously posted videos to her YouTube channel showcasing some of her watercolor paintings but she had little experience filming. In real time, Spain learned how to take videos of herself and post them to different platforms. “What 80-year-old do you know that’s figuring out technology like that?” Kim Carter asked. Spain’s enthusiasm only grew as she showcased her Mahomes memorabilia collection and elaborate custom clothing pieces. Then, her online devotion caught the eyes of Randi Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes’ mother, who commented on one of her Instagram posts. Later in the year, Spain and her family traveled to Kansas City to watch the Chiefs play in Arrowhead Stadium. Spain had posted the morning of the game she would be in a specific section, and Randi Mahomes later came by to meet her and they took several photos together. Spain continued to avidly follow the quarterback, posting paintings and new Chiefs memorabilia on her social media accounts from time to time. When her daughter, Kim Carter, filmed a documentary for her son’s wedding, Spain mentioned she wanted a documentary of her own. Elizabeth Carter and Kim Carter decided they would take their mother to the Chiefs training camp and make a documentary out of it. On August 2, 2024, Spain and her daughters arrived at the Chiefs training camp in St. Joseph, Missouri, for Quarterback Autograph Day, hoping their mother would be able to meet her idol. The training camp was packed with thousands of people who had all come to watch Mahomes practice for the upcoming NFL season. As Spain waded through the crowd, she met several fans and told them her story. The fans helped Spain get close to the best part of the stands to get an autograph from one of the players. A generous Chiefs fan who had camped out the night before gave her seat to Spain after hearing her story. When the practice ended, Mahomes walked up to the stands, straight toward the section where Spain was sitting. There, in the grandstands, the star quarterback and his super fan met at last. The two had a brief conversation as he signed two of Spain’s watercolor paintings and acknowledged his mother had previously told him about her. Her daughters never lost faith Spain would be able to fulfill her dream. Spain’s enthusiasm and devotion led her to never giving up hope she would achieve her goal. “It never works out exactly how you think it’s gonna happen but never stop dreaming,” Spain said. For Kim Carter, the heartwarming event has changed her outlook on how she approaches the generosity of strangers. “I will always trust the kindness of strangers and I will never doubt life’s working out that things can synchronously pop up.” After the excitement of the day, Spain was back on Instagram and told her followers, “Dreams really do come true.”"
"August 10, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-10T13:01:15.230Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/harris-trump-election-08-10-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Donald Trump on Saturday accused Vice President Kamala Harris of copying him after she backed the elimination of taxes on tips for hospitality workers, a policy first proposed by the former president.  Speaking at a Las Vegas rally Saturday, Harris promised to advance policies to benefit working families, pointing to the elimination of taxes on tips as an example.  Trump first raised the proposal at a June rally in Las Vegas, saying, “When I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips. We’re going to do that right away, first thing in office, because it’s been a point of contention for years … and you do a great job of service — you take care of people.” Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday backed the elimination of taxes on tips for hospitality and service workers, endorsing a policy first proposed by former President Donald Trump.  Speaking to a crowd of thousands at a Las Vegas rally, which included members of the state’s powerful culinary workers union, Harris promised to advance policies to benefit working families, pointing to the elimination of taxes on tips as an example.  Harris’ support for eliminating taxes on tips comes after Trump proposed the idea at a campaign rally in Las Vegas in June.  Harris is seeking to coalesce support from the sizable coalition of service industry workers in the key battleground state. The vice president recognized members of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in attendance at the rally, one day after the union endorsed her.  After Trump proposed eliminating taxes on tips in June, the union’s secretary-treasurer, Ted Pappageorge, pushed back on his promise, saying, “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.” The proposal is among the first notable policies offered by Harris since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket last month. Speaking to reporters in Arizona earlier Saturday, Harris said she plans to roll out her economic policy platform next week, noting that it will be focused on “what we need to do to bring down costs and also strengthen the economy.” A San Francisco fundraiser for the Harris Victory Fund has raised more than $12 million, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson said a day ahead of the event. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to travel to San Francisco following her Saturday rally in Las Vegas. The Democratic presidential nominee will deliver remarks at Sunday’s fundraiser, as will former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The campaign has seen a significant cash boost since Harris launched her presidential bid last month, including raising $36 million in the 24 hours after she announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday.  The campaign also said it raked in a whopping $310 million in its July fundraising efforts. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thanked supporters for braving the extreme heat at a joint rally with Vice President Kamala Harris in Las Vegas on Saturday, joking that “I’m melting like a snowman outside.” The Democratic vice presidential nominee also apologized to those who were turned away after the doors closed early as some people in line fell ill from the high temperatures. During his remarks, Walz briefly paused to allow medical staff to provide treatment to a person near the front of the crowd. Local law enforcement in Las Vegas closed the doors to Kamala Harris’ Saturday rally early after people waiting in line were falling ill from extreme heat, the campaign told reporters traveling with the vice president. The Harris campaign said law enforcement closed the doors “in the last hour” as thousands of people waited in line to enter the rally. CNN observed ambulances and medical professionals on scene as people entered the venue. Harris campaign staff passed out water bottles and fans to those waiting, while some portions of the line were covered by tents and cooled by large fans. Some people were observed being treated for illness outside the venue. A crowd of thousands awaited Harris’ remarks Saturday evening, although many seats remained empty ahead of the event. Vice President Kamala Harris said Saturday that she will roll out her economic policy platform next week and that it will focus on inflation.  The economy remains a critical issue for voters, as an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released Tuesday finds that Americans trust Donald Trump over Harris to handle the economy — but it is closely split. Fifty-one percent say Trump would be better at handling the economy, while 48% say Harris would be. When asked about the independence of the Federal Reserve, and suggestions that Trump has made that he would try to exert direct power over monetary policy — Harris said she would “never interfere” in decisions made by the Fed.  Asked about concerns about a potential recession, Harris said, “There was some turbulence this week, but it seems to have settled itself, and we’ll see what decisions they make next. I hear about them about the same time you do.”  The White House said Saturday that it condemned any attempt at foreign interference in American elections after the Trump campaign said it was hacked by Iran. On the specifics of the Trump campaign’s allegations, the National Security Council deferred to the Justice Department but said the White House takes “any reports of such activity extremely seriously.” Politico reported earlier Saturday that it had received emails from an anonymous account with documents from inside Donald Trump’s campaign operation. The Trump campaign pinned blame on Iran, though it is unclear whether the country was involved. CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission to the United Nations, the FBI and the Justice Department for comment. Vice President Kamala Harris said Saturday that “far too many civilians” have been killed in Gaza, after an Israeli strike on a school and mosque killed at least 93 Palestinians, according to local officials.   Gaza Civil Defense officials said people were performing dawn prayers at the Al-Tabi’in compound in the Al-Daraj neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City when it was hit overnight into Saturday. Israel confirmed it carried out the strike, saying Hamas was operating there. Harris added, “We need to get the hostages out. We need a hostage deal, and we need a ceasefire. And I can’t stress that strongly enough, it needs to get done.”  Harris’ comments about Israel on Saturday amounted to some of the most substantial on a policy-related matter since she became the Democratic standard-bearer.  Like President Joe Biden, she is confronting a political and diplomatic tightrope when it comes to Gaza.  While she and the White House have held out hope for a hostage and ceasefire deal that would bring an end to fighting in Gaza and lower regional temperatures, the power to reach such an agreement rests with Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — neither of whom has given final sign-off. Singer Celine Dion issued a statement Saturday slamming Donald Trump’s campaign for the “unauthorized usage” of her music, adding that she does not endorse its use or any other similar use.  The Trump campaign has played Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” at multiple campaign rallies throughout 2023 and 2024, though Dion’s statement says she and her management team had only recently become aware of its use, specifically pointing to it being played at the former president’s rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday.  CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign regarding whether it will cease playing the song at events. Rihanna, the Rolling Stones, Ozzy Osbourne, Queen and the estate of George Harrison, among other musicians, have all previously objected to Trump’s presidential campaigns using their music, dating to his original run in 2016. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Saturday said in a statement it had been hacked.  Politico reported earlier on Saturday it had received emails from an anonymous account with documents from inside Trump’s campaign operation.  Cheung pointed to a recent report published by Microsoft that said Iranian operatives had ramped up their attempts to influence and monitor the US presidential election by creating fake news outlets targeting liberal and conservative voters and by trying to hack an unnamed presidential campaign.  “On Friday, a new report from Microsoft found that Iranian hackers broke into the account of a ‘high ranking official’ on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump’s selection of a Vice Presidential nominee. This comes after recent reports of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, PA tragedy,” Cheung said. Cheung continued: “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House. Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” Still, it’s not clear whether Iran was responsible for the hacking, and the Microsoft report doesn’t say whether Iran was successful. CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission to the United Nations for comment.  CNN has also asked the Trump campaign whether it contacted law enforcement and has also reached out to the FBI and Department of Justice for comment.  Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance sought to brush off his Democratic rivals’ attempts to brand him as “weird,” claiming that Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, “aren’t comfortable in their own skin.” The Ohio senator’s comments came as Democrats seize on a message that stems from Walz — weeks before his selection as Harris’ ticket mate — describing former President Donald Trump and Vance as “just weird” in an interview on MSNBC. Bash noted that Harris and Walz have discussed policy positions and are trying to define the Republican ticket in voters’ eyes as well. “Dana, if you go to Kamala Harris’ campaign page right now, they still don’t have a policy — policy positions about what they’re going to do,” Vance said. “I think that’s really insulting to Americans.” Harris’ campaign website includes biographies of the vice president and Walz, as well as fundraising, volunteering and merchandise sections, but it does not feature a section laying out policy positions. For Dana Bash’s full interview with JD Vance, watch “State of the Union” on Sunday at 9 a.m. ET. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will wrap up their battleground state campaign blitz with a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, later today. The rally, which will be held at the University of Las Vegas, comes on the heels of an endorsement from the Culinary Union, which is Nevada’s largest labor union, representing 60,000 workers across the state. Harris and Walz will be introduced by Tillie Torres, a local Clark County teacher of 24 years and cancer survivor, who had student loans forgiven under the Biden-Harris administration, according to the campaign. Additional speakers at the event include Rep. Steven Horsford, Rep. Susie Lee, Rep. Dina Titus, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Sen. Jacky Rosen. Entertainment will be provided by DJ D-Nice. Other attendees at the event include former Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and League of United Latin American Citizens President Roman Palomares. The political arm of LULAC endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket on Friday, the first time the civil rights organization has endorsed a presidential candidate in its almost 100-year history. President Joe Biden touted new statistics that show violent crime is lower than when he and Vice President Kamala Harris took office, as reducing crime remains a top 2024 campaign issue. The data shows violent crime is at a “50-year low,” according to new statistics from the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities. Violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020. Reducing crime remains a top political issue for both parties, according to polling earlier this year from the Pew Research Center; 68% of Republicans and 47% of Democrats rated reducing crime as a “top political priority,” which is an increase for both parties since 2021.  The Trump campaign’s chief pollster downplayed a new set of polls from The New York Times and Siena College that show a close presidential race with no clear leader in three crucial states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Tony Fabrizio claimed the polls “dramatically understated President Trump’s support both among all registered voters and in their likely-voter model,” in a statement released Saturday, adding he believes they are part of “a series of public surveys released with the clear intent and purpose of depressing support for President Trump.” What the polls show: In head-to-head matchups among registered voters, Trump takes 48% to Harris’ 45% in Michigan; while in Pennsylvania, it’s 49% Harris to 46% Trump; and in Wisconsin, it’s 50% Harris to 46% Trump. There’s a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points or more for the poll in each state. The campaign statement comes as Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has seen a surge of enthusiasm in recent weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed the vice president.  Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Saturday denied that Trump has repeatedly called Vice President Kamala Harris a “b*tch” in private in recent weeks, after The New York Times reported on Saturday that he had used the derogatory term to refer to his Democratic rival.  The campaign pointed to a clip that is circulating on social media where Harris is heard saying, “As a woman, there’s a balance to be struck between being tough and being a b*tch.” The Trump campaign played the video during Trump’s campaign speech in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday night. Vice President Kamala Harris, quoting her mother, told a group of newly sworn-in commissioners for a White House initiative for Hispanics that their work on education and economic opportunity would be done in the context of their communities. It went viral. First, as a criticism of Harris on right-wing social media accounts, including @RNCResearch, the rapid response account of the Republican National Committee. But slowly, then all at once — around the time she became the presumptive Democratic nominee — it was co-opted by her supporters, who remixed and reposted the meme and catapulted Harris onto the “for you page” for TikTok users across the country and globe. For years as vice president, Harris has been quietly laying the digital groundwork behind the scenes — meeting with young voters, social media influencers and several grassroots organizations. Now, with less than 90 days until the November election, the Harris campaign has made subtle shifts to capitalize on the momentum around her candidacy — and translate her growing social media following into votes. Since President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed his vice president for the Democratic nomination 20 days ago, the Harris campaign’s digital structure and strategy have largely stayed the same, sources say. But there have been subtle shifts to better reflect the younger nominee at the top of the ticket. The number of plays Harris’ @KamalaHQ TikTok received for its 65 posts in 20 days is more than double what the @BidenHQ’s 335 posts received in roughly five months.

Tim Walz “misspoke” in a newly resurfaced video from 2018 in which he said he handled assault weapons “in war,” a Harris campaign spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. Walz’s military record has been heavily scrutinized by Republicans, including GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance, in the days after being tapped as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate on Monday. Vance has accused Walz of “stolen valor,” pointing to a video from 2018 circulated by the Harris campaign this week of Walz referring to weapons “that I carried in war” while explaining his support for an assault weapons ban. “We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,” Walz said in the video. Lauren Hitt, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said in a statement the governor misspoke in the clip. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way,” Hitt said in the statement. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, most recently in the Minnesota National Guard, before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. He deployed with his unit to Italy in 2003 in support of the US war effort in Afghanistan, but did not deploy to a combat zone as part of his service. Clarification: The post has been updated to reflect Walz served 24 years total in the Army National Guard, including in the Minnesota National Guard. Former President Donald Trump on Friday launched another string of attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris as he continued to pressure her to answer more questions from reporters. “If you can’t do a press conference, you cannot be president,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Bozeman, Montana. Trump falsely claimed that Harris was “refusing to debate” him. Harris and Trump have both agreed to a debate hosted by ABC News on September 10, and Harris told reporters Thursday she would be “happy” to discuss another debate after that. Trump also said he didn’t care if he mispronounced Harris’ name and claimed without elaborating that “nobody really knows her last name.”   “Kamala, sometimes referred to as Kamala, you know, she’s got about nine different ways of pronouncing the name. And because the press is so dishonest, no matter how you say it, they’ll say you were wrong. You were wrong. I don’t care if I get it right, actually, I couldn’t care less,” Trump said. Vice President Kamala Harris responded Friday to pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted her remarks at a rally in Glendale, Arizona, by saying that she and President Joe Biden are “working around the clock” to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and that “now is the time … to get the hostage deal done.” As Harris began her remarks, a group of protesters began chanting off to her right. It was unclear to CNN what exactly was being said The crowd initially attempted to drown out the protesters with chants of “U-S-A.” As they continued to interrupt her, Harris stopped her planned remarks to address the protesters, while indicating she could not hear exactly what they were saying. “We are all in here together, I’m told an extraordinary number of folks who are here together, because we love our country. We’re here to fight for our democracy, which includes respecting the voices that I think that we are hearing from,” she said. Harris then pivoted back to her prepared remarks, telling the protesters, “I respect your voice, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024.” The remark is Harris’ latest rebuff of pro-Palestinian protesters following her terse response to a group of people who interrupted her at a rally in Michigan on Wednesday. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” she said to the protesters. Former Los Angeles city councilman and state Sen. Nate Holden said Friday that he was with former President Donald Trump in a helicopter ride that made an emergency landing, despite Trump saying it was former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.  Trump told reporters gathered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday that he was involved in a helicopter emergency landing with Brown, who has since rejected Trump’s account as “obviously wrong” during a phone call with CNN, adding, “I’ve never been in a helicopter with him in my life.”  Thursday wasn’t the first time Trump referenced the incident as occurring with Brown. In one of Trump’s books, “Letters to Trump,” the former President recalled the event as “a little scary for both of us.” Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung noted that in a post on X Saturday. Holden said that he was in touch with Trump’s team during the 1990s as they were trying to build on the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, the district that Holden represented at the time, according to Politico.  With fewer than 90 days until Election Day, here’s where the presidential candidates are expected to be on Saturday: A set of New York Times/Siena College polls released Saturday morning shows a close presidential race with no clear leader in three crucial states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — with signs that Vice President Kamala Harris is improving on President Joe Biden’s standing in each state. In head-to-head matchups among registered voters, former President Donald Trump takes 48% to Harris’ 45% in Michigan; in Pennsylvania, it’s 49% Harris to 46% Trump; and in Wisconsin, it’s 50% Harris to 46% Trump. There’s a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points or more for the poll in each state. Looking at just those considered likely voters shows equally tight head-to-head races in Michigan (Harris 50%, Trump 46%), Pennsylvania (Harris 50%, Trump 46%) and Wisconsin (Harris 50%, Trump 46%). The numbers in each of the three states mark an improvement for the Democratic ticket compared with NYT/Siena polling testing the race between Biden and Trump earlier this year. Favorability of the candidates: In combined results from Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, 73% of registered voters say they’re satisfied with their choice of candidates in this year’s election, up from 58% in May, with the share of Democratic voters who say they’re satisfied (87%) now slightly outpacing the share of Republican voters saying the same (79%). Across the three states, Harris’ favorability rating stands at 48% favorable, and 49% unfavorable among registered voters; Trump is slightly further underwater, with 46% viewing him favorably and 52% unfavorably. Both candidates are described by a majority of voters across states as intelligent and having a clear vision for the country, with voters more likely to see Harris than Trump as honest and having a presidential temperament. Half of voters say that Harris “will bring about the right kind of change,” with 47% saying the same of Trump. Donald Trump on Friday attacked Tim Walz’s progressive policies in the former president’s first campaign rally since the Minnesota governor became Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.  At a rally in Bozeman, Montana, Trump highlighted bills that Walz signed that expanded health care coverage for undocumented immigrants in Minnesota and that mandated that schools provide free menstrual products in all restrooms – for both girls and boys – regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. He criticized Walz’s handling of the civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and pointed to recent remarks the governor made that “one person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness.” “But I’m not talking about him, I’m talking about her. This is her ideology, that’s why she picked him,” Trump said of Harris, whom he spent much of his campaign speech attacking. Trump made a quick reference to the forceful attacks about Walz’s military service that the former president’s running mate, JD Vance, has deployed against the governor all week. While Montana is reliably red, the state is hosting a pivotal Senate race, with Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this year. Trump on Friday praised Tester’s GOP opponent, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, saying, “His really is valor. It’s valor for heroism award. You know, the other one talks about valor, he has a different kind of a valor, it’s the opposite.” Background: Vance has accused Walz of “stolen valor” for language he used in a 2018 speech advocating an assault weapons ban, which the Harris campaign has included in a video on social media. Walz at the time said he wanted to “make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” Walz never deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service. Vice President Kamala Harris defended her record on securing the nation’s border, pointing to her experience as California’s attorney general. “I was attorney general of a border state. I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers,” she said at a rally in Arizona on Friday. “I prosecuted them in case after case and I won. So I know what I’m talking about.” Her comments come as Republicans have attacked Harris’ stance on border security. Harris reiterated her commitment to sign the bipartisan border security bill that failed to pass Congress earlier this year, while accusing former President Donald Trump of pressuring Republicans to vote against the bill to “help him win an election.” Harris told the thousands gathered at an arena in the Phoenix suburbs she will sign the bill, while calling for immigration reform that includes both “strong border security” and “an earned pathway to citizenship” and drawing a contrast to Trump’s record on immigration. “Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan bill in decades. But Donald Trump tanked the deal because he thought by doing that it would help him win an election. But when I am president I will sign the bill,” she continued, eliciting loud cheers from the audience. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is responding to former President Donald Trump’s stated reasoning for not hitting the campaign trail recently. Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday that he hasn’t been campaigning because “I’m leading by a lot and I’m letting their convention go through.” The latest polls show a tight race ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts on August 19. In a statement, Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson James Singer said: “Donald Trump is too lazy to fight for anything but himself or leave his country club – fine by us,” the statement added."
"Walz ‘misspoke’ in saying he served ‘in war,’ Harris campaign says | CNN Politics","Updated 4:11 PM EDT, Sat August 10, 2024",2024-08-10T16:39:03.658Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/politics/walz-national-guard-harris-campaign/index.html,"Minnesota Gov.

It’s the American way,” Hitt said in the statement. “In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,” Hitt continued. “He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children.” Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring to run for Congress in 2005. He deployed with his unit to Italy in 2003 in support of the US’ war effort in Afghanistan but did not deploy to a combat zone as part of his service. The clarification from the Harris campaign comes as the Trump campaign has sought to discredit Walz’s military service in the days since he joined the Democratic ticket. At a Michigan campaign event on Wednesday, Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, accused Walz of being “dishonest” about his record as part of a series of attacks on the governor’s military record. “What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,” Vance said. “I’d be ashamed if I were him and lied about my military service like he did.” At a campaign rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday, Trump made a brief reference to the attacks on Walz from Vance and other Republicans while praising Montana GOP Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. “His really is valor, it’s valor for heroism award. You know, the other one talks about valor, he has a different kind of a valor, it’s the opposite,” Trump said."
Vance responds to Walz calling GOP ticket ‘weird’ | CNN Politics,"Published 3:18 PM EDT, Sat August 10, 2024",2024-08-10T19:18:17.356Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/politics/vance-walz-gop-weird-cnntv/index.html,"For Dana Bash’s full interview with JD Vance, watch “State of the Union” on Sunday at 9 a.m. ET. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance sought to brush off his Democratic rivals’ attempts to brand him as “weird,” claiming that Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, “aren’t comfortable in their own skin.” “I think what it is, is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren’t comfortable in their own skin, because they’re uncomfortable with their policy positions for the American people,” Vance told CNN’s Dana Bash in an interview set to air Sunday on “State of the Union.” “And so they’re name-calling instead of actually telling the American people how they’re going to make their lives better,” he said. “I think that’s weird, Dana, but look, they can call me whatever they want to.” The Ohio senator’s comments came as Democrats seize on a message that stems from Walz — weeks before his selection as Harris’ ticket mate — describing former President Donald Trump and Vance as “just weird” in an interview on MSNBC. Bash noted that Harris and Walz have discussed policy positions and are trying to define the Republican ticket in voters’ eyes as well. “Dana, if you go to Kamala Harris’ campaign page right now, they still don’t have a policy — policy positions about what they’re going to do,” Vance said. “I think that’s really insulting to Americans.” Harris’ campaign website includes biographies of the vice president and Walz, as well as fundraising, volunteering and merchandise sections, but it does not feature a section laying out policy positions."
"August 9, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-09T12:07:55.495Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/harris-trump-election-08-09-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump on Friday launched another string of attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris as he continued to pressure her to answer more questions from reporters. “Since becoming a presidential candidate, she has refused to do a single interview. You know why? ‘Cause she’s dumb,” the former president said. Trump falsely claimed that Harris was “refusing to debate” him. Harris and Trump have both agreed to a debate hosted by ABC News on September 10, and Harris told reporters Thursday she would be “happy” to discuss another debate after that. Trump also said he didn’t care if he mispronounced Harris’ name and claimed without elaborating that “nobody really knows her last name.”   Donald Trump on Friday attacked Tim Walz’s progressive policies in the former president’s first campaign rally since the Minnesota governor became Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.  At a rally in Bozeman, Montana, Trump highlighted bills that Walz signed that expanded health care coverage for undocumented immigrants in Minnesota and that mandated that schools provide free menstrual products in all restrooms – for both girls and boys – regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. He criticized Walz’s handling of the civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and pointed to recent remarks the governor made that “one person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness.” Trump made a quick reference to the forceful attacks about Walz’s military service that the former president’s running mate, JD Vance, has deployed against the governor all week. While Montana is reliably red, the state is hosting a pivotal Senate race, with Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this year. Trump on Friday praised Tester’s GOP opponent, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, saying, “His really is valor. It’s valor for heroism award. You know, the other one talks about valor, he has a different kind of a valor, it’s the opposite.” Background: Vance has accused Walz of “stolen valor” for language he used in a 2018 speech advocating an assault weapons ban, which the Harris campaign has included in a video on social media. Walz at the time said he wanted to “make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” Walz never deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket ahead of their rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday. The two unions are Nevada affiliates of UNITE HERE, and represent 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno. The Culinary Union is also the state’s largest Latinx/Black/AAPI/immigrant organization with members who come from 178 countries and speak over 40 different languages. The Culinary Union touted Harris’ record of prioritizing and protecting working families, including advocating for affordable housing.  The union said in their endorsement that they believe Harris and Walz “will unite Black, Latinx, Asian American Pacific Islander, Indigenous, white, and immigrant workers to confront corporate greed and lower rent, gas, and grocery prices — unlike Republicans, who side with Wall Street landlords and the super-rich.” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris for President campaign manager, said in a statement, that Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “are honored” for the endorsement. “Standing in solidarity by their side, we will fight for workers, and we will win,” Rodriguez said. Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz stopped by Cocina Adamex, a local Latino-owned small business in Phoenix after their rally on Friday. They were also joined by Rep. Ruben Gallego. Harris briefly spoke with the owner and asked about the history of the restaurant, which the owner said has only been open for two years. Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her commitment to sign the bipartisan border security bill that failed to pass Congress earlier this year during remarks at a campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday while accusing former President Donald Trump of pressuring Republicans to vote against the bill to “help him win an election.” Harris told the thousands gathered at an arena in the Phoenix suburbs she will sign the bill, while calling for immigration reform that includes both “strong border security” and “an earned pathway to citizenship” and drawing a contrast to Trump’s record on immigration. “Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan bill in decades. But Donald Trump tanked the deal because he thought by doing that it would help him win an election. But when I am president I will sign the bill,” she continued, eliciting loud cheers from the audience. Donald Trump didn’t go to Montana for a Friday night rally because he’s desperate for votes in the ruby-red state. He’s won it for two straight presidential elections, each time by more than 15 points. The coming election figures to offer more of the same. The question, though, is whether Republican Senate nominee Tim Sheehy can come close to matching Trump and unseat the crafty Democratic incumbent Jon Tester. If Sheehy succeeds, the GOP’s road to a Senate majority becomes a whole lot clearer. But there’s more to this trip than the usual election season maneuvering. For Trump, ousting Tester has become something of an obsession. In 2018, he traveled to the state four times trying to boost support for Republican nominee Matt Rosendale – now a congressman – in his race against Tester. It didn’t work. Rosendale lost by about 3 points. The former president’s beef with Tester dates back to 2018, when the Montana Democrat was ranking member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and vehemently opposed Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, White House physician Ronny Jackson. Jackson became a Trump favorite early on, when the physician stood up in front of the White House press corps in 2018 and gushed over Trump’s “incredible genes” and, as he told it, “very sharp, very articulate” manner of speaking. A couple of months later, Trump tapped Jackson to lead the VA Department. It seemed an odd choice, given Jackson’s lack of experience for such a high-level job. But he might have been confirmed if not for the release of an explosive report by Democrats, led by Tester, alleging that Jackson was “abusive” to his colleagues and fast and loose with drug prescriptions. He was also accused of being intoxicated on the job and wrecking a government vehicle while drunk. Jackson denied the charges and, after being elected to Congress years later, called the report a “political hit job.” Trump, having held Jackson in such high regard, was infuriated at Democrats for undermining his pick. Jackson eventually withdrew himself from consideration for the post. In July 2018, Trump visited Montana, where he ripped into Tester. “Jon Tester showed his true colors with his shameful, dishonest attacks on a great man,” Trump said of Jackson at a rally in Great Falls. “That’s probably why I’m here.” Trump would return a few more times. Now, years later, he is back and once again seeking revenge. Some younger supporters of former President Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Montana Friday that their top issue this election was inflation, which was a big motivator for them to turn out for Trump in November.   Beyton Owens, 18, says she’s worried about the price of gas because she’s constantly driving for her nannying jobs. She said inflation is top of mind this election “because of my gas and my shopping.” And Tyler Sands, 28, says he had to move from California to Idaho in order to afford a home and thinks Trump can help bring the cost of living down.  “To me, the American dream is owning a home,” Sands, who said he now owns a home, told CNN. He said this was his first Trump rally.  Trump being on TikTok, Lauren Wetherell, 19, says, is “a huge thing” with younger voters, because “more people are getting to know him.”  When asked if she thought young people were excited about Trump, she said “I think yes and no, I think it’s very 50/50.”  Alexander Whitfield, 23, said he would be voting for Trump for the first time in November and has always been a fan of Trump’s. He said he grew up in a family that didn’t vote but has since left the Amish community and was looking forward to casting his vote this fall.   “Trump has always been my — he’s been the GOAT. He’s the man. And if I was voting at the time I would’ve voted for him,” Whitfield said.  Vice President Kamala Harris responded Friday to pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted her remarks at a rally in Glendale, Arizona, by saying that she and President Joe Biden are “working around the clock” to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and that “now is the time … to get the hostage deal done.” As Harris began her remarks, a group of protesters began chanting off to her right. It was unclear to CNN what exactly was being said The crowd initially attempted to drown out the protesters with chants of “U-S-A.” As they continued to interrupt her, Harris stopped her planned remarks to address the protesters, while indicating she could not hear exactly what they were saying. Harris then pivoted back to her prepared remarks, telling the protesters, “I respect your voice, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024.” The remark is Harris’ latest rebuff of pro-Palestinian protesters following her terse response to a group of people who interrupted her at a rally in Michigan on Wednesday. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” she said to the protesters. Harris’ latest call for a ceasefire comes after she recently spoke out forcefully about the situation in Gaza amid Israel’s military campaign in the region. Following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, Harris implored him to agree to a ceasefire deal while saying that “we cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering” of Palestinians in Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris defended her record on securing the nation’s border, pointing to her experience as California’s attorney general. Her comments come as Republicans have attacked Harris’ stance on border security. Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters Friday that he personally encouraged former President Donald Trump to visit his non-battleground home state because he believes Montana will be the state that delivers Republicans the Senate majority come November. Asked by CNN if he was the one who convinced Trump to stomp for Montana Senate nominee Tim Sheehy, Daines said he was, adding that his argument to the former president was that “one of the first phone calls you make as a new president is to the majority leader of the US Senate because our Founding Fathers gave a very important responsibility to the United States Senate, that was not given to the US House, and that’s personnel management. Every nominee from a president has to go through the US Senate.” The NRSC chair also maintained that Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascension to Democratic standard-bearer “hasn’t changed the way we’re thinking about the Senate races,” though he did acknowledge the enthusiasm around her candidacy before calling it a “honeymoon phase.” “There’s definitely a honeymoon period going on, and it’ll continue through the (Democratic National Convention). I think as we turn the corner in the middle of September, there’s going to be an awakening,” Daines said. Daines also jabbed at Harris’ new ruling mate, Tim Walz, claiming that the Minnesota governor was “by far our favorite pick from the NRSC perspective.” Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly on Friday defended Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s record of military service and attacked former President Donald Trump over his alleged past comments diminishing members of the military. Speaking at a campaign rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Glendale, Arizona, Kelly, a retired Navy pilot and astronaut, praised Walz’s years of service in the Minnesota Army National Guard and argued Walz’s experience in the military has informed his work in politics for the better.  Kelly went on to argue that Trump has “zero respect” for military service members, pointing to past reports that he allegedly denigrated members of the military as “suckers and losers.” “Now that’s not something I expect that Donald Trump would understand. Donald Trump calls those who served suckers and losers, and he has zero respect for any of us who have worn the uniform,” he said. “Here in Arizona, we don’t attack people for their service to our country. We thank them.” Kelly’s defense comes as Republicans, led by Trump’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have attacked Walz for past comments about his military service record. Kelly, who praised Walz throughout his remarks, did not acknowledge Friday that he had been among the contenders to be Harris’ running mate. He called Harris “the leader we need to take our country into the future,” pointing to her commitments to lower child care costs, restore reproductive rights and reduce gun violence – an issue with added significance as he spoke alongside his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot at a constituent event in 2011. Giffords also spoke briefly and reflected on being shot and her road to recovery in the years since, stressing the time it takes to bring change. “Change doesn’t happen overnight, and we can’t do it alone. Join me. Let’s move ahead together,” Giffords said. Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown told CNN on Friday that he has “no idea” what Donald Trump was talking about when the former president recounted a story about a helicopter emergency landing he allegedly experienced with Brown. In a Thursday news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump was asked by a reporter about Vice President Kamala Harris’ previous relationship with Brown and whether it helped her career trajectory. Trump said he knew Brown “very well” and told a story about the alleged incident. But Brown told CNN’s John Berman on Friday that he has never been in a helicopter with Trump. A Trump campaign senior adviser on Friday pointed CNN to a story by The New York Times that noted that Trump had told the story before, in his 2023 book, “Letters to Trump,” which featured correspondence between himself and Brown. The former president also claimed Thursday that Brown was “not a fan” of Harris and had told him “terrible things” about her. Asked Friday if he’d ever had a derogatory conversation about Harris with Trump, Brown told Berman, “No, I have not, nor anybody else.” “You’ve got to know that she served California extremely well,” Brown said of Harris, Trump’s Democratic rival. “She defeated an incumbent district attorney in this city because the people loved her, and she performed very well.” Trump doubled down on his claim Friday, a day after The New York Times reported that the former president had confused Willie Brown with former California Gov. Jerry Brown, with whom Trump toured wildfire damage by helicopter in November 2018. Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he had not confused the two politicians This post has been updated with additional comments from Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz stopped by a campaign field office in Phoenix, Arizona, ahead of their rally tonight in Glendale. The pair greeted staff members and volunteers. They shook hands, thanked volunteers for their time and complemented an assortment of signs that were being handmade. The vice president and Walz took a selfie in front of a large “Kamala and Coach” sign before exiting the office.  Donald Trump’s plane had a mechanical issue and was diverted on its way to Bozeman, Montana, for his fundraiser and rally, but landed safely in Billings, a source familiar with matter told CNN. Trump is currently en route to his fundraiser in Bozeman. The former president posted an hour ago on Truth Social that he had landed in Montana but did not mention an issue with the plane. Former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he has landed in Montana for a fundraiser and a campaign rally.  Trump attacked Harris and again called her a “phony.”  Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that media coverage around his revealing he placed a dead bear cub in New York City’s Central Park 10 years ago has hurt his presidential campaign while lambasting the media for covering the story instead of his “colorful personal life.” Kennedy said in an interview with Fox News on Friday he does not believe the anecdote about the dead bear, which he shared in a video he posted to his social media last week, has been helpful for his campaign. Kennedy said he’d rather focus on issues at the core of his campaign, like fighting government corruption, reducing US military influence and reimagining health care in the country. “Those are the issues that I would prefer to talk about, rather than, you know, my colorful personal life,” he said. Kennedy also addressed recent polling that suggests his campaign is failing to gain ground on former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, while acknowledging that some voters may feel voting for a third-party candidate with an unclear path to victory is riskier than backing one of the two major party candidates. When asked about how he plans to convince voters worried about wasting their vote to back him in November, Kennedy said he doesn’t know. “I don’t know,” he said. “I’m hoping that we figure out a way to counter it over the next three months.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign launched a new TV ad Friday promoting her commitment to border security as the Democrat looks to shore up a perceived vulnerability on an issue that Republicans have emphasized in their attacks.  Touting Harris as a former “border state prosecutor,” the ad is filled with images of border fencing and law enforcement, and contains the tag line, “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris.” The focus on immigration is a notable shift from earlier messaging that focused more on Harris’ biography and record, though it contains some similar elements, including reference to her law enforcement background as a former attorney general, which has been consistently emphasized. The tough-talk on the border and the spotlight on Harris’ background are a response to sustained Republican criticism on the issues of immigration and crime, which have been dominant themes in GOP campaign advertising. According to AdImpact data, nearly every ad run by Republicans in the presidential race over the last 30 days has referenced immigration, accounting for about $40 million for the $41 million total in TV advertising aired during that period. And about $19 million of that advertising has also referenced crime. Former President Donald Trump on Friday criticized podcaster Joe Rogan after Rogan praised independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Rogan said Thursday on his podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience” that Kennedy is “the only one that makes sense to me,” but later clarified that his praise did not amount to an endorsement. Rogan later posted on X: “For the record, this isn’t an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence. I think we could use more of that in this world.” Kennedy thanked Rogan for his comments. A super PAC backing Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is seeking to block Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ballot access in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, arguing Kennedy’s campaign violates petition-collecting laws in the state.  Clear Choice PAC, a group of Democrats combating ballot access for third parties, is supporting a challenge filed on Thursday by two voters asking a Pennsylvania judge to reject Kennedy’s ballot access, arguing his signatures show “a fundamental disregard of the circulation process and Pennsylvania law.”  The group argues the formatting of the petitions Kennedy submitted to Pennsylvania’s elections office “show a concerted effort to cover up” his petition circulation process and argues there are “numerous” faulty signatures among those submitted by Kennedy.  The group also argues that Kennedy intended to “deceive” Pennsylvania voters by listing a New York address as his residency despite living in Los Angeles. The residency question is also at the heart of Clear Choice’s objection to Kennedy’s ballot access in New York, which is currently being considered by a New York state court.  Kennedy’s campaign submitted signatures for ballot access in June. The deadline for outside groups to file objections to independent candidate petitions was Thursday.  Some background: The objection could trigger a review of the signature threshold for independent presidential candidates seeking to gain ballot access in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office has said it will accept nomination petitions containing 5,000 valid signatures in line with a 2018 court ruling on a minor party’s ballot access, despite Pennsylvania’s code of elections stipulating an independent candidate would need 33,043 signatures to qualify for November’s ballot. But the secretary’s office has offered guidance that an objection to an independent candidate’s petition could create an issue that “the state judiciary would need to resolve.”  The court has not yet said whether it would consider the state’s signature threshold for independent candidates. A hearing on the next steps in the federal election subversion case against former President Donald Trump will take place on September 5 after a trial judge on Friday granted an extension sought by special counsel Jack Smith. The deadline for a status report that the parties were slated to file Friday has now been moved back to August 30, according to the new order from US District Judge Tanya Chutkan.   Smith’s team on Thursday asked to push back the filing deadline and the hearing — originally scheduled for August 16 — because the prosecutors were continuing “to assess the new precedent set forth last month” by the Supreme Court in its immunity ruling.  Trump did not oppose delaying the proceedings. See where all the criminal cases against Trump stand. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is responding to former President Donald Trump’s stated reasoning for not hitting the campaign trail recently. Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday that he hasn’t been campaigning because “I’m leading by a lot and I’m letting their convention go through.” The latest polls show a tight race ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts on August 19. In a statement, Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson James Singer said: “Donald Trump is too lazy to fight for anything but himself or leave his country club – fine by us,” the statement added. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally tonight in Montana to boost GOP Senate candidate Tim Sheehy. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has added three senior hires to its fundraising apparatus as it works to mobilize donors and build on early momentum that resulted in an influx of cash, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Kristin Bertolina Faust will be co-chair of the finance operation, joining Rufus Gifford, who has served as chair of the National Finance Committee since President Joe Biden was the candidate. Stephanie Daily Smith and Jen Liu will join in senior adviser roles.  The addition of the three political consultants comes as the campaign works to bolster its West Coast outreach and capitalize on Harris’ own political network.  Michael Pratt and Colleen Coffey will continue as co-directors of the finance operations. CNN previously reported that the team was looking to expand its fundraising team. Former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump brought out Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock to the Republican National Convention last month, while Megan Thee Stallion, George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston are among the stars who have voiced support for Vice President Kamala Harris in her White House bid. But do election efforts by celebrities move the needle? Or is it all just hype? A new study by Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, shared exclusively with CNN, found that celebrities do play an influential role in promoting civic participation. Harvard’s report does not examine celebrity endorsements to specific candidates or political parities, instead focusing on the role celebrities play in nonpartisan voter participation efforts, like educating, mobilizing and encouraging Americans to register to vote. The researchers noted the power of social media, but also explored celebrity campaigns across mediums, including television, documentaries, merchandising and public service announcements. They looked at data from celebrity initiatives in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 election cycles, including efforts by Kerry Washington, Billie Eilish, Hailey Bieber, Trevor Noah, David Dobrik, Questlove and Taylor Swift. Find out more about the Harvard study here. Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on Friday reiterated he will support the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, in November despite “noise” and “distractions” after the former president recently revived their ongoing feud.  Trump renewed his attacks on Kemp during a rally last weekend in Atlanta, calling the second-term governor “a disloyal guy” and blamed him for his 2020 defeat. During a news conference on Thursday, Trump also said of Kemp: “I’ve never understood it. When you get somebody elected, they’re supposed to like you.” Speaking at radio host Erick Erickson’s “The Gathering” event, Kemp said his position remains unchanged on supporting Trump in November because it is in the “best interest” of the Republican Party. While Kemp plans to vote for Trump in the general election, he previously revealed to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins in June that he didn’t vote for Trump in Georgia’s GOP primary, because “the race was already over when the primary got here.” Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has filed ballot access petitions in Wisconsin and Washington, DC, according to elections offices in those states. The Wisconsin Elections Commission announced on Tuesday that Kennedy had filed for ballot access in the state, without specifying how many signatures Kennedy submitted. Independent candidates are required to submit 2,000 valid signatures to qualify in the state. The Washington, DC, Board of Elections shared on its website that Kennedy’s campaign filed for ballot access on Wednesday. It did not say how many signatures Kennedy’s campaign has submitted. Independent candidates are required to submit 4,573 valid signatures to qualify. In total, Kennedy’s campaign has either gained ballot access, submitted signatures or completed signature collection in 46 states. Kennedy has repeatedly said he plans to be on the ballot in every state and Washington, DC.  Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in 16 states. He’s eligible to receive 212 electoral college votes. Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are hitting the campaign trail today in different parts of the country. Here’s where we expect to see them: Harris and Walz: At 8 p.m. ET, the vice president and Minnesota governor will deliver remarks at a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona. It’s part of their campaign blitz over the next two days with stops in key battleground states to reach “diverse voters who power our victories,” the campaign team said. The duo will also slam former President Trump and “Project 2025’s agenda to drag voters in the past.”  These visits come after Harris locked in key endorsements from leaders across the two states, including from mayors representing Arizona’s border communities and some Arizona Republicans after she announced her presidential bid. This will mark Harris’ fourth visit to Arizona this year. Trump: At 10 p.m. ET, Trump will deliver remarks at a rally in Bozeman, Montana. He is expected to give Republicans a boost in one of the most competitive — and expensive — 2024 Senate races, in which GOP nominee Tim Sheehy, an entrepreneur and former Navy Seal, is looking to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester. Sensing the stakes, both parties have poured money into the contest, spending tens of millions on early advertising and booking airtime in the coming months, making it the second most expensive Senate race of the cycle. The Republican National Committee asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to revive parts of an Arizona law that requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in the state — including provisions that would require those documents to vote in the presidential election and to cast ballots by mail. The request puts the spotlight on an issue that Republicans have wanted front and center in the 2024 campaign, despite the lack of evidence that non-citizen voting is a significant threat to elections. Democrats and voting rights advocates say the requirement not only is unnecessary, but could disenfranchise people who don’t have easy access to documents like birth certificates that would prove their citizenship. Republicans are seeking to renew parts of the law requiring proof of citizenship for Arizonans who register to vote using the state voter registration form. They are also seeking to restore a requirement for proof of citizenship to vote in a presidential election. The complex way that Arizona crafted the proof of citizenship requirement in the 2022 voter law appears in part aimed at getting around a 2013 Supreme Court precedent that put limits on when states could impose such demands — particularly for those registering to vote using the federal registration form, which does not currently require documentary proof of citizenship. The lower court orders blocking the provisions in the Arizona law, Republicans told the Supreme Court on Thursday, were “unprecedented abrogation” of the state lawmakers’ authority “to determine the qualifications of voters and structure participation in its elections.” Keep reading about the details of the Republican request. Former President Donald Trump heads to Montana today to give Republicans a boost in one of the most competitive – and expensive – 2024 Senate races. It’s one of just two Senate races where the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jon Tester, is seeking reelection in a state Trump carried in 2020 (the other, Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio). Here, Republicans quickly coalesced around GOP nominee Tim Sheehy, an entrepreneur and former Navy Seal, avoiding an internecine primary. Sensing the stakes, both parties have poured money into the contest, spending tens of millions on early advertising and booking airtime in the coming fall months, making it the second most expensive Senate race of the cycle. Montana Senate race surges past $216 million in ad spending: According to AdImpact data, the race has drawn a total of more than $216 million in ad spending, including future reservations, trailing only Ohio, where both parties have combined to spend more than $322 million buying ad time. Democrats have outspent Republicans about $117 million to $98 million, counting all the Montana ad buys. Of that total, $95 million has already aired, and Democrats have outspent Republicans by about $56 million to $39 million in the Montana race so far. About $121 million worth of advertising remains to air, and it’s split about evenly between the parties, Democrats with about $61 million in future reservations, and Republicans with about $60 million. Independent presidential candidate Cornel West submitted signatures to qualify for the ballot in Wisconsin, a key battleground state in November’s presidential election.  West’s campaign said in a news release it has “significantly exceeded” the 2,000 signatures needed to qualify for November’s ballot as an independent candidate in Wisconsin. The campaign did not say how many signatures it collected.  The Wisconsin Election Commission said West’s campaign had submitted its signatures prior to Tuesday’s deadline for independent candidates to apply for ballot access.  West’s signature gathering in Wisconsin continues a targeted effort by his campaign to gain ballot access in key battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of November’s election. West has also pursued ballot access in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska and Maine.  West is currently on the ballot in five states: South Carolina, Alaska, Vermont, Oregon and Colorado. Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly named running mate is giving former President Donald Trump even more fodder to attack his Democratic rival as being weak on immigration — an issue that’s a top concern for many Americans in this presidential election. The Trump campaign and Republicans are pointing to several laws that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed last year that open state services and benefits to undocumented immigrants as examples of the Harris-Walz campaign’s “radical left” policies. Early in a news conference on Thursday, Trump slammed Walz on immigration, saying the governor doesn’t want to have borders or any form of safety for the US. His comments followed a video the GOP posted on X showing both Harris and Walz expressing support for sanctuary states and cities, with Walz saying that if the definition of a sanctuary state is that the federal government enforces immigration law and local law enforcement handles local laws, he agrees with it. The Trump campaign will use Walz, who has implemented an array of progressive policies as governor, as a way to draw even starker contrasts between the candidates and to highlight her perceived vulnerability — that she’s a San Francisco liberal, said John Thomas, a Republican strategist. Keep reading here about the GOP strategy on immigration. Earlier this summer, Alejandra Gomez, executive director of Living United for Change (LUCHA) in Arizona, told CNN it would be difficult for her organization’s canvassers to talk to voters about the Biden administration’s immigration policies. But now Gomez and the organizers in the pivotal battleground state are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascension to Democratic nominee for president and her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. She describes her tapping Walz as “a significant political gesture to voters.” In Minnesota, undocumented students who meet certain conditions are eligible for free college tuition at public two- or four-year colleges and other state financial aid awards. And last year, Walz signed a bill into law expanding eligibility for a standard driver’s license by allowing state residents, regardless of immigration status, to obtain a license. The group was also “incredibly encouraged” by Biden’s executive action in June shielding undocumented spouses and children of citizens. The group aims to knock on 1 million doors by November and has already reached 100,000. The political arm of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) is endorsing the Harris-Walz ticket on Friday and leadership from the organization will join Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz during a campaign event in Nevada on Saturday, the PAC announced.  LULAC, a civil rights organization dedicated to advancing opportunities for Hispanic Americans, was established in 1929. The PAC says that this is the first time LULAC has endorsed a presidential candidate in its almost 100-year history. The group describes itself as the nation’s oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization. Harris is expected to hold a campaign stop in Las Vegas on Saturday alongside Walz, her running mate, and LULAC leadership. The electoral landscape: Nevada has backed the Democrat for president in the past four elections, but the Biden-Harris ticket only won in 2020 by two points and its six electoral votes will be important to helping candidates reach 270 electoral votes. A Pew Research survey from earlier this years showed that Latinos make up 22% of the total eligible voter population in Nevada. “The stakes of this election require Latinos to unify and organize together like our lives depend on it. That’s what this endorsement makes clear: the organizing power of LULAC Adelante PAC will help us elect Vice President Harris and Governor Walz to fight to deliver for Latinos and our families,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.  The Trump campaign’s attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military record are channeling the “swift boating” campaign 20 years ago against John Kerry, which accused the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee of lying about his Vietnam service and decorations. LaCivita played a key role in the political advocacy group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which ran the TV ad campaign questioning Kerry’s military service. It’s a playbook that the Trump campaign appears to be re-running after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Walz, a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, as her running mate. Neither Harris nor Donald Trump ever served in the military. But Trump’s running mate – Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who is a Marine veteran – quickly zeroed-in on Walz’s military service, accusing him this week of abandoning his unit before it deployed to Iraq in 2006 and of falsely claiming he served in a war zone. “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,” Vance said at a campaign stop Wednesday. Here are the facts: Walz filed to run for Congress in February 2005 – before his unit was notified it could deploy to Iraq. He deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson, but not to a war zone. The hits on Walz’s military service align with Trump’s penchant for personal attacks against his political opponents, while also harkening back to the effort to sully Kerry’s military record two decades ago. Could this be effective? There are key differences. For one, Walz is the vice-presidential nominee and not at the top of the ticket, meaning the attempts to undermine his service may not go as far with voters as the attacks on Kerry, which leaned on his activities protesting the Vietnam war after he came home. Military service also played a much more central role in the 2004 campaign when President George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq was a key campaign issue. CNN has reached out to LaCivita for comment. President Joe Biden had banked on June’s presidential debate turning around a race that was slipping away from him. Now, Donald Trump may be laying a similar bet after reversing himself by agreeing to debate on ABC next month as his new Democratic opponent enjoys surging momentum. Trump clearly doesn’t believe he’ll suffer the kind of debacle that ended Biden’s campaign, but his decision — and call for another two debates on NBC and Fox, which Vice President Kamala Harris has not agreed to — tells an emerging truth about the election. After a barnstorming week for Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Trump suddenly looks like old news — a crushing new experience for an ex-president who prides himself on driving the narrative. The build-up to the debate on September 10, assuming it goes ahead, will be intense, and the truncated nature of the new campaign means it could create another historic pivot point on the dwindling road to the White House. Read the full analysis. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will continue their campaign blitz over the next two days with stops in key battleground states: Arizona and Nevada. The Harris-Walz campaign said during the two-day swing through the Southwest, they will “continue our work to reach the diverse voters who power our victories in the Southwest, highlighting the stakes of the race for reproductive rights and the Vice President’s leadership to secure the border.” The duo will also slam Donald Trump and “Project 2025’s agenda to drag voters in the past.”  More on Harris’ campaign strategy: As Harris has become the Biden administration’s foremost voice on reproductive rights, both in public events and behind the scenes, the campaign is leaning heavily on the issue of women’s reproductive rights in hopes of mobilizing voters. The campaign touted a robust ground game in the region with more than 25 coordinated campaign offices throughout Arizona and Nevada and more than 220 full-time staff. The campaign believes their infrastructure will allow them to court “two of the most diverse battlegrounds,” including young and Latino voters in those states. These visits come after Harris locked in key endorsements from leaders across these two states, including from mayors representing Arizona’s border communities and some Arizona Republicans after she announced her presidential bid. This will mark Harris’ seventh visit to Nevada and her fourth visit to Arizona this year. Trump, meanwhile, is holding a rally tonight in Montana. President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris will hold a joint event next week in Maryland to discuss lowering costs — marking their first formal appearance together since Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became the Democratic standard bearer. They both attended a welcome ceremony last week for Americans wrongfully detained in Russia held at Joint Base Andrews, and Harris and Biden both attended a Situation Room meeting this week focused on the Middle East. But they have not shared a stage together since Biden dropped his bid for a second term, making next week’s event a significant moment in the handing-of-the-torch. The focus of the event, lowering costs, is one of the four pillars Biden plans to focus on during the remainder of his presidency. Aides say that could take the form of expanding student debt relief and continuing efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs. How much Biden actually hits the campaign trail for Harris remains to be seen. He is most likely to appear in states like Pennsylvania, where he continues to appeal to voters. The president will deliver an address on the first night of this month’s Democratic Convention in Chicago. For the remainder of his term, Biden said he will devote much of his time to fulfilling his official duties, with a focus on foreign affairs. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz rallied union members in a local union hall in Michigan on Thursday, working to drum up support amongst organized labor and draw a sharp contrast between the Democratic ticket and Donald Trump when it came to labor issues.   In remarks focused on unity and community, Harris highlighted the strength and basic “fairness” of collective bargaining as she drew a throughline to how she believes it’s reflected in her campaign. Harris has touted her support of unions in the past including walking the picket line with striking workers in 2019. She praised unions for their contributions.  Walz, who was a union member as a teacher, thanked the auto workers for the “privilege” of joining their picket line last year, and sharply criticized the former president on labor issues.   “We know that unions built the middle class,” he said, adding, “you know who doesn’t believe that? Donald Trump.”  United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain offered a warm welcome to the Democratic ticket, telling members that Harris and Walz are both “one of us.” While Harris and Walz joined autoworkers on picket lines during their major strike last year, Fain noted Trump was “nowhere to be found,” and instead visited Detroit to go to a non-union business  Remember: Last September, instead of participating in the second Republican presidential primary debate, Trump visited Drake Enterprises, a non-union auto parts supplier in Clint Township, to appeal to a group of current and former union workers. US security officials are on alert for possible retaliatory attacks against Democrats following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, according to a new intelligence report obtained by CNN. The threat assessment — prepared jointly by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies, including local police in Illinois — outlines various potential security concerns surrounding the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Despite several conspiracy theories that appeared online after the attack blaming Democrats, there is no evidence the shooter was motivated by politics. A review of public records suggests he may have had divergent political leanings, and registered to vote as a Republican while also making a small donation to a Democratic-leaning group. While the motive of the gunman who fired on Trump remains a mystery to investigators, the bulletin says “politically and socially divisive topics have prompted violence in the past,” and adds that some extremists “will view political and social tensions as an opportunity to use or promote violence to further their ideological goals.” Read more about the DNC threat assessment. The Trump campaign is downplaying the significance of the Democratic Party reshuffling its ticket to elevate Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden, arguing that despite the change in the dynamics of the race, the “fundamentals” of the campaign have remained the same.  Trump campaign officials told reporters on Thursday they believe Harris’ improvement over Biden in public polls can be attributed to “irrational exuberance,” arguing that Harris is making up ground with voters who supported Biden in 2020 but had moved away from Democrats before Harris moved to the top of the ticket.  The official pushed back on Harris’ attacks on Trump’s presidential record, crystallized in the campaign’s new slogan, “We are not going back,” which Harris and her supporters have latched on to at recent campaign events.  “When you ask voters whether they’d rather return to the Trump economy, or stay with the Biden economy, we win that two to one,” the official said.   The official said the campaign’s internal data showed Harris has increased enthusiasm among Democratic voters and does better with undecided voters than Biden, but contended she still trails Trump in both voter motivation and popularity with undecided voters. Officials also said Harris was doing better among Black voters then President Joe Biden was, a demographic that Trump’s team has been heavily targeted this cycle. "
Kamala Harris’ VP pick has a long history with China. But Beijing may not be happy about it | CNN,"Updated 10:10 PM EDT, Fri August 9, 2024",2024-08-10T01:17:12.371Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/china/tim-walz-china-ties-intl-hnk/index.html,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate has a decades-long connection with China. But in the eyes of Beijing, that may not necessarily be good news. Tim Walz moved to China fresh out of college in 1989 to teach high school for a year, and then frequently returned to the country during a decade of taking American students on summer cultural exchanges. The 60-year-old Minnesota governor has spoken fondly of his time in China and the people he met there, and his familiarity with the country and empathy for its people bring a personal, nuanced perspective on the United States’ biggest strategic rival that is rare among his political peers. Some Republican opponents have seized on that experience to accuse Walz of being “pro-China,” but the Democratic vice-presidential nominee has a long history of criticizing authoritarian Chinese leadership. Walz moved to China at a tumultuous and politically charged time, shortly after the Tiananmen Square massacre, when the ruling Communist Party sent tanks in to violently quell peaceful student-led democracy protests in Beijing. Upon returning home to Nebraska in 1990, he told a local newspaper he felt the Chinese people had been mistreated by their government for years. “If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they could accomplish. They are such kind, generous, capable people,” he told the Star-Herald at the time. During his time in Congress from 2007 to 2019, Walz rallied support for imprisoned Chinese activists. He met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader loathed by Beijing, and Joshua Wong, the young Hong Kong democracy activist now jailed for his activism against Beijing’s tightening grip. “The more he understands China, the more he feels pity for the Chinese people, and the more critical he becomes of the rulers who govern them,” said Shen Dingli, a foreign policy analyst in Shanghai. “He has some understanding of Chinese culture and respects it in his heart, but he definitely does not accept China’s political (system),” Shen added. “Beijing is probably more fearful and uncomfortable with such a foreigner who understands China.” Walz was among the first groups of young Americans to teach in high schools in China under a Harvard University volunteer program, just a decade after the two countries established diplomatic relations. As a fresh graduate, he spent a year teaching English and American history at the Foshan No. 1 High School, in the southern province of Guangdong. There, he was met with industrious and welcoming students who applauded him each time he used a Chinese word correctly, and friendly strangers who offered to help whenever he stopped in the streets looking bewildered, he told the Star-Herald in 1990. “I was treated exceptionally well,” he told the newspaper. “There was no anti-American feeling whatsoever. American is ‘It’ in the eyes of the Chinese. Many of the students want to come to America to study.” That was a different era in China. The impoverished country was curious about the world after emerging from decades of self-imposed isolation and tumultuous rule under Mao Zedong. Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping unleashed market reforms and, along with an economic opening, calls for political liberalization gathered pace in the 1980s. Such calls coalesced into a student-led movement in the spring of 1989, which was brutally put down by the Chinese military weeks before Walz’s trip. “I remember waking up and seeing the news on June 4 that the unthinkable had happened,” Walz told Voice of America in an interview in 2014. “Many of my colleagues decided to go home and not to go on [to China]. I thought it was more important than ever to go, to make sure the story was told and to let the Chinese people know we were standing there, we were with them.” From Guangdong, Walz took a 40-hour cross-country train ride to the Chinese capital to see Tiananmen Square, the site of the democracy protests. He made sure he would always commemorate the crackdown in a personal way – by getting married on June 4, 1994, the fifth anniversary of the massacre. “He wanted to have a date he’ll always remember,” his wife and fellow high-school teacher, Gwen, told a local newspaper in Minnesota before their wedding. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon taking students on two-week tours in China for sightseeing and classes on culture, education and history. These trips became a summer tradition for the couple through 2003. “I would go back in a heartbeat,” said Cara Roemhildt, who went on such a trip in 1998. “It was an educational trip with one of our favorite teachers. It was more about the people. It wasn’t about the politics.” Roemhildt said she and her classmates still talk about the trip decades later. “It felt very, very comfortable. And we went all over…Train rides (to) a whole bunch of different places,” she told CNN. “Just seeing a different culture and having respect for it while seeing it. Knowing that it’s different, but knowing that it’s okay, too.” After entering politics in 2006, Walz continued to devote time and attention to China in Congress. He served more than a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which monitors human rights and the rule of law in the country – a role Beijing would not be happy about. “The Chinese government has always viewed that commission as ‘anti-China,’” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at the City University of Hong Kong. In Congress, Walz co-sponsored a series of resolutions calling on China to release its jailed rights activists, including Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, who eventually died in custody of liver cancer. In 2015, Walz joined a congressional delegation on a trip to China, which included a rare stop in Tibet, which he had also visited decades earlier during his time teaching at the Chinese high school. The following year, Walz met the Dalai Lama in Washington for what he called a “life-changing lunch.” He also welcomed Lobsang Sangay, then leader of Tibet’s government in exile, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-school students. At a congressional meeting that year, he called on Beijing to “ensure the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture” and “provide less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans.” Walz has also been a vocal supporter of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. In 2017, when Wong, the student protest leader, was jailed for his political activism, Walz posted a photo of himself and the young activist standing side by side to show solidarity with “all advocating for democracy in Hong Kong.” Walz also threw his support behind the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which sanctions officials responsible for human rights violations in the city, when the legislation appeared to be languishing in Congress. “We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum. Only Walz answered his,” Jeffrey Ngo, a Hong Kong democracy activist now based in Washington, said on X. “Walz is perhaps the most solid candidate when it comes to human rights and China on a major-party ticket in recent memory,” Ngo said. On the diplomatic front, Walz has criticized China’s unfair trade practices and its growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. In Chinese nationalist circles, which have an outsized voice on policy debates in China, there are no rosy illusions about Walz. “On human rights and ideological issues, he has basically crossed all the possible red lines out there,” Shen Yi, an international relations scholar known for his fiercely nationalistic views, wrote on social media. But unlike more hawkish politicians, Walz does not believe in decoupling, and instead holds a more nuanced view on the geostrategic rivalry between the US and China. “I don’t fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship. I totally disagree,” he said in an interview in 2016. “We’re on the same sheet of music, two of the world’s great superpowers, there’s many collaborative things we can do together.” Stephen Roach, former chief of Morgan Stanley Asia, said the Harris-Walz ticket may provide “an important counterweight to the current venom of American Sinophobia.” Walz’s empathy for the Chinese people and appreciation of China’s non-political aspects make him a harder case for Beijing to “villainize as an ‘anti-China’ foil” than politicians that are hawkish on all dimensions, Eric Fish, a former Beijing-based journalist and author of “China’s Millennials: The Want Generation,” said on X. Walz’s extensive experience with China makes him a rare figure in the race for the White House – at least since George H. W. Bush, who served as America’s unofficial ambassador to Beijing in the mid-1970s before running for vice president and later president. Bush’s stint in Beijing would go on to influence his foreign policy – and help steer US-China relations through the tumultuous fallout of the Tiananmen crackdown. But US-China relations are at a very different place now from the honeymoon period of engagement. Being tough on China has become a rare point of bipartisan consensus in the US, and Beijing is unlikely to be counting on Walz to improve bilateral ties. “The direction of US policy towards China is very clear. As an individual, regardless of your attitude towards China, there’s not much room for maneuver,” said Liu, the expert at the City University of Hong Kong. “And vice presidents can have a varied level of say in foreign policy, depending on the president they serve,” he added. Walz’s experience living and teaching in China could serve as a useful diplomatic ice breaker to warm up the room if that’s what the two sides wish to do, Liu said. But even then, he added, the Chinese would need to dance around the awkwardness in the timing and avoid all mention of the Tiananmen crackdown – which remains a political taboo in China. On China’s tightly controlled social media, Walz’s early ties to the country have raised eyebrows and generated considerable interest. The hashtag “Harris’ VP pick once taught in China” racked up 15 million views on microblogging site Weibo. The year of Walz’s arrival in China – 1989 – was not lost among those who understand the sensitivity of the date, despite decades of effort by the Chinese government to erase the brutal crackdown from public memory. But, perhaps reflective of the different era China now finds itself in under leader Xi Jinping, who has fanned nationalist sentiment and suspicion against foreigners over national security, many questioned the “real motive” of Walz’s first trip to China. “Heh, 1989-1990, Americans teaching in China during this period – it’s something worth pondering carefully,” said a top comment on Weibo. “Must be a spy,” said another. Liu said that, given how drastically China has changed over the past decades, Walz’s understanding of the country from his younger days may offer limited help on American policy toward China today. Walz himself has conceded that he’s by no means a China expert. “I lived in China, and as I said I’ve been there about 30 times,” he said in the 2016 interview. “But if someone tells you they’re an expert on China, they’re probably not telling you the truth because it’s a complex country.”"
"Trump rails against vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, Harris and Walz in Montana | CNN Politics","Updated 3:04 AM EDT, Sat August 10, 2024",2024-08-09T17:21:14.199Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/donald-trump-montana-rally-senate/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Friday in Montana, where he railed against vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, briefly talked up the Democrat’s GOP challenger and then unleashed another dizzying series of attacks on the Democratic presidential ticket. The rally in Bozeman was Trump’s first since Vice President Kamala Harris officially secured the Democratic nomination and selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate, two moves that have energized Democrats and, if only for a few days, knocked the former president out of the headlines. Big Sky Country is expected to break overwhelmingly for Trump in November, but the Senate race is on track to be much closer – and could swing the balance of power in the chamber. “We need the Senate,” Trump told the crowd Friday, stressing the critical nature of the contest here. “We need the Senate.” As president in 2018, Trump stumped hard for then-state Auditor Matt Rosendale, visiting the state four times during that midterm cycle. Rosendale, now a congressman, lost to Tester by about 3 points. Tester’s opponent this year – Republican Tim Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL and aerospace CEO – appeared alongside Trump at the event but was hardly the honored guest. Trump has for years been at odds with Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, over the senator’s role in sinking the nomination of former White House doctor Ronny Jackson to run the Veterans Affairs Department. Jackson, now a congressman from Texas, traveled to Bozeman to deliver his own indictment of Tester, who, in 2018, helped compile a report detailing a slew of allegations – including abusive behavior, loosely handling prescription drugs and being intoxicated on the job – that eventually caused Jackson to withdraw from consideration. “He decided that it was in his political best interest and would help his (reelection campaign) if he could come out and be the guy who tore down one of Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees,” an agitated Jackson told the crowd. “He tried to destroy me.” Trump’s visit to Montana came on the heels of a busy week for Harris, who officially selected Walz as her vice presidential pick on Tuesday before the two struck out on a campaign tour of battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona. In addition to his typical attack lines, Trump also brought audio-visual aids on this occasion, twice stopping his speech to play video mash-ups of Harris either misspeaking or embracing a liberal cause. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has closely mirrored the Harris-Walz campaign’s schedule over the past few days, visiting many of the same states in what he said was an effort to heighten the contrast between the dueling tickets. Trump on Friday acknowledged Vance’s difficulties during his first few weeks as the Republican vice presidential nominee. Calling his new running mate “really special,” Trump recalled telling Vance, “You got your sea legs” after taking some early shots. The former president was less complimentary of Walz, calling him “very freakish” while previewing further lines of attack. If Harris and Walz win the election, Trump said, “the people cheering will be the pink-haired Marxists, the looters, the perverts, the flag burners, Hamas supporters, drug dealers, gun-grabbers and human traffickers.” That riff, and others like it, were part of a broad, though scattered, attempt to paint the Democratic ticket as too liberal. “But I’m not talking about him, I’m talking about her,” Trump added, referring to Harris. “This is her ideology. That’s why she picked him.” Trump made only passing reference to his campaign’s recent attacks about Walz’s military service, which have mostly been deployed by Vance, who served in the Marine Corps. “His really is valor,” Trump said of Sheehy, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other deployments. “It’s valor for heroism award, you know. The other one talks about valor. He has a different kind of a valor. It’s the opposite.” Vance has accused Walz of “stolen valor” for language he used in a 2018 speech advocating an assault weapons ban, which the Harris campaign has included in a video on social media. Walz at the time said he wanted to “make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” Walz never deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service. The Bozeman rally also marked Trump’s first foray outside Florida this week. On Thursday, he held a roughly hourlong news conference with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida during which he attempted to recapture the spotlight from his Democratic rival. Trump used the attention to toss a familiar laundry list of attacks against Harris, Walz and Democrats more broadly. The former president repeatedly insulted Harris’ intelligence and needled her for not yet holding a news conference of her own, described Walz as a left-wing radical in disguise and, once more, insisted that Jewish voters who support Democrats “should have their heads examined.” On Friday, Trump again attacked the vice president’s intelligence and mocked her for not doing an interview or holding a news conference since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. He falsely claimed that Harris is “refusing to debate” him. Harris and Trump have both agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, and Harris told reporters she would be “happy” to discuss another debate. Trump also said Friday that he didn’t care if he mispronounced Harris’ name and claimed without elaborating that “nobody really knows her last name.” “Kamala, sometimes referred to as Kamala, you know, she’s got about nine different ways of pronouncing the name,” Trump said. “And because the press is so dishonest, no matter how you say it, they’ll say you were wrong. You were wrong. I don’t care if I get it right. Actually, I couldn’t care less.” The past week has thrust the 2024 campaign into a new phase, with the major-party tickets now, finally, firmly in place ahead of the election and the candidates ratcheting up their rhetoric. Harris and Walz have used their battleground state swing this week to paint the election as a choice between a prosecutor and a convicted felon, as well as a “normal” ticket, theirs, and the “weird” pairing of Trump and Vance. Trump’s running mate, meanwhile, used his travels to attack Harris’ record on crime, inflation and the border, while also doubling down on the former president’s false claims about her heritage, labeling her “a chameleon” who “pretends to be something different depending on which audience she’s speaking to.” Vance also escalated his attacks on Walz, accusing the Minnesota governor of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress. Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. Those clashes mostly took a backseat on Friday night to what’s expected to be an ultra-competitive Senate race. Tester, who was first elected in 2006, is the last-remaining Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office in Montana. Sheehy, meanwhile, has won the support of both Trump and his allies and the GOP establishment, which views the seat as key to winning a Senate majority going into 2025. Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the first member of his party’s leadership to back Trump’s 2024 bid, was an early Sheehy supporter and helped convince the former president to get behind him. Speaking to reporters before the rally, Daines said that he personally encouraged Trump to visit his home state, despite it not being a presidential battleground, because he believes Montana will be the state that delivers Republicans the Senate majority come November. “You can imagine if President Trump had to call Chuck Schumer and try to figure out how to get his nominees through,” Daines said. “So that’s why Montana becomes very important, because this becomes the 51st seat.” The Montana contest is one of just two Senate campaigns in which a Democratic incumbent is seeking reelection in a state Trump twice carried. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s campaign in Ohio is the other. But unlike in Ohio, Montana Republicans quickly coalesced around Sheehy, avoiding a tempestuous primary. Sensing the stakes, both parties have poured money into the contest, spending tens of millions on early advertising and booking airtime in the coming fall months, making it the second-most expensive Senate race of the cycle so far.

GOP launches new immigration attacks on Harris highlighting Walz’s policies | CNN Politics,"Published 9:03 AM EDT, Fri August 9, 2024",2024-08-09T13:03:47.136Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/immigration-trump-harris-walz-policies/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly named running mate is giving former President Donald Trump even more fodder to attack his Democratic rival as being weak on immigration — an issue that’s a top concern for many Americans in this presidential election. The Trump campaign and Republicans are pointing to several laws that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed last year that open state services and benefits to undocumented immigrants as examples of the Harris-Walz campaign’s “radical left” policies. “This is a guy who wants to give driver’s licenses to illegal aliens,” JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential hopeful, said of Walz at a campaign stop in Michigan on Wednesday, while stressing that Trump will stop the influx of migrants into the US. “This is a radical human being who comes from the far-left wing of the Democratic Party.” Early in a news conference on Thursday, Trump slammed Walz on immigration, saying the governor doesn’t want to have borders or any form of safety for the US. His comments followed a video the GOP posted on X showing both Harris and Walz expressing support for sanctuary states and cities, with Walz saying that if the definition of a sanctuary state is that the federal government enforces immigration law and local law enforcement handles local laws, he agrees with it. The Trump campaign will use Walz, who has implemented an array of progressive policies as governor, as a way to draw even starker contrasts between the candidates and to highlight her perceived vulnerability — that she’s a San Francisco liberal, said John Thomas, a Republican strategist. “By selecting Walz, it was a tacit endorsement of Walz’s track record and his policy agenda,” Thomas said. “Trump will seek to brand her with Gov. Walz’s liberal track record, particularly on the issue of immigration.” Asked for comment, a Harris campaign official said that the governor and vice president support the bipartisan border deal — which Republicans blocked in the Senate earlier this year after Trump voiced opposition to the bill — and President Joe Biden’s executive orders, which reduced border crossings. Aided by a Democratic sweep of the state legislature last year, Walz signed several bills into law that make Minnesota more welcoming to undocumented immigrants. The Trump campaign has focused on legislation Walz signed last year that allows people in Minnesota to obtain driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status, joining other states with similar laws. According to a March 2023 press release from the governor’s office, which noted that there are an estimated 81,000 undocumented immigrants in the state, the measure will increase safety by ensuring that all drivers are licensed and insured. The legislation moves “us toward our goal of making Minnesota the best state to raise a family for everyone,” Walz said in the release, emphasizing “everyone.” Undocumented immigrants will also be eligible for MinnesotaCare, which provides health insurance for lower-income residents who don’t qualify for Medicaid, starting in 2025. The measure, which is expected to extend coverage to 40,000 people and cost $109 million through fiscal 2027, was part of the One Minnesota Budget that Walz signed in the spring of 2023. Plus, undocumented Minnesota residents whose families earn less than $80,000 are eligible for the North Star Promise Scholarship, which covers tuition and fees at two- and four-year public colleges in the state, under a bill Walz signed last year. Positions like these become vehicles for Trump and the Republican National Committee to go after Harris’ existing record on immigration, said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has bused migrants to northern cities, quickly made the connection, posting on X: “Harris/Walz–the most dangerous P/VP ticket ever.” “She supports free health care to illegal immigrants. He signed laws giving state services to them,” Abbott posted on Tuesday, the day Harris named Walz her running mate. “Both provide magnets for more illegal immigration.”"
"Wide swath of America remains opposed to Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, poll finds | CNN Politics","Published 1:00 AM EDT, Fri August 9, 2024",2024-08-09T05:00:02.640Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/poll-roe-wade-abortion-harris-trump/index.html,"The Supreme Court’s two-year-old decision to overturn Roe v. Wade remains unpopular with a wide majority of Americans, according to a poll Friday that landed as Vice President Kamala Harris hammers on reproductive rights as a centerpiece of her campaign for the White House. Two-thirds of Americans oppose the high court’s abortion decision, according to the new Marquette Law School poll – a more lopsided disapproval than the court’s other major recent decisions to expand access to guns, for instance, or grant former President Donald Trump sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution. Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the discontent. Harris, who has called for restoring Roe, has stressed reproductive rights as a key issue. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is telling crowds about his daughter’s birth through in vitro fertilization treatments. “Donald Trump said he wants to punish women,” Harris said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania this week. “And as a result of his actions, today in America one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban.” In the Supreme Court’s bombshell decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, five conservative justices voted to overturn Roe, the 1973 precedent that established a constitutional right to abortion. The 2022 ruling returned the question of abortion to states, about half of which have banned or severely restricted access. Trump, who as president nominated three justices to the court who voted to overturn Roe, has campaigned on keeping abortion as a state issue. He told reporters in Florida on Thursday that he doesn’t believe the issue will drive voters like it did during the 2022 midterm elections. “I think that abortion has become much less of an issue,” Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club. Still, the fallout from the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs has kept abortion as a live issue in the nation’s culture wars and on its court dockets. The justices grappled with two major abortion controversies this year. The court barred enforcement of an Idaho law prohibiting emergency room abortions, and it unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone. Sixty-seven percent of respondents in the Marquette poll supported the court’s decision in the abortion pill case. Opposition to the outcome in Dobbs has remained consistent in polling since it was decided, with 66% of respondents against it when Marquette asked in 2022. Also consistent over the past couple of years has been overall near-record dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court. The latest Marquette poll found 57% of Americans disapprove of the court, compared with 61% who felt that way two years ago. Nearly 6 in 10 respondents in the latest poll said the justices’ decisions are motivated mainly by politics, compared with 43% who believe their decisions are based mainly on the law. The Marquette poll was conducted from July 24 to August 1 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. A Pew Research Center poll Thursday reached a similar conclusion, with 51% of respondents holding an unfavorable view of the court. The survey found that views on the Supreme Court depended heavily on partisan affiliation, with just 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents viewing the court favorably compared with 73% of Republicans."
Analysis: The Harris v. Trump debate is already looming as another historic pivot point in an extraordinary campaign | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:47 AM EDT, Fri August 9, 2024",2024-08-09T04:00:02.334Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/trump-harris-debate-analysis/index.html,"President Joe Biden had banked on June’s presidential debate turning around a race that was slipping away from him. Now, Donald Trump may be laying a similar bet after reversing himself by agreeing to debate on ABC next month as his new Democratic opponent enjoys surging momentum. Trump clearly doesn’t believe he’ll suffer the kind of debacle that ended Biden’s campaign, but his decision — and call for another two debates on NBC and Fox, which Vice President Kamala Harris has not agreed to — tells an emerging truth about the election. After a barnstorming week for Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Trump suddenly looks like old news — a crushing new experience for an ex-president who prides himself on driving the narrative. The build-up to the debate on September 10, assuming it goes ahead, will be intense, and the truncated nature of the new campaign means it could create another historic pivot point on the dwindling road to the White House. Already, Trump is playing his idiosyncratic expectations game of denigrating the skills of his opponent, who could be the first Black woman and South Asian president. At a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort Thursday, he compared Harris unfavorably with Biden, who he’d long argued lacked the mental acuity to serve. “She’s actually not as smart as he is. I don’t think he’s very smart either, by the way. I’m not a big fan of his brain,” Trump said. The clash also looms as an extreme test for Harris. The vice president has a mixed record in debates — she performed strongly in such events early in her failed 2020 presidential campaign. But at others, she struggled. And her most unflattering moments in office have come when she’s been asked to explain her positions or answer tough questions in major interviews. But as she grows in confidence as the Democratic nominee, Harris is a more accomplished politician than she was four years ago — and supporters are keen to see her leverage her skills as a former prosecutor to skewer the four-times indicted former president. Harris jabbed Trump over his change of heart over the ABC debate and said she was happy to have a conversation about a second, later encounter. “I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a debate on September 10. I’m looking forward to it, and I hope he shows up,” she told reporters before boarding Air Force Two in Detroit. After Harris turned the campaign upside down in less than three weeks, Trump showed in his news conference that he’s still grappling for an effective response. The ex-president appears to be grieving the contest against 81-year-old Biden and in denial about the early success of the energetic new Democratic ticket. Asked why he wasn’t doing more to campaign and to counter the rollicking rollout of the Harris campaign, Trump argued, “I’m leading by a lot and I’m letting their convention go through.” He insisted he hadn’t “recalibrated strategy at all” as he made the same arguments that the US is swamped by open borders and immigrant crime. But there’s a growing feeling his campaign needs such a reboot. Harris has erased the ex-president’s previous advantage over Biden with the race now neck-and-neck in the latest CNN Poll of Polls. A new Marquette Law School poll released Thursday morning found Harris leading 52% to Trump’s 48% among registered voters nationally. Trump’s problem is not that there are not solid arguments against Harris and her new running mate: Millions of Americans are hurting over high prices and are stalked by economic insecurity. The world is an increasingly dangerous place as American enemies team up to challenge Washington’s power. And Harris is intimately linked to everything the unpopular Biden administration did in these areas. The new Democratic team hasn’t offered concrete policies to tackle such issues, and the vice president is yet to submit to detailed questions from reporters or do a major television interview. And many Republicans and right-leaning independents are receptive to Trump’s arguments over the southern border crisis even if arrivals of undocumented migrants have eased since Biden tightened enforcement earlier this year. But Trump isn’t making many of these points effectively as he stews over his personal grievances. His characteristically off-the-rails news conference at one point digressed into him comparing his and Martin Luther King Jr.’s crowd sizes. And the former president also seems to be laying a predicate to challenge another election if he loses — untruthfully insisting on Thursday that the Democratic Party’s switch of nominees was unconstitutional. “We have a constitution. It’s a very important document, and we live by it,” Trump said, apparently oblivious to the irony of such comments coming from a former president who tried to steal the 2020 election and has threatened the fabric of US democracy. In a statement, the Harris campaign tried to spin Trump’s ramblings as proof that he’s losing at a time when it is seeking to brand Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, as “weird.” “Donald Trump took a break from taking a break to put on some pants and host a press conference public meltdown,” the campaign said in a statement that included the strike-thru. “He hasn’t campaigned all week. He isn’t going to a single swing state this week. But he sure is mad Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are getting big crowds across the battlegrounds.” Trump’s strategy on Thursday was familiar. He reinserted himself into a news cycle he was losing with a dark, dystopian message. This is “the most dangerous period of time I’ve ever seen for our country,” he said, and he predicted a Great Depression and World War III if he’s not elected. His return to the politics of fear and his dark, American carnage narratives presented a contrast with the lightness and joy that has erupted in huge Democratic rallies this week after Harris named her running mate and they set off on a joint journey through the swing states that will decide November’s election. Despite renewed recession fears, unemployment is currently at 4.3% and economic growth is solid. No credible economist is predicting a return to the 25% unemployment of the 1930s. And while American power is being challenged by dictatorial leaders in Russia, China and North Korea, and wars are raging in the Middle East and Ukraine, there’s no sign that a third global conflagration is imminent. The atmospherics of the 2024 campaign have shifted at remarkable speed. Three weeks ago on Thursday, Republican delegates left their convention in Milwaukee buoyant over Trump’s chances, with many predicting a landslide election win after his defiant response to an assassination attempt supercharged his campaign. Now, Trump seems stuck in a moment of political paralysis. But he’s unlikely to remain that way. His entire political career, and his 2024 campaign especially, has been a case study in seizing upon almost existential threats and using them to political advantage. This is a former president, after all, who leveraged a mugshot taken in a Georgia jail to build a primary campaign that crushed his rivals on the premise that he was being victimized for political gain. Harris’ achievement so far has been to restore the election to a tight race in a polarized nation. But despite her adoring crowds this week, the vice president remains untested in the fierce heat of a national presidential election. And the route for Democrats to 270 electoral votes still looks challenging even if there are signs that the vice president may be putting some battlegrounds back in play. Trump’s aides insisted on Thursday that Harris’ early bounce was expected. “They’re celebrating getting back voters they should have had to begin with,” one official told reporters. “They know, as we do, that the fundamentals of the race have not changed.” The official added: “When you ask voters whether they’d rather return to the Trump economy, or stay with the Biden economy, we win that two to one.” This is why many Republicans believe their version of reality will soon reassert itself. “The honeymoon period’s going to end,” Trump insisted on Thursday. But the former president is showing few signs he knows how to make that happen."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday repeatedly demeaned Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “barely competent,” and made a string of false and often confusing claims about her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The former president took a variety of questions for about an hour at Mar-a-Lago. Meantime, Harris and Walz continued their blitz of battleground states with an event in Detroit this afternoon before heading to Arizona. Here are the top headlines:  Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are rallying voters across the Midwest this week, looking to build on support from key union leaders as they promote a message of pro-labor policies that they say benefit the middle class. At the leadership level, the Democratic ticket’s been deemed a clear choice. Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers who endorsed Harris last week and appeared alongside the pair Tuesday, called them a “Democratic Dynamic Duo.” The public show of support follows weeks of behind-the-scenes maneuvering to renew support from the unions that had backed President Joe Biden, who called himself the most pro-union president in history, until he made a surprise exit from the race last month. Since then, Harris has set out to prove that she won’t veer from Biden’s agenda — working the phones with union leaders, holding early campaign events alongside the American Federation of Teachers and the UAW, and notching the endorsement from a major hospitality union, despite a proposal by former President Donald Trump to increase service workers’ take-home pay. And the selection of Walz as the ticket’s No. 2 is seen as bolstering those labor bona fides: Walz and his wife were both union members, and his tenure as governor includes infrastructure, climate and paid leave legislation. Fain projected confidence later Thursday during an interview with CNN’s Erica Hill, insisting that an “overwhelming majority” of union members will vote for Harris and Walz in November. Keep reading about the role unions are playing in this election. President Joe Biden offered praise tonight for Kamala Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, according to a source in the room where he spoke to his former Wilmington-based campaign staff. “When you get to know him, he’s the real deal,” he added. First lady Jill Biden also spoke. She echoed her handwritten note, thanking them for “(believing) in Joe” and expressing her appreciation, per another source in the room.  President Joe Biden spoke to several hundred members of his former Wilmington-based campaign staff at The Queen Theatre Thursday night, thanking them for their support of his presidential bid, a campaign official told pool reporters traveling with the president.  There were a few tears from some staff members, the official told the pool. Biden took photos with every person who wanted one. Donald Trump spent the first half of 2024 juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defended himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House. After a seven-week trial this spring in Trump’s New York hush money trial, a jury found the former president guilty on all 34 felony counts. The charges stem from his alleged falsification of business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. Judge Juan Merchan had set a sentencing hearing for July 11, a week before the Republican National Convention. But after the US Supreme Court issued its ruling in Trump’s immunity case, Merchan pushed the sentencing hearing to September 18 “if such is still necessary.” Also in September, Trump is set to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, newly selected Democratic vice presidential candidate, is facing scrutiny over his military service record, with critics, including his Republican rival Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of falsely suggesting he saw combat during his time as an Army reservist. It’s not the first time Walz has encountered such criticism. A CNN KFile review reveals that similar accusations were made in 2006, during Walz’s first run for Congress. That year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. Walz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both. At issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz’s website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan. Walz was more specific in other statements and interviews with the media from 2006, in which he did say that, “by luck of the draw,” he was posted to Italy, and not Afghanistan. Read more about this here and what more about this reporting below: Donald Trump continues to juggle multiple legal issues while preparing to face Kamala Harris in the November election.  The special counsel’s office wants more time before having to detail what the Justice Department’s next steps could be in the 2020 election case against Trump, which would push any activity in the case into September at the earliest, just months before the presidential election. Prosecutors with special counsel Jack Smith’s office said in a filing Thursday that they are still working through what the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer – which granted Trump sweeping immunity for official acts as president – means for the case and how it proceeds. The request marks a notable change in federal prosecutors’ approach in this criminal case putting the option of a delay on the table after the special counsel spent a year urging the case forward to trial so voters could quickly have answers. The move by Smith also contrasts sharply with Chutkan’s, who, ready to move forward in the days after she was given the case back last week, issued two rulings and set a quick schedule. Chutkan had scheduled an August 16 hearing to go over the case’s schedule moving forward but prosecutors are asking the judge to push that date back into September. Prosecutors and defense attorneys had a call earlier Thursday and the “defense was happy to provide this extra time,” according to a source familiar with their thinking. The two sides also spoke on a call earlier this week. Click here to see where all the criminal cases against Trump stand. Kamala Harris’ campaign is blasting Donald Trump over suggesting during his news conference earlier today that he is open to revoking access to the abortion pill, mifepristone. Trump was asked by a reporter: “There are other things the federal government could do, not just an [abortion] ban. Would you direct your FDA, for example, to revoke access to mifepristone? That’s one of the things.” Trump answered, “So, you could do things that will be, would supplement. Absolutely. And those things are pretty open and humane, but you have to be able to have a vote. And all I want to do is give everybody a vote, and the votes are taking place right now as we speak.” Pushed by the reporter: “And that’s something you would consider?” Trump said, “There are many things you can do on a humane basis that you can do outside of that, but you also have to give a vote.” During CNN’s presidential debate in June, Trump said he would not try to block access to the abortion pill mifepristone if reelected and said he agreed with the US Supreme Court’s decision to reject a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating the abortion pill. “The Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill, and I agree with their decision to have done that and I will not block it,’ Trump said. ABC News will allow other networks to broadcast its September 10 presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, an ABC spokesperson told CNN on Thursday.  Details about the debate’s format and rules have yet to be confirmed publicly, but the 90-minute face-off will likely take place in Philadelphia, a source familiar with the matter said. ABC News anchors David Muir and Lynsey Davis will moderate the debate, the network previously said. During the first presidential debate of the 2024 season between President Joe Biden and former President Trump, CNN allowed other networks to air the debate but with strict requirements around its promotion and broadcast. More than 51 million people watched the debate in June across 22 networks. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for the ballot in Texas, the Texas Secretary of State’s office announced on Thursday. In May, the Kennedy campaign submitted over 245,000 signatures to the Texas Secretary of State. Kennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan appeared in person to help carry boxes of signatures into the state’s elections office in Austin, part of the campaign’s effort to highlight the strength of its signature-gathering operation by petitioning in the state with one of the largest signature thresholds in the country for independent candidates. On Thursday, Texas Director of Elections Christina Adkins informed the Kennedy campaign in a letter that Kennedy will appear on November’s ballot, after his petition was found to contain 122,513 valid signatures, more than the 113,151 signatures needed to qualify. In July, Texas Democrats sent a letter asking the Secretary of State’s office to reject Kennedy’s petition, arguing Kennedy’s signatures violated several state laws on the proper formatting guidelines for petition signatures. The letter to the Kennedy campaign did not acknowledge the Texas Democrats request. Including Texas, Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in 16 states. He’s also gained ballot access in New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, New Mexico, Tennessee, Minnesota, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Nebraska, Hawaii and Utah. Kennedy is now eligible for 212 electoral college votes. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday defended her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military service in the face of criticism by Republicans, including GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, who have accused Walz of embellishing his record. “Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country, and I think that we all should,” Harris told reporters as she prepared to depart Detroit with Walz. On Wednesday in Michigan, Vance, also a veteran, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005 and falsely claiming he had served in a combat zone. Some context: Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006. He retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service. In a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed two state proclamations this week that highlight aspects of his record and background playing a prominent role in his first days as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. On Wednesday, Walz signed a proclamation naming August 7, 2024, as “Combat Wounded Veterans Purple Heart Day” in Minnesota. On Thursday, Walz signed another proclamation labeling today as “Farm Family Recognition Day” in the state. The two proclamations are Walz’s first official actions as governor since being tapped as Harris’ running mate on Monday. The honorary proclamation recognizing wounded veterans comes amid renewed scrutiny of his record of military service. Republicans, including GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, have accused Walz of inflating his service record and skirting a deployment to Iraq while enlisted in the Army National Guard. Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. He has previously referred to guns as weapons “I carried in war,” despite not being deployed to a combat zone during his 24 years of service. In the proclamation, Walz recognized the sacrifice paid by wounded veterans. Walz’s recognition of family farm workers aligns with the Harris campaign’s attempt to highlight Walz’s Midwestern roots, in part to rural voters in the region. On the day Walz was announced as Harris’ running mate, the campaign released a camouflage hat bearing the Harris-Walz campaign logo. “I grew up working on a family farm. I know the work our farmers, ranchers, and producers do is tough under the very best of conditions,” he wrote on social media in a post sharing the proclamation. “I’ll always make the case: We owe them our full support to keep feeding Minnesota and the world.” Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday posted on social media that she is looking forward to debating former President Donald Trump on September 10. CNN previously reported Trump and Harris are set to debate on ABC on September 10 after the former president said during a news conference earlier today that he agreed to it along with two others next month. Harris also told reporters before boarding Air Force Two in Detroit that she is “happy” to discuss further debates. “I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a debate on September 10. I’m looking forward to it and I hope he shows up,” Harris said. When asked if she would be open to the other debates mentioned by Trump, Harris said: “I’m happy to have that conversation about an additional debate for after September 10.” During a press conference earlier today, Trump indicated he would debate Harris on September 4 with Fox and September 25 with NBC — in addition to the now-agreed upon September 10 debate. Asked when she will sit down for her first interview, Harris said she’s talking to her team and wants to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month. President Joe Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews Thursday he’s confident in Vice President Kamala Harris’ ability to debate former president Donald Trump, following the news the two candidates have agreed to participate in at least one debate next month. Asked if he’s confident in his vice president’s ability to debate the GOP nominee, Biden appeared first not to hear the question, before responding, “Yes, I am, as long as you keep him talking!” He then boarded AF1 for New Castle, Delaware. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz rallied union members in a local union hall in Michigan Thursday, working to drum up support amongst organized labor and draw a sharp contrast between the Democratic ticket and Trump when it came to labor issues.   In remarks focused on unity and community, Harris highlighted the strength and basic “fairness” of collective bargaining as she drew a throughline to how she believes it’s reflected in her campaign. Harris has touted her support of unions in the past including walking the picket line with striking workers in 2019. She praised unions for their contributions.  Walz, who was a union member as a teacher, thanked the auto workers for the “privilege” of joining their picket line last year, and sharply criticized the former president on labor issues.   “We know that unions built the middle class,” he said, adding, “you know who doesn’t believe that? Donald Trump.”  United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain offered a warm welcome to the Democratic ticket, telling members that Harris and Walz are both “one of us.” While Harris and Walz joined autoworkers on picket lines during their major strike last year, Fain noted Trump was “nowhere to be found,” and instead visited Detroit to go to a non-union business  In September, instead of participating in the second Republican presidential primary debate, Trump visited Drake Enterprises, a non-union auto parts supplier in Clint Township, to appeal to a group of current and former union workers. Vice President Kamala Harris would not answer a question from CNN on whether she will commit to three debates against former president Donald Trump in September. Harris and Trump are slated to debate on ABC on September 10 after the former president said Thursday at a news conference that he had agreed to it, along with two others. It is not immediately clear whether Harris will attend the other debates that Trump mentioned Thursday. Harris deflected most questions from several reporters, including CNN, along the ropeline after her campaign event in Detroit today. The two candidates have been at odds for weeks over the issue. Harris previously agreed to the ABC debate on September 10 – which was originally accepted by Trump and former President Joe Biden before the latter dropped out of the race. Earlier this week, Trump had said that he would not debate Harris if she did not agree to attend the proposed Fox News debate on September 4. The Harris campaign responded to Donald Trump’s news conference this afternoon, saying the former president “took a break from taking a break to put some pants on to host what it called a “public meltdown.” The campaign knocked Trump for not campaigning all week, while Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are on a battleground campaign blitz. “He hasn’t campaigned all week. He isn’t going to a single swing state this week. But he sure is mad Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are getting big crowds across the battlegrounds,” the campaign said. During his news conference, Trump argued he hasn’t been campaigning because “I’m leading by a lot and I’m letting their convention go through,” in response to a question from CNN’s Kristen Holmes at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence. Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that inflation virtually did not exist during his presidency – drawing a contrast between his administration and that of President Joe Biden whose early years in office were plagued by decades-high inflation.  “I had 1% inflation. I had actually no inflation because if you look at the categories, we had just about no inflation,” he said at his Mar-a-Lago press conference. “I actually had a positive inflation. It was a perfect number because you don’t want zero …  I had a perfect number, right around the 1%.”  Facts First: Trump’s comment is false. Inflation was low, but not 1%.  The Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump’s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Trump campaign is downplaying the significance of the Democratic Party reshuffling its ticket to elevate Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden, arguing that despite the change in the dynamics of the race, the “fundamentals” of the campaign have remained the same.  Trump campaign officials told reporters on Thursday they believe Harris’ improvement over Biden in public polls can be attributed to “irrational exuberance,” arguing that Harris is making up ground with voters who supported Biden in 2020 but had moved away from Democrats before Harris moved to the top of the ticket.  The official pushed back on Harris’ attacks on Trump’s presidential record, crystallized in the campaign’s new slogan, “We are not going back,” which Harris and her supporters have latched on to at recent campaign events.  “When you ask voters whether they’d rather return to the Trump economy, or stay with the Biden economy, we win that two to one,” the official said.   The official said the campaign’s internal data showed Harris has increased enthusiasm among Democratic voters and does better with undecided voters than Biden, but contended she still trails Trump in both voter motivation and popularity with undecided voters. Officials also said Harris was doing better among Black voters then President Joe Biden was, a demographic that Trump’s team has been heavily targeted this cycle.  Former President Donald Trump once again claimed that he signed the largest tax cut in history during his administration. “Our tax cuts, which are the biggest in history, our tax cuts are coming due as you know very soon,” Trump said in his Thursday news conference. Facts First: This claim is false. Analyses have found that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released in June, the federal government’s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger – former President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Former President Donald Trump tried to distance himself from his previous calls to lock up Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election. During a Mar-a-Lago news conference on Thursday, he said that while his supporters “used to say, ‘lock her up, lock her up,’” he wouldn’t echo those calls and instead “would say just, ‘relax, please.’”   “I was very protective of (Clinton). Nobody would understand that, but I was. I think my people understand it. They used to say, ‘lock her up, lock her up,’ but I would say just, ‘relax, please,’” Trump said.   Facts First: Trump’s suggestion that while his supporters chanted “lock her up,” he merely told them to “relax” is misleading at best. Trump sometimes went silent and paused his remarks as his supporters engaged in the chants, giving them time to continue, but he has used those exact words and similar language on other occasions. Historically, Trump used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. “For what she’s done, they should lock her up,” Trump said after the crowd chanted “lock her up” at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina.   “‘Lock her up’ is right,” he said at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania.  Trump has also explicitly called for Clinton’s imprisonment using different phrasing.   “Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,” he said in a June 2016 speech in California. “She has to go to jail,” he repeated in an October 2016 speech in Florida. At a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton said, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Trump responded, “Because you’d be in jail.”    Trump softened his rhetoric shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn’t want to hurt her and didn’t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to “lock her up.”   “You should lock her up, I’ll tell you,” he said at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted “lock them up” in relation to the Biden family, Trump said, “You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary.” Former President Donald Trump repeated his false claim that Vice President Kamala Harris, a lawyer who was elected as San Francisco’s district attorney and then as California’s attorney general, “couldn’t pass her bar exam.”  Facts First: It’s not true that Harris “couldn’t pass her bar exam.” She did fail on her first attempt to pass the bar exam, according to The New York Times, but then succeeded. She was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school.   Trump could fairly say that Harris couldn’t initially pass the bar exam, but his news conference comments made it sound like she never passed.  Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed at a Mar-a-Lago news conference Thursday that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6.”  Facts First: This is not true.   Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Maryland, was fatally shot by a US Capitol Police employee as a mob tried to force its way toward the House Chamber. Three other people died of “medical emergencies” during the riot. In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”  Former President Donald Trump claimed during today’s remarks to reporters that “everybody’s going to be forced to buy an electric car” if Democrats win the 2024 election, a claim he has made repeatedly at campaign rallies. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. President Joe Biden has not mandated that everyone will be forced to buy an EV, or outlawed cars powered by gasoline. Biden’s administration has finalized regulations pushing automakers and consumers to move toward electric vehicles, as well as more efficient gas-powered hybrids.  Earlier this year, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized ambitious new tailpipe emissions regulations for automakers that boost both EVs and plug-in hybrids – cars that run on electric batteries and a smaller gas-powered engine. The Biden administration has also offered tax credits to people who buy certain electric vehicles, invested in new EV charging stations and ordered federal entities to purchase electric vehicles, among other policies promoting the adoption of these vehicles. In 2023, EVs made up just 7.6% of new car sales, according to Kelley Blue Book. The new rule is targeting 35% to 56% for EVs in 2032, and 13% to 36% for plug-in hybrids.  But there is no Biden requirement that “everybody” has to drive an electric vehicle and no Biden proposal to prohibit citizens from continuing to use gasoline-powered engines.  Former President Donald Trump said during his news conference Thursday that the United States wouldn’t have experienced “any inflation” had it not been for “bad energy problems” during the Biden administration.  Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He appeared to be referencing the spike in gas prices that occurred after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. That certainly contributed to inflation at the time, but it was trending higher before then as a result of pent-up demand from the pandemic and labor shortages.   It’s also worth noting that domestic oil production was higher in 2022 compared to when Trump was president, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. Ahead of their event at the United Auto Workers local 900 union hall, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz filmed campaign content for digital platforms, the campaign said.  The two spent a little over an hour at the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Detroit where they filmed videos. The stop was closed to the press, according to pool reporters traveling with her. In a news conference Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, former President Donald Trump repeated his familiar story about how migrants are supposedly arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed by foreign leaders from prisons and mental health facilities.  “Why is it that millions of people were allowed to come into our country from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, insane asylums?” he said. “These are institutions that are being emptied out, not in South America, all over the world, including South America, all over the world. Prisons are being emptied out into our country because we have a president that’s the worst president in the history of our country.”  Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that jails and mental health facilities around the world are being emptied out so that their inhabitants can travel to the US as migrants. Last year, Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.  Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.  When former President Donald Trump was asked about his ear following an assassination attempt at one of his rallies last month, he said it has “pretty much recovered.” He said he doesn’t have any hearing damage, saying “I got very lucky.” When asked if there’s a scar on his ear, Trump said, “yeah, a little bit. Not much.” Former President Donald Trump said he hasn’t been campaigning because he’s “leading by a lot and I’m letting their convention go through,” in response to a question from CNN’s Kristen Holmes at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence Thursday afternoon.  After saying Holmes asked a “stupid question,” Trump defended his lack of public events in the past week. Trump said his Democratic rival Kamala Harris “can’t do a news conference. She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference.” He promised to travel to campaign more “after their convention,” adding that he’s “going out to certain places to help certain senators get elected, not even for me.” The Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22. Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim at a news conference Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris acted as a “border czar” during the Biden administration and that “essentially, she never went to the border” during her time as vice president, discounting her 2021 border visit as one to “a location that was not part of the problem, that was not really going to the border.” Facts First: Trump repeated two false claims here. First, Harris did go to the border as vice president, in Texas in mid-2021; many Republicans had criticized Harris prior to the visit for not having gone, and some later argued that she didn’t go frequently enough, but the recurring claim that she “never went” has not been true for more than three years. Second, Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. Former President Donald Trump said the FBI did a “very good job” with the investigation into his assassination attempt last month. “The FBI came to see me about the shooter. I think they’ve done a very good job, and I think they did a very good job with respect to this other lunatic that they have in custody,” Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. The former president was referring to a Pakistani man who has alleged ties to the Iranian government who was arrested in New York. The man was charged by the Justice Department earlier this week with seeking to carry out political assassinations, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. FBI investigators believe that Trump and other current and former US government officials were the intended targets of the plot, a US official briefed on the matter said. Victim interviews, like the one Trump participated in with the FBI after his attempted assassination at a rally in July, are a routine part of criminal investigations, but are voluntary. Former President Donald Trump said he believes abortion “has become much less of an issue” ahead of the November election. “I think it’s actually going to be a very small issue,” Trump said. Trump repeated that he believes in abortion exceptions for instances of rape, incest and the life of the mother. “I believe strongly,” he said Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida, at a news conference. “I think that that’s a very important thing.” Former President Donald Trump said he thinks “it’s very important to have debates” during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago this afternoon. He said he has agreed to three upcoming dates with Fox, ABC and NBC. A senior Trump adviser and an ABC source familiar with the matter both said the correct dates Trump has agreed to with networks are: September 4 with Fox, September 10 with ABC and September 25 with NBC.  Trump said “minor details” are still being worked out including audience and locations. He also said Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has to agree to the terms. CNN has reached out to NBC and the Harris campaign for comment. More background: Harris had previously agreed to the ABC debate on September 10.   ABC News’ Washington Bureau Chief Rick Klein confirmed on Thursday that the ABC debate was on, posting on X, “The @abc debate will be Sept. 10 - with Trump and Harris now both confirmed.” An ABC source was confident their debate would be first, as the Harris campaign has indicated she will not agree to the Fox News debate. A source familiar with the NBC negotiations says September 25 was “one of the dates” given to the campaigns. While they’ve been in discussion with both camps, the Harris campaign has not formally accepted. Details on location, rules and moderators will be determined closer to the debate date. This post has been updated with additional background on the presidential debates. Former President Donald Trump praised his vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, while addressing media Thursday from Florida. Vance mirrored the Democratic ticket’s schedule this week in battleground states, and held an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday, where he reopened a line of attack into Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota’s military record. Former President Donald Trump said he wants three presidential debates before the election in November. He said at a news conference on Monday that he hopes to take the stage with Vice President Kamala Harris several times before voters start casting their ballots. Trump also acknowledged the possibility of a vice presidential debate and praised his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Vance has been holding events in key battleground states this week — often in the same place as the Harris campaign. On Wednesday, both Vance and Harris were in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The day before, on Tuesday, they both had events in Philadelphia. Former President Donald Trump said he “hasn’t recalibrated strategy at all” since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. He also accused Harris of being “weak on crime” and having “open borders.” “I think she’s worse than Biden,” Trump said at a Thursday press conference in Palm Beach, Florida. Donald Trump described how he views the current Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris became the former president’s new opponent. Trump attacked Harris’ policy stances and said that she is a “radical left person.” Harris became the official Democratic nominee for president earlier this week after Biden announced that he would not run for reelection last month. This is the former president’s first news conference since Harris announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be her running mate on Tuesday. Former President Donald Trump is now speaking after he said this morning that he would hold a news conference at Mar-a-Lago this afternoon. Trump has looked to respond to the sudden change in his opponent after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race last month and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. US security officials are on alert for possible “retaliatory” attacks against Democrats following the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump last month, according to a new intelligence report obtained by CNN.  The threat assessment — prepared by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies, including local police in Illinois — outlines various potential security concerns surrounding the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which kicks off on August 19.  While the motive of the gunman who fired upon Trump remains a mystery to investigators, the bulletin says that “politically and socially divisive topics have prompted violence in the past,” and adds that some extremists “will view political and social tensions as an opportunity to use or promote violence to further their ideological goals.” The intelligence assessment is common for major gatherings deemed National Security Special Events by the DHS secretary, and includes many of the security concerns outlined in a joint report federal law enforcement issued last month ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.  CNN has reached out to DHS and the FBI for comment on the threat assessment. Read more about the DNC threat assessment. Correction: This post has been updated to indicate the Democratic National Convention starts Tuesday, August 19. While the spotlight has been on both parties’ vice presidential nominees in recent weeks, it’s the top of the ticket that has remained in focus on the airwaves as presidential ad wars continue to escalate.  Across the country and a series of key battleground states in particular, ad spending soared to the highest single-week total of the presidential campaign so far last week, seeing a combined total of more than $82 million in presidential advertising. Democrats outspent Republicans during that stretch from July 30 through August 6 by about $50 million to $32.6 million. Since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and its allies have launched a mix of ads, both promoting her record and biography and attacking former President Donald Trump. The Trump campaign and its allies, meanwhile, have poured millions into amplifying concerns about immigration and crime, assigning equal blame to Biden and Harris. These are the states that saw the most presidential ad spending last week, according to AdImpact data: Vice President Kamala Harris tackled the angst within her own party over the conflict in Gaza head-on at a campaign rally in Detroit Wednesday night, moving quickly to shut down protests interrupting her event. “Because we believe in democracy, everyone’s voice matters, but I am speaking now,” she said as a group of about eight women interrupted the event with pro-Palestinian messages. As the shouting continued, Harris grew blunter, saying, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” The episode highlights how Harris is navigating the complex dynamics of the Israel-Hamas war on both the diplomatic level and a political one as she now leads the Democratic ticket. The conflict in Gaza has proven to be a key issue for progressive and young voters as well as Arab American and Muslim communities. That includes those in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to significant Arab American and Muslim communities including in cities like Dearborn. Like Biden, Harris is confronting a political and diplomatic tightrope not entirely in her control. While the White House holds out hope for a hostage and ceasefire deal that would bring an end to fighting in Gaza and lower regional temperatures, the power to reach such an agreement rests with Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — neither of whom has given final sign-off. Pro-Palestinian protesters have pressed for the United States to wield pressure on Israel using arms sales and other assistance as leverage — decisions that, for now, are not Harris’ to make. While Biden has said he would withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, he has so far stopped short of major steps that would cut off American assistance to its ally. In substance, her positions have not been at odds with Biden’s. Behind the scenes, however, she has advocated for a more empathetic approach to the Palestinians and in public has sometimes struck a more forceful tone than Biden when discussing the situation in Gaza. The Trump campaign on Thursday continued to press Vice President Kamala Harris to answer more questions from reporters. The new statement from the campaign echoes recent attacks from former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance that Harris has not answered enough questions from media since becoming the Democratic nominee. “When is your next press conference?” the statement from the campaign reads. Trump said he will hold a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort Thursday afternoon. Earlier on Thursday, Trump claimed that “Kamala refuses to do interviews because her team realizes she is unable to answer questions, much like Biden was not able to answer questions, but for different reasons. He is just plain ‘shot,’ and she is just plain ‘Incompetent.’” What do sport hunters and fans of breakout queer pop star Chappell Roan have in common? Well, not much, perhaps. But now you can add at least one item to that list: Kamala Harris’ and Tim Walz’s new campaign cap. The pair’s first joint merch offering was unveiled Tuesday, just hours after the vice president named the Minnesota governor and hunting enthusiast as her presidential running mate. At first glance, their “Harris-Walz” caps presented a classic outdoorsy combination of camouflage (every hunter’s pattern of choice) and bright orange (used for visibility and avoiding mistaken identity). However, online commentators were quick to highlight the striking similarity between the design and Roan’s own merchandise — specifically her “Midwestern Princess” trucker hats, which reference her debut album “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.” The 26-year-old singer-songwriter seemed surprised, posing the question on X, “Is this real”? Despite the similar designs, campaign officials told CNN that new merchandise was not a direct reference to Roan but instead reflected Walz’ own camo hat that he wears frequently as governor. While officially unintentional, the twinning of Walz’ hat and Roan’s merch comes hot off the heels of Harris’ embrace of Charli XCX’s “Brat” green, and appears to some as another instance of her campaign reacting quickly to the Gen-Z zeitgeist. The Democratic Party’s alignment — even if inadvertent — is in keeping with two of the themes we have already seen in Harris’ short campaign: appearing cool by association and feeding the viral meme-makers who are burnishing her credentials among young voters. Leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement said they briefly spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz backstage at the Democratic ticket’s rally in Detroit on Wednesday.  The short encounter comes as Harris is navigating the complex dynamics of the Israel-Hamas conflict at both a diplomatic level and a political one as she now leads the Democratic ticket. Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, the cofounders of the Uncommitted National Movement, an effort aimed at showing disapproval for President Joe Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza, expressed to Harris and Walz their concerns about the US supplying weapons to Israel and the plight of Palestinian civilians in the strip, according to a statement from the group. A Harris campaign spokesperson described the short meeting as an extension of her continued engagement with Arab, Muslim and Palestinian communities about the war in Gaza since October 7. The spokesperson continued: Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.  Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.  Walz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race. “I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,” Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.  “As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,” he said. “I don’t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.” Walz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It’s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.  In a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.  “I left in April of 2005 and for me it was just short of 25 years and it was to run for this office. We were really concerned that we were going to try and do both. There’s always the Hatch Act and some of the things that you have to be very careful of,” Walz said in the interview. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork. It was the first big day of the wrestle for the Midwest that is likely to decide the 2024 election, and someone important was missing — former President Donald Trump. The Republican nominee left it to his vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, to troll the newly minted Democratic ticket through the critical swing state territory Wednesday as a fresh 90-day race for the White House burst into life. Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held two high-energy rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan that showed the euphoria inside a once-despairing Democratic Party for its two new candidates. The Democratic nominee borrowed a trick from Trump’s playbook, performing a dramatic arrival scene aboard Air Force Two in Michigan that mirrored his past use of the bigger presidential jet before a packed airport rally. For the second day in a row, Harris appeared before thousands of excited supporters who spelled out a collective warning sign for Trump — who is known to obsess over crowd sizes. She appeared to be quickly settling into her novel role as her party’s official candidate, displaying flashes of charisma and increasing confidence as her political honeymoon showed no signs of ending. Read the full analysis. The Trump campaign is eager to define Tim Walz as a far-left liberal on the wrong side of the culture wars, particularly when it comes to his support for transgender youth. His backers, however, call him a “prairie populist,” focused on meeting the everyday needs of working Americans, as demonstrated by policies like free school meals for kids and paid family and medical leave. They say that if he’s changed, it’s because his constituents have, too. Democrats say they think Republicans will struggle to paint Walz as an ultra-liberal, and that many of the criticisms the Trump campaign is launching at Walz – from his handling of the protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by a police officer to raising questions about his military service – already fell flat during the governor’s 2022 reelection bid. Walz won by nearly 8 percentage points. How it started: Walz’s political career began when he flipped Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District – a red, rural seat that had only been held by one other Democrat in 100 years – in 2006, a wave midterm year for his party. Walz went on to serve six terms in the seat, which is now represented by a Republican. Despite his more conservative voting record in the House, there have been several through-lines in Walz’s policies. Healthcare has been a key part of his platform since 2006, when he campaigned on lowering costs. He later voted for the Affordable Care Act, which made him a target during the Tea Party wave of 2010. How it’s going: His biggest shift has been on gun control. Though he’d previously received an A rating from the National Rifle Association and is an avid hunter, he donated his NRA contributions after the October 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. In February 2018, following the Parkland shooting, he wrote a Star Tribune op-ed seeking to clarify his stance in support of “common sense” gun reforms. Walz faced blowback on the issue during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, particularly in his Democratic primary. “I’m a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights to own firearms,” Walz said in an interview explaining his about-face. “But I also recognize the need to have some common-sense changes in this. I reject the notion that it’s one or the other. Those folks out there who are responsible gun owners ― their hearts are breaking every time you see one of these shootings.” Read more about Walz’s political journey here. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will speak at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, around 3 p.m. ET on Thursday. Harris will appear with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz before they travel to Phoenix, Arizona, for an event. The duo were welcomed by a massive crowd in an airplane hangar in Detroit during their first joint rally as the presumptive Democratic ticket in the battleground state of Michigan on Wednesday. “It’s been a pretty interesting 24 hours for me, I have to be honest. I don’t know how I can explain to you walking into that arena in Philly or that field out in Wisconsin or right here, to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign,” Walz remarked to the thousands of Michigan voters crowded into an airplane hangar, many standing for several hours packed together on a sunny day. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump announced he would be holding a news conference at Mar-a-Lago at 2 p.m. ET Thursday.  CNN’s Ali Main contributed reporting to this post. The Harris-Walz campaign on Thursday released a new ad targeting Latino voters in key battleground states as they try to court the key demographic. The 60-second ad begins with a collage of photos from Harris’ childhood and highlights her upbringing as the daughter of immigrants and the success of her political career. “With that same determination, she always defended us. As a prosecutor, she protected us from violent criminals. As attorney general, she beat the banks that kicked families out of their homes. As our vice president, she fights for women’s reproductive rights—every day. And she beat the pharmaceutical companies to lower costs for insulin and prescriptions,” it continued.  Remember: A recent  New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection found that Harris improved on Biden’s standing among Latino voters, shifting from 50% Trump to 41% Biden in the earlier poll to 57% Harris to 38% Trump now. A CNN Poll of Polls average of general election polling continues to find no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, with each holding 49% support in an average of recent polls testing the head-to-head matchup. The latest Poll of Polls incorporates six surveys released in the weeks since Joe Biden announced his decision to exit the campaign. All six show a race within the margin of error. A new Marquette Law School poll, fielded July 24-August 1 and released Thursday morning, finds Harris taking 52% to Trump’s 48% among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, with a +/- 4.1 percentage point margin of error. When third-party candidates are included, the poll finds Harris leading Trump, 47% to 41%, among registered voters, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. taking 9%, Jill Stein taking 2% and Cornel West and Chase Oliver at 1% each. In the Marquette Law School poll, 10% of voters are so-called “double haters” — those with unfavorable opinions of both Harris and Trump. In Marquette’s May poll, 21% had unfavorable views of both Biden and Trump. About 4 in 10 registered voters (41%) in the new Marquette poll describe Harris as “very liberal,” while 48% describe Trump as “very conservative.” Former President Donald Trump announced he will hold a news conference at Mar-a-Lago at 2 p.m. ET Thursday. “I will be doing a General News Conference at 2:00 P.M. at Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach. Thank you!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  President Joe Biden said Wednesday he doesn’t have confidence there will be a peaceful transition of power if former President Donald Trump loses in November, comments supported by Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell. Biden on Wednesday pointed to comments from the Republican presidential nominee suggesting the only way he’d lose is if the election is stolen from him. When asked Thursday if she agreed with Biden’s comments, Dingell responded, “Yes.” Earlier this year, Trump warned that if he lost the 2024 election it would be a “bloodbath” for the US auto industry and the country — comments Biden and his then-campaign quickly leaped on, claiming the former president was inciting political violence. Biden also warned that Trump was preparing to challenge the election results again in November as he did in 2020, including by putting in place sympathetic local election officials. Kamala Harris’ campaign is highlighting its organization in the so-called “Blue Wall” states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan which will be key to its electoral map in November, pointing to Harris’ new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as an asset in rural areas of these states.  As Harris and Walz continue their battleground blitz in Michigan on Thursday, the campaign pointed to its growing infrastructure, including more than 600 coordinated staff across those three critical states, with another 150 staffers joining in the coming weeks, Harris-Walz battleground states director Dan Kanninen said in a memo Wednesday.  By the numbers:  And as voters get to know Walz, Kanninen pointed to his record and biography: “As a governor, congressman, football coach, veteran, and high school teacher, Walz has championed working families his entire life,” he said, echoing Harris’ introduction in Philadelphia.  Kanninen highlighted Walz’s experience as a congressman from a red district and specifically noted that he “consistently outperformed national Democrats in his House district, including in counties that have supported Trump, offering a blueprint for how to cut margins in rural areas across the country.” He suggested that the campaign will focus Walz’s time and efforts on messaging to rural voters: “Our campaign will continue to go everywhere, and Governor Walz will be a key messenger in these rural areas where we’re focused on limiting Republicans’ margins.” Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday — key states on the path to the presidency. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also held events in both states today, underscoring the importance of reaching voters there. Harris is expected to be back in Michigan tomorrow. Donald Trump won both of those states eight years ago but they have vexed Republicans ever since. Along with Pennsylvania, Trump’s stunning 2016 victories in Michigan and Wisconsin produced a seismic crack in the so-called blue wall of states Democrats had relied on in every election going back to 1992. Trump’s particular success with blue-collar voters gave Republicans optimism for a political realignment that could turn the Rust Belt red for the foreseeable future. Instead, Republicans have struggled to replicate Trump’s initial success in subsequent elections, including in 2020 when Biden narrowly won all three states en route to victory. Democrats in that time also took over the governors’ offices in Michigan and Wisconsin and flipped a Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022 which proved crucial to maintaining control of the chamber. In both states, efforts to subvert the 2020 election — including by enlisting fake electors — have also roiled Republican politics, at times aided by Trump.  Still, gone are the days when Democrats could comfortably count on these states to deliver in national elections. Biden won Michigan in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes. The margin was much tighter in Wisconsin, where he came out ahead by about 21,000 votes — a victory of about 0.7 percentage points. A CNN Poll of Polls average of national polling finds a close general election race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Trump currently holds 49% support in the average of five recent polls testing the matchup, while Harris holds 48%. The latest Poll of Polls includes an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released Tuesday that also finds no clear leader in a head-to-head matchup between the candidates, with Harris taking 51% and Trump taking 48% among registered voters nationally. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll finds that Americans trust Harris over Trump to handle the issue of abortion (56% say Harris would do a better job, compared with 41% Trump) and the preservation of democracy (53% say Harris, 46% Trump). Americans prefer Trump on immigration (52% say Trump would better handle the issue, 46% Harris), with a closer split on who would better handle the economy (51% say Trump would be better, 48% Harris).

Tim Walz are rallying voters across the Midwest this week, looking to build on support from key union leaders as they promote a message of pro-labor policies that they say benefit the middle class. At the leadership level, the Democratic ticket’s been deemed a clear choice. Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers who endorsed Harris last week and appeared alongside the pair Tuesday, called them a “Democratic Dynamic Duo.” The public show of support follows weeks of behind-the-scenes maneuvering to renew support from the unions that had backed President Joe Biden, who called himself the most pro-union president in history, until he made a surprise exit from the race last month. Since then, Harris has set out to prove that she won’t veer from Biden’s agenda — working the phones with union leaders, holding early campaign events alongside the American Federation of Teachers and the UAW, and notching the endorsement from a major hospitality union, despite a proposal by former President Donald Trump to increase service workers’ take-home pay. And the selection of Walz as the ticket’s No. 2 is seen as bolstering those labor bona fides: Walz and his wife were both union members, and his tenure as governor includes infrastructure, climate and paid leave legislation. “It’s very much the Biden agenda in a state where you can actually legislate an agenda,” Seth Harris, Biden’s former labor policy adviser at the National Economic Council, told CNN about Walz’s record in Minnesota. “It very much parallels what they did at the federal level.” The union leaders who back Biden — and now Harris’ — agenda wield an immense amount of power within the Democratic Party, and the work is just beginning to try to turn their endorsements into member turnout in November. One influential union — the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents a diverse set of industries — may remain neutral this cycle, withholding an endorsement of the Democratic Party candidate for the first time in nearly three decades. But beneath the executive level, work remains to shore up support among millions of card-carrying union members who represent a critical constituency for both parties across the manufacturing-heavy Midwest — and whose political allegiances often don’t mirror those of their leadership. In a memo released Thursday, the Harris-Walz campaign said it plans to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars” throughout the fall to reach an estimated 2.7 million union members in battleground states. “That means something when roughly 45,000 votes in key states decided the election four years ago,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez wrote in the memo. The abrupt change in Democratic candidates sent unions scrambling to adjust their messaging internally — to print new signs, film new ads explaining the policies their new candidate would support, and update talking points for local chapters. Part of the task at hand, one top AFL-CIO executive told CNN, is connecting the infrastructure and semiconductor laws that Biden and Harris enacted to the economic boon felt in various industries. “There’s so much work available, and they’re trying to bring in more apprentices, get more people trained up because of these investments,” said Greg Regan, the president of the Transportation Trades Department at the AFL-CIO. “This is not surface-level stuff.” While that messaging may take time, many rank-and-file workers are not sold. A video message from Fain praising Walz on the union’s Facebook page elicited a tsunami of negative comments from factory workers across the country, many of whom voiced their support for the Republican ticket. Harris and Walz are set to meet with the UAW members at a local union hall in the Detroit area on Thursday afternoon. The more intimate setting than other campaign events, featuring about 100 rank-and-file UAW members, was planned to connect with the workers and try to mobilize support beyond the union’s leadership. Divergent views are expected in an organization representing roughly 400,000 active employees and nearly 600,000 retired workers. But it illustrates that many voters still see the actions of the Biden-Harris administration as not going far enough. In September, Biden joined a picket line and called for higher wages when the union was locked in contentious talks with the Big Three automakers. Shortly after an agreement was reached to break the strike, UAW’s Fain endorsed Biden. Biden and his labor secretary also got involved to broker a truce between a dozen railroad industry unions — including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — who were threatening a strike in 2022. Biden praised the deal as a compromise at the time, even as workers simmered over some of the terms in the weeks that followed. And some of that anger remains. A Facebook post by IBEW promoting Walz joining the ticket received more than 800 comments, some favorable but most decrying the economy and the plights of workers over the last three and a half years. Among those opposing the IBEW’s endorsement, many suggested that the union’s leadership was out of touch with its members. Labor groups conduct their own internal polling to gauge the views of their members and what messages will be most effective. Those polls may show a more fractured base than the near-unanimous endorsements would suggest. “I expect some data toward the end of the month, especially after the (Democratic National) Convention,” Regan of the AFL-CIO told CNN. “It will be really interesting to see.” Fain projected confidence later Thursday during an interview with CNN’s Erica Hill, insisting that an “overwhelming majority” of union members will vote for Harris and Walz in November. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a union with 1.3 million members, is also polling its rank-and-file members for their views and is expected to decide after the convention whether it will endorse either candidate for president. Shortly after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Teamsters leadership invited her to participate in a roundtable interview on top issues facing the union. “Teamster members want to hear your vision on issues that affect their families,” said the letter to Harris, obtained by CNN. The roundtable would focus on four issues, according to the letter: the shrinking American middle class; corporate bankruptcy reform; antitrust enforcement in the warehouse and package delivery industries; and the freedom to form and join a union. A Teamsters spokesperson told CNN that Harris has not responded to the invitation. The Harris campaign did not answer questions about the invitation. Top Democrats have expressed frustration with Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien, for delivering a primetime speech at the Republican National Convention while still seeking a speaking role at the Democrats’ event. A convention official said no final programming decisions have been made. “He’s got a lot of members who support Trump, a lot who support Harris, and a great deal on the line from a policy perspective,” said Seth Harris, the former Biden labor adviser. “The endorsement shouldn’t be decided by who speaks at the convention.” DNC officials, according to people with knowledge of the conversations, have been weighing the Teamsters request, while also considering a desire to recognize labor leaders who have not wavered in their loyalty to the party. “The list of union leaders who want to speak at the DNC is pages long,” Harris said. “The DNC has a difficult choice to make.” A spokesperson for O’Brien said he requested speaking roles at both parties’ conventions. In response, Trump invited O’Brien personally to the Milwaukee event, the spokesperson said. The DNC, she said, has not responded."
Trump attacks Harris and Walz during first appearance since Democratic ticket was announced | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:47 PM EDT, Thu August 8, 2024",2024-08-08T21:56:03.065Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/politics/trump-news-conference-attacks-harris-walz/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday repeatedly demeaned opponent Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “barely competent,” and made a string of false and often confusing claims about her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “He has positions that it’s not even possible to believe they exist. He’s going for things that nobody’s even heard of. Heavy into the transgender world, heavy into lots of different worlds,” Trump told reporters gathered for his first news conference since Harris announced Walz as her vice presidential pick. Over about an hour, the former president fielded a variety of questions and swerved into familiar talking points, from criticizing Democrats over immigration and the economy to a rant accusing the party of conspiring against President Joe Biden. He insisted that his campaign strategy is unchanged now that Harris is his opponent and said he preferred running against her, at one point speculating that his performance with White male voters would go “through the roof.” “I haven’t recalibrated strategy at all. It’s the same policies: open borders, weak on crime. I think she’s worse than Biden,” Trump said. “Because he got forced into the position. She was there long before.” Asked about his light campaign schedule, Trump dismissed the question as “stupid” before saying that he’s been busy taping commercials, talking on his phone, the radio and on television programs. He noted, too, that he was holding a news conference, his first in months, before saying Harris “is not smart enough” to do one of her own. His last campaign event was over the weekend, when he rallied with running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Vance, for his part, has campaigned in the same states as Harris and Walz this week. Trump also spent considerable time on Thursday complaining about media coverage of his campaign rallies, claiming at one point that the audience for his remarks on January 6, 2021 – shortly before the riots at the US Capitol – was his biggest ever and, in an absurd turn, compared favorably to the turnout for Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. “If you look at what Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, it was a great speech. And you look at ours, same real estate, same everything. Same number of people, if not, we had more,” Trump said. “And you look at it, and you look at the picture of his crowd and my crowd. We actually had more people. They said I had 25,000, and he had a million people and I’m OK with it because I like Dr. Martin Luther King.” Trump’s rambling monologues cut a sharp contrast again the newly minted Democratic ticket, which is younger and, in its few appearances so far, more focused on its preferred issue set. The former president, meanwhile, seemed inclined to comment – often with lies or misleading claims – on every matter under the sun, from polling (“really good”) to the prospects of a new world war (“very close”). His forays into more mainstream criticisms of Harris and the state of the country under President Joe Biden struck some familiar, if occasionally head-scratching, lines of attack. “Now you have millions and millions of dead people, and you have people dying financially because they can’t buy bacon, they can’t buy food, they can’t buy groceries,” Trump said of Americans. “They can’t do anything. They’re living horribly in our country.” Largely, though, Trump’s remarks were a rehashing of old grievances and a ramping up of newer, often insulting charges. Jewish Americans supporting Harris, Trump said, “should have their head examined.” “She’s been very, very bad to Israel and very bad to Jewish people,” he added. He did not specify how, nor that Harris is married to a Jewish man, second gentleman Doug Emhoff. He went on to downplay the impact that abortion rights will have on the coming election, calling it a “very small issue” and “not a big factor anymore,” before falsely claiming – again – that Democrats support abortion “even after birth.” The race for the White House, Trump added later, would not be competitive – so long as the election was fairly conducted, again falsely suggesting that past votes have not been. “The (MAGA) base is 75% of the country,” Trump said, “far beyond the Republican party.” In a minor reversal from past remarks, when he suggested he might not debate Harris at the previously appointed dates and times, Trump on Thursday announced that he had agreed to meet her on three occasions. “I think it’s very important to have debates, and we’ve agreed with Fox on a date of September 4. We’ve agreed with NBC. Fairly full agreement subject to them on September 10. And we’ve agreed with ABC on September 25,” the former president said. A senior Trump adviser and an ABC source familiar with the matter both said that the correct dates Trump has agreed to with networks are: September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with ABC and September 25 with NBC. Trump said “minor details” were still being worked out, including audience and locations."
"Trump and Harris agree to debate on ABC on September 10, network says | CNN Politics","Updated 6:01 PM EDT, Thu August 8, 2024",2024-08-08T19:19:59.829Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/politics/trump-debate-harris-september/index.html,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are set to debate on ABC on September 10 after the former president said Thursday he had agreed to the faceoff, along with two others next month. “ABC News will host qualifying presidential candidates to debate on September 10 on ABC. Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate,” the network said in a statement. Speaking at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said that he was “looking forward” to debating the vice president and that he had agreed to upcoming dates with Fox News, ABC and NBC. “I think it’s very important to have debates, and we’ve agreed with Fox on a date of September 4. We’ve agreed with NBC. Fairly full agreement subject to them on September 10. And we’ve agreed with ABC on September 25,” the former president said. A senior Trump adviser and an ABC source familiar with the matter both said that the correct dates Trump has agreed to with networks are: September 4 with Fox News, September 10 with ABC and September 25 with NBC. Trump said “minor details” were still being worked out, including audience and locations. “The other side has to agree to the terms. They may or may not agree. I don’t know if they’re going to agree. (Harris) hasn’t done an interview. She can’t do an interview. She’s barely competent, and she can’t do an interview, I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight,” he said. Harris, who had previously agreed to the ABC debate, confirmed her participation later Thursday and said she would be “happy” to discuss a further debate. “I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a debate on September 10th. I’m looking forward to it, and I hope he shows up,” Harris told reporters before boarding Air Force Two in Detroit after an event with the United Auto Workers. Asked if she would be open to the other debates mentioned by Trump, Harris said: “I’m happy to have that conversation about an additional debate for after September 10th.” The ABC debate was originally accepted by Trump and former President Joe Biden before the latter dropped out of the race. Earlier this week, Trump had said that he would not debate Harris if she did not agree to attend the proposed Fox News debate on September 4. An ABC source had earlier expressed confidence that the network’s debate would be the first one between Trump and the vice president, as the Harris campaign has indicated she will not agree to the Fox News debate. A source familiar with the NBC negotiations said September 25 was “one of the dates” given to the campaigns. While the network has been in discussions with both camps, the Harris campaign has not formally accepted. Details on location, rules and moderators will be determined closer to the debate date.

"No, Taylor Swift did not endorse Kamala Harris in a photo | CNN","Published 5:08 PM EDT, Thu August 8, 2024",2024-08-08T21:08:10.928Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/entertainment/taylor-swift-endorsement/index.html,"Taylor Swift’s supporters are keenly adept at reading into the singer’s lyrics and social media posts. And Swift is keenly masterful at providing what are known as “Easter eggs” for her fans, laying secret clues and hidden messages for her followers to dissect and discuss. This week, a photo shared by Swift that included a silhouette of a woman in a pantsuit — perhaps similar to one that could have been worn by Vice President Kamala Harris — had some fans suggesting the superstar had laid a massive Easter egg, giving her presidential endorsement to Harris. But that’s not the case. The image in question, posted Wednesday on Swift’s Instagram in a carousel of ten images, shows Swift center stage performing in Warsaw, Poland. In the background of the image, a woman in a pantsuit is pictured waving as she walks off the stage. Some speculated the woman pictured was depicting a silhouette of Harris, but it’s actually one of Swift’s background singers, who wear pantsuits during the particular set that was pictured in Swift’s post. A closer look at Swift’s posts from other Eras Tour stops, shows the background performers pictured in clearer focus in the pantsuit costumes. Also, the woman in the silhouette mistaken to be Harris is wearing boots, part of the performers’ costumes seen in other photos from the tour. (Though the vice president has been photographed wearing boots before, she typically wears pumps, or, more recently, sneakers with her suits.) Further evidence of no endorsement? Swift’s caption did not reference anything evoking politics. “Oh I loved those Warsaw shows SO much!!! Our first time ever playing in Poland, but it won’t be the last,” Swift wrote with the carousel of photos. “I seriously had the best time 😆 Also want to thank those beautiful crowds for making us the first tour to play 3 nights in a row in your stadium!!” Yet, some Harris supporters still thought they may have picked up on a clue. “Taylor Swift just low key endorsed Kamala Harris and MAGA is losing their minds,” the group Call to Activism wrote on X. CNN has reached out to representatives for Swift for comment. Swift posted the image hours before organizers canceled three of her concerts in Austria after authorities said they foiled a terror attack planned for the Vienna leg of her tour. Supporters, political pundits, media figures and likely the Harris campaign itself is closely watching for Swift’s endorsement, wondering if — or when — it may come. One of the most influential stars on the planet, Swift’s endorsement could have major impact with her hundreds of millions of fans around the world. In fact, a community of “Swifties for Kamala” has already emerged, without the star’s participation, with thousands of Swift’s fans making signature friendship bracelets to support Harris and voicing their support of the vice president loudly across social media. Swift has yet to speak out about Harris or former President Donald Trump this election cycle, but she endorsed President Joe Biden and Harris in their bid for the White House in 2020. “The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies, and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included,” Swift told V magazine in October 2020 about her endorsement. “Everyone deserves a government that takes global health risks seriously and puts the lives of its people first. The only way we can begin to make things better is to choose leaders who are willing to face these issues and find ways to work through them.” On social media at the time, Swift shared the cover of the magazine and joked, “So apt that it’s come out on the night of the VP debate. Gonna be watching and supporting @KamalaHarris by yelling at the tv a lot.” In 2020, Swift tweeted about Trump, writing, “After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November.” Swift largely stayed away from politics for the first decade of her career. But in her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” she expressed regret for not speaking up sooner. In a scene where her father told her that she could face backlash and media scrutiny for speaking out against Trump, Swift responded, “I don’t care if they write that.” She told her father, “I’m sad that I didn’t two years ago, but I can’t change that. I’m saying right now, that this is something I know is right … I need to be on the right side of history.” Speculation about a 2024 endorsement from Swift has been going on for months. Leading up the Super Bowl, right-wing media and some Republicans suggested Swift was part of an alleged conspiracy staged by the NFL and Democratic Party to deliver the 2024 presidential election to Biden. Trump recently spoke about Swift, calling her “beautiful” but “liberal” in a new book about “The Apprentice.” “I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump,” the former president told author Ramin Setoodeh in his book, “Apprentice in Wonderland.” “I hear she’s very talented,” Trump said. “I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!” After the book was released, Swifties on the left of the political spectrum took to social media with a message for the former president: “Stay away from her.”"
Harris navigates Gaza conflict on campaign trail | CNN Politics,"Published 11:47 AM EDT, Thu August 8, 2024",2024-08-08T15:47:27.278Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/politics/harris-gaza-conflict-campaign-trail/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris tackled the angst within her own party over the conflict in Gaza head-on at a campaign rally in Detroit Wednesday night, moving quickly to shut down protests interrupting her event. “Because we believe in democracy, everyone’s voice matters, but I am speaking now,” she said as a group of about eight women interrupted the event with pro-Palestinian messages. As the shouting continued, Harris grew blunter, saying, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” The episode highlights how Harris is navigating the complex dynamics of the Israel-Hamas war on both the diplomatic level and a political one as she now leads the Democratic ticket. The conflict in Gaza has proven to be a key issue for progressive and young voters as well as Arab American and Muslim communities. That includes those in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to significant Arab American and Muslim communities including in cities like Dearborn. Backstage in Detroit Wednesday, Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, briefly met in a photo line with the two leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement, an effort aimed at mobilizing voters during the Democratic primaries to show discontent with President Joe Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza. Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, the co-founders of the group, expressed to Harris and Walz their concerns about the US supplying weapons to Israel and the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a statement from the group. “The VP was receptive. I thanked her for the attention her staff is giving to our request for a meeting about an arms embargo. She thanked me for being there and for my work,” Alawieh, who is an “uncommitted” delegate to the Democratic National Convention, told CNN. “It feels fruitful; we’re hopeful that she will engage substantively with our request for an arms embargo that stops sending bombs to kill people we love.” While the group is calling for a meeting, a source familiar with the conversation said Harris did not express openness to an arms embargo when she spoke with the group’s leaders on Wednesday. “@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups,” Harris’ national security adviser Phil Gordon posted on X Thursday. “She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.” A Harris campaign spokesperson said in the brief encounter that the vice president “reaffirmed that her campaign will continue to engage” with Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian community members about the war in Gaza. “The Vice President has been clear: she will always work to ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups,” the spokesperson said. “The Vice President is focused on securing the ceasefire and hostage deal currently on the table.” “As she has said, it is time for this war to end in a way where: Israel is secure, hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,” the spokesperson added. Like Biden, Harris is confronting a political and diplomatic tightrope not entirely in her control. While the White House holds out hope for a hostage and ceasefire deal that would bring an end to fighting in Gaza and lower regional temperatures, the power to reach such an agreement rests with Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — neither of whom has given final sign-off. American officials have grown frustrated that progress toward a deal appears stalled, despite what they say are only narrow differences between the two sides on paper. The recent assassination of a top Hamas leader in Tehran, believed to be conducted by the Israelis, further hampered progress toward an agreement. That has left the US with diminishing options for bringing the humanitarian crisis to an end, despite the potential political fallout for Harris in November. Pro-Palestinian protesters have pressed for the United States to wield pressure on Israel using arms sales and other assistance as leverage — decisions that, for now, are not Harris’ to make. While Biden has said he would withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, he has so far stopped short of major steps that would cut off American assistance to its ally. “She’s Joe Biden’s vice president and right now, national security is being run out of the White House,” said Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who attended Harris’ rally in Detroit on Wednesday and who has been outspoken about the necessity of addressing the Gaza issue head-on in her state. “I think they want to see and understand that she cares, and what the Middle East strategy is going to be. And she is walking a very delicate line there. But I do believe that her understanding of this community and reach-out is critical,” Dingell told Kasie Hunt on “CNN This Morning.” Biden has included Harris from the beginning in his dealings with Netanyahu, and she was present this week in the White House Situation Room for a meeting of top national security officials to discuss escalating Middle East tensions. In substance, her positions have not been at odds with Biden’s. Behind the scenes, however, she has advocated for a more empathetic approach to the Palestinians and in public has sometimes struck a more forceful tone than Biden when discussing the situation in Gaza. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said last month after meeting Netanyahu in Washington. When she briefly spoke with Harris on Wednesday, Elabed broke down in tears and said, “Michigan voters want to support you, but we need a policy that will save lives in Gaza right now. I meet with community members every day in Michigan who are losing tens and hundreds of family members in Gaza. Right now, we need an arms embargo.” The uncommitted movement has requested a meeting with Harris about their policy demands, as well as speaking time at the Democratic National Convention and language in the party platform supportive of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. The Listen to Michigan campaign launched an effort to urge Democrats to vote “uncommitted” in the state’s Democratic presidential primary. The effort mobilized more than 100,0000 people to cast “uncommitted” votes and won more than 57% of the vote in Dearborn, home to large Arab American and Muslim communities, to Biden’s 40%. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud told CNN last week that he and other leaders in the Uncommitted movement were eager to hear more from Harris and cautiously optimistic with her at the top of the Democratic ticket. “I’m hopeful that Vice President Harris will chart a new course,” Hammoud said. “I think if she’s able to chart a new course, there can be a meaningful conversation about what happened to the broader uncommitted movement come November.” Assad Turfe, the chief deputy county executive of Wayne County who supported the uncommitted movement during Biden’s candidacy, told CNN Thursday he is now endorsing Harris, saying she “represents the true spirit of our nation and values.” “As someone who has been closely monitoring the war in Gaza, I firmly believe we need a permanent ceasefire now. When making decisions, I rely on the information available, and right now, Vice President Harris gives us the best chance of achieving peace in that region moving forward,” Turfe said in a statement to CNN. “Moreover, she provides communities of color with the best opportunities for creating success here in America.”"
Trump team targets Walz and his military record in attempt to slow down Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:26 AM EDT, Thu August 8, 2024",2024-08-08T04:00:02.490Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/politics/harris-vance-midwest-trump-analysis/index.html,"It was the first big day of the wrestle for the Midwest that is likely to decide the 2024 election, and someone important was missing — former President Donald Trump. But the Trump campaign is now on offense, with its vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance leading an attack on the military record and credibility of Vice President Kamala Harris’s new running mate Tim Walz. The focus on the Minnesota governor and claims that he sidestepped a deployment to Iraq by retiring from the Army National Guard to run for Congress in 2005 represented a searing welcome to the hard knuckle reality of a major national campaign against opponents for whom no issue is off limits. The Republican nominee left it to Vance to troll the newly minted Democratic ticket through the critical swing state territory Wednesday as a fresh 90-day race for the White House burst into life. Harris and Walz held two high-energy rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan that showed the euphoria inside a once-despairing Democratic Party for its two new candidates. The Democratic nominee borrowed a trick from Trump’s playbook, performing a dramatic arrival scene aboard Air Force Two in Michigan that mirrored his past use of the bigger presidential jet before a packed airport rally. For the second day in a row, Harris appeared before thousands of excited supporters who spelled out a collective warning sign for Trump — who is known to obsess over crowd sizes. She appeared to be quickly settling into her novel role as her party’s official candidate, displaying flashes of charisma and increasing confidence as her political honeymoon showed no signs of ending. In one moment that delighted her supporters, Harris icily stared down hecklers in Detroit who chanted what appeared to be a pro-Palestinian message. “You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that, otherwise, I’m speaking,” Harris said. It was a micro episode, but the video of the put-down quickly went viral on social media in a way that enhanced the vice president’s image as she navigated one of the many challenges she’s going to face in the next three months. Trump’s team, meanwhile, tipped its hand on how it plans to halt Harris’ momentum and discredit her new sidekick, whom she delights in highlighting as a coach, a veteran and an archetypal Midwestern dad. The former president has struggled to find a way to respond to the sudden change in his opponent after President Joe Biden bowed to Democratic fears that he was too old to serve a second term. Trump’s claims that Harris is not really Black and his deliberate mangling of her name in juvenile social media posts as “Kamabla” only underscore how he seems adrift. The Republican nominee will make a new attempt to reset the narrative of the race and to interrupt Harris’ strong start on Thursday. He said on Truth Social that he’ll hold a press conference at Mar-A-Lago at 2 p.m. ET. Trump on Wednesday called into his safe space on Fox News from his Florida club to claim he was “thrilled” that Harris had chosen Walz, billing the Democratic team as radical and too far left for America. “This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner,” Trump said. His attacks, however, were mostly unfocused and of only limited effectiveness as he again failed to spell out a clear and concise case against his rival. Vance was more forensic. In Eau Claire, Wisconsin, he held an event that was much smaller than Harris’ outdoor rally but that directly addressed key economic concerns that preoccupy voters in the region, including high prices, the cost of housing and energy and food. “I know that we can do better. We were doing better when Donald J. Trump was president,” Vance said. In a new rhetorical twist, he all but ignored Biden and kept referring to the “Harris administration,” implying the vice president was the real power in the White House. Harris showed in the same western Wisconsin city that she understands that the economic issues that bedeviled the Biden administration, despite a strong post-Covid-19 rebound, are a huge concern. “We will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable health care, affordable childcare and paid leave,” she told the crowd. “While our economy is doing well, by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it.” In another front of its emerging offensive against Harris, the Trump campaign cranked up pressure on the vice president to do a major media interview, apparently hoping to goad her into a forum in which she’s historically been more vulnerable than when delivering scripted speeches. “I think it’s really disgraceful, both for Kamala Harris but also for a lot of the American media that participates in this stuff, to have a person who has been the presumptive nominee of the Democrat Party for 17 days and refuses to take a single question from the American media,” Vance said in Wisconsin. In this light, Trump’s pledge to hold a news conference on Thursday looks like an attempt to create a contrast with the vice president. Harris, especially early in her vice presidency, sometimes waffled in interviews and unscripted moments, and the Trump campaign clearly sees this as a potential way to slow her strong start. But with the Democratic National Convention looming in less than two weeks, there seems little incentive yet for the Harris camp to take any risks, especially since Democrats can argue for now at least that the vice president has been spending her time frantically building a new campaign and hurriedly seeking a running mate. But such a position will be hardly sustainable in the longer term, and Harris will come under pressure to demonstrate she’s qualified to serve as president – especially amid increasing challenges to American power abroad. The way that Vance is pursuing the vice president through the nation’s most contested political real estate was illustrated in one rather odd moment on Wednesday. As he arrived in Wisconsin and saw Air Force Two on the tarmac, he walked toward the plane in what he later said was an attempt to talk to the vice president. “I just wanted to check out my future plane,” he said. There was another sign on Wednesday of the shifting political sands underneath the campaign. Days after saying he’d refuse to take part in a previously arranged presidential debate on ABC and demanding that Harris meet him on Fox, the ex-president showed new openness to a one-on-one clash. “We’ll be debating her, I guess, in the pretty near future. It’s going to be announced fairly soon, but we’ll be debating her,” he said in his Fox interview, leaving open the possibility it could happen on a different network. “I’d do it right now, because I want to debate her. I think it’s important for the country that we debate,” he said. After trying to dictate terms for a showdown on the conservative news channel, Trump then added, “I think Fox would do a really good job, but two people have to agree.” Harris seems to see Walz as a priceless asset in courting voters outside traditional Democratic areas. “Isn’t he amazing?” Harris asked another fired up crowd in Detroit on Wednesday night. Her campaign, meanwhile, released a memo from its battleground states director, Dan Kanninen, that foretold the coming fight over swing states. “We … are competing everywhere because we know we need to narrow the margins in rural areas to win,” the memo said. Kanninen argued that Walz was ideally positioned to lead the quest for these voters, pointing out that he had “represented a Republican district in southern Minnesota for 6 terms in Congress” and had historically outperformed national Democrats in his House district, including in areas that supported Trump. This, the memo said, offered a “blueprint for how to cut margins in rural areas across the country.” But the Trump campaign is trying to make Walz a liability for the vice president. It spent all day seeking to make him out to be a political extremist antithetical to the American middle ground on crime, immigration and social policies. Trump’s allies, for example, are calling attention to a new Minnesota law requiring public schools to stock menstrual products in both their girls and boys bathrooms in an effort to paint Walz as a far-left liberal for accommodating transgender students. And Republicans have been focused on his handling of the unrest in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd, accusing him of waiting too long to call in the state National Guard. Trump, however, praised Walz’s response in a 2020 call with governors, undercutting some of those lines of attack. And Vance stepped up his attacks on Walz’s portrayal of his military career, accusing him of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005. “When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I’m very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,” Vance said. Walz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, retiring in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It’s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement. A National Guard article on his unit’s deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005 – two months after Walz retired. Vance served four years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal. The Ohio Republican also accused Walz of falsely claiming he had served in a combat zone, pointing to the governor’s comments about supporting an assault weapons ban. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” the governor said in a video promoted by the Harris campaign. Walz deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service. The spectacle of one military veteran sparring over the service of another was a sign of the bitter political struggle to come in an election that holds huge implications for the country. To that point, Biden issued a fresh warning about Trump’s potential threats to democracy, in an intervention into a campaign in which he was once a central figure but is now marginalized. The president, in his first interview since ending his reelection bid, told CBS News that he doesn’t have confidence that there’ll be a peaceful transition of power if Trump loses in November. “I mean, if Trump loses, I’m not confident at all. He means what he says,” Biden said."

The sun rises later and sets earlier on the streets of FiDi, and the TikTokers looking for a man in finance (trust fund, six-five, blue eyes) have moved on to pommel horse nerds and Tim Walz’s big dad energy. It’s perhaps fitting, then, that Wall Street’s fleeting moment in the meme zeitgeist comes to a close just as the investing crowd is getting thoroughly put in its place by Certified Nerdy Dad and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Hayden Powell. Here’s the deal: On Monday, as global stock market turmoil spilled over into the US, investors were crying out for the central bank to do something drastic, something it hasn’t done since the start of the pandemic in 2020 — call an emergency meeting to slash interest rates and stanch the bleeding on Wall Street. Powell’s response was a classic dad move: Ignore the screaming toddler and let the tantrum run its course. The whole episode underscored a fundamental tension between the Fed, which is focused on economic stability, and Wall Street, which is focused on profit. The two institutions need each other. They’re part of a big family that keeps commerce flowing in the world’s largest economy. And, like most families, they rarely agree on what to do, and they sometimes hate each other. Stock traders and analysts aren’t shy about complaining when the Fed isn’t moving on their preferred timeline. The Fed, for its part, stays largely out of the muck of name-calling. But Powell, in particular, has a knack for the sarcastic retort. Last week, he told reporters (more or less) that the pundits can shout all they want on CNBC and it won’t matter one lick to the grown-ups making policy at the Fed. “We follow the many commentators who bless us with their commentary,” he said. “But we don’t change anything in our approach.” (That’s what counts as a scathing critique in Powell’s buttoned-up briefing room.) The message from Powell and other policymakers is clear: We won’t be strong-armed by Wall Street. It’s not surprising coming from Powell, an avowed Paul Volcker fanboy who has praised the former Fed boss’s unflinching approach to fighting inflation (even when it meant triggering two recessions). Powell’s stance is a stark contrast with the scene playing out in Japan. In short: The Japanese central bank last week raised interest rates for only the second time in 17 years, and its top policy official rattled investors by hinting at more to come. A week and one giant stock market correction later, the Bank of Japan sent out another official to walk back those comments and try to calm investors. The BOJ’s deputy governor, Shinichi Uchida, citing volatility in financial markets, said the bank would not raise its policy interest rate as long as markets remain unstable. And just like that, Japanese stocks surged. Parents of all stripes know the hazards of rewarding bad behavior. In the BOJ’s case, Uchida’s comments illustrate a problem central banks have found themselves in for the past two decades, according to economist Mohamed El-Erian. Writing for Bloomberg on Wednesday, he wrote that central banks have repeatedly “attempted to take the difficult but necessary steps to deal with economic and financial imbalances, only to fold under market pressure … The pause that the BoJ felt forced to adopt is likely to eventually conflict with the country’s economic well-being,” El-Erian says. Powell (formerly in finance, hazel eyes, great ties) appears to have a real opportunity to Volcker it up even more in the coming weeks.

"August 7, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-07T12:10:45.154Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kamala-harris-trump-election-08-07-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.  Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.  Walz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race. Walz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It’s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.  In a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.  The Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.  This post was updated with excerpts from a 2009 interview with Tim Walz. Vice President Kamala Harris saw – and heard – at least a flavor of the challenges facing her candidacy in Michigan. Her Wednesday evening remarks in Detroit were interrupted by a small group of about half a dozen protestors who persistently chanted what appeared to be a pro-Palestinian message. “Because we believe in democracy, everyone’s voice matters, but I am speaking now,” she responded, repeating a refrain she has previously used at events in response to protesters. She then tried to talk over the protests as the crowd chanted: “Kamala! Kamala!” While railing against her rival’s agenda, Harris said, “if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” After a few minutes, the protesters were led out of the venue, where thousands had gathered to see Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. This is the latest reminder of the challenges facing Harris in Michigan. Her rally tonight is about 15 minutes from Dearborn, home to one of the largest Muslim and Arab-American communities in the country. Organizers of the uncommitted movement said at a press conference earlier in the day that there were no plans currently underway for a meeting with Harris while she’s in Michigan. Vice President Kamala Harris is capitalizing on the trappings of office — and the power of imagery — at a rally tonight in Detroit that her advisers say is the largest of the campaign so far. Air Force Two slowly pulled into view of a crowded airport hanger, with strains of Beyoncé’s “Run the World” filling the air. Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stepped off the plane to the song of “Freedom.” For Democrats, it was a level of enthusiasm not seen for years at campaign rallies. It was, in fact, taking a page out of Donald Trump’s playbook, particularly by using the magnificence of Air Force Two as a backdrop. The former president held countless rallies across the country using (a slightly larger) Air Force One. To pull off this picture-perfect moment on an August day took the sweating sacrifice of thousands of supporters, many of whom had been waiting for more than six hours by the time Harris arrived. Several people fainted or passed out, with chants of “medic, medic” sounding throughout the evening. A few moments after Harris took the stage, another fan fell. “We need a medic,” Harris said. “Let’s all take care of each other.” Campaign staffers rushed to pass out water and snacks as the political speeches wore on. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized her plans to help the middle class if she is elected to the White House — contrasting her vision with the policies of former President Donald Trump. Attacking Trump, Harris said the former president “intends to take our nation backward” and hurt the middle class with policies like those outlined in Project 2025. Trump has made clear he wants little to do with the conservative blueprint and has said he doesn’t know who is behind it. But, six of his former Cabinet secretaries helped write or collaborated on the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation.  Harris also argued that if Trump is elected he will give tax breaks to big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. “Unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first,” she said. “When the middle class is strong, America is strong.” Vice President Kamala Harris said her campaign is “not just about us versus Donald Trump.” She said her campaign’s vision is focused on the future, and accused Trump’s of focusing on the past. Harris went on to promise rights for labor unions, retirement for senior citizens and affordable housing and childcare as well as affordable healthcare. “We fight for the future,” Harris said, with the audience later chanting “we’re not going back.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer welcomed fellow midwestern Gov. Tim Walz to Detroit on Wednesday, praising Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate selection during the Democratic ticket’s first joint rally in Michigan. In addition to Walz being a fellow governor in the Great Lakes region and a “good Midwesterner,” Whitmer said “Tim and I get along because we both lead according to a three part strategy — get sh*t done.” The Michigan Democrat said Walz has been an “incredibly successful governor,” in large part because he “works across the aisle to build consensus,” and noted the Minnesota Democrat’s achievements in passing infrastructure legislation, cutting taxes, providing free school lunches and protecting public safety. “A lot of that sounds familiar. It’s because Tim and I have been trying to outdo one another on all these fronts for the last couple of years,” she joked. Whitmer repeatedly ruled herself out of Harris’ recent running mate search, saying she intends to serve out her term through 2026.  She and Walz, along with fellow Midwestern Govs. Tony Evers of Wisconsin and JB Pritzker of Illinois, issued endorsements for Harris nearly in unison the day after President Joe Biden exited the race, in a signal of Democratic support for Harris in the “blue wall” of the upper Midwest. “We need a strong woman in the White House, and it’s about damn time. And a good man by her side in vice president Tim Walz,” Whitmer said. Democratic vice presidential pick Gov. Tim Walz argued that the upcoming election in November is about determining the direction of the country. “This election is about what direction this country’s going to go in,” he said at a rally in Michigan, adding that Donald Trump would pull the country backward. Walz claimed Trump knows what Project 2025 is and what it will do. The former president has denied that he had anything to do with the plan and said he didn’t know who was behind it. He also argued that if given another term, Trump would do things like “rig the economy for the ultra-wealthy” and ban abortion. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says the students he taught while he was a football coach and social studies teacher encouraged him to run for office. “I never thought much about it,” Walz said referring to the idea of running for Congress. “They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them, a commitment to the common good.” Speaking at a rally in Michigan Wednesday, Walz said that while working in Congress, he learned how to “compromise without compromising my values,” and “how to work across the aisle to get good things done for people.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz is back on the campaign trail Wednesday, pitching Vice President Kamala Harris as the next president. The newly-minted running mate was speaking ahead of Harris in Detroit. Walz drew a comparison between Harris and Donald Trump, saying the former president and his running mate, JD Vance, “tried to steal the joy from this country.” “Our next president brings the joy, she emanates the joy,” he said, before talking about his upbringing in a small Nebraska town. “I know a little bit something about that commitment to people,” he said, referring to what he said was Harris’ commitment to Americans. Earlier on Wednesday, Harris and Walz were greeted by cheers from the crowd on the tarmac in Michigan as they stepped off Air Force Two. They traveled to Michigan after a campaign stop in Wisconsin earlier in the day. It’s all part of a blitz around battleground states as candidates on both sides sprint to Election Day. In the first few minutes of his speech in Michigan, Walz called for a medic to come help someone in the crowd. He spotted the person and asked for someone to give them water. “Thank you for caring for your neighbors. Thank you for showing them what Michigan does,” he said before continuing. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain praised Vice President Kamala Harris’s selection of Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate during the Democratic ticket’s joint campaign rally in Michigan on Wednesday, hailing the newly minted ticket as a “Democratic dynamic duo.” He acknowledged on Wednesday that his union was “loud” in advocating for Walz to be on the ticket, telling the crowd of thousands of Michigan voters, including several UAW members, “he’s one of us.” “A working-class guy with working-class values. He’s a teacher, a coach, a governor. He’s a proud union member. And he has always put the working class first,” he said. He praised Harris’s record, saying, “You know where Kamala Harris was during the GM strike in 2019? On the picket line standing shoulder-to-shoulder with autoworkers.” The UAW International Executive Board voted to formally endorse Harris’ candidacy at the end of last month. Meanwhile, Fain sharply criticized former President Donald Trump, whom he has a history of trading barbs with, proclaiming, “Every time Donald Trump gets a chance, he trashes our union and he trashes the working class. He comes to Michigan … he talks about how he’s going to bring back the auto industry. Let me tell you something, Donald Trump doesn’t know sh*t about the auto industry.” Fain criticized Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, with characteristically sharp language, calling the former president “a scab” and the Ohio senator “a vulture.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. qualified for the ballot in New Jersey on Wednesday, the New Jersey Secretary of State ruled, after defeating a challenge to his ballot petition from a local elections attorney. New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way ruled on Wednesday to accept Kennedy’s ballot access petition, rejecting a challenge from attorney Scott Salmon arguing Kennedy violated the state’s “Sore Loser Law,” which prevents candidates who ran for office in a primary from seeking that same office in a general election as an independent candidate.  In the ruling, Way said she believed the Sore Loser Law was inapplicable to Kennedy’s petition because Kennedy — who initially launched his presidential campaign as a Democrat seeking to challenge President Joe Biden in the primary — did not file a ballot petition for the state’s primary or conduct a write-in campaign in the state. Way wrote that in siding against Salmon, she would accept Kennedy’s nominating petition to appear on November’s ballot in New Jersey. In a statement to CNN, Salmon said his challenge of Kennedy’s petition helped clarify the limits of the Sore Loser Law in the state, which will benefit his work in future election cases. Including New Jersey, Kennedy qualified for the ballot in 15 states and is eligible to receive 172 electoral college votes. Republicans are attacking Tim Walz’s response to unrest in Minneapolis in 2020, but at the time, then-President Donald Trump said he “fully” agreed with how the Minnesota governor handled rioting in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, undercutting a key line of GOP attack this week after Walz was named Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate. The call was led by Trump, who was joined by then-Attorney General Bill Barr, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and included a series of governors as protests across the country, some of which devolved into violent rioting, were breaking out following the police killing of Floyd on May 25. Details from the call, during which Trump implored governors across the country to “dominate” protesters, have previously been reported, and CNN published the call’s full transcript the day it happened in 2020. It’s not uncommon for even the most bitter of political rivals to offer tempered praise toward one another in the aftermath of a natural disaster or serious nationwide crisis – especially ones that require cooperation in responses between state and federal governments.  But more than four years later, Trump’s praise for Walz takes on new meaning as the GOP nominee and his allies have sought to jolt Americans’ memories of the nationwide unrest that summer, linking Walz to pictures of Minneapolis engulfed in flames and the aftermath of the destruction. Read more. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz visited the Harris campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, where he rallied staffers working on the campaign that he recently joined and thanked them for their work. Walz urged aides to “feel that excitement” and promised “we’re gonna win this” in a video posted to his social media. While shaking hands with one staffer, who yelled “let’s do this,” Walz said “we’re doing it, it’s on.” The video features campaign staff chanting “let’s go coach,” a nod to his previous work as a high school football coach. In another nod to his past, Walz likened the campaign to high school football, telling one staffer in the video that “it’s Friday night lights.” President Joe Biden has tasked his team with coming up with an agenda for his final six months in office, defining key priorities for the administration as he looks to secure a one-term legacy – including a robust schedule on the world stage. On a call with political appointees across agencies Wednesday afternoon, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients laid out four main pillars for Biden’s team to execute in a lame duck period, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. The four pillars include: On the fourth point, national security adviser Jake Sullivan suggested Biden would keep a busy schedule: “You can expect to see very busy months of activity, of summits and trips to ensure that we do everything we can to leave it on the field,” Sullivan said, adding that there would be “high-level summits both here and abroad.” But before that, Sullivan said Biden’s most urgent priority “is to avoid escalation into a larger war in the Middle East and to deliver the ceasefire and hostage deal that he’s worked so hard to deliver.” Zients told the team that Biden encouraged his top lieutenants to form a plan “to finish as strong as we started” on the Sunday that he announced he would not seek a second term. Vice President Kamala Harris quieted chants from audience members at her rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Wednesday calling on former President Donald Trump to be jailed by saying “the courts are going to handle that part” and insisting Democrats focus on defeating Trump in November’s election. Harris outlined her record as a prosecutor and district attorney in California, and contrasted it with Trump’s legal troubles, including being found guilty on felony charges of falsifying business records and losing a civil suit to E. Jean Carroll, who accused her of sexual assault. “I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said, prompting loud cheers from the audience. “In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like that my whole career.” As the cheers died down, some audience members could be heard chanting “lock him up.” In response, Harris interrupted the chants to clarify that she’s focused on defeating Trump in the upcoming election and insisted Trump’s legal troubles be handled independently.   Some context: The Wisconsin rally is not the first time Democratic voters have chanted “lock him up” at campaign rallies. Hundreds of voters joined in the chant during the Harris rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The chant is an inversion of the pledge Trump made during his 2016 presidential campaign to put then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in jail, which was embraced by supporters at his rallies. Vice President Kamala Harris introduced her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to Wisconsin voters at a rally in Eau Claire on Wednesday, playing up his Midwestern roots and stressing the importance of Wisconsin in Democrats’ path to victory.  Addressing a crowd of thousands at an outdoor venue on the outskirts of the small Wisconsin town, Harris and Walz both strongly attacked former President Donald Trump while presenting a contrast between their values and those of the Republican ticket. Walz spoke ahead of Harris and highlighted his roots in nearby Minnesota, his record of working with Republicans as a member of Congress and his military service, noting “I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.” “Are there Minnesotans in the house today?” Walz asked, prompting a sizable cheer. Walz jokingly boasted to the Eau Claire crowd that he knew how to pronounce the name of the town, a quip some locals in the audience responded to with applause.  Harris similarly laid out Walz’s ties to the Midwest, while often referring to him as “coach,” a nod to his past as a high school football coach. In response, the crowd chanted “coach.” Minutes later, the crowd chanted “VP Walz” after Harris referred to Walz as “the next vice president.” She also made clear the importance of Wisconsin in the Democrats’ path to victory in November. The highly enthusiastic crowd maintained energy throughout the afternoon, buoyed by a performance from native Eau Claire band Bon Iver. The crowd regularly broke out in spontaneous cheers egging on her remarks.  Donald Trump’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance said he would debate Vice President Kamala Harris if she wanted to next week, despite Vance being the bottom of the GOP ticket and Harris being the top of the Democratic ticket.   At a campaign event in Wisconsin, Vance also falsely suggested Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz weren’t already the Democratic nominees for president and vice president and that there could be different people in those roles. The DNC announced on Tuesday that Harris and Walz have officially been certified as the Democratic Party’s nominees for president and vice president.  “But look, if Kamala Harris wants to honor her commitment and debate on August 13, let’s do it. I’m all game,” Vance said. Harris had previously accepted CBS’ offer to participate in a vice-presidential debate on August 13 before President Joe Biden suspended his campaign and endorsed Harris for president.  Harris is now saying she will honor the commitment Biden made to debate former President Donald Trump in September at a debate hosted by ABC News, but Trump has since backed out of that debate and is trying to propose a new debate hosted by Fox News. Harris has not agreed to the new debate hosted by Fox.  President Joe Biden said Wednesday he doesn’t have confidence there will be a peaceful transition of power if former President Donald Trump loses in November. He pointed to comments from the Republican nominee suggesting the only way he’d lose is if the election is stolen from him. Earlier this year, Trump warned that if he lost the 2024 election it would be a “bloodbath” for the US auto industry and the country — comments Biden and his campaign quickly leapt on, claiming the former president was inciting political violence. Biden also warned that Trump was preparing to challenge the election results again in November as he did in 2020, including by putting in place sympathetic local election officials. The full Biden interview is expected to air on CBS Sunday morning. Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War combat veteran, on Wednesday defended Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz against JD Vance’s accusations that Walz had engaged in “stolen valor” and ducked service in Iraq. “Stolen valor is very, very serious charge. The vice presidential nominee, someone who I served with, someone who is a veteran, and was the highest ranking … Army-enlisted man to ever serve in Congress, has never claimed anything of that nature,” Gallego told reporters. Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who was deployed to Iraq in 2005, said, “You know, war is tough. I had some men that decided not to go to war. They had the option. They decided not to take it, and you know, for a lot of them, I don’t blame them.” “Gov. Walz served his country honorably. And without a doubt, you know he would be an asset as vice president, especially with veterans,” he said. Walz had left the Army National Guard after 24 years and ran for Congress in 2005, retiring two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. Gallego, who had pushed for Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly to be Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pick, acknowledged that he was “disappointed” Kelly wasn’t selected, but said Walz would be able to represent the working class of the military community and is “still a great pick.”  Organizers for the uncommitted movement said Wednesday that a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris while she is in Michigan is not currently in the works. Asked by CNN if there had been any specific engagement with Harris’ team related to her trip to Detroit, Abbas Alawieh, a delegate for the movement at the Democratic National Convention, said he couldn’t speak to details of engagement. Pressed on if there is a meeting in the works for Thursday, Alawieh responded, “no, there’s no meeting in the works for tomorrow.” Harris will arrive in Michigan later on Wednesday to hold a rally in Detroit with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. She’s scheduled to hold another campaign event in the state on Thursday. Alawieh and other members of the uncommitted movement have said that since Harris became the party’s presumptive nominee, they have been encouraged by “initial signals” by Harris’ team and others in the party to an “openness” to engage on their demands. The group has requested a meeting with Harris, as well as speaking time at the Democratic National Convention and language in the party platform supportive of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. Making the group’s request clear, Alawieh said “if Vice President Harris embraces an arms embargo, we will drop everything we’re doing, endorse Vice President Harris and make sure that we proactively encourage the voters who have believed in this movement to vote for Vice President Harris.” Supporters of former President Donald Trump are calling attention to a new Minnesota law requiring public schools to stock menstrual products in both their girls and boys bathrooms in an effort to paint Gov. Tim Walz as a far-left liberal for accommodating transgender students. Walz, whom Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Tuesday as her running mate, signed the bill into law last year. It took effect January 1 and mandates that school districts and charter schools provide free menstrual products in all restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. The measure has led some in the Trump camp to label Walz “Tampon Tim.” In a state House committee hearing last year, the bill’s sponsor, state Democratic Rep. Sandra Feist, urged her fellow lawmakers to reject an amendment from a Republican colleague that would have inserted the word “female” in the bill. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, called Walz a “radical” on Fox News Tuesday, adding that his support for such policies is dangerous for women’s health. “As a woman, I think there is no greater threat to our health than leaders who support gender-transition surgeries for young minors, who support putting tampons in men’s bathrooms in public schools,” Leavitt said. “Those are radical policies that Tim Walz supports. He actually signed a bill to do that.”  The online brouhaha led Hillary Clinton, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign, to clap back, posting on X: “How nice of the Trump camp to help publicize Gov. Tim Walz’s compassionate and common-sense policy of providing free menstrual products to students in Minnesota public schools! Let’s do this everywhere.” Clinton included an image of Walz’s face on a tampon box that was posted on X by Chaya Raichik, who created the far-right site “Libs of TikTok.” Walz has taken several steps to protect transgender Minnesotans. Last year, he signed an executive order that directed Minnesota agencies to do whatever they could to protect and support Minnesotans seeking gender-affirming health care services. He also signed “trans refuge” legislation that safeguarded access to such care and another law that banned conversion therapy, a discredited practice that aims to change someone’s understanding of their gender identity or sexual orientation. –CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this story. The White House pushed back against comments from Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, engaged in “stolen valor” by touting his military service. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday that Walz’s “record speaks for itself.”  Earlier Wednesday, Vance stepped up his attacks on Walz’s portrayal of his military career, accusing him without evidence of ducking service to Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005.  The attacks on Walz’s military record are part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor after he was tapped Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Walz’s 24-year military service is one of several facets of his background that appeal to voters that the Harris campaign is trying to reach with his selection. Some more context: CNN’s Jeremy Herb and Haley Britzky reported that Walz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Typically, service members need to submit papers several months before they can retire. A National Guard article on his unit’s deployment states that they received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz said that as a Minnesotan, he doesn’t “shy away from challenges.” He said the former president “weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that’s to say nothing of the job he did as president.” Walz also went on to criticize Trump’s record on the economy, health care and education. “I don’t need you telling me about our health care. I don’t need you telling us who we love. And I sure as hell don’t need you telling us what books we’re going to read,” he said to an animated crowd. Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday — key states on the path to the presidency. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also held events in both states today, underscoring the importance of reaching voters there. Harris is expected to be back in Michigan tomorrow. Donald Trump won both of those states eight years ago but they have vexed Republicans ever since. Along with Pennsylvania, Trump’s stunning 2016 victories in Michigan and Wisconsin produced a seismic crack in the so-called blue wall of states Democrats had relied on in every election going back to 1992. Trump’s particular success with blue-collar voters gave Republicans optimism for a political realignment that could turn the Rust Belt red for the foreseeable future. Instead, Republicans have struggled to replicate Trump’s initial success in subsequent elections, including in 2020 when Biden narrowly won all three states en route to victory. Democrats in that time also took over the governors’ offices in Michigan and Wisconsin and flipped a Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022 which proved crucial to maintaining control of the chamber. In both states, efforts to subvert the 2020 election — including by enlisting fake electors — have also roiled Republican politics, at times aided by Trump.  Still, gone are the days when Democrats could comfortably count on these states to deliver in national elections. Biden won Michigan in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes. The margin was much tighter in Wisconsin, where he came out ahead by about 21,000 votes — a victory of about 0.7 percentage points. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said he doesn’t plan on calling Vice President Kamala Harris as “Kamabla,” like former President Donald Trump has in multiple recent social media posts.  “Look, I think obviously the president loves to give people nicknames and I think that he’s going to keep on doing that. I would be shocked if it’s the last nickname he gives her before the end of the election,” Vance said in response to a question from CNN as he spoke to reporters on the tarmac next to his plane. Vance also reacted to Harris’ campaign raising $36 million in the 24 hours since Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.  “Obviously, Democrats are going to raise a lot of money because they stand up for Wall Street, they stand up for the big banks, and I’m not shocked you’re going to have a lot of big money donors coming in for the Kamala Harris campaign. She was their preferred candidate,” Vance said.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz opened up a campaign event Wednesday in swing state Wisconsin by acknowledging Gov. Tony Evers, who he called “the kindest human being,” as well as the state attorney general Josh Kaul and state superintendent Jill Underly. He went on to thank those attending the event in Eau Claire, noting that they came “for one beautiful simple reason: You love this country and this democracy.” Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him back on Tuesday evening and left him a voicemail, but the two men have not spoken yet. “It was just a, ‘Hey, thanks for calling, appreciate it, look forward to the debate,’ etcetera,” Vance said when asked what Walz said in his voicemail. Vance was asked whether holding campaign events in the same cities as Vice President Kamala Harris this week was an effective strategy. Vance held an event on Tuesday in Philadelphia ahead of Harris’ event in the city and, on Wednesday, Harris and Vance both had events scheduled in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Vance said one factor his team considered was that local media was going to cover Harris’ trip and that they were looking to have a “counter-narrative.” Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance slammed Vice President Kamala Harris in remarks in Wisconsin on Wednesday. Vance mentioned that he exited his plane and walked straight over to Air Force Two, which had landed at the same airport just a few minutes before, earlier in the day. Both Vance and Harris are holding rallies in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, today. Vance also said he wants to make more things in America, including energy and food. His remarks are taking place at Wollard International, which manufactures both military and commercial belt loaders and tow tractors, as well as other airline equipment. His wife, Usha Vance, was also in attendance. Kamala Harris’ campaign is highlighting its organization in the so-called “Blue Wall” states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan that will be key to its electoral map in November, pointing to Harris’ new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as an asset in rural areas of these states.  As Harris and Walz continue their battleground blitz in Wisconsin on Wednesday, the campaign pointed to its growing infrastructure, including more than 600 coordinated staff across those three critical states, with another 150 staffers joining in the coming weeks, Harris-Walz battleground states director Dan Kanninen said in a memo Wednesday.  By the numbers:  And as voters get to know Walz, Kanninen pointed to his record and biography: “As a governor, congressman, football coach, veteran, and high school teacher, Walz has championed working families his entire life,” he said, echoing Harris’ introduction in Philadelphia.  Kanninen highlighted Walz’s experience as a congressman from a red district and specifically noted that he “consistently outperformed national Democrats in his House district, including in counties that have supported Trump, offering a blueprint for how to cut margins in rural areas across the country.” He suggested that the campaign will focus Walz’s time and efforts in messaging to rural voters: “Our campaign will continue to go everywhere, and Governor Walz will be a key messenger in these rural areas where we’re focused on limiting Republicans’ margins.” Donald Trump’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance stepped up his attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s portrayal of his military career, accusing him without of evidence of ducking service to Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005.  While Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq, the attacks on Walz’s military record are part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor after he was tapped Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Walz’s 24-year military service is one of several facets of his background that appeal to voters that the Harris campaign is trying to reach with his selection — and that Republicans are trying to blunt by painting him as an out-of-touch liberal.  Walz and Vance, the two VP candidates who are likely to square off in a debate this fall, are both military veterans, unlike their running mates. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.  At a campaign stop in Michigan Wednesday, Vance accused Walz of abandoning his unit before they deployed to Iraq in 2006.  “When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably and I’m very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,” Vance said.  Walz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Typically, service members need to submit papers several months before they can retire.  A National Guard article on his unit’s deployment states that they received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit’s history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.  Walz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. Keep reading about Vance’s attacks against Walz’s military record. After touching down in Wisconsin for a campaign event, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance exited his plane and walked straight over to Air Force Two, which had landed at the same airport just a few minutes before.  Vance returned after several minutes and talked to reporters gathered near his aircraft.  “I just wanted to check out my future plane,” Vance said.  The senator said he did not speak to Vice President Kamala Harris.  Both Harris and Vance are holding campaign events this afternoon in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. A CNN Poll of Polls average of national polling finds a close general election race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Trump currently holds 49% support in the average of five recent polls testing the matchup, while Harris holds 48%. The latest Poll of Polls includes an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released Tuesday that also finds no clear leader in a head-to-head matchup between the candidates, with Harris taking 51% and Trump taking 48% among registered voters nationally. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll finds that Americans trust Harris over Trump to handle the issue of abortion (56% say Harris would do a better job, compared with 41% Trump) and the preservation of democracy (53% say Harris, 46% Trump). Americans prefer Trump on immigration (52% say Trump would better handle the issue, 46% Harris), with a closer split on who would better handle the economy (51% say Trump would be better, 48% Harris). More about the poll: The CNN Poll of Polls includes the five most recent national polls measuring the views of registered or likely voters in a 2024 presidential general election between Harris and Trump. Less than hour before Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are set to speak at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, supporters eagerly gathered to see the new Democratic ticket’s first appearance in the key battleground state. As hundreds of Harris supporters braved the heat at an outdoor venue in Eau Claire, staff passed out waters to attendees. But spirits remained high in anticipation of their first glimpse of Walz since he joined the ticket. “I’m just really pumped for education. I am pumped that Tim Walz is on the ticket as a former educator. We just need to do great things for our kids. Get them reading, get them educated, all the things,” a voter told CNN. The audience regularly erupted in cheers as staff gave timing updates. At one point, an eagle flew over the crowd, prompting loud cheers from those gathered. Outside the venue, a line of cars entering the event stretched over half a mile outside the venue.  The remarks are expected to begin around 1:20 p.m. CT (2:20 p.m. ET). CNN’s Kimberly Berryman and Eva McKend contributed reporting to this post. Standing in the shadow of Dr. Martin Luther King’s grave, African American church leaders said their congregations are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket.   Nearly a dozen faith leaders were at the news conference that took place at Dr. Martin Luther King National Park in Atlanta’s historic Sweet Auburn neighborhood.   “We are standing here today because democracy delivered us, democracy has been our deliverer, and in Donald Trump’s America democracy is not a threat to us — democracy is a threat for him,” Rev. Shanan Jones, who also preached at Ebenezer and is now the President of Concerned Black Clergy of Metropolitan Atlanta said.    Bishop Reginald Jackson, the leader of over 500 African Methodist Episcopal (AME) churches in Georgia and who worked on previous efforts to elect President Joe Biden, said the president made a “very, very difficult decision” to not seek reelection, but it was a decision that “put what was best for the nation ahead of himself.” Since Vice President Harris has taken over the top of the ticket, the pastors said their congregations have found new energy.   The two vice presidential candidates have now been chosen and they are hitting the campaign trail today in key battleground states. Here’s a brief breakdown about Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance: Tim Walz is in his second term as Minnesota governor and was most recently chair of the Democratic Governors Association. A onetime high school teacher and football coach who served in the Army National Guard, Walz later spent 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district in southern Minnesota. Walz had been an outspoken defender of Joe Biden, but when the president dropped out, he endorsed Harris and has since emerged as a reliable, energetic and cutting advocate for the campaign. JD Vance was elected to the US Senate from Ohio in 2022 after receiving a boost from former President Donald Trump in a contentious Republican primary. A venture capitalist and the author of the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance had once been a key voice in the “Never Trump” movement during the 2016 election. But he later became a leading MAGA proponent, courting the former president at meetings in Mar-a-Lago and through appearances on Fox News. The Harris-Walz campaign raised $36 million in the 24 hours since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, a campaign official said. Harris made her selection public on Tuesday before the pair appeared for the first time together at an event in Philadelphia. At that rally, Walz portrayed himself as both a folksy Midwestern everyman and an attack dog for Harris. The Republican Party’s media allies are yet again struggling to coalesce around a single attack on the Democratic ticket. In the hours since Kamala Harris tapped Tim Walz as her running mate, top figures in right-wing media have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at the Minnesota governor as they race to define him, seeking to tarnish the Midwesterner’s image with only 90 days to go before Election Day. On Tuesday, Walz was portrayed in a harsh light as a left-wing “radical” who is supposedly out of touch with everyday Americans; he was criticized as a governor who allowed Black Lives Matter protesters to riot, engage in violence, and burn Minnesota’s cities without consequence; and was accused of being “groomed by the Chinese” after he spent his honeymoon in China. Fox News, naturally, led the charge, with the right-wing network devoting segment after segment to assailing Walz and his character. The wide array of attacks on Walz highlighted the GOP’s ongoing difficulty in settling on a single, effective line of attack against the Harris campaign. Since she assumed the top spot on the Democratic ticket in July, right-wing media has been noticeably struggling to present a cohesive narrative against her. Instead, they have resorted to a range of disparaging remarks, branding Harris as a “DEI” candidate and mocking her laughter, among other offensive criticisms. Kamala Harris’ stump speech Tuesday night began to sketch out the policy appeal she will make to voters in November. And there are no big surprises. It’s standard Democratic orthodoxy. She praised her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for being an early defender of LGBT rights. She’s pledged that she and her new running mate will save the Affordable Care Act. And the vice president promised they’d also pass a bill restoring nationwide abortion rights. A Harris administration would protect and expand voting rights, she said. Mentioning that Walz is a hunter and a gun owner, the Democratic nominee called for “reasonable gun safety laws.” On the economy, perhaps the stickiest issue she will face, Harris promised to fight for the middle class and to bring down prices. That part of her speech – and her capacity to demonstrate empathy for the struggles that many Americans are still facing despite the strong post-Covid economy – is going to need fleshing out if she is going to effectively counter Trump’s populist economic appeal in the Midwest. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota dismissed GOP leaders framing Gov. Tim Walz as liberal. In a Wednesday interview on CNN, Smith said former President Donald Trump’s labeling of the Democratic vice presidential pick as “very liberal” is “just laughable.”  She said Walz was elected to represent a “conservative-leaning district, a farming rural community.” “Is that liberal? I don’t think so,” Smith said. Walz’s election to Congress was one of the biggest conservative upsets of the 2006 election cycle. She also highlighted his endorsement from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a former Democrat turned independent centrist, as further proof of Walz’s broad appeal.  Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have repeatedly pointed to unrest in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. Smith pushed back, saying, “In the midst of all of that pain, Gov. Walz came in, he deployed the National Guard, he restored peace to the streets of Minneapolis.” Remember: Walz — who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years — deployed the Minnesota National Guard, first activating it on May 28, 2020, more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Tuesday evening’s raucous event introducing Kamala Harris’ new running mate was about as far a cry as her team could have orchestrated from the smaller, quieter events President Joe Biden was holding until he withdrew from the race last month. The contrast was notable. Harris’ and Tim Walz’s speeches were laced with humor and delivered with high energy to a crowd many times the size of Biden’s largest events. When Biden was last rallying supporters in Philadelphia, he spoke to a much smaller audience for seven minutes at a church service. At the time, the unscripted speech was seen as a win — if only because Biden made no major errors. Tuesday’s event was a dramatically different affair. Neither Harris nor Walz dwelled on the record or accomplishments of the Biden administration, focused instead on their opponents and their vision for the country’s future. Absent were any mention of Donald Trump’s threat to Democracy, or his vow to act as a dictator on Day 1 — central themes of Biden’s former campaign. The shift in messaging is hardly a surprise for a candidate who entered the race with an implicit mandate to do things differently from Biden, who was struggling to gain traction. But the difference in style and substance presented to the American public for the first time Tuesday was an indication that Democrats have moved in a very different direction. Where the Biden administration has struggled, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has succeeded. The former schoolteacher turned politician whom Vice President Kamala Harris picked as her running mate in the 2024 presidential race has been able to enact many of the progressive policies President Joe Biden and Harris pitched but failed to get through Congress. Here are some of the progressive measures Walz has enacted as governor: Child tax credit: Many lower-income Minnesota families can access a state child tax credit, which Walz signed into law last year. At a glance, the credit, which provides up to $1,750 per kid with no limit on the number of children claimed, is the most generous in the US and is projected to lower child poverty by a third. It is also refundable so families can receive a refund even if they don’t owe any tax, though they do need to file a tax return to claim the credit. Free college tuition: Last year, Walz signed a bill into law that made college tuition free for students from Minnesota families who earn less than $80,000 a year. Between 15,000 and 20,000 students are expected to benefit during the upcoming school year, the first year the program is in effect. Abortion access: Walz has been an advocate for abortion access. In January 2023, he signed into law the Protect Reproductive Options Act, which established the right for people in the state to obtain an abortion after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade the previous year. Tim Walz was in the midst of his interview with Vice President Kamala Harris’ vetting team when he told them there was something important they needed to know. He doesn’t use a teleprompter, the Minnesota governor said. He doesn’t even have one, in fact. So if he was the pick, Walz said, Harris’ team would have to get him a teleprompter and teach him how to use it. It was a lighter moment, but it was also part of an interview process with Harris’ team that Walz aced, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The Minnesota governor was upfront about his vulnerabilities, noting he wasn’t from a swing state or a household name. He also said he was a bad debater. But Walz made it clear he would be a team player. Asked how he saw his role as VP, Walz said he would perform the job however Harris wanted him to. Asked if he wanted to be the last person in the room before Harris made a decision, Walz said only if she wanted him to be there. And asked if he had ambitions to run for president himself one day, Walz said he did not, a point that sources said was not lost on a team looking to minimize the potential for any internal drama in a future Harris administration. The vetting interview was a key step for Walz to ultimately lock up the selection that Harris made after sitting down with the three finalists, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, for one-on-one interviews at her residence on Sunday. Keep reading here about Harris’ decision to select Walz. Former President Donald Trump says he expects to debate Vice President Kamala Harris “in the near future” while leaving open the possibility for the debate to take place on a network other than Fox News, a shift from his previous pledge to only debate Harris there. Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday he would prefer for a debate between him and Harris to be hosted by Fox News, but suggested his campaign is having conversations with other networks about the hosting a debate as well, while adding the decision is “up to me.” “I can tell you every network loves me very much right now. They love me very much. I’ve never been so loved by CBS and by ABC fake news… and by NBC. No, they’re all in love with me now, so that, you know, I say yes,” he continued. Trump added he believes debates “are very important,” and again stressed his preference would be to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News, but said Harris’ unwillingness to agree to a Fox News debate may prevent the network from hosting.  “I’m all for Fox. I’d like to see it on Fox. I think Fox would do a really good job. But two people have to agree,” he said.  The comments come after Trump, who has accepted a Fox News invitation to appear in a debate on September 4, said in a social media post on Saturday he would only debate Harris on Fox News or “I won’t see her at all.” On Friday, Trump backed out of a planned September 10 debate hosted by ABC News. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for Vermont’s presidential ballot, the state’s director of elections confirmed to CNN on Wednesday.  Last week, Kennedy’s campaign submitted 2,000 signatures to Vermont’s elections office, doubling the 1,000 signatures needed to gain ballot access in the state.  Sean Sheehan, director of elections for the Vermont Secretary of State, told CNN Kennedy’s ballot petition has been verified and he will appear on the state’s ballot in November. Including Vermont, Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in 14 states, along with Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, New Mexico, Tennessee, Minnesota, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Nebraska, Hawaii and Utah.  Kennedy is eligible to receive 158 electoral college votes. On the heels of Vice President Harris’ first campaign stop in the Midwest with her running mate, the college students still in the area for the summer are eager for her visit.  Thell says many of her classmates come from throughout the entire region and aren’t strictly Wisconsinites. She’s very familiar with Gov. Tim Walz and his broad appeal. The 20-year-old is gearing up to work hard this fall to ensure students are registered to vote and it will be the first time she will have the opportunity to vote in a presidential race. “People are just so excited to have someone who is Midwestern who can represent us a little bit better,” said Thell, a native of a small rural conservative community in South Central Minnesota. Matthew Lehner, Chair of the Wisconsin College Democrats, says he’s fired up about the Democratic ticket and the most excited he’s ever been. “I do think this is a very strong strategic choice because he knows well the language that Midwesterners speak. He can campaign in these areas and connect well with folks in western Wisconsin, folks in Michigan and really make sure that we’re holding down these critical states,” he added.  Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Wednesday as she continues her battleground state tour with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The vice president’s remarks in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, are expected at 1:20 p.m. CT (2:20 p.m. ET). Harris is also expected to travel to battleground Michigan on Wednesday, where she will make remarks at a campaign event in Detroit at 6:40 p.m. ET. Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, is also set to visit those states today as he makes his pitch to voters on behalf of the GOP ticket. He will deliver remarks at 10 a.m. ET at a press event in Shelby Township, Michigan, which is a suburb of Detroit. He will then deliver remarks at a press event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. CNN reported earlier this week that the Ohio senator is looking to veer attention away from the launch of the Democratic ticket with a series of events in the same cities and states as his opponents. He also visited Philadelphia yesterday hours before Harris and Walz held their rally in the city. Vance’s tour comes as he seeks to reintroduce himself to the American public after his initial rollout as Trump’s running mate was bogged down by his past comments disparaging women and elected officials who don’t have children. It also offers him a chance to divert attention away from Harris, who is embarking on a new phase of her two-week-old campaign and seeking to maintain momentum.  Trump participated in an interview on Fox News this morning and is not on the campaign trail today. Former President Donald Trump said he was “thrilled” Vice President Kamala Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, painting Walz as “very liberal” while suggesting Harris passed over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro because he is Jewish. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Trump compared Walz to progressive Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in an attempt to portray Harris and Walz as “radical” and “communist,” and he “could not be more thrilled” about Walz joining the ticket. “This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner,” he added.  Trump said he expected Harris to pick Shapiro, whom he called “a better choice,” and said he believes Shapiro wasn’t picked because his Jewish identity would “offend somebody else” while pitching himself to Jewish voters. “I think I’m gonna get a tremendous amount of Jewish votes,” he added. CNN reported Tuesday that Shapiro — who was favored by some of the Democratic Party and anti-Trump Republicans as a more moderate selection — did not go over as well with Harris’ team during his vetting interview, according to sources familiar with the process. While Walz came across as deferential and cooperative, Shapiro struck some as overly ambitious, with “a lot of questions” about what the role of the VP would be. Donald Trump’s campaign is already setting out to define Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as someone who will move the Democratic presidential ticket to the left – with a key focus on his record, senior Trump campaign advisers and people close to the former president told CNN. Trump’s team spent the last several days compiling opposition research on Walz, in addition to other leading contenders to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. His advisers say that while they will pull on details from his 12 years in Congress, their goal is to paint Walz — a former teacher and Army National Guard veteran — as someone who has been in lockstep with progressives over the last four years and a key champion of the Biden administration’s policies. The Trump campaign, which has struggled over the last several weeks to find lines of attack that best work against Harris, said the Walz pick presents a new opportunity for them to reimagine their campaign playbook against her. Key focal points in their expected attacks include arguing Walz has taken a liberal stance on the border, painting him as anti-gun and anti-cop, tying him to Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, linking him to the Biden administration’s economic policies and questioning his record on foreign policy. In Congress, Walz’s position on gun rights earned him backing from the National Rifle Association. But he’s since fallen out of favor with the gun lobby over his support for gun safety actions as governor. Now that he is Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has stepped down from the Democratic Governors Association, where he had been serving as chair. According to DGA bylaws, because Walz is now a federal candidate, he cannot also serve as the sitting chairman of the umbrella organization for Democratic governors and gubernatorial candidates. Walz had been serving in the role since December. In a note sent to DGA staff Monday and confirmed to CNN, DGA Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper wrote: “Having the DGA Chair become the VP candidate is a BIG DEAL and a thing to celebrate! His team (Gov. Walz) called me this morning to say ‘We want you to know how important the DGA is to the governor and to our whole team.’”  Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly will succeed Walz as chair. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will continue their campaign blitz through key swing states on Wednesday, with events in Wisconsin and Michigan as the newly formed ticket seeks to mobilize voters.  The campaign says the two will “highlight the choice facing Blue Wall voters between the Trump-Vance agenda to weaken unions and give tax cuts to the wealthy on the backs of the middle class, and the Harris-Walz vision for the future, where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.” The Harris campaign also touted messaging and campaign infrastructure, saying in part: “The Harris-Walz campaign battleground infrastructure in the Blue Wall dwarfs the Trump-Vance operation. Team Harris-Walz has nearly 400 staff across almost 100 field offices in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the Trump campaign still barely has any ground game presence.” At the midday rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the indie group Bon Iver is set to perform. Speakers include: In Detroit, Michigan, speakers include: Harris’ event in the Great Lake State comes after over a dozen labor endorsements, including from the UAW International Executive Board, which voted to formally back Harris’ candidacy last week.

Catch up on key moments from the rally: Small-town background: Mutual praise: Promises made: Attacks on Trump and Vance: Read more about today’s campaign rally here. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to make America joyful again. The vice president’s rocking rollout of her running mate on Tuesday sent jolts of energy through a huge crowd, as the pair personified the extraordinary transformation of the 2024 election campaign. Such a scene would have been unthinkable even three weeks ago — in a Democratic Party that believed it was doomed to a disastrous defeat as an aged president resentfully faced a revolt that ultimately ended his reelection bid. Yet inside Temple University’s packed basketball arena in Philadelphia, activists and Harris supporters beamed smiles of deliverance, marveling at the turn of events and a second chance against Donald Trump they can barely believe. It’s hardly new for a political party to sell hope and aspiration — it’s a staple of presidential election campaigns. But the fresh vibe in Philadelphia was striking because it emerged after one of the darkest chapters of modern US politics. Americans have experienced a Trump presidency that threatened to tear the country apart, suffered through a pandemic that killed more than a million citizens and endured grinding years of economic insecurity caused by inflation and high grocery prices. For most of this year, the former president has promised a second presidency of retribution. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, had been delivering searing warnings that his rival was tarnishing the very soul of America, even as the haunting signs of the president’s advancing age became increasingly painful to watch. Read the full analysis. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are officially the Democratic nominees for president and vice president, the party announced Tuesday. The Democratic National Committee announced Monday that Harris won the presidential nomination. She is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. Harris won 99% of the vote, according to the Democratic National Convention. Under party rules, Harris could name her running mate without a separate vote."
Right-wing media figures launch flurry of attacks on Tim Walz in race to define VP candidate | CNN Business,"Updated 4:19 PM EDT, Wed August 7, 2024",2024-08-07T13:12:24.212Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/media/right-wing-media-tim-walz-harris-attacks-vp-election/index.html,"The Republican Party’s media allies are yet again struggling to coalesce around a single attack on the Democratic ticket. In the hours since Kamala Harris tapped Tim Walz as her running mate, top figures in right-wing media have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at the Minnesota governor as they race to define him, seeking to tarnish the Midwesterner’s image with only 90 days to go before Election Day. On Tuesday, Walz was portrayed in harsh light as a left-wing “radical” who is supposedly out of touch with everyday Americans; he was criticized as a governor who allowed Black Lives Matter protesters to riot, engage in violence, and burn Minnesota’s cities without consequence; and was accused of being “groomed by the Chinese” after he spent his honeymoon in China. Fox News, naturally, led the charge, with the right-wing network devoting segment after segment to assailing Walz and his character. Sean Hannity opened his program arguing that Harris’s choice of Walz — who he called the “most far-left governor in the United States” — revealed she was the most extreme Democratic presidential candidate in history. Hannity not only disparaged Walz with a wide range of negative descriptors, but he also criticized his personal demeanor, claiming he is “pretty weird.”

Meanwhile, other MAGA Media figures, without an ounce of self-reflection or evidence, tried to shame the Democratic ticket by claiming that Walz was selected over Josh Shapiro simply because the Pennsylvania governor is Jewish. “He was denied this because he is a Jew,” Jeanine Pirro declared on Fox, citing his position on the war in Gaza. “And the problem right now is they are pleasing the Hamas end of the Democrat party.” Never mind that it was Donald Trump who dined at Mar-a-Lago with Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and the Adolf Hitler-loving rapper Kanye West, among other moments in which he has embraced White nationalism over the years. The wide array of attacks on Walz highlighted the GOP’s ongoing difficulty in settling on a single, effective line of attack against the Harris campaign. Since she assumed the top spot on the Democratic ticket in July, right-wing media has been noticeably struggling to present a cohesive narrative against her. Instead, they have resorted to a range of disparaging remarks, branding Harris as a “DEI” candidate and mocking her laughter, among other offensive criticisms.

It remains to be seen whether the Trump campaign will eventually establish a clear and consistent strategy for defining Harris and Walz. While Trump previously fixated on President Joe Biden’s age and stamina, he has struggled to craft a compelling narrative against his new Democratic rival. And if the disjointed coverage from right-wing media on Tuesday indicates anything, it suggests that Trump and his allies are facing a formidable challenge in rallying around a unified strategy as the clock ticks toward Election Day."
Look of the Week: Harris-Walz’s campaign hat says more than you might think | CNN,"Published 2:10 PM EDT, Wed August 7, 2024",2024-08-07T18:10:32.752Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/style/campaign-hat-harris-walz-lotw/index.html,"What do sport hunters and fans of breakout queer pop star Chappell Roan have in common? Well, not much, perhaps. But now you can add at least one item to that list: Kamala Harris’ and Tim Walz’s new campaign cap. The pair’s first joint merch offering was unveiled Tuesday, just hours after Harris named the Minnesota governor and hunting enthusiast as her presidential running mate. At first glance, their “Harris-Walz” caps presented a classic outdoorsy combination of camo (every hunter’s pattern of choice) and bright orange (used for visibility and avoiding mistaken identity). However, online commentators were quick to highlight the striking similarity between the design and Roan’s own merchandise — specifically her “Midwestern Princess” trucker hats, which reference her debut album “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.” Roan’s drag-inspired makeup, theatrical stage looks and honest lyrics about grappling with her sexuality have made her a Gen-Z favorite. Earlier this week, she reportedly drew the largest crowd in history at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago. After Walz was announced as Harris’ running mate, calls to put the vice presidential nominee — who hails from West Point, Nebraska — in one of Roan’s caps surfaced. “You asked, we answered,” reads the online store listing, in what could be read as an acknowledgement. The 26-year-old singer-songwriter seemed surprised, posing the question on X, “is this real”? Despite the similar designs, campaign officials told CNN that new merchandise was not a direct reference to Chappell Roan but instead reflected Walz’ own camo hat that he wears frequently as governor. (In fact, he was wearing his when he received the call from Harris inviting him to be her presidential ticket.) While officially unintentional, the twinning of Walz’ hat and Roan’s merch comes hot off the heels of Harris’ embrace of Charli XCX’s “Brat” green, and appears to some as another instance of her campaign reacting quickly to the Gen-Z zeitgeist. Designed by Roan’s creative director Ramisha Sattar, the “Midwestern Princess” trucker hats (which also come in khaki and green) have grown in popularity as the Missouri-born musician’s cult following blossoms into a mainstream one. Although released last September, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” has proven something of a sleeper hit and now sits at no.4 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The Democratic Party’s alignment — even if inadvertent — is in keeping with two of the themes we have already seen in Harris’ short campaign: appearing cool by association and feeding the viral meme-makers who are burnishing her credentials among young voters. Needless to say, the internet was quick to debate, joke and discuss the hats, with Roan reposting one user’s comical observation about the singer’s LGBTQ following: “How gay do u have to be to see hunting colors and think it’s a Chappell Roan thing.” Others joked about the moment of mutual recognition when “queer millennials/zoomers who like Chappell Roan and white boomers into hunting and fishing (see) each other wearing the camo Harris Walz hat.” And maybe that’s the point. Producing what is perhaps the only item of merch in existence that could simultaneously speak to the hunting community and Gen-Z hypebeasts is, in itself, a message: that the Democratic ticket is a broad church. The cap’s other messaging is less subtle: The online store boasts its patriotic credentials of being both “American made” and “union made.” At $40, the Harris-Walz hats are also $10 more expensive than Roan’s, though that is treated as a donation to the Harris Victory Fund. In equally confident style, the online shop describes the Harris-Walz cap as being the “most iconic hat in America.” Whether they can surpass Trump’s ubiquitous red MAGA hats remains to be seen. But given they won’t even be shipped to customers until mid-October, it may prove a tall order."
‘Squad’ member Cori Bush loses Democratic primary in Missouri | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:35 AM EDT, Wed August 7, 2024",2024-08-07T03:07:13.108Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/cori-bush-squad-missouri-democratic-primary/index.html,"Missouri Rep. Cori Bush has lost her Democratic primary to St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, securing another win for the same pro-Israel groups that helped oust New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman six weeks ago. Bush, a member of the House “squad” of progressive lawmakers like Bowman, was already earmarked for a tough primary in Missouri’s 1st Congressional District – which ended up being the second-most expensive primary of the cycle, behind only Bowman’s race in New York. Her fierce advocacy for a ceasefire in Gaza added fuel to opponents’ fire. And in similar fashion to Bowman, Bush – despite the backing of progressive groups, local leaders and top congressional Democrats – was unable to fend off Bell, who, like Bush, rose to prominence during the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a decade ago following the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown. With his victory Tuesday, Bell will be heavily favored in the general election for the solid blue St. Louis-area seat. His win also marks the second time in three cycles that a challenger has unseated the incumbent in the 1st District Democratic primary – Bush defeated Rep. William Lacy Clay in the 2020 contest. Bell first entered elective politics in 2015, when he won a seat on the Ferguson City Council. Three years later, he was the first Black St. Louis County prosecutor, unseating longtime incumbent Robert McCulloch. “What we had, that he did not have, was the power of people,” Bell told supporters that night in 2018. But his decision not to bring charges against the officer who shot Brown frustrated some in the community, including Brown’s father, who cut an ad for Bush in the closing days of the race in which he says: “I feel like (Bell) lied to us.” In the primary, Bush sought to cast Bell as a vehicle for corporate donors far removed from the community that elected him – and that he is now likely to represent in Congress next year. “By supporting our grassroots campaign,” Bush said in a recent fundraising email, “you’re standing up against a grifter politician and the influence of big money in politics and demanding real representation for the people of MO-01.” But her defeat will be blow to House progressives, who rallied around Bowman earlier this year, only to see him lose by more than 15 points to a more moderate opponent in the Democratic primary. Both Bush and Bowman came under criticism from their opponents for lodging protest votes against President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill – which was not as climate-friendly as they had hoped – on its way to passage in 2021. (Only six Democrats, in all, joined most Republicans in opposition.) “She sold out our president, and she sold out the city of St. Louis,” a person says in an ad by the United Democracy Project, the super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The group spent about $9 million on ads attacking Bush or boosting Bell. Bush’s infrastructure vote and her early, strident advocacy for a halt to the fighting in Gaza were her main vulnerabilities, though her rivals also argued she focused too much on national politics and not enough on her district. An ad by the Mainstream Democrats PAC also attacked her for being the subject of a federal investigation over alleged misuse of campaign funds for security services. Bush has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that she complied with House rules. Bell had no shortage of local endorsers, but, in addition the United Democracy Project’s big outlay, big spenders on his behalf included the Democratic Majority for Israel, the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC and billionaire Reid Hoffman’s Mainstream Democrats. Bush is the fourth House member to lose a primary this year. In March, Rep. Jerry Carl lost an all-incumbent Republican primary in Alabama to Rep. Barry Moore after both ran for the same seat following redistricting. Bowman lost his primary in June, and last week, Virginia Rep. Bob Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, conceded his Republican primary after a recount upheld his June defeat. This story has been updated with additional information."
Analysis: Happy warriors Harris and Walz propose an antidote to Trump’s American carnage | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:35 AM EDT, Wed August 7, 2024",2024-08-07T04:00:02.675Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/politics/harris-walz-happy-warriors-analysis/index.html,"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to make America joyful again.

It’s hardly new for a political party to sell hope and aspiration — it’s a staple of presidential election campaigns. But the fresh vibe in Philadelphia was striking because it emerged after one of the darkest chapters of modern US politics. Americans have experienced a Trump presidency that threatened to tear the country apart, suffered through a pandemic that killed more than a million citizens and endured grinding years of economic insecurity caused by inflation and high grocery prices. For most of this year, the former president has promised a second presidency of retribution. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, had been delivering searing warnings that his rival was tarnishing the very soul of America, even as the haunting signs of the president’s advancing age became increasingly painful to watch. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the last GOP primary challenger standing against Trump, used to predict that the first party to ditch its old, White male presidential candidate in 2024 would get a massive boost. While Harris is yet to prove she can alter the fundamentals of a race against Trump, she’s proving Haley’s point, bringing some unexpected sunshine to an election year. “We both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down,” Harris said of her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Walz. “Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it?” the vice president asked before adding, “We both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them.” This message is a mirror image of Trump’s political method, which relies on tugging at the fault lines of US society for political gain. Walz rammed home the point, as if anyone in the packed arena filled by roaring cheers had missed it. “Thank you for bringing back the joy,” he told his new boss, as he riffed through a series of dad jokes about Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, showing why the Harris team thinks he’ll be a hit in the Blue Wall battleground states that will decide the election. The new Harris-Walz double act struck a stunning contrast. Just a few weeks ago, Democrats dreaded Biden’s small and glum campaign events when the 81-year-old president’s stumbles revived memories of his disastrous Atlanta debate performance. Now, they have a candidate and a running mate who can draw a massive crowd, inspire the base and project vigor and hope in a way that will take the battle to Trump over the frenetic last three months of the campaign. Multiple rallygoers Tuesday expressed delight at the extraordinary twist in their fortunes at an event that conjured flashbacks to Barack Obama’s hope-and-change rallies of 2008, especially when the crowd chanted “Yes We Can” when Harris pledged to save the Affordable Care Act. “I couldn’t be more delighted,” said Karla D’Alessio, from Hatfield, Pennsylvania. “I wish all elections were 100 days,” she added, referring to the truncated race to November with a suddenly dynamic Democratic ticket. Gini George, who was born in Mumbai and especially identifies with Harris’ South Asian heritage, glowed with happiness and said, “I love it,” when asked about the new Harris-Trump matchup. She also praised Walz for his early defense of LGBTQ rights. Both women expressed reverence for Biden’s decision to step aside and allow his party to finally pass the torch. The optimism, laughter and positive energy in Philadelphia on Tuesday felt like a different planet from the dystopian dirge of Trump rallies, which devolve into festivals of personal vengeance for a candidate who has tripled down on the American carnage mantra of his first inaugural address. “We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation,” Trump said at a typical event in Manchester, New Hampshire, in January, portraying the US as a hellscape of energy shortages, drug-infested cities, out-of-control immigration and crime. He added: “We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way.” On Tuesday, Trump reinforced his favorite conceit – that if Americans don’t vote for him, they won’t have a country anymore, reacting to the vice president’s running mate pick with a warning that hardly seemed apt, given Walz’s Minnesota nice manner. “TIM WALZ WILL UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH! He’s already pulling in MILLIONS to WIPE MAGA OUT,” the ex-president said in a fundraising email. America now has a choice between the former president’s nightmarish vision of national decline that only a strongman can fix and Harris’ optimistic vow that America is still a land of aspiration. But that dichotomy also points to a huge risk for Harris. Running a campaign rooted in hopefulness and good cheer at a time when many Americans feel demoralized and tired could backfire. After all, years of decaying economic security exacerbated by high inflation and elevated grocery prices during the Biden administration created the kind of conditions in which Trump’s populist demagoguery can prosper. If the vice president misjudges the national mood, her campaign could come across as oblivious to the concerns of many voters. It was noticeable, for instance, that while Harris pledged to bring down prices and fight for the middle class, her speech on Tuesday was light on details of exactly how she would alleviate the economic stress that many people are feeling. Without solutions, Harris’ hope-fueled speeches could become bromides by repetition, especially if Trump has more accurately judged America’s collective psyche than she has. Harris is, after all, a key part of an unpopular administration – which, for all its success in passing sweeping legislation that could revive US manufacturing and overhaul the country’s infrastructure, has not been able to convince millions of Americans of the reality of the country’s relatively strong economic rebound after the pandemic. Tuesday’s rally proved the vice president can draw a crowd and work it — to great theatrical effect. But her most significant assignment in the next two months will come in convincing Americans she can meet building crises at home and abroad — as evidenced by a stock market plunge on the eve of her running mate selection and fears the Middle East is on the precipice of a wider war. Still, in a race likely to be decided across the three battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Walz may be able to reach rural voters that the California Democrat can’t. While the Minnesota governor is not going to help her beat Trump in his rural heartlands, any trimming of the ex-president’s margins there could complement Harris’ expected high turnout among inner city minority voters and suburban women. Walz praised Harris as a prosecutor, a senator and a vice president who had dedicated her life to serving her country while arguing that Trump only served himself. The symbolism of reassurance was strong. A plainspoken, White, Midwestern dad, football coach and high school teacher who reached the rank of command sergeant major in the Army National Guard was vouching for the values and patriotism of a running mate who is being demeaned by Trump as a racial chameleon and out of the American cultural and political mainstream. Ironically, given the events of the last two weeks, Walz is serving a similar role that then-vice presidential nominee Biden played for future President Obama in 2008. Walz is sure to reprise his endorsement at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in a couple of weeks — and on pretty much every day until Election Day as he and Harris set off on an exhausting journey. “We have 91 days — my God, that’s easy. We’ll sleep when we’re dead,” he said."

Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Wednesday as she continues her battleground state tour with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The vice president’s remarks in Wisconsin are expected at 1:20 p.m. CT (2:20 p.m. ET). Harris is then expected to travel to neighboring Michigan, another battleground state, where she will make remarks at a campaign event at 6:40 p.m. ET Wednesday. As Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz — the new Democratic vice presidential nominee — has enacted progressive health care provisions. Walz has been an advocate for abortion access, in January 2023 signing into law the Protect Reproductive Options Act, which established the right for people in the state to obtain an abortion after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade the previous year. In April 2023, he signed a law protecting people who travel to Minnesota for abortions, and clinicians providing abortion care, from criminal penalties from other states. Minnesota’s policies make it among the most protective states for abortion access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights. When Kamala Harris became the first vice president believed to have visited an abortion clinic in office, she chose a Planned Parenthood location in Minnesota. Walz also signed an executive order in March 2023 directing state agencies to take action to protect and support access to gender-affirming health care across the state. Gender-affirming care is evidence-based care for people who identify as transgender or nonbinary. It’s been deemed medically necessary and has the backing of nearly every major medical association and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half of states now have laws that restrict such care. “We want every Minnesotan to grow up feeling safe, valued, protected, celebrated and free to exist as their authentic versions of themselves,” Walz said after signing the order. The next month, he signed “trans refuge” legislation that safeguarded access to such care. He also signed another law that banned “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that aims to change someone’s understanding of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Cedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, described what it was like to be in Vice President Kamala Harris’ inner circle while she decided on a running mate in her bid for president. He said that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was announced today as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, “fit that mold.” Richmond added that Walz “expressed that he didn’t have ambition to be president.” When asked about Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and the other finalists, Richmond said there was “a great connection” with Walz. “Shapiro is immensely talented. He cares about the American people. He’s devoted to the people of Pennsylvania, and he loves his country dearly. And so did Senator Kelly and Governor Bashir. It was — she couldn’t make a wrong choice with the options that she had. But there was a great connection between Governor Walz and not to mention that there is a great contrast,” he said. “And I think it was a great decision that she made. And it’s no slight on anybody who I was not picked but that connection was strong, that contrast was strong,” he added. “Like she always does, I think she put a lot of time, energy, effort, thought, and she put a heart into it and that’s where we ended up,” he said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised in January 2023 to make Minnesota the best state in the nation for kids to grow up in. Less than five months later, he signed a budget and another bill enacting much of that vision. Here are several of the provisions that are now law: Child tax credit: Many lower-income Minnesota families can access a state child tax credit. The credit, which provides up to $1,750 per kid with no limit on the number of children claimed, is the most generous in the US and is projected to lower child poverty by a third. The full credit is available to single parents earning $29,500 and couples earning $35,000, and slowly phases out depending on income, filing status and number of children. More than 215,000 families, totaling more than 437,000 children, have claimed the credit so far for 2023, Walz said in a statement last week. The average credit was $1,244 per child — totaling $545 million.  Universal school meals: Students can receive free breakfast and lunch in participating schools, making Minnesota the fourth state to enact such a universal school meals measure. Nearly 4.3 million more breakfasts and 4.5 million more lunches were served to students last fall compared with the same period in 2022, Walz said in March. The measure is expected to cost the state about $400 million over two years. Paid family and medical leave: In a program set to launch in 2026, individuals will be able to take up to 12 weeks for each period of medical and family leave, for a combined maximum of 20 weeks in a 12-month period. How much workers will receive during their leave will depend on their pay. Benefits are paid by the state but are funded through payroll deductions on wages. Minnesota will be the 13th state to enact such a program. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to reflect the choice of her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.  The campaign filed an amended statement of candidacy, listing Walz as a candidate in the new filing. In recent weeks, amendments to the campaign’s statement of candidacy have captured the series of dramatic developments for the Democratic presidential ticket. On July 20, the campaign filed under “Biden for President,” listing President Joe Biden and Harris as candidates. On July 21, the campaign filed an amendment, renaming itself “Harris for President” after Biden withdrew from the race. And now, on August 6, the campaign has updated its statement of candidacy again for Walz, capping its transformation. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers will win their respective Senate primaries in Michigan on Tuesday, CNN projects, setting up a competitive general election race for the seat of retiring Democrat Debbie Stabenow. The race is one of several that could help determine the balance of power in the Senate, where Democrats are defending a narrow majority this fall. Slotkin is projected to defeat actor Hill Harper, who is known for his roles on “CSI: NY” and “The Good Doctor.” Rogers, who had Donald Trump’s endorsement, is projected to win a Republican primary that included former Rep. Justin Amash, a noted critic of the former president. Both nominees have national security backgrounds – Slotkin as a former CIA analyst and Rogers as the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have not won a Senate race in Michigan in 30 years. About today’s primaries: While presidential primaries are long behind us, there are still a few down-ballot primaries for congressional, state and local races to get through before November’s general election. Four states — Missouri, Michigan, Kansas and Washington – held down-ballot primary contests today.  One of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s former students told CNN on Tuesday that he likely wouldn’t have finished high school without him. He called Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly minted running mate “just a great overall human being.” Clement also spoke warmly of Walz’s presence in his life as his high school football coach. “There’s no question I probably wouldn’t have finished high school,” he continued, explaining that Walz was able to “pull him through” a struggle he had with substances. “Without that, you know, who knows where my trajectory would have gone,” he said, while also noting that he continued to stay in contact with Walz after he graduated. Clement also described Walz as a high-energy, goofy teacher, who was also “the type of guy that’s gonna tell you what you needed to hear” when necessary. “I need to hear it in football. I definitely needed to hear it in the classroom, right? So he really helped pull me along there,” he added. Watch here: Tuesday evening’s raucous event introducing Kamala Harris’ new running mate was about as far a cry as her team could have orchestrated from the smaller, quieter events President Joe Biden was holding until he withdrew from the race last month. The contrast was notable. Harris’ and Tim Walz’s speeches were laced with humor and delivered with high energy to a crowd many times the size of Biden’s largest events. When Biden was last rallying supporters in Philadelphia, he spoke to a much smaller audience for seven minutes at a church service. At the time, the unscripted speech was seen as a win — if only because Biden made no major errors. Tuesday’s event was a dramatically different affair. Neither Harris nor Walz dwelled on the record or accomplishments of the Biden administration, focused instead on their opponents and their vision for the country’s future. Absent were any mention of Donald Trump’s threat to Democracy, or his vow to act as a dictator on Day 1 — central themes of Biden’s former campaign. The shift in messaging is hardly a surprise for a candidate who entered the race with an implicit mandate to do things differently from Biden, who was struggling to gain traction. But the difference in style and substance presented to the American public for the first time Tuesday was an indication that Democrats have moved in a very different direction. While today’s attention has largely been on Kamala Harris’ choice as a VP and the presidential primaries are long behind us, there are still a few down-ballot primaries for congressional, state and local races to get through before November’s general election. Four states — Missouri, Michigan, Kansas and Washington – held down-ballot primary contests today.  A key race to watch in Missouri is the Democratic primary for the state’s 1st Congressional District, where Rep. Cori Bush, a member of the House “squad” of progressive lawmakers, is being challenged by St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell. Bush has been a target for centrist and Israel-aligned groups over her stance on the war in Gaza.  Michigan is playing host to a competitive Senate race to succeed retiring Democrat Debbie Stabenow. Former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin are favored in their respective primaries today. And in Washington’s 4th District, Rep. Dan Newhouse, who was among the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after January 6, is facing two Trump-endorsed GOP opponents – Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler and 2022 Senate nominee Tiffany Smiley. Under Washington state’s election rules, all candidates run on the same primary ballot, with the top two, regardless of party, advancing to the general election. Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, made their debut as the Democratic ticket tonight in Philadelphia. See scenes from the campaign rally in the pictures below: Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called in to an all-staff meeting after Tuesday’s rally in Philadelphia to thank the team for the rollout and give a pep talk. She also praised Walz and his energy. “I was so proud to stand on that stage and talk about who you are and what you have done in sacrifice and dedication to our country. Really, you have an extraordinary life and career and it is my honor to be able to do this with you and we’re going to win,” she continued. Tim Walz was in the midst of his interview with Vice President Kamala Harris’ vetting team when he told them there was something important they needed to know. He doesn’t use a teleprompter, the Minnesota governor said. He doesn’t even have one, in fact. So if he became the pick, Walz said, Harris’ team would have to get him a teleprompter and teach him how to use it. It was a lighter moment, but it was also part of an interview process with Harris’ team that Walz aced, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The Minnesota governor was up-front about his vulnerabilities, noting he wasn’t from a swing state or a household name. He also said he was a bad debater. But Walz made it clear he would be a team player. Asked how he saw his role as VP, Walz said he would perform the job however Harris wanted him to. Asked whether he wanted to be the last person in the room before Harris made a decision, Walz said only if she wanted him to be there. And asked whether he had ambitions to run for president himself one day, Walz said he did not, a point that sources said was not lost on a team looking to minimize the potential for any internal drama in a future Harris administration. The vetting interview was a key step for Walz to ultimately lock up the selection that Harris made after sitting down with the three finalists, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, for one-on-one interviews at her residence Sunday. “It was a home run,” said one source familiar with Walz’s meeting with Harris’ vetting team. “Everyone loved him.” Beyond the personal chemistry Harris and her team felt toward Walz, people familiar with the interview process said that he was also someone Harris felt could attract the kinds of voters Democrats have lost to Donald Trump — voters who Harris may not be able to connect with on her own. Read more about what went on behind the scenes during the vetting process. Watch more: Vice President Kamala Harris was looking for chemistry in a running mate. At the close of her rally here in Philadelphia, the smile that spread wide across her face suggested she may have found just that with Tim Walz. While Harris and Walz were still finding their way on stage together – should they hug? should they shake hands? – the debut of the new Democratic ticket showed two partners appearing far more comfortable than many in recent history. He walked a step behind, gesturing repeatedly to her, intent on making her the center of the show. There’s little doubt that Walz will upstage Harris – nor have any interest in trying to do so. That, of course, would be a fool’s errand, given how adoring the Democratic crowd was for Harris. As the Democratic candidates lingered on stage, basking in the booming applause as they stood beneath a giant blue Harris-Walz sign, it’s clear that Harris has entered an entirely new realm in just 17 days. But she made clear the hardest part of this assignment was yet to come. “Now we’ve got some work to do,” Harris said. “We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we are up against.” Second Gentlemen Doug Emhoff shared a photo on social media Tuesday alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’ wife, Gwen Walz. In the photo, the two are seen holding a Harris-Walz campaign sign after Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz’ first rally together in Philadelphia. Just over eight years ago, another Democratic Tim was being introduced as the vice presidential nominee ready to take on former President Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine walked out to “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” at Florida International University on July 23, 2016. The events are similar visually, both planned in part by longtime producer Greg Hale, who was spotted peeking from backstage in the moments before Vice President Kamala Harris walked out with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.  “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” was, again, on Tuesday night’s playlist at another college campus, Temple University in Philadelphia. But the stage was lit in red, white and blue, with attendees wearing coordinating, color-changing bracelets — a sign of the times. This event also featured a heavily-produced video of Harris to warm the crowd up, and a Beyoncé soundtrack.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ripped Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president, saying he can’t wait to get on the debate stage. “Like all regular people, I grew up with in the heartland. JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That’s not what middle America is,” Walz said at a Tuesday rally in Philadelphia. After the crowd quieted down, Walz added, “That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.” “You see what I did there?” Walz said, giving a shrug and a small laugh. The governor also repeated his now-popular line of attack, calling Vance and other Republicans “weird as hell.” “I got to tell you, pointing out just an observation of mine that I made. I just have to say it — you know it, you feel it. These guys are creepy, and yes, just weird as hell,” Walz said. “That’s what you see.” Vance told CNN’s Kristen Holmes earlier on Tuesday that he wants to debate Walz but only after Walz officially becomes the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Harris and Walz officially became the Democratic nominees for president and vice president, the party announced Tuesday evening. Watch here: This post has been updated with comments from Vance earlier Tuesday on debating Walz. Former Vice President Al Gore called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz a “proven leader” and “valuable asset” to the Democratic ticket on the issue of climate change. Gore, who served as vice president under President Bill Clinton, is a well-known climate advocate. Vice President Kamala Harris introduced her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, to America on Tuesday — and then he returned the compliment. The new Democratic vice presidential nominee praised Harris as a prosecutor, a senator and a vice president who had dedicated her life to service — while arguing that Donald Trump served only himself.  The symbolism is strong. A plainspoken, White, Midwestern dad — who was an Army National Guard sergeant major, a football coach and a high school teacher — is vouching to his own community for the values and patriotism of a running mate who is being demeaned by Republicans as a racial chameleon and as out of the American cultural and political mainstream. Ironically, given the events of the last two weeks, Walz is serving a similar role that then-VP nominee Joe Biden played for future President Barack Obama in 2008. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz drew a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump, offering new and crowd-pleasing lines of attack against his opponent framed around personal freedoms, including reproductive rights. “Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now, what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make, even if we wouldn’t make the same choice for ourselves. There’s a golden rule: mind your own damn business,” he said to cheers. Walz spoke personally about his own family’s journey with fertility treatments, including IVF, to welcome daughter, Hope.  “When the vice president and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions,” he said. He took specific aim at Trump, who, he said, “would damn sure take us backward.” “Don’t believe him when he plays dumb: He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict my freedom,” he said, referring to the Trump-aligned playbook the former president has disavowed. And Trump, Walz said, “doesn’t know the first thing about service – he doesn’t have time for it because he’s too busy serving himself,” later adding that he “sews chaos and division.” Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov.Tim Walz to be her running mate. CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten looks at the data to understand if Walz will help her this November. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz slammed former President Donald Trump’s record on Covid-19, economy and crime in his speech at Tuesday’s rally in Philadelphia, insisting that Republican nominee doesn’t “doesn’t know the first thing about service” because he’s serving himself. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz walked a Philadelphia crowd through his biography, introducing himself Tuesday as the Democratic pick for vice president. In his first remarks as part of the Democratic ticket, Walz told the audience about his time as a teacher and a coach and his experience as a veteran. “I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived Butte, a small town of 400 where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm,” Walz said. He used his biography to try to draw contrasts between the Democratic ticket and former President Donald Trump. Walz said he joined the Army National Guard when he was 17 years old. “The National Guard gave me purpose; it gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves,” adding that the “GI bill gave me a shot at a college education.” Walz said after graduating, he taught high school social studies and coached football for nearly 20 years, before running for Congress in 2006. “It was my students. They encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them — a commitment of common good. A belief that one person can make a difference,” Walz said. Vice President Kamala Harris compared Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s background with that of GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance in remarks at her campaign’s Philadelphia rally Tuesday. “I’m telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on Day 1,” Harris said. Kamala Harris’ stump speech began to sketch out the policy appeal she will make to voters in November. And there are no big surprises. It’s standard Democratic orthodoxy. She praised her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for being an early defender of LGBT rights. She’s pledged that she and her new running mate will save the Affordable Care Act. And the vice president promised they’d also pass a bill restoring nationwide abortion rights. A Harris administration would protect and expand voting rights, she said. Mentioning that Walz is a hunter and a gun owner, the Democratic nominee called for “reasonable gun safety laws.” On the economy, perhaps the stickiest issue she will face, Harris promised to fight for the middle class and to bring down prices. That part of her speech – and her capacity to demonstrate empathy for the struggles that many Americans are still facing despite the strong post-Covid economy – is going to need fleshing out if she is going to effectively counter Trump’s populist economic appeal in the Midwest. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz thanked Vice President Kamala Harris for “the trust you put in me” as well as for “bringing back the joy.” He went on to commend Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. “He can bring the fire,” Walz said of Shapiro. “This is a visionary leader.” Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have now raised more than $20 million since the announcement that Walz was joining the ticket Tuesday morning, according to the campaign. Additionally, Harris’ campaign began selling a camouflage baseball hat on its website – a nod to Walz, who regularly dons a camouflage cap, joining the ticket today. The hat bears the words “Harris Walz” written in the campaign’s newly-minted font in bright orange over a camouflage print. The Harris campaign is charging $40 for the hat. The website’s description suggests high demand for the hat. “You asked, we answered. The most iconic political hat in America,” the description reads.  More context: Walz, an avid hunter, often wears a camouflage hat at campaign events and during his personal life. In a video posted by the Harris campaign on Tuesday, Walz was wearing a camouflage hat when he received the call from Harris asking him to join the ticket.  This post has been updated with additional information on the Harris-Walz campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris, the official Democratic nominee for president, emphasized unity and celebrated the diversity of the country during remarks in Philadelphia on Tuesday. She talked about her background growing up in California, contrasting that with the upbringing of her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was raised in Nebraska. Vice President Kamala Harris argued that Americans are witnessing a “full-on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights” during remarks in Philadelphia Tuesday, pointing to her promises to enshrine reproductive rights if she is elected. Harris was appearing for the first time with her new vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Harris touted Walz’s record on abortion during his time as governor, saying this campaign is a “fight for freedom.” She slammed Trump and said it is because of the former president’s actions that states have abortion bans. Walz has been an advocate for abortion access, in January 2023 signing into law the Protect Reproductive Options (PRO) Act, which established the right for people in the state to obtain an abortion after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade the previous year. In April 2023, he signed a law protecting people who travel to Minnesota for abortions, and clinicians providing abortion care, from criminal penalties from other states. Harris promised to sign a bill to “restore reproductive freedom,” vowing to sign it into law. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are officially the Democratic nominees for president and vice president, the party announced Tuesday. The Democratic National Committee announced Monday that Harris won the presidential nomination. She is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. Harris won 99% of the vote, according to the DNC. Under party rules, Harris could name her running mate without a separate vote. This post has been updated with additional details on the party’s announcement. Vice President Kamala Harris outlined why she picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election. She continued, saying that she “found such a leader,” referencing Walz, who was standing behind her. Harris went on to speak about Walz’s life, saying that he is “more than a governor.” She pointed toward his experience coaching high school football, saying that it will influence his ability to serve the country as vice president. “He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn’t even see it in themselves,” she said, adding that Walz led his team from a winless record to the school’s first state championship. Harris said Walz was “the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having,” saying that he inspired people to “dream big” and that he made “people feel like they belong.” “That’s the kind of vice president he will be,” Harris said. Kamala Harris, the official Democratic nominee for president, said that her campaign is not just about beating former President Donald Trump in November, but it’s also about the future. “I know Donald Trump’s type,” Harris said, to huge cheers and chants from the crowd. She added she is fighting for affordable housing, health care and child care. “We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for American families so that they have the chance not just to get by but to get ahead,” he said. Her newly named vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stood behind her and clapped. It is the first time Harris and Walz have appeared together. She said she set out to “find a partner who can help build this brighter future” and turned to introduce Walz to the audience, arguing that he is that partner her campaign has been seeking. Vice President Kamala Harris told a raucous crowd in Philadelphia on Tuesday that Democrats, while energized, have work to do to win in November. Harris went on to describe her presidential campaign as “not just a fight against Donald Trump,” but “a fight for the future.” Vice President Kamala Harris said Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was one of the finalists to be her running mate, will help Democrats win the key state in November. Harris called Shapiro a “dear, dear friend and an extraordinary leader.” Shapiro took the stage just before Harris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The vice president said with Shapiro’s help, “we will win Pennsylvania” — a key state in the path to the presidency. These are some of the excerpts from Vice President Kamala Harris’ expected speech during her first rally with her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.   Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are holding their first joint appearance at a rally in Philadelphia — kicking off their sprint across the electoral map. The candidates came out together on the stage to a roaring applause from the crowd. A former educator, Walz is currently in his second term as Minnesota governor and chairs the Democratic Governors Association. He is expected to lean on his biography to introduce himself to voters, many for the first time, according to excerpts of his remarks. He previously served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was a finalist on Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate short list, voiced support Tuesday to an enthusiastic crowd for Harris and her newly announced vice presidential pick, Tim Walz. “I’m going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America,” Shapiro said in Philadelphia, where the candidates were holding their first joint rally. He also praised Walz, calling him “a great man” and an “outstanding governor,” and urged the crowd to give the Minnesota governor “a whole lot of love.” “I’ll tell you what else — Tim Walz is a dear friend, and I want you to know Lori and I feel blessed to have Tim and Gwen in our lives,” Shapiro said. “They are outstanding public servants, and I can’t wait for you, Philly, the rest of this commonwealth and our entire country to get the chance to know the Walzes.” Watch here: Had things turned out differently Tuesday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would be taking his first steps on a national political stage. Instead, he’s the warm-up act. The rising Democratic star was beaten to Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential nomination by Tim Walz — but judging by the testimony of many people in the crowd here and the rapturous welcome he got when walking out to speak — Pennsylvanians are glad he’s staying home.  Shapiro is demonstrating the rapid-fire rhetoric that means he’s going to be seen as a future presidential prospect for Democrats whatever happens in November.  And as he turned his attention to Trump’s running mate JD Vance, Harris supporters, chanted, “He’s a weirdo! He’s a weirdo!” Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, practiced using a teleprompter ahead of taking the stage in Philadelphia for the first joint Harris-Walz rally, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. As CNN has reported, Walz raised the issue during his interview with Harris’ vetting team in recent days. He doesn’t use a teleprompter, the governor told the team, and doesn’t even have one — so if he were to become Harris’ pick, he would need to learn. The crowd is on its feet and coursing with enthusiasm inside the Liacouras Center at Temple University in Philadelphia, where Vice President Kamala Harris is minutes away from making the debut appearance with her running mate. But first, the audience is hearing from the Democrat she didn’t pick — Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Thunderous applause from the hometown crowd erupted as Shapiro took the stage, walking past blue signs declaring: “Harris/Walz.” “I love you Philly,” Shapiro said. “And you know what else I love? I love being your governor.” Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have raised more than $10 million since the Minnesota governor was announced as Harris’ VP pick Tuesday morning, according to the campaign. Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt touted it as “one of the campaign’s best fundraising days this cycle.” The campaign also said it expects Tuesday’s joint rally in Philadelphia to be the largest event to date for the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris and Walz are expected to be introduced at 5:30 p.m. ET, and the duo will hold their “first virtual grassroots fundraiser” following the rally. When Vice President Kamala Harris called Gov. Tim Walz this morning to inform him that he was her selection for her pick for vice president, he initially didn’t answer.  That’s because the phone blocked the caller ID from her government-issued phone, which is standard, a person familiar with the call tells CNN.  Harris had to phone Walz a second time – when he answered to accept the call and the offer.  When then-Rep. Tim Walz became the ranking member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Rep. Ann Kuster, a Democrat from New Hampshire, remembers he gave her a gift. Instead of the kind of ceremonial present many members had become accustomed to from their ranking member or chairman — fancy pens, maybe a little clock or collectible — Walz offered something that Kuster said she now sees as the perfect distillation of the practical politician he embodies: a sturdy wool blanket made in his home state of Minnesota.  “He gave us each this very, very heavy blanket made from his district,” Kuster said.  The blanket ended up serving a critical role in Kuster’s recovery after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot just a few years later. Its weight, she said, made it the only thing she could get sleep under while she was recovering from the trauma of that day.  “Just salt of the earth,” Kuster said of Walz and the gift he gave.  In Congress, members remember a colleague who hailed from a tough district but was still willing to take some difficult votes, such as advancing the Affordable Care Act, a decision that led to the defeat of many other Democrats from swing districts.  “He had to be relatable to people in his district, but there were core Democratic values that were expressed in acts of courage,” Takano said of the ACA vote.  Walz served on both the Agriculture and Veterans’ Affairs committees with Kuster, who remembers him as someone who could easily defuse tense situations with humor. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, who has known Walz for two decades, told CNN that “Tim is a no-nonsense guy. He takes his work super seriously but he doesn’t take himself too seriously, so he is great to work with.” Second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Gwen Walz, wife of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, spoke on the phone Tuesday. “Holy smokes!” Walz exclaims after Emhoff introduces himself. Watch video of the moment below: First lady Jill Biden offered her “congratulations” to Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen, after Vice President Kamala Harris choose him as her running mate, elevating the former teacher, congressman and Army National Guard veteran to join the Democratic ticket.  “National Guard family. Public School Educators. Governor and First Lady of MN. Our next VP and Second Lady - Congratulations Tim and Gwen 💕,” the first lady wrote on social media. Jill Biden herself served as second lady when the president was then-Vice President Joe Biden. The first lady has made some public appearances, including at the Paris Olympics, but has largely stayed out of the spotlight since President Biden bowed out of the 2024 race. A big, loud crowd is getting warmed up for Vice President Kamala Harris’ first joint appearance with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the Liacouras Center, the home of Temple basketball in Philadelphia. Harris supporters are wearing flashing blue, red and white bracelets and almost all seats in a venue that seats 10,000 for college games are filled and there’s a healthy gathering on the floor. Large banners hanging from the ceiling feature the new campaign logo – which has “Harris” written in white block capitals above “Walz” in a slightly smaller font against a blue background. Home state Sen. John Fetterman just took the stage. “I work with JD Vance and I am to confirm that he is a seriously weird dude,” Fetterman said of the GOP vice presidential nominee, borrowing the adjective that Walz coined for the Republican ticket that helped rocket the Minnesota governor to prominence and to the vice presidential nomination. The latest CNN Poll of Polls average of national polling shows a close general election race with no clear leader between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Trump holds 49% support in the average of five recent polls testing the matchup, while Harris holds 48%. The Poll of Polls includes an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released Tuesday that also finds no clear leader in a matchup between the candidates, with Harris taking 51% and Trump taking 48% among registered voters nationally. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll finds that Americans trust Harris over Trump to handle the issue of abortion (56% say Harris would do a better job, while 41% say Trump would) and the preservation of democracy (53% say Harris, 46% Trump). Americans prefer Trump on immigration (52% say he would better handle the issue, compared with 46% for Harris), with a closer split on who would better handle the economy (51% say Trump, 48% Harris). Gov. Tim Walz will lean on his personal biography and will try to draw contrasts between the Democratic ticket and former President Donald Trump in his first stump speech as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Walz will detail his rural upbringing in Nebraska, his Minnesota values, and his experience as a teacher, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks, introducing himself to voters – many of whom are learning about him for the first time. Walz will add, “Minnesota’s strength comes from our values — our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand. “These same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students, I took to Congress and the state capital, and now, Vice President Harris and I are running to take them to the White House,” he is expected to say. Walz will also serve as a hype man for the vice president, saying he “couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket” and help make Harris president. Harris, he will say, has “fought on the side of the American people,” pointing to her career as a prosecutor while also saying that she “brings joy to everything she does.” Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate was “a massive gift to Republicans.” “The reality is his progressive policies are going to cause Democrats to lose a lot of centrist voters,” Ramaswamy said in an interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. The biotech entrepreneur, who ended his bid for the GOP presidential nomination after a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses, argued that “Donald Trump is actually the moderate when it comes to policy on this race.” Ramaswamy, a surrogate for the Trump campaign, later added: “This provides an opening that resets the race after, admittedly, a rough couple of weeks for Republicans.” Former President Donald Trump responded directly to Vice President Kamala Harris’ new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling the pair “the most Radical Left duo in American history.” Republicans have spent the day working to define Walz as a progressive liberal, pointing to his record as governor.  “This is the most Radical Left duo in American history, “ Trump wrote on TruthSocial. “There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again.” Earlier Tuesday, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Harris’ decision to pick Walz “highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.” Former President Barack Obama served as “a sounding board” for Vice President Kamala Harris as she made her decision to select Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, a senior aide told CNN. Obama, whose relationship with Harris goes back nearly two decades, has communicated with her frequently since her whirlwind presidential campaign began two weeks ago. While Obama did not tip his hand on the scale, an aide said, he listened as she and her vetting team made arguments about her path toward winning the White House. In a statement Tuesday, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama praised the selection of Walz and drew an implicit contrast with the Republican ticket. They added: “By selecting Tim Walz to be her vice president from a pool of outstanding Democrats, Kamala Harris has chosen an ideal partner — and made it clear exactly what she stands for.” Vice President Kamala Harris posted a video on social media of the moment where she called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to ask him to be her running mate. Harris told the governor that she has enjoyed their work together so far and has the “utmost respect” for him and his dedication to the country. “We’re going to do this, we’re going to win and we’re going to unify our country and remind everyone that we are fighting for the future for everyone,” Harris said. “Let’s win this thing,” Walz later added. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate Tuesday, retired from the Army National Guard as a master sergeant after 24 years in uniform, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Master sergeant is one of the more senior ranks for enlisted soldiers. Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard, told CNN on Tuesday that while Walz “obtained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role,” he officially retired as a master sergeant in 2005. That’s one rank below command sergeant major because “he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.”  Walz is identified on his official biography page as “Command Sergeant Major Walz.”  In the Army, the command sergeant major is the senior enlisted leader in a battalion or higher unit echelons, enforcing training, performance and appearance standards. It’s not uncommon for an enlisted leader at that rank to be “conditionally promoted,” meaning they are promoted under the assumption they will complete the required professional military education to officially obtain that rank. If that professional military education is not completed, the service member reverts to their previously held rank — in Walz’s case, reverting to master sergeant after not completing the additional coursework at the Army Sergeants Major Academy.  It’s unclear why Walz did not complete the coursework. CNN has reached out to Walz’s office.  During his time with the Minnesota National Guard, Walz served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, working as a cannon crew member and field artillery senior sergeant, according to Augé. Walz was deployed to Vicenza, Italy, in 2003 as part of a security mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, according to Augé. “The battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey. Governor Walz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy, during his deployment. He returned to Minnesota in April, 2004,” Augé said. This post has been updated with information about Walz’s deployment. Early GOP attacks on Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz have criticized his handling of civil unrest after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, claimed Tuesday that the Minnesota governor “allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020.” And Trump has previously claimed that he took action to deploy the Minnesota National Guard over the objections of the state’s Democratic leaders.  CNN’s Daniel Dale fact-checked that assertion in July 2020, writing: A CNN interactive from that summer provides a closer look at the timeline of events in the city: Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020, and protests began the next day as demonstrators clashed with police. Some of those turned violent, with riots in Minneapolis leaving businesses destroyed. There was looting, violence and arson, along with peaceful protest, in Minneapolis on May 27. On May 28, Walz signed an executive order activating part of the Minnesota National Guard. Also that day, protesters lit the outside of the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct on fire.   Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, activated the entire Minnesota National Guard on May 30. “He activated the Minnesota National Guard at the request of the Mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before he talked to the White House,” Walz’s press secretary, Teddy Tschann, said in a statement to CNN at the time. As CNN’s fact check notes, Tschann said there were no buildings set on fire on the night of May 30, unlike the previous three nights. The Harris-Walz campaign released a video Tuesday highlighting newly announced vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s biography. The video, which runs just under 90 seconds, is narrated by the Minnesota governor, who talks about his service in the Army National Guard and time as an educator.  “I coached football and taught social studies for 20 years. And I tried to teach my students what small-town Nebraska taught me: respect, compromise and service to country,” Walz adds.   It’s something the campaign has leaned into heavily — earlier Tuesday, it posted a video on TikTok drawing a contrast with Walz’s GOP counterpart, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and playing up the governor’s rural roots. The TikTok post features video of Walz in office, with farm animals, on a football field, and in a helicopter, underscoring how the campaign plans to utilize his biography. Former President Bill Clinton calls Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz a “terrific choice” and said that he will “be a great vice president” in a statement issued Tuesday.  Harris chose Walz to be her running mate and the duo will appear together in their first joint rally in Philadelphia later today before visiting other battleground states this week. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Tuesday after Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate.  As friends and allies of Vice President Kamala Harris privately discussed her running mate finalists, one of the qualities of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mentioned most often: His background as a geography teacher and football coach.  Specifically, multiple conversations have compared Walz to Eric Taylor, the fictional West Texas football coach from the popular television series “Friday Night Lights.” Coach Taylor, played by actor Kyle Chandler, is portrayed as a wholesome family man in middle America who married his high school sweetheart and serves as a role model for the young men he coaches. Some of the motivational messages Taylor delivers to his team have become pop culture lore.  Rohini Kosoglu, a longtime policy adviser to Harris, tweeted one of them: “Clear Eyes, Full Heart, Can’t Lose.”   David Plouffe, senior adviser to the Harris-Walz campaign, said on CNN that both Harris and Walz are “optimists” who plan to infuse the party’s messaging and policies with positivity. Walz, he said, could help build on President Joe Biden’s support among older voters, and those in suburban, exurban and rural areas.  With the election home stretch overlapping with football season, allies expect those teacher-coach attributes to be on full display, particularly across the South.  “Who doesn’t want someone radiating positivity from the sidelines?” one quipped in a text message. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff will headline a fundraiser for the Harris campaign in Paris on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said.  Emhoff will visit Paris from Wednesday until next Monday as he’s set to lead the presidential delegation to the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics. While in Paris, he will also meet with government officials and senior leaders at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He will also speak at a roundtable to discuss efforts to promote education about the Holocaust and to combat antisemitism, as well as speak at an annual event commemorating the victims of the 1982 attack at a Jewish restaurant in Rue des Rosiers, which killed six people and injured 22 others.  First Lady Jill Biden was initially scheduled to headline a Paris fundraiser for President Joe Biden’s campaign when she traveled to France’s opening ceremony of the Olympics, but that plan was scrapped after her husband bowed out of the 2024 race. Emhoff has spent much of the past two weeks raising money for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and is set to join her in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, today as she kicks off a battleground state tour with her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz hadn’t been in the top tier of potential running mates for Kamala Harris until the past few weeks. But his selection to join the vice president on the Democratic ticket underscores both the power of social media and of being relatively affable and nondivisive. The fact that Harris selected a candidate who does well online shouldn’t be surprising — this is the campaign that has embraced “coconut tree” and “brat.” But is the Walz pick indicative of a campaign that is too online? That’s a fair question given that Harris skipped over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro in favor of Walz. Shapiro, who was long seen as a front-runner for the vice presidential pick, divided a lot of the online left over his perceived views on the Israelis and Palestinians. Notably, Walz shares many of those same views but received far less backlash than Shapiro, who is Jewish. One of the first rules when it comes to a vice presidential pick is to “Do no harm.” Harris likely did no harm with this pick. The big question now is whether she left points on the board by choosing Walz over Shapiro. Minnesota is likely not going to be competitive this fall. No Republican nominee for president has carried the state since 1972, and polling in the North Star State since Harris entered the race has shown that the streak is likely to continue. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, is almost certainly a must-win state for Harris. In fact, it is probably the most important swing state this cycle, and the polling there has been very tight. Shapiro holds a 61% favorable rating in Pennsylvania and outperformed Biden’s 2020 baseline by 14 points in 2022. What we can say, though, is that Walz is not likely to help Harris with many swing voters. He did less than a point better than Biden in Minnesota when he won reelection in 2022. In fact, Shapiro seems to have done better with White voters without a college degree in Pennsylvania than Walz did with the same demographic in his state two years ago. Read more about whether Harris left points on the board by choosing Walz. Minnesota, which has been led by Gov. Tim Walz since 2019, has had a healthy labor market since it recovered from a Covid-19 pandemic-induced shock in early 2020. The state’s unemployment rate was 2.9% in June, which tied for 11th lowest with four other states, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been at 3% or less since November 2021. That’s lower than the national unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in June and has mainly hovered in the mid- to high-3% range since early 2022. Likewise, a larger share of Minnesotans are in the labor force, compared to their peers nationwide. The state’s participation rate, which counts both those working and looking for jobs, was 67.8% in June, the fifth highest in the US. The national rate was 62.6%.  Under Walz, the state has also enjoyed a healthy budget surplus, which has allowed the governor to enact many of his progressive policy proposals. The 2024-25 biennium budget is projected to end with a surplus of $3.7 billion, according to the Minnesota Management and Budget agency’s latest projection in February. That’s an increase of $1.3 billion from the agency’s projection from November. Tax revenue, especially from corporations, was also higher than previously projected, according to the agency. However, Minnesota is still expected to spend more than it collects in revenue in the current budget term and the next one. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Tuesday reacted publicly for the first time to Vice President Kamala Harris’ choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, arguing the decision “highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.”  Speaking to reporters aboard his plane in Philadelphia, Vance argued Harris “listened to the Hamas wing of her own party in selecting a nominee.” The Trump campaign has tried to argue that by not selecting Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Harris caved to more progressive members of the Democratic Party who ardently oppose Israel’s handling of its war in Gaza. Shapiro is Jewish and has been critical of some demonstrators who have protested Israel’s war against Hamas.  Vance said he left Walz a voicemail this morning after learning he was Harris’ pick.   “I didn’t get him, but I just said, ‘Look, congratulations, look forward to a robust conversation, and enjoy the ride.’ And maybe he’ll call me back, maybe he won’t,” Vance said.  Republicans moved quickly Tuesday to try to define Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen as her running mate. The former president’s campaign, which has spent the last several days compiling opposition research on Walz, plans to attack him as someone who is more liberal than both Harris and President Biden, with a key focus on his record as governor for the last four years, senior Trump campaign advisers and people close to the former president told CNN. Trump’s advisers said that while they will pull on details from his 12 years in Congress, their goal is to paint Walz — a former teacher and Army National Guard veteran — as someone who has been in lockstep with progressives over the last four years and a key champion of the Biden administration’s policies. Key focal points in their expected attacks include… Progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar congratulated Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on his selection as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, promoted Walz’s policies in a post on X, saying: “Our North Star state Governor has signed universal school meals, paid family and sick leave, marijuana legalization, and protections for reproductive rights into law.” “Bringing Minnesota nice to the ticket,” she added. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told CNN’s Kristen Holmes on Tuesday that he wants to debate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz but only after Walz officially becomes the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Vance added, “Would it shock me if the Democrats pulled another switcheroo, no it wouldn’t. So look, we’re going to wait until they actually nominate Kamala Harris and Tim Walz before we do any debates. And then of course we want to have a robust debate.”  Harris announced Walz as her running mate Tuesday morning. Rep. Dean Phillips argued that Democrats “have to start refocusing on the bread basket of America” to win the 2024 election — and Gov. Tim Walz is the person to carry the message. The Democratic lawmaker from Minnesota, who previously ran for president in the primaries against President Joe Biden, said this includes winning over key areas, such as the Great Plains and the Midwest. Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. Phillips said he is excited about Walz, calling him a “decent, outstanding guy.” As governor, Walz’s policies were “downright normal,” Phillips said, referencing attacks from Republicans that Walz’s record as the leader of the state has been very progressive. “Of course he’ll be positioned as an uber progressive, but the fact is, if you look at his record in Congress, if you look at his common-sense approach to things, I think people are going to be awfully, awfully pleased at his decency and competency,” Phillips said. Pennsylvania looms large in the 2024 election, despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to pass over Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. Harris will unveil her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, at a rally in Philadelphia later today, which is the top media market for presidential ad spending so far in 2024. And Pennsylvania has seen more ad spending than any other battleground state, more than twice as much as the next closest, Michigan. According to AdImpact data, presidential campaigns and allied outside groups from both parties have combined to spend about $51.7 million on advertising in the Philadelphia market since the start of the year through today, more than any other media market. This includes advertising that was aired in support of President Biden before he withdrew from the race. Here, Democrats have outspent Republicans by about $29.6 million to $22 million. The second closest media market behind Philadelphia is Atlanta, which has seen about $35.6 million total in presidential ad spending so far. Two other Pennsylvania media markets — Pittsburgh and Harrisburg — are among the top 10. And Pennsylvania leads all battleground states in ad spending by a wide margin. From the start of the year through today, campaigns and outside groups from both parties have combined to spend nearly $124 million advertising in the commonwealth. Democrats have outspent Republicans by about $66 million to $57.8 million statewide so far. And Pennsylvania is far ahead of the battleground state that has seen the second most ad spending, Michigan, at about $58.8 million all spending combined. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed enthusiasm around Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling it “an excellent decision.” “Vice President Harris made an excellent decision in Gov. Walz as her running mate. Together, they will govern effectively, inclusively, and boldly for the American people. They won’t back down under tight odds, either - from healthcare to school lunch,” the congresswoman wrote on X. Under his tenure as governor, Walz signed into law a bill providing free school breakfast and lunch, a policy that Walz has made a cornerstone in his appeal to make Minnesota “the best state for kids to grow up,” as Walz said in a release upon the bill signing. Ocasio-Cortez also joked in another X post that Democrats are in “disconcerting levels of array” in response to the fact that both she and Sen. Joe Manchin are on the same page on Walz. Ocasio-Cortez was a key member of President Biden’s 2020 Democratic coalition, which was seeking to unite the progressive and moderate factions of the party.  Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Vice President Kamala Harris’ bringing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on to the Democratic ticket exacerbates partisan tensions in his first reaction to the news on social media.  In a social media post, Kennedy pointed to Walz’s attacks on Donald Trump as an example of sowing division, while pitching himself as a unifier.  “America’s political divide sharpens with the pick of Tim Walz for Dem VP. He called Trump supporters “fascist” and “weird,” and they in turn are calling him worse than that. The need for an independent President who stands outside the divide and can unify the country is more compelling than ever,” he wrote on X.  Walz has previously referred to Trump as “fascist” and “weird,” but has explicitly said he does not see Republican voters in those terms. President Joe Biden has praised Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for picking Tim Walz as her running mate, saying their ticket will be a “powerful voice for working people.” “They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy. And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation,” Biden wrote. “It’s time for all Democrats—and indeed all Americans—committed to freedom, democracy, and American leadership in the world to rally behind the Harris-Walz ticket. Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy. That moment is now,” Biden wrote in a social media post. The president added that he has known Walz for nearly two decades as he listed out the toplines of his journey into public politics. And after Biden lauded Harris’ decision to pick Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, he also posted a fundraising appeal for the new Democratic ticket on social media. “Chip in now to help get @KamalaHarris and @Tim_Walz to the White House,” Biden wrote with a campaign donation link. House GOP Chair Elise Stefanik slammed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as a “failed Member of Congress and a failed Governor,” as top congressional Republicans label him as a “radical.” Republicans focused their attacks on progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders’ support for Walz and the governor’s handling of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. GOP Senator Lindsey Graham also noted the governor’s handling of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, saying, “Not only did Governor Tim Walz sign legislation giving free college and free health care to illegal immigrants, but he sat on the sidelines and watched Minneapolis burn for four days straight. Weird and dumb.” Republican Senator Joni Ernst called Walz “Bernie Sanders’ choice for VP,” and said the Democratic ticket is “the most radical ticket in American history.” For his part, Sanders did announce his support for Walz as Harris’ running mate this morning, tweeting, “@Tim_Walz is a great asset to @KamalaHarris’ winning campaign & administration. He is a former public school teacher, football coach, and strong union supporter. As governor, he delivered for working families in MN. As VP, he will deliver for the working families of the US.” President Joe Biden spoke by phone Tuesday morning with Kamala Harris ahead of her official announcement that she’d selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. He then spoke with Walz to congratulate him on being selected, according to Emilie Simons, a White House spokesperson.  Biden is in a unique position: he has served as both president and vice president, which would inform his insights and advice to both Harris and Walz. When Biden was asked last week whether he had consulted with Harris about the choice, he said yes. But asked what qualities she should look for in a selection, he demurred: “I’ll let her work that out.” Gov. Tim Walz remains under his gubernatorial protection via Minnesota state police as he makes his way to Philadelphia for a joint rally with Vice President Kamala Harris. When he touches down in Philadelphia hours from now, US Secret Service officially takes over his security, a source familiar with the process tells CNN. Walz will be taken through a full onboarding process, as is custom for all new Secret Service protectees.  Walz will have a full Secret Service detail when he departs the rally this evening, the source said. His wife, Gwen Walz, will also now receive Secret Service protection. As a member of Congress, Tim Walz was one of just 17 Democratic lawmakers who voted to hold then-Obama Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over refusing to comply with a subpoena over the body’s investigation into the Fast and Furious scandal. “To do its job, Congress must have access to all the information it needs to make independent, sound judgments on behalf of the American people,” Walz said in a statement at the time, according to the Star Tribune.  Walz’ vote may not have come as a surprise given the political landscape of his district— he successfully flipped his seat from Republicans when he was elected to Congress in 2006. When he left Congress to assume the governorship, the seat flipped back. Holder, for his part, led the vetting process that Walz eventually emerged from as the party’s vice presidential nominee.  A reminder on the fast and furious scandal: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – in cooperation with legal gun dealers – traced weapons of low-level buyers, who they believed were acquiring them illegally for Mexican drug cartels. Nearly 2,000 firearms from the program went missing, some turning up at killing scenes in Mexico – and at the site of a December 2010 gun battle in Arizona that left US Border Patrol agent Brian A. Terry dead. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a critical swing vote in the closely divided Senate, praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, as the “real deal,” and someone who can “bring balance to the Democratic Party.” The Trump campaign has released its first reaction video to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ decision to pick Tim Walz as her running mate. The video, which is being billed as the first “reaction ad” from the campaign, will be part of an upcoming ad buy. A Trump campaign source did not provide details on where or when it would air. It has already been pushed by the campaign and Republicans on social media. “Tim Walz will be a rubber stamp for Kamala’s dangerously liberal agenda,” a narrator says. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance will speak at midday in Philadelphia during a campaign stop in the city. Donald Trump’s running mate will deliver remarks just hours after Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz as her running mate, and hours before Harris and Walz will hold their first in-person rally in the city. On Wednesday, both Vance and the Harris campaign will hold events in the Detroit area and Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  CNN’s Arit John contributed reporting in this post. Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will address campaign and 2024 Democratic National Convention staff during an all-hands meeting Tuesday that is expected to be held at 6:15 p.m. ET, a source familiar tells CNN. The duo will hold their first joint appearance at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday night that will kick off their sprint across the electoral map. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is en route to an airport in Minnesota and will then head to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he is set to campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris this evening, a source familiar with the matter says. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pick, has a long and storied political history, going from a centrist member of Congress to a progressive governor with a Democratic trifecta in his state. Over more than a decade in Congress, he assembled a fairly centrist voting record. As a first-time campaigner, he opposed a ban on same-sex marriage and supported abortion rights. Once in Congress, he balanced that out with comparatively more conservative positions on gun rights, which resulted in scoring a National Rifle Association endorsement. Walz has since fallen out of favor with the gun lobby over his support for gun safety actions as governor. During his first term as governor, Walz had to grapple with divided government and slim majorities in the state Legislature. But in 2022, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (as the state’s Democratic Party is known) won control of both the state House and Senate, giving Walz’s party a slim “trifecta” of government control. That allowed Walz to sign into law a raft of expansive social welfare programs such as free lunch for public school students, expansive access to Medicaid, increased protections that allow workers to unionize and expanded medical and family paid family leave. Minnesota Democrats were also able to codify abortion rights into law, increase transgender rights protections, pass a marijuana legalization bill and install new gun safety laws. Progressives hailed the work as an example of all that Democrats could achieve. Walz is also a former teacher and Army National Guard veteran. As the Harris campaign seeks to introduce voters to Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, there’s one notable biographical item that is sure to be key in the coming 90-plus days: Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen, went through the in-vitro fertilization process to welcome their daughter, Hope. The Biden-turned-Harris campaign has made the fight for reproductive rights a centerpiece of its messaging, with Harris personally leading that charge in contrast with Republicans. Earlier this year, Alabama’s Supreme Court said that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death – a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on infertility treatments. While the state’s legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats have argued that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation.  Frmer President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama heralded Vice President Kamala Harris’ choice of Gov. Tim Walz as a running mate, highlighting his “values and integrity.” They continued, “Governor Walz doesn’t just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud.” CNN had reported that President Barack Obama was among the people Harris consulted with as she made her choice.  “Tim’s signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,” the Obamas said. Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out an early vision for the Democratic ticket in the official news release unveiling Tim Walz as her vice presidential pick as the campaign enters a new stage. The campaign touted both Harris’ and Walz’s record on several policy issues including women’s reproductive rights and the economy — and vowed that the pair will continue to draw a stark contrast between former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance. Harris and Walz “will to crisscross the country to outline the choice between two very different visions for the future: Vice President Harris and Governor Walz, who are running to move the country forward, not backward — or Donald Trump and JD Vance, who are running to enact their extreme and dangerous Project 2025 agenda that will roll back Americans’ rights and freedoms, hurt the middle class, and threaten our democracy.”  Harris and Walz will make their first joint campaign appearance at a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, later today. This event marks the first day of a five-day barnstorm to introduce the Harris-Walz ticket to voters in key battleground states. Vice President Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential pick Tim Walz is known for bonding with rural voters who other Democrats can’t reach. That’s one big reason why the Minnesota governor, who is largely unknown to most Americans, now finds himself on a major party ticket in the most intense sprint to an election in modern history following President Joe Biden’s late decision to abandon his reelection bid. The selection of Walz reveals the geographic and demographic key to the 2024 election. If Harris is to win, her path will most likely run through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Donald Trump captured in 2016 only to lose them to Biden in 2020. Presently, they are threatening to tilt back to the Republicans again this year. History suggests that vice presidential nominees rarely deliver a state to their ticket-mates as voters tend to focus on potential presidents. But Walz, a friendly and jocular leader whose urbanity doesn’t conceal an acidic partisan tongue, provides a political complement to Harris. The vice president will hope to perform strongly among minority voters in cities like Detroit, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Milwaukee and to run up Democratic numbers among suburban and women voters alienated by Trump. Walz may be able to help most by reaching out to rural Americans wavering over a vote for the ex-president but who are not yet convinced by the new Democratic nominee or may find her too liberal. Keep reading about how Walz’s pick could shape up. Vice President Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, capping the Midwestern Democrat’s short but swift ascent from a relative unknown to a leading driver of the Democratic attacks on Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda.  Before Walz was elected governor in 2018, he served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans. Walz, 60, is also a former high school teacher and football coach who served in the Army National Guard.  Harris and Walz will appear together in Philadelphia later on Tuesday for the new Democratic ticket’s first joint rally. See more of Gov. Walz’s life in pictures “White Dudes for Harris” said its X account was labeled as spam just a week after it had been locked and then reinstated on the Elon Musk-owned platform. Musk has publicly endorsed Harris’ opponent, Donald Trump. A leader of the political organizing group for Kamala Harris claims there is a double standard on Musk’s platform, despite the billionaire’s long-standing claim to be a “free-speech absolutist.” Some context: X first locked the “White Dudes for Harris” account during a massive fundraiser with 190,000 participants and more than $4 million raised on July 29, according to a post by the organizers. It was subsequently reinstated the following day. “White Dudes for Harris” is one of several coalition groups that have popped up in support of Kamala Harris. The campaign said groups like Black Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris and White Dudes for Harris raised more than $20 million. CNN has reached out to X for comment, but the company rarely responds to press inquiries. The Harris campaign has made its first TikTok since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, welcoming him to the race.  The 21-second post features Walz drawing a contrast with his GOP counterpart, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and playing up his rural roots.  It features video of Walz in office, with farm animals, on a football field, and in a helicopter, underscoring how the campaign plans to utilize his personal biography. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the newly-selected running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris, said in a post on X Tuesday that it is “the honor of a lifetime to join @kamalaharris in this campaign.” Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a contender in Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pool, expressed his support of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Giffords is Kelly’s wife and once served as a House member in Arizona. For more than 40 years, Democrats have nominated presidential and vice presidential nominees who attended law school. That ended Tuesday when Vice President Kamala Harris selected Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. He is the first Democrat on a presidential ticket since 1980 to have not attended law school. He has a masters in educational leadership. Former President Jimmy Carter was the last Democrat on the ticket to have not attended law school. Former Vice President Al Gore left Vanderbilt Law School early to pursue a political career, so he never became a lawyer. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz confirmed their new status as running mates on social media. His bio on X now says, “Running to win this thing with @KamalaHarris.” On Instagram, Harris shared a message describing her decision to select Walz as her running mate. “I am proud to announce that I’ve asked @walzforgovernor to be my running mate,” she wrote. “One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It’s personal.” New merchandise launched by the Harris-Walz campaign marks a dramatic break in the style of the Biden-turned-Harris campaign.  Biden campaign signage was in the sans-serif typeface “Decimal” and serifed “Mercury Text,” both designed by Hoefler&Co in consultation with Biden campaign senior creative adviser Robyn Kanner.  When the Biden signage rolled into Harris branding 16 days ago, there was a notable continuity in style in the updated signage.  The new typeface and color scheme unveiled Tuesday represents a notable change as Vice President Kamala Harris moves forward with her new running mate, and harkens back to her 2020 “KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE” sans-serif logo. Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, writing on social media that she’s “thrilled” to see him join the ticket. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was a contender to be Kamala Harris’ running mate, praised the vice president’s choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday. Buttigieg also served in the military and has spent time campaigning for Harris in the Midwest, including in Michigan where he now resides with his family. He is in Maine on Tuesday, promoting the Biden-Harris infrastructure agenda. Most Americans are unfamiliar with Tim Walz, an NPR/PBS/Marist poll released Tuesday finds. A 71% majority of US adults have never heard of Walz or are unsure how to rate him – making him even less of a known quantity than fellow running mate finalists Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro. The poll, conducted August 1-4, finds that 17% of US adults view Walz favorably, with 12% viewing him unfavorably. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll gives Walz a 31% favorability rating among Democrats, with just 7% in the party rating him unfavorably. Republican VP pick JD Vance, meanwhile, has seen his ratings fall underwater, with 34% viewing him favorably and 43% unfavorably. In July, the public was closely split — 28% viewed him favorably and 31% unfavorably. A spokesperson for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro confirms to CNN that Shapiro will still attend Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Philadelphia tonight. He was one of the finalists to be Harris’ running mate. Shortly after Vice President Kamala Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, the Harris campaign updated its website to reflect the newly formed ticket. Several Harris-Walz merch items were also posted for sale including mugs, t-shirts, stickers and yard signs.  The Trump campaign has spent the last several days compiling opposition research on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in addition to other leading contenders to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, and plans to attack Walz as someone who is more liberal than both Harris and President Joe Biden — with a key focus on his record as governor for the last four years, senior Trump campaign advisers and people close to former President Donald Trump tell CNN. Trump’s advisers said that while they will pull on details ranging from both his years in Congress as well as governor, their goal is to paint him as someone who has been in lockstep with progressives over the last four years and a key champion of the Biden administration’s policies. Key focal points in their expected attacks include arguing Walz has taken an extremely liberal stance on the border, painting him as anti-gun and anti-cop, tying him to Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, linking him to the Biden administration’s economic policies, and questioning his record on foreign policy. The campaign also plans to lean heavily into Harris’ decision against selecting Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her vice presidential pick – even as Trump’s advisers and many people close to the former president privately acknowledge they were more concerned about Shapiro being on the ticket given the importance of winning Pennsylvania, the sources said. Trump’s team plans to argue that Harris listened to far-left voices who were concerned about how Shapiro would handle the war between Israel and Hamas. In a text message to supporters, Vice President Kamala Harris said she was “pleased to share” that she had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join the Democratic campaign as her running mate. Harris also used the message to ask supporters to support the campaign. “Now, would you pitch in $20 to welcome Tim to our ticket? We are relying on your immediate support to defeat Donald Trump and JD Vance,” she said. “It means the world to me, to Tim, and to our families to have you in our corner,” the Democratic presidential candidate added. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, hailed her ultimate decision to tap Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday. “Lori and I consider Tim and Gwen to be good friends of ours and we are excited for them and for the country to get to know the great people we know them to be,” Shapiro said in a statement on X. Read his full statement below: Vice President Kamala Harris told Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz that they are the underdogs in the 2024 presidential race – but that they are confident that together they have a winning message on reducing costs for the middle class and protecting freedom. Vice President Kamala Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz leaned heavily on his experience and personal biography and their chemistry, a source close to the process said. And she found his biography compelling: a background as a high school teacher and football coach, his service in the Army National Guard, and his roots in rural America, viewing his story as one that will appeal to voters in crucial midwestern battleground states.  As Harris deliberated, one of her most crucial decision factors was her strong personal rapport with Walz, believing he will be a trustworthy partner in campaigning, and possibly, in governing. On Capitol Hill, there is widespread excitement for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’ selection as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate. In conversations with several aides across the ideological spectrum, Walz is seen as a champion of progressive policies who delivers and packages his message in a way where he still appeals to many voters in the middle of the country. When asked about Walz, Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois, a progressive member, sent a GIF of a dancing penguin, a sign she said he was happy with the news. When he was in Congress, Walz represented Minnesota’s first congressional district. He consistently won races in a tough district even in 2016 when Donald Trump won the district by 15 points. His old district is now represented by Republican Rep. Brad Finstad. Walz spent a lot of time in Congress focused on mental healthcare access for veterans and served as the top Democrat on the Veteran’s Affairs committee in the 115th Congress. At the time he was elected to Congress, he was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve. Activists and organizers in the key battleground state of Georgia are applauding Vice President Kamala Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Luis Zaldivar organizes immigrant communities in the Peach State and says Walz is a unifying choice.  Georgia-based activist Hillary Holley, the Executive Director of the national organization Care in Action, describes Walz as a “care champion” with legislative victories to back it up. Vice President Kamala Harris has now personally informed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz she has selected him as her running mate, a source familiar with the matter said. Harris informed Walz via a video call. They are expected to appear together in their first joint rally later today in Philadelphia. As Vice President Kamala Harris entered the final stretch of deliberating over her vice presidential running pick, the Harris campaign was armed with research, vetting materials and polling on the finalists – data that would all help to inform the vice president’s political decision of a lifetime.  None of the three finalists – Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly – were shown in the polling data as moving the Harris-Trump national match up beyond the margins, two sources familiar said. The same was the case in a range of the most critical battleground states.  Both Shapiro and Kelly were shown to improve the Democratic ticket’s chances against Donald Trump in Pennsylvania and Arizona, respectively, but those improvements were only on the margins, the source added. As word spread that Vice President Kamala Harris had chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Walz’s neighbors in St. Paul have gathered outside his home to witness a piece of political history in their own backyard.  Dog walker, joggers and nearby residents were heard sharing in their excitement over the news and praising Harris’ choice.  A few cars driving by the house have honked their horns in celebration.  Sue Ver Steeg, a Minneapolis resident who came to the governor’s house, told CNN she’s excited and relieved about the pick.  Nick Arnosti is a St. Paul resident who found about the news when he rode his bike by Walz’s house on his way to work and saw the crowd gathered. He said he’s excited about the ticket and feels lucky to be able to witness the moment.  “Yeah, it’s pretty crazy. You know, I wasn’t necessarily expecting it,” he said. “It’s a pretty cool experience.”  Donald Trump’s campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in a statement Tuesday, calling him a “West Coast wannabe” who has spent “his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State.” “While Walz pretends to support Americans in the Heartland, when the cameras are off, he believes that rural America is ‘mostly cows and rocks’. From proposing his own carbon-free agenda, to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide. If Walz won’t tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American’s nightmare,” she added. The Trump campaign on Tuesday sent its first fundraising blast attacking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shortly after CNN and other outlets began reporting that Vice President Kamala Harris had selected him as her running mate.  The text included a link to the Trump campaign’s fundraising page, which claimed Walz “would be the worst VP in history” and labeled him as being more “dangerously liberal” than Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris’ VP pick Tim Walz oversaw cutting-edge clean energy policy as governor of Minnesota. As part of a Democratic trifecta in the state house, senate and governor’s office, Walz signed a law last year that aims to make 100% of Minnesota’s electricity clean by 2040. The law narrowly passed the Minnesota state senate and was signed by Walz in February 2023. The law compels utilities that provide electricity in Minnesota to switch from polluting sources of electricity like coal and natural gas to clean sources, including wind, solar, battery storage, hydropower and clean hydrogen. Under the law, utilities need to switch to generating 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and get 80% of the way there by 2030. Minnesota’s largest utilities have voiced support for having to move quickly to zero-carbon energy but have also acknowledged the switch will be challenging. And earlier this summer, Walz signed a separate bill to speed up energy permitting projects in Minnesota and get more clean energy onto the grid. Passing a similar bill at the federal level has been elusive in Congress. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz emerged from the most accelerated vice presidential search in modern history as Vice President Kamala Harris’ preferred governing partner, with Harris impressed “by his authenticity,” a person close to the process told CNN.  While the two did not enjoy much of a previous relationship, aides said Harris grew increasingly enthused by how Walz genuinely carried himself and found a warm chemistry with him during a final meeting Sunday at her residence at the Naval Observatory.  In a remarkable two-week period, Walz ascended from a third-tier candidate to a final contender in the view of Harris and her vetting team. He was propelled by support from across the Democratic Party, progressive and moderate groups, in a sophisticated whirlwind campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris’ “chemistry” with her newly-selected running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was “really important and it really clicked for both of them,” a source close to Walz told CNN. Vice President Kamala Harris will be making calls to the final vice presidential contenders this morning after selecting Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, people familiar with the matter said. She’ll inform those who she didn’t pick to be her running mate and thank them for participating in the process, the person said. Over the weekend, Harris met with Walz, Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly for interviews. The meeting with Walz had “great chemistry,” the person said, and the two got along well.  Many of former President Donald Trump’s allies had feared that Vice President Kamala Harris would ultimately choose popular Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate, potentially giving her an advantage in the critical battleground state. While Trump has repeatedly said that vice presidential candidates don’t matter, he and his running mate, JD Vance, had zeroed in on Shapiro in their recent attacks, an indication of the threat that Shapiro could pose to the campaign. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has been selected as Kamala Harris’ running mate, according to multiple sources. Walz spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard, which included a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks, working as an educator and coach, before shockingly defeating a six-term Republican incumbent congressman in 2006, a wave year for Democrats. Walz remained when the tide rolled out, reelected to the typically red district repeatedly until he left to run for his current job in 2018. (The seat quickly returned to GOP control after his departure.) Walz’s six years in charge of Minnesota have seen a remarkable series of political and social upheaval. First came the Covid-19 pandemic and then, in its midst, the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, which set off global anti-racist demonstrations. Walz navigated it all – alongside more usual complaints over wasteful spending – well enough that, by the beginning of 2023, he was leading a Democratic trifecta in the state government. In the time leading up to his selection as Harris’ running mate, Walz had first been an outspoken defender of Joe Biden following his disastrous debate performance as calls for the president to end his reelection bid escalated. When Biden did drop out, Walz endorsed Harris the next day and has since emerged as a reliable, energetic and cutting advocate for the presumptive Democratic nominee. Picking Walz underscores the Harris campaign’s focus on a path to victory that puts a premium on the “blue wall” states of the Midwest. Minnesota is slightly outside that sphere, but Walz, once a high school football coach, has evolved during his time in office into something of a progressive populist folk hero – the exact kind of pugilistic voice that Democrats taking on Trump are keen to highlight. He has over the past week delivered a handful of memorable haymakers against Republicans, though his most notable contribution has been a determination to label the GOP, especially its presidential ticket of Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz has referred to the duo as “weird dudes,” before lighting into their political agenda. Read more about Walz’s career and pick as Harris’ VP. Vice President Kamala Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate illustrates the power of social media. Walz had not been in the top tier of basically anyone’s list until the past few weeks.  He became an online sensation thanks to his “happy go lucky” Midwestern manner and his recent attacks on Republicans as “weird,” which seem to have stuck.  It’s not clear, however, that Walz will be of any help to Harris in the key battleground states. Recent polling suggests that Minnesota is not expected to be all that competitive.  Additionally, Walz has not shown much of an ability to win over swing voters when running statewide. While other potential Harris running mates (Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro) greatly outperformed Biden’s 2020 baseline in their most recent elections, Walz did less than a point better than Biden when he won a second term in 2022. Still, Walz is unlikely to hurt the ticket. He did better than most Minnesota Democrats two years ago, which is very different from Ohio Sen. JD Vance – Donald Trump’s running mate. Vance was the worst-performing statewide Republican winner in the 2022 midterm elections. Before he got his start in politics, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, reportedly chosen on Tuesday to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, was a longtime educator – just like his wife. Gwen Walz has taught in public, alternative and migrant schools, as well as prisons. She also served as an administrator and coordinator at Mankato Area Public Schools, a school district in the congressional district her husband represented from 2007 to 2019. Her first public event as Minnesota first lady was a rally in support of voting rights restoration for felons. She has also toured state prisons and helped recruit an assistant commissioner working to install a new college curriculum behind prison walls, among other things, according to a report from Minnesota Public Radio. Read more about her here. Former President Donald Trump’s team has begun attacking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz moments after CNN reported that Vice President Kamala Harris had chosen Walz as her running mate. Campaign sources told CNN that they believe Walz’s selection will help with their argument that Harris is a radical liberal. Walz had emerged as a liberal favorite in the mix. “Don’t ever shy away from our progressive values. One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness,” Walz said recently during remarks to the White Dudes for Harris Zoom fundraiser. On social media, the campaign and super PAC, MAGA Inc, immediately started pushing some of the research it had been gathering on Walz while it prepared for Harris’ ultimate decision, calling him an “incompetent liberal.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who CNN has reported is Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate pick, was a “staff favorite,” one source at Harris’ Wilmington, Delaware campaign headquarters said.  Staffers have been excitedly standing by for the vice presidential announcement, sources say, including the small circle of staffers preparing for the Walz rollout. There was little sleep last night, the staffer said, as the team awaited the news – capping a whirlwind 16-day period since President Joe Biden’s team became Harris’ campaign.  As Vice President Kamala Harris decided to pick Tim Walz as her running mate, according to sources, CNN’s John King explains why the Minnesota governor may have emerged as the right choice for the Democratic ticket. The reason for the pick includes factors such as “comfort level” and that Harris believes Walz would be a “good governing partner,” King said. As her Republican rival Donald Trump labels her as “dangerously liberal,” Walz will be able to defend that, King said. “We’re in such uncharted territory with a campaign this late, with Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick having a more of a rocky rollout. And so if you’ve watched, Gov. Walz has impressed everybody,” King said. As the vice presidential candidate, Walz can go to a smaller market TV while Harris focuses on national picture, King explained. As she was going through the vetting process, Vice President Kamala Harris was impressed, in part, by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s “happy go lucky” warrior and joyful presence. Vice President Kamala Harris grew increasingly comfortable with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in the final days of the selection process, people familiar with the search said, elevating the plainspoken former congressman, teacher and commander in the Army National Guard to join the Democratic ticket and help lead the party’s fight to defeat Donald Trump. Harris will make her call with Walz, which will be turned into an official announcement to be sent to supporters today.  A small team from the Harris campaign was standing by near the Minnesota governor’s mansion to greet him and fly with him to Philadelphia, where he is set to appear tonight with Harris at their first joint rally of the campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris has made a decision for her running mate, with four people close to the process saying Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota is her choice.  A former educator, Walz is currently in his second term as Minnesota governor and chairs the Democratic Governors Association. He previously served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans.  He has over the past week delivered a handful of memorable haymakers against Republicans, though his most notable contribution has been a determination to label the GOP, especially its presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz has referred to the duo as “weird dudes,” before lighting into their political agenda.   The phrase has stuck, becoming a central meme in the new, post-Biden version of the campaign, a development that is delighting Democrats and apparently frustrating many on the right.    During recent remarks at a “White Dudes for Harris” fundraiser, Walz made a rough-and-ready case for the vice president before would-be small-dollar donors.  Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is closely monitoring Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate decision, two sources close to Trump told CNN. While advisers maintain that they don’t believe the pick will be that impactful in the race long term, they have been collecting opposition research on the top contenders, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.  Some Trump allies have expressed concern about Shapiro’s potential to deliver Pennsylvania to Democrats in November, however, a Trump adviser brushed off that notion, saying that Shapiro had yet to be fully vetted on a national stage.  As Trump has tried out new attack lines on Harris, including questioning her ethnicity, the campaign intends to continue to paint her as a radical Democrat, linking her to President Joe Biden’s policies, particularly on crime, immigration, and inflation. The Secret Service is standing by to quickly launch protection for Vice President Kamala Harris’ expected running mate on Tuesday.  The Democratic nominee for vice president is expected to receive a full Secret Service protective detail, USSS spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told CNN.  Secret Service is staffed with special agents and resources at field offices near where each final contender lives, Guglielmi said, and the permanent CNOS team “will be activated once the person is announced.” The new protectee is receiving Secret Service protection at a moment of heightened scrutiny for the agency just weeks after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump – and days after the agency’s director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the fallout.  As she has been weighing one of the most consequential decisions of her political career, Vice President Kamala Harris has been relying on a tight circle of aides and confidantes for advice and perspective, people familiar with the deliberations said. She has faced an onslaught of views, both in public and private, amid the interviews she conducted at the Naval Observatory over the weekend. But amid the storm, she has sought to limit the circle of actual decision-making to her closest advisers. Others who have offered their advice over the course of the process include former attorney general Eric Holder, who captained the vetting process through his law firm. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who leaves for Paris this week to attend the Olympics closing ceremony, has also acted as a central sounding board.  Former President Barack Obama has consulted with Harris at points since she emerged as the Democratic standard-bearer, though he has not advocated for a particular name as a running mate, a person familiar with the matter said. When President Joe Biden was asked last week whether he had consulted with Harris about the choice, he said yes. But asked what qualities she should look for in a selection, he demurred: “I’ll let her work that out,” he said. Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip with her soon-to-be-announced running mate to Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday has been postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby, a campaign official said.  This marks the second Harris trip impacted by the tropical storm this week. The vice president is also postponing a Friday stop in Savannah, Georgia.  Campaign officials have yet to detail when the events will be rescheduled. The stunning transformation of the 2024 presidential race will reach new heights Tuesday when Vice President Kamala Harris unveils her running mate after a sequence of events that left Republican nominee Donald Trump flailing. Harris is due to join her vice presidential pick at a rally in Philadelphia that will kick off a joint sprint across an electoral map expanded by President Joe Biden’s shelving of his own reelection bid just over two weeks ago. In the final hours of her search after a compressed vetting period, Harris narrowed in on two candidates — Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, 51, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, sources told CNN, although Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon. Shapiro is a rising Democratic star whose popularity in the commonwealth could be an asset to Harris in perhaps the most vital swing state. Walz is an experienced progressive leader whose profile could help shore up the midwestern blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, that may represent Harris’ best route to the Oval Office. The theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy’s momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden’s age and acuity in a potential second term is moot. While the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday — outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out — hinted at potential new twists to come before November. Harris’ final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off. Read Collinson’s full analysis on Harris as she is set to announce her VP pick. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has no public events on his schedule today, according to a copy of his schedule obtained from CNN affiliate WCCO. Walz and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro are the two candidates left in Vice President Kamala Harris’ search for her running mate, according to previous reporting. Harris is expected to announce her decision today and will later hold a rally with her new running mate in Philadelphia. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to attend a fundraiser in California on Sunday, a source familiar with the event said. The event is expected to take place in the San Francisco area, the source said, and will come on the heels of a battleground state swing with her new running mate this week. Harris will be in San Francisco following a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday. Vice President Kamala Harris went to bed last night not yet having made a decision on her vice presidential running mate, and chose to sleep on the most consequential decision of her political career for one more night, a source familiar tells CNN.  That means that the vice president will only be informing her chosen running mate – as well as the advisers around her – sometime this morning of her choice.  Still, preparations for that eventual announcement — including prep work for this evening’s Philadelphia rally where Harris and her running mate will appear together for the first time – have had to go on even as the campaign has been in waiting mode.  To that end, the campaign has multiple versions of signs printed featuring Harris’ name alongside the names of several of the finalists, the source said. Casa Grande, Arizona —It is 101 degrees, the desert sun in full force. Yet Pablo Correa and Jacob Dials are smiling as they go door to door, foot soldiers in a progressive army that suddenly has a bouncy spring in its step. Correa said canvassers who were loyal to President Joe Biden are now excited by Vice President Kamala Harris, seeing her as a candidate with more vigor, more diversity and, critically, more support. However, not all voters feel that Harris represents any real change on the issues plaguing many Democrats. Read more here about things are shaping up in Arizona. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are reportedly among the top contenders to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. She’s expected to make her decision ahead of a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Here are key things to know about each of the possible candidates: Josh Shapiro: Shapiro, who was previously the state’s attorney general, was elected in a landslide victory in 2022, defeating a 2020 election-denying far-right state senator to become the third Jewish governor elected in the crucial swing state. During a stop in Philadelphia last month, Harris called Shapiro a “great partner to the president and me.” The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, placed the governor in the spotlight. His response to the death of Corey Comperatore, the Trump supporter who was killed while shielding his wife and daughter, has especially been lauded. Tim Walz: Walz spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard, which included a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks, working as an educator and coach, before shockingly defeating a six-term Republican incumbent congressman in 2006, a wave year for Democrats. Walz remained when the tide rolled out, reelected to the typically red district repeatedly until he left to run for his current job in 2018. (The seat quickly returned to GOP control after his departure.) Walz’s six years in charge of Minnesota have seen a remarkable series of political and social upheaval. First came the Covid-19 pandemic and then, in its midst, the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, which set off global anti-racist demonstrations. Walz navigated it all – alongside more usual complaints over wasteful spending – well enough that, by the beginning of 2023, he was leading a Democratic trifecta in the state government. Mark Kelly: Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly represents a state that Biden won by only 10,457 votes in 2020 and has national name recognition both as a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He has been a reliable supporter of Democratic Party priorities while in office but has occasionally bucked his party, such as in 2023, when he flatly called the influx of undocumented migrants across the US southern border a “crisis.” If Kelly was elected to higher office, his seat would remain in Democratic hands as Gov. Katie Hobbs would be able to appoint his successor. Kamala Harris and her running mate will have company on the campaign trail this week as they tour key battleground states: Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. The Ohio senator mate is bracketing the launch of the Democratic ticket with a series of events in the same cities and states as his opponents.  Vance will make a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon, hours before Harris and her running mate hold their first in-person rally in the city that evening. On Wednesday, both Vance and the Harris campaign will hold events in the Detroit area and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. And on Thursday, Vance will appear in North Carolina, making stops in Raleigh – where the Democratic ticket is also campaigning – as well as in Oakboro, located east of Charlotte. Vance’s tour comes as he seeks to reintroduce himself to the American public after his initial rollout as Donald Trump’s running mate was bogged down by his past comments disparaging women and elected officials who don’t have children. It also offers him a chance to divert attention away from Harris, who is embarking on a new phase of her two-week-old campaign and seeking to maintain momentum.  The campaign stops headlined by Vance, however, won’t include Trump or match the scale of the events held by Harris and her running mate. The vice president’s campaign said this week her battleground tour would include a mix of intimate gatherings at family-owned restaurants and union halls, but also large rallies in arenas and college campuses. Vice President Kamala Harris has won the Democratic presidential nomination, the party announced Monday, making her the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. The announcement came after the period for delegates to cast their digital ballots closed at 6 p.m. ET.  Harris won 99% of the vote, according to the Democratic National Committee. It’s been clear since shortly after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris that the vice president would be the only serious candidate for the nomination. She was the only candidate who had gathered enough delegate signatures to appear on the ballot, and the party had already declared on Friday that she had won enough votes to secure the nomination.  Next, the results will be certified by the secretary of the convention, and Harris will officially accept the nomination.  Harris can also now choose her running mate without the need for a separate vote. She is expected to reveal her choice today ahead of a planned campaign rally in Philadelphia."
Democrats lean on Walz’s biography at Philadelphia rally introducing new ticket to voters | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:02 PM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T21:31:17.408Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/vp-pick-tim-walz-remarks-harris/index.html,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz introduced himself as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate for the first time at a joint Philadelphia rally Tuesday, positioning himself as both a folksy populist and a fierce defender of the official Democratic ticket. “We’ve got 91 days. We’ll sleep when we’re dead,” Walz told the crowd. “Over those 91 days, and every day in the White House, I’ll have Vice President Harris’ back every single day – and we’ll have yours.” The appearance marked the first opportunity for both Walz, a relatively unknown politician on the national scale, and Harris to share his story with voters across the country, from his upbringing in small town, rural Nebraska to his record as governor of the North Star State. “Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future,” Harris said. “A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward. A fighter for the middle class, a patriot who believes as I do in the extraordinary promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity and justice – not just for some, but for all.” It was also an opportunity for the party to unify after the vice president’s search for a running mate grew competitive in its final days. Harris and Walz were introduced by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, one of three running mate candidates the vice president met with in-person over the weekend. Shapiro, who faced a last-minute push to hurt his chances of being chosen, started his speech by telling the crowd how much he loves his current job and vowing to help elect Harris and Walz. “I am going to continue to pour my heart and soul into serving you every single day as your governor, and I’m going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States,” Shapiro said. “Tim Walz is an outstanding governor, Tim Walz is a teacher. Tim Walz is a guardsman. Tim Walz is a great patriot.” As the duo sought to introduce Walz in battleground Pennsylvania, the pair used their remarks to portray the Minnesota governor as a Midwestern everyman, a high school teacher turned purple district lawmaker who advanced key Democratic policy since being elected to his state’s top office in 2018. “Minnesota’s strength comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences and always being willing to lend a helping hand,” Walz said. “Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state Capitol. And now Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House.” The governor described following in the footsteps of his late father – a former educator who served in the Army – first as a member of the Army National Guard and later as a teacher. Walz said that his students encouraged him to run to flip his Republican-controlled congressional district in 2006. “They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: a commitment of common good,” he said. “I believe that one person can make a difference. So, in 2006, I took the leap and I ran for Congress.” Walz also leaned into his role as an attack dog for Harris, at times mocking the Republican ticket. He said Trump is “too busy serving himself” to serve others and would take the country backwards, echoing Harris’ popular stump speech line: “We’re not going back.” Walz didn’t spare his Republican counterpart, Sen. JD Vance, either, referencing the Ohio senator’s Ivy League education and declaring that he “can’t wait” to debate him. She took her own jab at Vance, comparing the records of the two parties’ running mates. “When you compare his resume to Trump’s running mate, well – some might say it’s like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad,” Harris said. She also used her remarks to tell Walz’s story, including his time as a faculty advisor to his high school’s Gay Straight Alliance, and said that only in America could two people with such different backgrounds win the presidency. “The promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle class kids – one a daughter of Oakland California who was raised by a working mother, the other a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm – only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House,” Harris said. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Harris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:00 PM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T12:52:40.956Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/tim-walz-harris-vice-president/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, elevating the former teacher and Army National Guard veteran to join the Democratic ticket and help lead the party’s fight to defeat Donald Trump. The selection – which Harris personally delivered to Walz via a video call, according to a source familiar with the matter – caps the Midwestern Democrat’s short but swift ascent from a relative unknown to a leading driver of the party’s attacks against the former president and the MAGA agenda. Walz emerged from the most accelerated vice presidential search in modern history from a shortlist that included half a dozen Democrats, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. The vice president held in-person interviews with Walz, Shapiro and Kelly on Sunday. While Harris and Walz did not enjoy much of a previous relationship, aides said Harris grew increasingly enthused by how Walz genuinely carried himself and found a warm chemistry with him during a final meeting Sunday at her residence at the Naval Observatory. Harris was impressed “by his authenticity,” a person close to the process told CNN. At a Tuesday rally in Philadelphia, their first joint appearance together, Walz portrayed himself as both a folksy Midwestern everyman and an attack dog for Harris. “Thank you for bringing back the joy,” he said to Harris as he took the lectern, saying he is “thrilled to be on this journey” with her and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. “We’ve got 91 days. We’ll sleep when we’re dead,” Walz told the crowd. “Over those 91 days, and every day in the White House, I’ll have Vice President Harris’ back every single day – and we’ll have yours.” In a remarkable two-week period, Walz ascended from a third-tier candidate to a final contender in the view of Harris and her vetting team. He was propelled by support from across the Democratic Party, progressive and moderate groups alike. “He talks and looks like a lot of the voters we’ve lost to Trump,” said a longtime Democratic operative who was supportive of Walz from the day President Joe Biden stepped aside. In March, Walz accompanied Harris when she became the first sitting vice president to visit a clinic that performs abortions. A source close to Walz said that visit, along with the time Harris spent with the governor as he campaigned for reelection in 2022, had a “big impact.” “The chemistry was really important to Harris and it really clicked for both of them,” the source said. “Then, on top of that, the Harris campaign, like all of us, saw how energizing Walz was for the base.” Trump’s campaign has already begun crafting a narrative around Harris decision on Walz, with one source saying the vice president “bent the knee to the anti-semitic, anti-Israel left and chosen someone as dangerously liberal as she is.” Shapiro, considered another finalist for the role, is Jewish and has been critical of some demonstrators who have protested Israel’s war against Hamas. Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Walz “has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State.” A former educator, Walz is currently in his second term as Minnesota governor and chairs the Democratic Governors Association. He previously served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans. In the time leading up to his selection as Harris’ running mate, Walz had first been an outspoken defender of Joe Biden following his disastrous debate performance as calls for the president to end his reelection bid escalated. When Biden did drop out, Walz endorsed Harris the next day and has since emerged as a reliable, energetic and cutting advocate for the presumptive Democratic nominee. Picking Walz also underscores the Harris campaign’s focus on a path to victory that puts a premium on the “blue wall” states of the Midwest. Minnesota is slightly outside that sphere, but Walz, once a high school football coach, has evolved during his time in office into something of a progressive populist folk hero – the exact kind of pugilistic voice that Democrats taking on Trump are keen to highlight. He has over the past week delivered a handful of memorable haymakers against Republicans, though his most notable contribution has been a determination to label the GOP, especially its presidential ticket of Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz has referred to the duo as “weird dudes,” before lighting into their political agenda. The phrase has stuck, becoming a central meme in the new, post-Biden version of the campaign, a development that is delighting Democrats and apparently frustrating many on the right. During recent remarks at a “White Dudes for Harris” fundraiser, Walz made a rough-and-ready case for the vice president before would-be small-dollar donors. “How often in 100 days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in 100 days do you get to do something that’s going to impact generations to come?” Walz asked. “And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his a**, sent him on the road?” The line was well received on the call and almost immediately grabbed headlines. For many Democrats, at least, the online virality – with apologies to Biden’s “Dark Brandon” meme – was the kind they have pined for over the past few years. Walz also has a personal story befitting the zeitgeist – a family history, as he discussed last month, of infertility troubles, with his wife of three decades, Gwen, which allows him to speak with some authority against opponents or skeptics of in vitro fertilization, or IVF. “My oldest daughter’s name is Hope. That’s because my wife and I spent seven years trying to get pregnant, needed fertility treatments, things like IVF – things (MAGA Republicans) would ban,” Walz told Harris supporters. “These guys are the anti-freedoms.” And to draw a bright, cheeky line under his own childhood experience, Walz – not for the last time – recounted that he “grew up in a small town: 400 people, 24 kids in the class, 12 cousins.” Prior to Congress, Walz was a high school teacher and football coach and served in the Army National Guard, reaching the rank of command sergeant major, one of the highest ranks an enlisted member can attain. Over more than a decade in Congress, he assembled a fairly centrist voting record. As a first-time campaigner, he opposed a ban on same-sex marriage and supported abortion rights. And once in Congress, he balanced that out with comparatively more conservative positions on gun rights, which resulted in scoring a National Rifle Association endorsement. Walz has since fallen out of favor with the gun lobby over his support for gun safety actions as governor. “I think he was a solid Democratic member of the House with a few twists - focus on ag, farmers, rural areas,” said Democratic strategist Jeff Blodgett, a longtime aide to the late Sen. Paul Wellstone. “I think that he wanted to protect rifles and things of that nature as a rural congressman.” Walz ran for governor in 2018, emerging victorious by a double-digit margin. He won reelection in 2022 with 52 percent of the vote. As governor Walz had to grapple with divided government and slim majorities in the state Legislature. But in 2022, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (as the state’s Democratic Party is known) won control of both the state House and Senate giving Walz’s party a slim “trifecta” of legislative control. That allowed Walz to sign into law a raft of expansive social welfare programs such as free lunch for public school students, expansive access to Medicaid, increased protections that allow workers to unionize and expanded medical and family paid family leave. Through the trifecta, Minnesota Democrats were also able to codify abortion rights into law, increase transgender rights protections, pass a marijuana legalization bill and install new gun safety laws. Progressives hailed the work as an example of all that Democrats could achieve. Former President Barack Obama wrote in a tweet praising the most recent legislative session that it was a “reminder that elections have consequences.” Walz touted the trifecta’s work in a combative 2023 State of the State address. “There’s nowhere quite like Minnesota right now,” he told the audience of lawmakers. “Together, we’re not just showing the people of Minnesota what we’re capable of in delivering on our promises. We’re showing the entire American people just how much promise is contained in that progressive vision held by so many people.” “As governor, he’s embraced the idea that it’s really important to invest in people and infrastructure to grow the economy,” Blodgett said. “And to do it in a way that really helps people in the middle and down below. To me, it’s just a huge focus on economic issues that are kitchen table issues that people care about.” When speculation began about who Harris would pick as a running mate, Walz started out as the darkest of dark horses. He did get support from a few members of Congress such as Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as encouragement from labor unions. In the end, Walz’s background as a governor experienced in working with Democrats and Republicans and his roots in rural Minnesota made him an appealing choice for Harris. Walz was also a surprise to Republicans. “Tim Walz doesn’t even register on the fear-o-meter,” Minnesota Republican strategist Kevin Poindexter said before the announcement, adding that Republicans had been more worried about Harris picking either Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. “Him joining the ticket as VP does not bring anything.” Many of Trump’s allies had feared that Harris would ultimately choose the popular Shapiro as her running mate, potentially giving her an advantage in the critical battleground state. Those allies now are breathing a sigh of relief, with one source close to Trump saying that Pennsylvania “is still definitely up for grabs,” with Harris’ decision to go with Walz. While Trump has repeatedly said that vice presidential candidates don’t matter, he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had zeroed in on Shapiro in their recent attacks, an indication of the threat that Shapiro could pose to the campaign. Walz’s selection means that both the Trump and Harris campaigns have vice presidential nominees who their backers hope will help rally support across the Midwest. Democrats hope Walz’s Minnesota roots will attract a wide swath of voters throughout the region, while Republicans feel that Vance’s history of growing up in Ohio, as documented in his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” will find appeal in blue states like Michigan or even Minnesota. Democratic strategist Raghu Devaguptapu, a former Democratic Governors Association political director, characterized Walz as a “real steady hand” more than anything else as a governor. “He’s not the most charismatic guy, but he’s a steady hand. He’s really thoughtful, very likeable. He’s done a really nice job of building a broad coalition of support. … That’s the center of strength around Tim Walz,” Devaguptapu said. This story has been updated with additional reporting. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Walz’s military rank in the Army National Guard. He attained the rank of command sergeant major."
The ‘Blue Walz’: How a low-key Midwestern governor shot to the top to be Harris’ VP pick | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:46 PM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T23:23:47.642Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/tim-walz-inside-harris-vp-pick/index.html,"Tim Walz was in the midst of his interview with Vice President Kamala Harris’ vetting team when he told them there was something important they needed to know. He doesn’t use a teleprompter, the Minnesota governor said. He doesn’t even have one, in fact. So if he was the pick, Walz said, Harris’ team would have to get him a teleprompter and teach him how to use it. It was a lighter moment, but it was also part of an interview process with Harris’ team that Walz aced, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The Minnesota governor was upfront about his vulnerabilities, noting he wasn’t from a swing state or a household name. He also said he was a bad debater. But Walz made it clear he would be a team player. Asked how he saw his role as VP, Walz said he would perform the job however Harris wanted him to. Asked if he wanted to be the last person in the room before Harris made a decision, Walz said only if she wanted him to be there. And asked if he had ambitions to run for president himself one day, Walz said he did not, a point that sources said was not lost on a team looking to minimize the potential for any internal drama in a future Harris administration. “He had a very clear understanding that it was to be a partner, but to support the president, go out and connect with America and be that governing partner,” said Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman and Biden White House adviser who was deeply involved in the selection process. “It’s not the easiest of positions, but it’s a very important position.” The vetting interview  was a key step for Walz to ultimately lock up the selection that Harris made after sitting down with the three finalists, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, for one-on-one interviews at her residence on Sunday. “It was a home run,” said one source familiar with Walz’s meeting with Harris’ vetting team. “Everyone loved him.” Beyond the personal chemistry Harris and her team felt toward Walz, people familiar with the interview process said that Walz was also someone Harris felt could attract the kinds of voters that Democrats have lost to Donald Trump— voters that Harris may not be able to connect with on her own. “He hunts, he fishes, you want to have a beer with him,” said the source familiar with Walz’s meeting. “He will play in Michigan, Wisconsin, Western Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina.” A longtime Democratic operative who has known Walz for years agreed, saying: “He talks and looks like a lot of the voters we’ve lost to Trump.” By Tuesday, staffers at the Harris campaign headquarters were already joking about the “Blue Walz,” referencing the key midwestern battleground states that they hope he will help her lock up. Shapiro – who was favored by some of the Democratic Party and anti-Trump Republicans as a more moderate selection – did not go over as well with Harris’ team during his vetting interview, sources familiar with the process told CNN. While Walz came across as deferential and cooperative, Shapiro struck some as overly ambitious, with “a lot of questions” about what the role of the VP would be. And while Shapiro did “very well” in his in-person meeting with Harris on Sunday, multiple sources said, Walz was seen as a pick that would come with less drama and palace intrigue – both on the campaign trail and, if they win in November, at the White House. “It was a striking contrast” between the two, said the source familiar with the meeting. Walz was an unexpected contender to become the No. 2 on the Democratic ticket – he was hardly mentioned among the potential contenders when Joe Biden dropped out a little over two weeks ago. But sources familiar with the selection process described Walz as the walk-on player who was ultimately picked for the team over the five-star recruits because he was a Midwestern governor who can campaign as a natural on the stump as a fellow “happy warrior.” Walz, who was a 24-year Army National Guard veteran and high school teacher before entering politics, brought a “joy and excitement” to the process that ultimately won Harris and her team over, said another source. Walz was the running mate option that Harris knew the least — but he won over the Democratic nominee, as well as her team, by making clear he would adapt to her style and policies. Harris had not been expecting Walz to say he didn’t plan to run for president, a source familiar with her thinking told CNN. But afterward, as she sat around the same dining room table in the Naval Observatory, Walz’s answer stuck with her. “That showed his willingness to say, ‘Look I’m not concerned about my image or my approval rating or what’s next for me in the next chapter of life. I’m going to stay in this moment, be your vice president, run through walls, fight for the American people and demonstrate our values,’” said Richmond. “That’s a strong and compelling argument.” The elevation of Walz was the culmination of a remarkable whirlwind, a capstone to a two-week campaign to join the Democratic ticket – first, with a goal of catching the attention of the Harris team and second, to win over the vice president herself. “He was at ease and very natural,” said a senior Democratic adviser who was briefed on Walz’s face-to-face interview with Harris. “It was a ‘know-it-when-you-see-it’ type of thing.” While much of the attention around the vetting process focused on the work being done by former Attorney General Eric Holder and former White House counsel Dana Remus, the questions beyond the paperwork and biographical scrubs really started last Friday with video interviews for the candidates being considered. The Zoom calls also featured an until-now secret three-person committee: Richmond, former Boston mayor and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. Richmond has become a top adviser to Harris. Walsh and Harris grew close during his time in the Biden administration. Cortez Masto was elected the same year to the Senate with Harris, but they’d also previously served as attorneys general together through the landmark multistate mortgage settlement that became a defining moment for both their careers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The three-person group was picked for geographic diversity, different skill sets and background. But most of all, they were picked because they were who Harris trusted to help figure out whom she could trust, which many who know her acknowledge is often the hardest thing for Harris. Richmond and Walsh, who both went from being elected officials to members of Biden’s administration, were there to help answer a question very much on Harris’s mind after her own experience as vice president: “She wanted to make sure that we could ask questions like, ‘You’re going to go from a principal to a hybrid principal/staffer. Can you make that transition?’” according to one source familiar with the process. Of the nine options vetted, and six who met virtually with the committee, Walz and Shapiro entered the rushed final weekend as the clear favorites, three people involved in the process told CNN. Kelly was included as a third option. Walz was propelled by support from across the Democratic Party – progressive and moderate factions alike – in a sophisticated campaign guided by some of the party’s most seasoned operatives. He had former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on his side – old allies from his 12 years in Congress representing a rural Minnesota district – as well as glowing words from former President Barack Obama, who said in a statement Tuesday of Walz, “He has the values and the integrity to make us proud.” Obama also served as a “sounding board for Vice President Harris to talk through how she was thinking about it,” said one senior aide. As Walz gained traction online for his comment that Republicans were “weird,” Harris was watching, too. “She likes the way he operates,” said a person involved with the process. “She liked how it became a thing then. It was funny, it was pointed, but it wasn’t over the top.” While Harris and Walz did not have much of a previous relationship – a fact that some around Walz worried might be his downfall in the process – aides said Harris grew increasingly enthusiastic by how Walz carried himself during the process. A courtesy call between Harris and Walz on July 21, the same Sunday afternoon Biden stepped aside, sparked a formal vetting process that ultimately led him to the top of the ranks of finalists. Along the way, many Democratic leaders believed Shapiro was the frontrunner in the sudden race to become Harris’ running mate. Extensive polling and focus groups conducted by the Harris campaign showed no nominal difference among the final contenders, but two Democratic advisers close to the search process acknowledged Shapiro, who is Jewish, had become something of a lightning rod for Gaza protests that Harris was not eager to revisit, an issue that’s divided Democrats throughout the 2024 campaign. “Nobody wanted to rip that scab back open,” one of the Democrats said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential process. But other sources close to the vetting process pushed back on the notion that the Gaza protests had anything to do with Harris’ decision to pick Walz over Shapiro. In the end, the bigger hurdle for Shapiro was his face-to-face meeting with Harris, where he posed “very specific” questions about the role of a vice president, including what decisions he would be included in making, should they win election. “He was negotiating the job with her, while Walz was saying ‘What can I do to help?’” said the Democratic adviser, who added that Shapiro was unquestionably a rising star in the party but just didn’t meet the moment and forge a comfortable connection with Harris. For Walz, the evolution from being seen as a moderate Democrat – winning a Republican-leaning congressional district in 2006 – to becoming a leading progressive governor impressed Harris and her team about his appeal. Walz’s deferential style was also a huge factor in his appeal with Harris, sources said. “She wanted to make sure that people understood there are going to be times when you’ll have great influence and there are going to be times when something’s happening and you’re told about it at the last minute,” said one of the people involved in the vetting process. “She said, ‘That’s just the nature of the job and you have to be OK with that.’” Ahead of Harris’ three interviews on Sunday with Walz, Shapiro and Kelly, a panel of close advisers presented findings and recommendations to Harris at her residence at the Naval Observatory. As they did, other senior campaign staff prepared videos and logos and merchandise for the various options. They waited, not knowing which way Harris would go. They wrestled with wrapping their minds around how different the options really were, and what each would mean for the campaign and for them. According to sources familiar with the process, Harris was immediately leaning toward Walz after the Sunday meetings. But she felt torn through the end. Harris slept on it Sunday. By Monday, she was quietly closing in on selecting Walz, informing only a small group of advisers of where her thinking stood that evening, a source familiar with the matter said. Harris went to bed Monday morning without making any official decision. Small teams of staffers were sent to be on location for each of the final three options, none of them knowing when they woke up on Tuesday morning what the day was going to bring. Speeches for Tuesday night’s rally in Philadelphia were written in advance for all the options. When Harris finally called Tuesday morning, Walz was at home with his wife and two children, along with his sister and brother-in-law. He didn’t answer the first call that came through that morning because it was from a blocked number and he didn’t want to miss a call from Harris. She got him on the second try. Walz was handed his speech shortly after Harris called to officially tell him he was the pick.  After a small family celebration, Walz brought donuts to staffers who were there with him and hopped on a call with a wider group of staff to thank them for their work. After arriving in Philadelphia for the first joint Harris-Walz rally Tuesday, a source said that Walz practiced using the teleprompter ahead of taking the stage for his speech."
Ryan Reynolds had a few questions for Blake Lively’s ‘It Ends with Us’ leading man | CNN,"Published 1:54 PM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T17:54:33.748Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-interviews-brandon-sklenar/index.html,"Brandon Sklenar came for a press day to promote his new movie and ended up in the hot seat. Sklenar, who costars with Blake Lively in the film “It Ends with Us,” was surprised in an interview by Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds. The “Deadpool & Wolverine” star shared a video of the conversation he had with his wife’s on-screen love interest. “It’s not every day the husband gets to interview his wife’s love interest in a film,” Reynolds started off. “It’s kind of crazy.” What followed was a pretty funny interaction that included Reynolds’ mother, Tammy Reynolds, and his “Deadpool & Wolverine” costar, Hugh Jackman. Reynolds questioned Sklenar about a “suggestive” promo photo for “It Ends with Us” and asked whether the actor had a nickname for Lively. After Reynolds jokingly claimed he’d been on a “meth journey” for six months, Sklenar asked Reynolds if he wanted to take a break. “From Blake?” Reynolds responded. “Sure.” Minutes later, Reynolds gave Sklenar a hug before stepping away as his mother appeared. “Well, it’s not every day the mother-in-law of the leading lady gets to interview the love interest and the man trying to replace my sweet little gummy bear, Ryan,” Tammy Reynolds said. “Let’s dive in shall we?” After reading questions from Ryan Reynolds, which included instruction to “don’t f***ing blow this for me,” Mrs. Reynolds got flirtatious. “Goddamn you’re gorgeous,” she told Sklenar. “It creeps up on you.” Ryan Reynolds then returned to make the pitch for Sklenar to become his “new dad.” They weren’t the only ones making the actor uncomfortable. Jackman did as well. “It’s not everyday a guy gets to interview the love interest of his best friend’s wife and the guy trying to replace Ryan as a husband and me as his best mate,” Jackman said. Sklenar ends up complimenting Jackman on his work in “Les Misérables,” The video ended with the Reynolds and Jackman singing Sklenar’s praises before Jackman quipped, “I think we’ve found the next Wolverine.” “It Ends with Us” is in theaters Friday."
The math behind why Harris picked Walz and why she may regret it | CNN Politics,"Published 12:55 PM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T16:55:40.288Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/math-behind-harris-walz-vp-pick/index.html,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz hadn’t been in the top tier of potential running mates for Kamala Harris until the past few weeks. But his selection to join the vice president on the Democratic ticket underscores both the power of social media and of being relatively affable and nondivisive. So what took Walz from, nationally speaking, a relative unknown to major-party vice presidential nominee? You might just call the entire thing “weird.” Recall how Democrats started calling Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance “weird” a few weeks ago. The attack might have felt like something out of high school, but the crazy thing is that it seems to have worked. A look at Google trend data reveals a recent increase in searches for the word “weird.” More than that, the topics associated with “weird” were Make America Great Again, the Republican Party, Vance and Walz. Why Walz? He’s been credited as the first one to have started calling Republicans weird in any large-scale way. And we know that the Harris campaign was paying attention because it fired off at least one email missive that suggested that the “weird” attacks against the Republican ticket were driving the online conversation. The fact that Harris selected a candidate who does well online shouldn’t be surprising – this is the campaign that has embraced “coconut tree” and “brat.” Harris has also done very well on TikTok, which is something Joe Biden’s campaign couldn’t do. But is the Walz pick indicative of a campaign that is too online? That’s a fair question given that Harris skipped over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro in favor of Walz. Shapiro, who was long seen as a front-runner for the vice presidential pick, divided a lot of the online left over his perceived views on the Israelis and Palestinians. Notably, Walz shares many of those same views on the issue but received far less backlash than Shapiro, who is Jewish. The fact that Walz faced virtually no opposition from any of the major Democratic Party factions almost certainly helped him. After all, the Harris campaign has been riding a wave of good emotions since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Walz’s nondivisive manner on a larger scale seemed to play on a smaller scale as well. Harris had good personal chemistry with him and particularly liked his “happy go lucky” attitude, according to CNN reporting. Getting along with a running mate and not potentially dividing the party with the choice is reason enough to pick someone. One of the first rules when it comes to a vice presidential pick is to “Do no harm.” Harris likely did no harm with this pick. Walz served 12 years in the US House and is currently in his second term as governor. He can’t be attacked for having little experience, unlike his Republican counterpart Vance, who is the least liked vice presidential nominee coming out of his party’s convention on record. The big question now is whether Harris left points on the board by choosing Walz instead of Shapiro. Minnesota is likely not going to be competitive this fall. No Republican nominee for president has carried the state since 1972 – it’s Democrats’ longest presidential winning streak (outside of Washington, DC). And polling in the North Star State since Harris entered the race has shown that the streak is likely to continue. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, is almost certainly a must-win state for Harris if she wants to be president. In fact, it is probably the most important swing state this cycle, and the polling there has been very tight. Shapiro currently holds a 61% favorable rating in Pennsylvania and outperformed Biden’s 2020 baseline by 14 points in 2022. Whether that would have been enough to propel a Harris-Shapiro ticket in Pennsylvania this fall is a question mark, though political science literature suggests it very well could have. What we can say, though, is that Walz is not likely to help Harris with many swing voters. He did less than a point better than Biden in Minnesota when he won reelection in 2022. In fact, Shapiro seems to have done better with White voters without a college degree in Pennsylvania than Walz did with the same demographic in his state two years ago. And even if Walz had been an electoral juggernaut, it remains to be seen whether he can help the Democratic ticket outside his home state. If Harris ends up losing Pennsylvania and the election by a small margin, it will be one of history’s great “what-ifs.” Did she not choose Shapiro because she was afraid of the online left? Harris, of course, is hoping the election won’t be that close. She seems to have momentum, and the Walz pick will probably do nothing to impede it."
Analysis: Walz could help Harris shore up the ‘blue wall’ on the way to the White House | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:00 AM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T04:00:01.980Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/harris-running-mate-global-turmoil/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential pick Tim Walz is known for bonding with rural voters who other Democrats can’t reach. That’s one big reason why the Minnesota governor, who is largely unknown to most Americans, now finds himself on a major party ticket in the most intense sprint to an election in modern history following President Joe Biden’s late decision to abandon his reelection bid. The selection of Walz reveals the geographic and demographic key to the 2024 election. If Harris is to win, her path will most likely run through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Donald Trump captured in 2016 only to lose them to Biden in 2020. Presently, they are threatening to tilt back to the Republicans again this year. History suggests that vice presidential nominees rarely deliver a state to their ticket-mates as voters tend to focus on potential presidents. But Walz, a friendly and jocular leader whose urbanity doesn’t conceal an acidic partisan tongue, provides a political complement to Harris. The vice president will hope to perform strongly among minority voters in cities like Detroit, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Milwaukee and to run up Democratic numbers among suburban and women voters alienated by Trump. Walz may be able to help most by reaching out to rural Americans wavering over a vote for the ex-president but who are not yet convinced by the new Democratic nominee or may find her too liberal. One of the key developments in Midwestern politics in recent years has been the shift of some White, working class and male voters from Democrats to Republicans, including those who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but who were won over by Trump’s cultural conservatism and populist, nationalist economic values in 2016. If Walz can winnow Trump’s margins outside the cities in these states even by a few thousand votes, he could make an important contribution to the Harris campaign in a knife-edge race. The importance of the Midwestern trio of states is no secret. Trump also appeared to have this in mind with his choice of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, whose political emergence epitomizes the transformation in the region’s politics. Walz has emerged as something of a Democratic folk hero in recent days. In a party where many members appeared to be reconciled to defeat under Biden, he has added a carefree tone and coined a new angle of attack against Trump and Vance that delighted Democrats – branding them “weird.” Harris’ decision to choose Walz, a 60-year-old former congressman, progressive, Army National Guard veteran and schoolteacher will be seen by some experts as a “safety first” move. The vice president certainly had a strong incentive to do nothing to upset her momentum after securing the Democratic nomination in a surreal period since Biden’s exit from the race just over two weeks ago. And the perils of a botched vice-presidential rollout were illustrated in recent days as Trump and his team spent two weeks defending Vance after his past reference to Democratic politicians as “childless cat ladies” created the rockiest rollout of a vice-presidential pick since Republican Sarah Palin in 2008. The question now is whether the compressed vetting period left any political skeletons or missteps the Trump campaign can discover and highlight. Walz won the spot after Harris chose him over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the other finalist in her hurried running mate search. The Keystone State governor offered the potential promise of helping to secure Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes. But Shapiro, who is Jewish, was criticized by some on the left for comments condemning the tone of campus protests. While he has been more outspokenly critical about the choices made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than the president, some progressives had warned against his selection as vice presidential nominee. One potential line of attack against the vice president may be that she decided not to contradict the most liberal voices in her party who were strongly against Shapiro. And there is some relief among Republicans that a Democratic governor who easily won Pennsylvania and has high approval ratings did not get the nod from Harris. But Shapiro, a Democratic rising star, is likely to remain a vocal advocate for the Democratic ticket in the commonwealth. Walz and Harris will hold their first joint appearance at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday night that will kick off a sprint across an electoral map expanded Biden’s shelving of his campaign. The theatrics will offer the vice president a fresh chance to supercharge her candidacy’s momentum, which has energized a party that had looked headed for defeat in November and tightened the contest into a 50-50 struggle in a polarized country. Her relative youth, at 59, has inverted the generational contrast with Trump, 78, now that the issue of Biden’s age and acuity in a potential second term is moot. While the naming of the Democratic vice presidential pick is the focus of the campaign, new developments Monday – outside a race that has been on a momentous trajectory since Trump escaped an assassination attempt and Biden pulled out – hinted at potential new twists to come before November. Harris’ final deliberations took place against a backdrop of fast-developing domestic and global events that reflected the complex political environment she must navigate if the novelty of her sudden elevation wears off. A global stock market plunge, for instance, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,000 points Monday, amid rising unemployment and revived fears of a US recession that could further sour voters on an economy that the White House insists is in great shape but that has nevertheless left millions of people feeling deeply insecure. There is no sign that the US economy faces a looming meltdown on the scale of the 2008 crisis that helped lead to the victory of Obama over Republican John McCain. The banking system appears strong, inflation has ebbed and the US has bounced back more strongly than other developed nations from the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, in a tight election likely to be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states, any issue can be decisive. Any economic shocks in the weeks to come could prove treacherous for Harris given she’s tied to the current administration but also lacks the ability to influence factors like whether the Federal Reserve will begin to make long-awaited interest rate cuts. Harris on Monday also had to juggle discussions on her pick with her official duties. She joined Biden in the White House Situation Room amid intense diplomacy as signs point to an Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel that would risk igniting a full-scale regional war that could drag in the United States. News that several US service members were injured in a suspected rocket attack on an air base in Iraq again underscored the many factors that are beyond the vice president’s control that could rock the race in the run-up to November. Multiple US officials told CNN that the US expects Iran to hit back for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran perhaps within a 24-hour time frame – a period that could coincide with the vice president’s plans to name her running mate. The Middle East war has already had a significant impact on the campaign. Israel’s repeated disregard for Biden’s calls to shield civilians in its assault on Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks has carved splits in the Democratic coalition, especially in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to many Arab Americans. Trump, who has struggled to adapt his campaign to his new Democratic foe, sought to exploit both evolving crises on Monday in a way that pointed to a potentially more effective attack against Harris than his questioning of her racial identify last week. He blasted the stock sell-off as a “Kamala Crash” on social media and warned World War III was beckoning. The ex-president’s comments lacked context and were overly alarmist. But perception is often as important as reality in a presidential race. Trump is seeking to tie Harris to what he claims are Biden’s failures as he seeks to foster a sense among Americans that the country and the world are fast spinning out of control. At the very least, the economy and Middle East instability will increase pressure on Harris to do more to counter Trump’s populist economic arguments and to flesh out how she would lead at a time when US global power is more challenged than it’s been in decades. Tuesday’s events in Philadelphia would have been unthinkable less than three weeks ago when Biden was resisting growing Democratic efforts to push him aside after his disastrous June debate performance in Atlanta. At the time, the 2024 race – which promises sweeping consequences for America’s democracy and future path – was still reeling from the attempt to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania just before he claimed his third-straight GOP nomination. The contest for the White House had previously been shaped by Trump’s multiple legal woes, but the success of his courtroom delaying tactics and assists from conservative judges have pushed off a reckoning for his most serious alleged offenses – including his attempt to steal the 2020 election that he lost in a bid to remain in power. Still, Harris’ strong start appears to have restored the election to a neck-and-neck race, according to recent surveys. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, for instance, there was no clear leader nationally with Trump at 49% and Harris at 47%. But the vice president’s campaign is so new that it’s too early to judge the full impact of her entry into the race, especially without a critical mass of new swing state data.

‘White Dudes for Harris’ said their account was targeted by X for the second time | CNN Business,"Updated 10:58 AM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T14:53:27.086Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/business/white-dudes-for-harris-said-their-account-was-targeted-by-x-for-the-second-time/index.html,"“White Dudes for Harris” said its X account was labeled as spam just a week after it had been locked and then reinstated on the Elon Musk-owned platform. Musk has publicly endorsed Harris’ opponent, Donald Trump. A leader of the political organizing group for Kamala Harris claims there is a double standard on Musk’s platform, despite the billionaire’s long-standing claim to be a “free-speech absolutist.” “I’m over here getting white supremacist memes in my feed, and when I report them I’m told they ‘didn’t violate policy,’” lead organizer Ross Morales Rocketto posted on X Tuesday. “But the @dudes4harris account gets throttled because… maybe they’re afraid.” X has been criticized for allowing hate speech and other extreme content to flourish since Musk bought the company in October 2022. In March, a judge threw out X’s lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which had been accused of violating the company’s terms of service when it studied, and then wrote about, hate speech on the platform following Musk’s takeover of Twitter . X first locked the “White Dudes for Harris” account during a massive fundraiser with 190,000 participants and more than $4 million raised on July 29, according to a post by the organizers. “Uh oh… we pissed off @elonmusk,” the account posted on July 29. It was subsequently reinstated the following day. But on Tuesday, the account posted a screenshot that said X found the account to contain spam or to be engaging in other types of platform manipulation. The account was still posting on X on Tuesday. “This comes after they suspended us last week and put our account in ‘read-only’ mode,” the account posted on X. “They are scared of the conversation we started across the country last week. We cannot let them shut us down. Keep fighting.” CNN has reached out to X for comment, but the company rarely responds to press inquiries. “White Dudes for Harris” is one of several coalition groups that have popped up in support of Kamala Harris. The campaign said groups like Black Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris and White Dudes for Harris raised more than $20 million."
"Who is Gwen Walz, the wife of Harris’ new running mate? | CNN Politics","Published 9:06 AM EDT, Tue August 6, 2024",2024-08-06T13:06:33.035Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/wife-tim-gwen-walz-family/index.html,"Before he got his start in politics, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, chosen on Tuesday to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, was a longtime educator – just like his wife. Gwen Walz has taught in public, alternative and migrant schools, as well as prisons. She also served as an administrator and coordinator at Mankato Area Public Schools, a school district in the congressional district her husband represented from 2007 to 2019. Her first public event as Minnesota first lady was a rally in support of voting rights restoration for felons. She has also toured state prisons and helped recruit an assistant commissioner working to install a new college curriculum behind prison walls, among other things, according to a report from Minnesota Public Radio. “Gwen understands that corrections must be an inclusive component of our education system, and by expanding opportunity, our state can dramatically reduce recidivism rates and most importantly, transform lives,” reads her official biography page. Walz first met her husband in western Nebraska, where she began her career teaching English, according to her official biography. They were married in 1994, Shortly after, the two established Educational Travel Adventures, Inc., which organized annual educational trips to China for students. The couple have two children: Hope, a recent graduate of Montana State University, and Gus, who is in high school. Speaking about her husband shortly after he took office in 2019, Walz told Twin Cities PBS: “I make no mistake about it, Tim is going to make the decisions. And he did when he was in Congress. And I think we worked toward usually the same end, but we really trust one another.” Walz was born in Glencoe, Minnesota, and grew up in the western part of the state. Both her parents were teachers and small-business owners. Walz was educated at Gustavus Adolphus College and Minnesota State University."
"August 5, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-08-05T12:07:19.819Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kamala-harris-trump-election-08-05-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Vice President Kamala Harris has won the Democratic presidential nomination, the party announced Monday, making her the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. The announcement came after the period for delegates to cast their digital ballots closed at 6 p.m. ET.  Harris won 99% of the vote, according to the Democratic National Committee. It’s been clear since shortly after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris that the vice president would be the only serious candidate for the nomination. She was the only candidate who had gathered enough delegate signatures to appear on the ballot, and the party had already declared on Friday that she had won enough votes to secure the nomination.  Next, the results will be certified by the secretary of the convention, and Harris will officially accept the nomination.  Harris can also now choose her running mate without the need for a separate vote. She is expected to reveal her choice by Tuesday ahead of a planned campaign rally in Philadelphia.   Dozens of top comedians teamed up to raise money for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign in a virtual event on Monday night. Ben Stiller, Jason Bateman, Tiffany Haddish, Phoebe Robinson, Patton Oswalt, Whoopi Goldberg, Keegan-Michael Key, Ed Helms, Kevin Nealon, Margaret Cho and more spoke as part of the “Comics for Kamala” event. Upwards of 24,000 people were watching the live Zoom at its most populated moment, which has so far raised more than $530,000 directly for the Harris campaign. Jon Hamm kicked off the gathering, which was hosted by comedian Paul Mercurio. Nick Offerman performed a comedic folk song on his guitar with references to former President Donald Trump; Kathy Griffin brought on the singer Sia via a FaceTime call; “SNL” alum Cecily Strong did a roast of Trump’s running mate, JD Vance; and Key reprised his impression of former President Obama. “I don’t feel like there’s a lot to laugh about when it comes to the stakes of this election,” actress Kathryn Hahn, who stars in the upcoming Marvel series “Agatha All Along,” told gatherers. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who served as one of the organizers of the event, spoke to Harris’ comedic side, saying, “She’s tough, she’s real, she’s ready, but she’s also funny. It’s really refreshing to have someone right now who’s funny. She’s serious, but she doesn’t take herself too seriously.” Progressive politicians, labor leaders and activists joined an organizing call on Monday to encourage progressive voters to support Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, saying they could achieve far more of their policy goals under a Harris administration than a second Trump term. Harris and her campaign have recently clarified how some of her previous policy positions have shifted, including backing away from more progressive stances on fracking and healthcare. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal emphasized the progressive achievements under the Biden-Harris administration, including investments in combatting climate change, drug price negotiation rules, canceled student debt and strict enforcement of antitrust law. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a member of the progressive “squad” on Capitol Hill, asked: Organizers for the “uncommitted” movement were also on the call, still not backing Harris but expressing hope that they may be able to work with the vice president to achieve their goals and defeat Trump. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, whose union recently formally backed Harris, said he’s “excited as hell” for the momentum behind the campaign and predicted a “massive crowd” at Harris’ rally in Detroit on Wednesday. The Harris campaign is seeking to capitalize on the anticipation around the final hours of its search for a running mate, sending out yet another email tonight imploring supporters to sign up. While the campaign has sent several similar messages in the past week, a closer look at the latest email could contain a clue to how Vice President Kamala Harris intends to record a video Tuesday morning with her new partner on the Democratic ticket. Tonight, it remains unclear whether Harris has reached a final decision, although a senior Democratic adviser says she almost certainly has, given the hour. The campaign is intent on keeping the decision a secret as a display of loyalty to their new candidate and new boss, the adviser said. The email includes a picture of the moment Joe Biden called her on Zoom and asked him to be her running mate. “See this picture? That was the moment Joe Biden asked me to be his Vice President,” Harris wrote. “It was perhaps one of the most memorable days of my life.” As Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke Monday evening in Minneapolis, he gave no indication of whether he has been chosen as a running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris. “We’ve got an incredible candidate,” he said during his 11-minute speech at a fundraiser for Harris. Walz is among the final three potential candidates to be Harris’ vice presidential selection. She’s expected to make her decision ahead of a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The Democratic governor referenced a new line of attack he helped coin for Democrats by labeling former President Donald Trump, vice presidential candidate JD Vance and some of their Republican allies “weird.” Walz reiterated that he does not intend to call all Republicans weird, noting that some Republicans are “people that I love.” House Speaker Mike Johnson is set to visit 20 states in August, aiming to buoy Republican candidates and hold onto the speaker’s gavel.  Johnson will be stopping by Wisconsin, Arizona, Ohio, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Virginia, Connecticut and other states, according to a source familiar with his plans.  Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday where she is expected to deliver remarks at a campaign event at 5:30 p.m. ET before returning to Washington, DC. CNN reported earlier that the campaign plans to officially announce Harris’ choice for a running mate through an online message to supporters before the rally, where she’s expected to make her first appearance with her pick. Harris hopes to keep it under wraps “until as close to then as possible,” a person familiar with the search told CNN. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN Monday that she has not spoken to President Joe Biden since he dropped out of the presidential race last month. Asked by CNN’s Dana Bash whether she would like to speak with him in the future, Pelosi said, “Yes.” “Is everything OK with your relationship?” Bash asked. “You’d have to ask him, but I hope so,” Pelosi said. “Look, I love Joe Biden, respected him for over 40 years.” Last month, the president stepped down from the Democratic ticket and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. CNN previously reported that Pelosi privately told Biden that polling showed he could not beat former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and his run could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning back the House in November. Pelosi described Harris, who on Friday earned enough votes from Democratic delegates to win the party’s nomination for president, as “very politically astute,” pointing toward Harris’ experience winning a competitive primary for California attorney general. “She pulled that off because of her astuteness,” Pelosi said, “and I can go more into that but the fact is, you’ve seen in the past three weeks how she has managed the opportunity that is there.”  Watch below: Despite his campaign’s efforts to paint Kamala Harris as “dangerously liberal,” former President Donald Trump attacked Harris’ racial identity, saying she “happened to turn Black” during a panel interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week. Republicans have urged Trump to focus on policy, not race or identity. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage and not her terrible, dangerous liberal record throughout her entire political life, is a good day for her and a bad day for us,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I would encourage President Trump to prosecute the case against Kamala Harris’ bad judgment.” During a Saturday rally in Atlanta, where Harris had addressed supporters days earlier, Trump sought to blunt some of the momentum she has enjoyed since launching her campaign, while defending Vance, who’s faced scrutiny over past controversial comments. “We have to work hard to define her,” Trump said. “I don’t even want to define her. I just want to say who she is. She’s a horror show.” But he also took the opportunity to lash out at a fellow Republican in the key battleground state, disparaging Gov. Brian Kemp, who revealed last month that he did not support Trump in the state’s GOP primary. (The governor has said he’ll “support the ticket” in November.) Earlier in the day, Trump attacked Kemp and his wife on Truth Social. The rally followed hours of the Trump and Harris campaigns engaging in a public back-and-forth over when they would meet on the debate stage after the former president said he would no longer attend a September 10 ABC News debate he agreed to when Biden was still the nominee. After two weeks of sowing doubt over whether he would attend, Trump said Saturday he would instead meet Harris at a September 4 Fox News debate with a live audience or not at all. Harris’ campaign has said she will attend the ABC News event, and taunted the former president for backing out of that event. Read more about Harris’ VP search and Trump’s strategy against the Democratic ticket. Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the campaign of Kamala Harris, said on social media that the vice president is yet to make a decision on a running mate. Munoz was responding to a local report that said Harris had made her decision and that her running mate has accepted. CNN reported earlier that Harris is focusing on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter, although the process, these sources cautioned, is still fluid and none of the finalists can be ruled out until Harris makes her decision. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon, a source told CNN. The Republicans for Harris coalition kicked off its North Carolina campaign Monday with a virtual news conference featuring four elected Republicans and former Republicans explaining their support for the Democratic ticket this election.  Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr, former Mecklenburg County GOP board member Michael Tucker and US Army veteran Scott Peoples addressed their personal reasons for endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, and what role the newly formed coalition of Republicans and former Republicans will have in the plan to turn the battleground state blue in November. “I am proudly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States, for a number of reasons. And not many of those are because of all the policies, but because of the person. Because of the adherence to the Constitution and because it’s going to be a stable hand in a time when this country needs a stable hand to get us to the next step,” he added. Orr, a Republican for 45 years before switching his registration to unaffiliated “after January 6 and the events that followed,” told the press on the call that “the stakes are simply too high not to take action.” The Harris campaign has said the coalition will “play a pivotal role in engaging Trump-skeptical Republican voters across North Carolina, facilitating Republican-to-Republican voter contact, including by hosting Republican-featured events, door knocking, phone banking, spearheading letter-to-the-editor campaigns, and building local networks with Republican organizations, businesses, and community groups.” Tucker said he cast one of the more than 250,000 votes for Nikki Haley in the North Carolina’s Republican primary back in March, and now, he is “actively working to protect America to identify other Republicans who have also been alienated by Donald Trump.”  Tucker, Peoples and Orr all acknowledged that many Republicans or Republican-leaning voters in North Carolina likely do not feel comfortable with casting a ballot for a Democrat- or at least, admitting that are doing that.  “You’re not alone if you feel this way and you are hearing this, there are other Republicans who feel the same way you do,” said Tucker. “They don’t have to step forward like we are. All they have to do is go in that voting booth, in the privacy of that spot, and do the right thing for America. And that is vote for Vice President Harris,” said Orr. Kamala Harris and her soon-to-be announced running mate will have company on the campaign trail this week as they tour key battleground states: Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. The Ohio senator mate is bracketing the launch of the Democratic ticket with a series of events in the same cities and states as his opponents.  Vance will make a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon, hours before Harris and her running mate hold their first in-person rally in the city that evening. On Wednesday, both Vance and the Harris campaign will hold events in the Detroit area and Eau Claire, Wisconsin. And on Thursday, Vance will appear in North Carolina, making stops in Raleigh – where the Democratic ticket is also campaigning – as well as in Oakboro, located east of Charlotte. Vance’s tour comes as he seeks to reintroduce himself to the American public after his initial rollout as Donald Trump’s running mate was bogged down by his past comments disparaging women and elected officials who don’t have children. It also offers him a chance to divert attention away from Harris, who is embarking on a new phase of her two-week-old campaign and seeking to maintain momentum.  The campaign stops headlined by Vance, however, won’t include Trump or match the scale of the events held by Harris and her running mate. The vice president’s campaign said this week her battleground tour would include a mix of intimate gatherings at family-owned restaurants and union halls, but also large rallies in arenas and college campuses. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with the administration’s national security team in the White House Situation Room Monday afternoon. The meeting comes as Harris prepares to announce her pick for vice president. Washington is bracing for an expected Iranian retaliation for the killing of a top Hamas leader in Tehran last week, even as deep uncertainty swirled around when Iran would act — and how far it might go. The meeting in the Situation Room included an intelligence update as well as a discussion on the latest efforts to calm tensions in the region, an official told CNN. Multiple US officials across the region and in Washington told CNN that the US expects Iran to retaliate in the coming days – perhaps even within the next 24 hours – against Israel for Ismail Haniyeh’s killing. But the US has struggled to gauge when the response will come and what form it will take, in part because Iran already moved some of the military assets necessary to carry out a major attack on Israel in April, making it more difficult for US intelligence to predict its actions now, according to two US officials. Officials are relying on multiple streams of intelligence, and there are divisions among national security officials on how and when Iran’s response might unfold. The relative uncertainty has left the Biden administration in a defensive crouch as it tries to rally allies and pressure Iran not to escalate tensions. The killing of Haniyeh – who served as a top Hamas political figure whose job included a role as one of the group’s chief hostage and ceasefire negotiators – along with the killing of Hezbollah leader Fu’ad Shukr in Lebanon last week have thrown the war into its most uncertain phase. Read more about today’s meeting and tensions in the Middle East. Vice President Kamala Harris is focused on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in the final hours of her process to select a running mate, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The selection process, these sources cautioned, is still fluid, and none of the finalists could be ruled out until Harris makes her decision. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon, a source told CNN. Here are key things to know about the possible contenders: Josh Shapiro: Shapiro, who was previously the state’s attorney general, was elected in a landslide victory in 2022, defeating a 2020 election-denying far-right state senator to become the third Jewish governor elected in the crucial swing state. During a stop in Philadelphia last month, Harris called Shapiro a “great partner to the president and me.” The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, placed the governor in the spotlight. His response to the death of Corey Comperatore, the Trump supporter who was killed while shielding his wife and daughter, has especially been lauded. Tim Walz: Walz spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard, which included a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks, working as an educator and coach, before shockingly defeating a six-term Republican incumbent congressman in 2006, a wave year for Democrats. Walz remained when the tide rolled out, reelected to the typically red district repeatedly until he left to run for his current job in 2018. (The seat quickly returned to GOP control after his departure.) Walz’s six years in charge of Minnesota have seen a remarkable series of political and social upheaval. First came the Covid-19 pandemic and then, in its midst, the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, which set off global anti-racist demonstrations. Walz navigated it all – alongside more usual complaints over wasteful spending – well enough that, by the beginning of 2023, he was leading a Democratic trifecta in the state government. Mark Kelly: Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly represents a state that Biden won by only 10,457 votes in 2020 and has national name recognition both as a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He has been a reliable supporter of Democratic Party priorities while in office but has occasionally bucked his party, such as in 2023, when he flatly called the influx of undocumented migrants across the US southern border a “crisis.” If Kelly was elected to higher office, his seat would remain in Democratic hands as Gov. Katie Hobbs would be able to appoint his successor. A campaign official says Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip to Savannah, Georgia, has been postponed due to the impacts from Tropical Storm Debby.  Harris is set to campaign in several key battleground states this week alongside her running mate, who is expected to be announced before a rally tomorrow in Philadelphia. Former President Donald Trump on Monday criticized Google and said people should “not use it” over what he claimed was censorship by the search engine over his assassination attempt last month.  “The market speaks. Everybody should maybe just go off Google, not use it. There are so many other things,” Trump said in a streamed conversation with Internet personality Adin Ross.  Trump claimed, “When you put up the name, the word assassination, it went to Lincoln, it went to many other people, many of whom I didn’t even know there was an attempted assassination. The only one it didn’t have was Trump. Think of it. And when you put up the word assassination it also sent you to Kamala, and people were really angry.” Trump said Google was “really crooked” and horrible.”  A few weeks after promising to eliminate taxes on tips, former President Donald Trump has unveiled a second proposal for targeted tax relief. The beneficiaries this time would be senior citizens, an influential voting bloc. While lifting the levy would benefit many older Americans for a little while, the proposal would harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget, if Trump and Congress don’t come up with a way to replace the lost revenue, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. What’s more, many seniors could ultimately be hurt if Social Security and Medicare’s trust funds run dry sooner and benefits have to be cut. In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump reiterated his promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits but did not specify how he would pay for the proposal. When Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo asked how he would offset the lost revenue, Trump said he would focus on eliminating “waste” and “fat” in the federal government – but did not say what he would cut. The highest-income households would be the biggest winners in dollar terms, but middle class and upper-middle income taxpayers would get the largest boost in their after-tax income, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Lower-income households would get little to no benefit. Social Security benefits began being taxed in 1984 as part of the last major federal overhaul to shore up the program’s finances. Any changes to tax law would need to go through Congress. Read more about Trump’s proposal here. Vice President Kamala Harris is staying focused on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in the final hours of her process to select a running mate, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Harris met with Shapiro and Walz in separate meetings on Sunday. She also met with Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.  CNN previously reported that Harris has not decided on her vice presidential running mate as of Monday morning. The selection process, these sources cautioned, is still fluid, and none of the finalists could be ruled out until Harris makes her decision.  All three – Shapiro, Walz and Kelly — remain in the running as of Monday afternoon, a source told CNN.   Casa Grande, Arizona —It is 101 degrees, the desert sun in full force. Yet Pablo Correa and Jacob Dials are smiling as they go door to door, foot soldiers in a progressive army that suddenly has a bouncy spring in its step. Correa said canvassers who were loyal to President Joe Biden are now excited by Vice President Kamala Harris, seeing her as a candidate with more vigor, more diversity and, critically, more support. However, not all voters feel that Harris represents any real change on the issues plaguing many Democrats. Read more here. Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing to employ high-profile musical acts to help boost her campaign, with the indie group Bon Iver planning a performance at a rally in Wisconsin this week. Billboard first reported on the band’s plans to perform at Wednesday’s event, which is part of a larger swing through battleground states. Harris will be joined at each stop by her still-to-be-named running mate. The group was founded in Eau Claire, where the rally will take place. Last week, Harris was joined at a rally in Atlanta by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion and rapper Quavo — acts that would have been difficult to imagine appearing at a rally with President Joe Biden when he was the party’s presumed nominee. Harris also sought permission from Beyoncé to use her song “Freedom” as part of her campaign.  It’s all part of a more concerted push to use popular culture and entertainment figures to help galvanize support behind Harris ahead of November’s election. A bipartisan group of secretaries of state blasted Elon Musk and his X platform Monday for providing “false information” about Vice President Kamala Harris’ supposed ineligibility to appear on the 2024 presidential ballot in several battleground states.  The group flagged issues that emerged last month with the AI-powered Grok chatbot on X, formerly known as Twitter. Soon after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, Grok provided information to some users inaccurately, stating: “The ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election,” in nine states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas and Ohio, according to the letter.  The letter urged Musk to “immediately implement changes” on the X platform. They want him to direct users to a nonpartisan website from the National Association of Secretaries of State where voters can look up reliable information about their registration status and polling-place locations.  Election officials from five of the nine affected states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington state – signed onto the letter. Four of the five officials are Democrats. Pennsylvania’s top election official, Al Schmidt, is a Republican who famously refused to support former President Donald Trump’s attempts to interfere with the 2020 election results in Philadelphia.   CNN has reached out to X for comment.  According to the letter, the false information about Harris’ eligibility to appear on the ballot reached “millions of people” before it was apparently corrected, after 10 days.  Vice President Kamala Harris had not made a decision on her vice-presidential running mate as of Monday morning, a source familiar with the process tells CNN, as the Harris campaign is getting ready to unveil that choice in a matter of hours.  The decision is expected to be made later today, and once it is made, the vice president would inform a small team of top advisers – and of course, her chosen running mate. While that is the general expectation on timing, sources cautioned that the decision is ultimately Harris’ to make and Harris’ alone – and if she needed more time, the final decision could slide into tomorrow.   Harris and her new running mate will appear at a joint rally together in Philadelphia tomorrow evening, before hitting a series of additional cities in battleground states the rest of the week. Over the weekend, she interviewed in-person Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.  The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Biden-Harris administration couldn’t shake the “vibecession” even when the economy was on a tear. It may be even harder now that cracks are forming in the labor market. Americans have been grumpy about the economy for the better part of three years because prices have gone up, and — fairly or unfairly — many consumers have blamed the White House. Now, inflation is more or less under control, but that’s also come at a cost: The job market, while still historically strong, is starting to weaken. Last month, the economy gained just 114,000 jobs, and unemployment rose to 4.3% from 4.1%, largely because of an influx of job seekers re-entering the workforce. It was hardly a disastrous jobs report, but it was a surprisingly abrupt shift from June, when the economy added 179,000, and May, when it added 216,000. One month isn’t enough to declare a trend, but it’s enough to seriously complicate Harris’ economic pitch as the new presumptive Democratic nominee. Earlier Monday, the Biden administration announced that White House economic aide Gene Sperling would leave after serving as the president’s implementation coordinator for the $1.9 trillion Covid relief law, known as the American Rescue Plan, to help fill out Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy team.  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to travel to Maine on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Department of Transportation announced Monday. He’s expected to tour bridge construction sites and a port location as the 50th state stop on his national tour promoting the Biden administration’s infrastructure investments. Buttigieg has been on the shortlist of potential running mates for Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris and her VP pick are expected to make stops in seven swing states this week, including Pennsylvania on Tuesday evening and Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday. White House economic aide Gene Sperling is leaving the White House after serving as President Joe Biden’s implementation coordinator for the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law, known as the American Rescue Plan, to help fill out Vice President Kamala Harris’ policy team.  Sperling will be a senior economic advisor to the policy team on the campaign, according to a White House official. His departure comes after Brian Nelson, a top Treasury official, left the administration last week to join the campaign.  Sperling has over a decade of experience in senior roles in government having served in previous Democratic administration under Clinton and Obama. Under both president’s he led the federal government’s response during moments of economic crisis.  Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made light of a decade-old incident in which he drove a dead bear cub carcass from upstate New York to New York City and placed it in Central Park, joking “maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” referring to a past medical abnormality he has said was caused by a parasitic worm in his brain. Kennedy made the comment in an interview with The New Yorker as part of an expansive profile of his life and presidential campaign published on Monday. Kennedy revealed he drove the dead bear cub to Central Park approximately 10 years ago in a video on social media on Sunday as part of an effort to get ahead of the magazine’s story. The New Yorker article includes an image of Kennedy sticking his hand in the dead bear’s mouth, pantomiming as if the bear is biting his hand. The image echoes a photo published by Vanity Fair last month of Kennedy pretending to eat a cooked animal carcass. Vanity Fair reported Kennedy sent the photo to a friend while suggesting they try eating dog. The publication consulted with a veterinarian who said the carcass in the photo appeared to be a dog. When asked about the bear incident, he told the magazine, “maybe that’s where I got my brain worm,” referencing a 2010 incident in which Kennedy experienced short-term memory loss and “brain fog” that he said was caused by a parasitic worm that entered his brain and died. Kennedy has often referenced the brain worm episode for comedic effect at campaign events and in interviews since it was first reported by the New York Times in May. He has previously said he believes he contracted the parasite from eating undercooked meat. The wide-ranging article details Kennedy’s history with drug addiction, his previous marriages and infidelity and his relationship to his family. If Donald Trump is reelected, he’ll take office having learned the lessons of four years of legal battles in his first term, during which inexperienced personnel, slapdash policymaking and his own indifference to how the federal government worked made his agenda especially vulnerable to legal challenges. The 2024 Republican nominee already has a clear idea of how he’d jumpstart a second term, with plans to immediately enact hardline immigration policies and to dismantle civil service protections for thousands of federal employees. His allies, including the influential conservative organizations that have participated in the endeavor known as Project 2025, have crafted policy papers and vetted potential Trump-aligned staff that could swiftly be hired to the federal government, so that his vision could be quickly and effectively implemented. (Trump himself has tried to distance himself from Project 2025 but many of his policies and goals overlap.) Ferguson said his office was “building the airplane as we were flying it” at the time. Now, the Washington Democrat – who is running for governor – has spent the last year pulling together a legal playbook so that his successor will be ready to hit the ground running in the event Trump wins again. Those kind of preparations – researching case law, writing memos, shifting around staff – are being done across the country by liberal advocacy groups, blue states and other organizations that fought Trump in court. They’re thinking through the kinds of plaintiffs they’d recruit, where in the country they’d file their lawsuits, how they’d shape their legal arguments to adjust for how the judicial landscape has changed in the last several years and bulking up on litigative staff.

Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, defended her husband’s previous comments deriding childless adults and downplayed his labeling of some Democratic politicians as “childless cat ladies,” calling it a “quip.” In a sit-down interview with Fox News that aired Monday, Usha Vance, a trial lawyer, argued her husband’s past comments, which have received renewed scrutiny since he joined former President Donald Trump’s presidential ticket, were in service of an argument about the challenges facing parents and the role government plays in parents’ lives. “The reality is, JD made a quote – I mean, he made a quip, and he made a quip in service of making a point that he wanted to make that was substantive,” she said. The first solo interview from Usha Vance comes alongside fresh urgency for the Republican senator to quickly change the conversation around his candidacy. Trump allies have been eager to see Usha Vance defend her husband and the Republican ticket publicly as the campaign continues its defense of different resurfaced clips of JD Vance. Read more here. As Vice President Kamala Harris draws closer to selecting her running mate, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain on Sunday reiterated his support for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while expressing reservations about Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. “I believe a Harris-Beshear ticket would be unbeatable. I believe both of them would just be such dynamic candidates,” Fain said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Fain added, “But we really like Tim Walz from Minnesota. Also think he’s an awesome guy for labor, 100% behind labor, and those would be our top two if we had to pick any.” In contrast, Fain expressed concerns about Shapiro’s support for school vouchers and Kelly’s position on the union-friendly PRO Act. Kelly told HuffPost last month that he would vote in favor of the legislation if it came to the floor; he had previously cited reservations about a provision that would extend collective-bargaining rights to independent contractors. Fain has criticized former President Donald Trump’s lack of support for union workers and his courting of big donors instead of blue-collar workers. The United Auto Workers formally endorsed Harris last week, and the union remains a political force in the critical battleground state of Michigan. Vice President Kamala Harris is making the biggest decision of her two-week-old presidential campaign as she chooses a running mate and prepares to introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters in several key battleground states this week. It was unclear late Sunday after a day of interviews with finalists whether she had made a final decision, people familiar with the search said. The campaign plans to officially announce the choice through an online message to supporters before a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, where she’s expected to make her first appearance with her pick. Harris hopes to keep it under wraps “until as close to then as possible,” a person familiar with the search told CNN. The selection will kick off a new phase of the campaign, as Harris seeks to maintain the momentum that has propelled her bid and former President Donald Trump struggles to adapt to running against an entirely new candidate. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Sunday brushed off recent criticism of his selection as Donald Trump’s running mate, calling it a “badge of honor.” Vance also responded to being called “weird” by supporters of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, calling the put-down “a lot of projection.”  Asked about Harris’ potential running mate, Vance replied “I think whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris’ record and Kamala Harris’ policies,” adding: “I don’t really care who she chooses as a running mate.” "
Virginia man charged with threatening to kill Vice President Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"Published 5:46 PM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T21:46:40.469Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/death-threats-kamala-harris-virginia-man-arrested/index.html,"A Virginia man has been charged with making death threats against Vice President Kamala Harris and appeared in federal court on Monday. According to court records, Frank Lucio Carillo made several threats against Harris, President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, several Arizona officials, and others on the right-wing social media platform Gettr. In response to a subpoena, the FBI found 4,359 posts from Carillo “targeting various public officials,” including Harris. In several posts, Carillo allegedly threatened to cut out Harris’ eyes and described various ways he wanted to kill the vice president, court records say. “I will cut your eyes out,” Carillo allegedly wrote in one expletive-laden rant where he called Harris a “b*tch” and said he hoped she would “suffer a slow agonizing death.” A number of similar posts are cited in court records, with graphic and detailed threats against the vice president as well as others, including one Islamophobic post in 2023 when he wrote that people should “go out with your guns and kill all Muslims.” When FBI agents first arrived at Carillo’s house over the social media posts, Carillo asked if they were there “about the online stuff,” and said, “I posted it.” Carrillo, appearing to talk to himself, also said, “I guess I’m gonna need a lawyer,” according to court documents. Federal agents retrieved two firearms from his home, including a pistol he bought in 2023 and a rifle purchased this year. A hearing to determine whether Carillo will remain behind bars while awaiting a resolution in his case has been set for Thursday. CNN is reaching out to an attorney for Carillo for comment."
Harris’ whirlwind search for running mate enters final hours as she prepares to take new Democratic ticket on the road | CNN Politics,"Updated 3:34 PM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T04:01:02.565Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/harris-vice-presidential-search-2024/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris is making the biggest decision of her two-week-old presidential campaign as she chooses a running mate and prepares to introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters in several key battleground states this week. Harris is focusing on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN, although the process, these sources cautioned, is still fluid and none of the finalists can be ruled out until Harris makes her decision. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly remained in the running as of Monday afternoon, a source told CNN. The selection will kick off a new phase of the campaign, as Harris seeks to maintain the momentum that has propelled her bid and former President Donald Trump struggles to adapt to running against an entirely new candidate. The decision is expected to be made later Monday, and once it is made, the vice president would inform a small team of top advisers and her pick. Sources cautioned, however, that the decision is ultimately Harris’ to make – and if she needed more time, the final decision could slide into Tuesday. The campaign plans to officially announce the choice through an online message to supporters before a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, where she’s expected to make her first appearance with her pick. Harris hopes to keep it under wraps “until as close to then as possible,” a person familiar with the search told CNN. The whirlwind vice presidential search entered its final hours Sunday after Harris had interviewed three final contenders — Walz, Shapiro and Kelly — and weighed her choice with advisers out of public view for three straight days. An extraordinary campaign for and against the candidates broke out across the spectrum of the Democratic Party last week and over the weekend. Different stakeholders have made their own arguments about who would be most electable against Trump — and who could help Harris sustain the streak of positive news her campaign has been riding for the past two weeks, while the former president has been put on the defensive over his own vice-presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid last month and endorsed Harris, the vice president has locked up the support of the Democratic Party and improved on the president’s polling against Trump. A new CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday, for example, found no clear leader between Harris and Trump among likely voters nationally — whereas Biden had been down 5 points in previous CBS News/YouGov polling. A CNN average of four recent polls also found a close matchup between the two, with Trump averaging the support of 49% and Harris averaging 47%. Harris’ candidacy has energized Democrats and stirred donors, with her campaign announcing last week that it had raised $310 million in July, more than double Trump’s haul of $138.7 million. And on Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced that Harris had won enough delegate support to win the party’s nomination ahead of the end of the voting period Monday. It was four years ago this week that Biden announced his decision to choose Harris as his running mate. He did so on August 11, 2020, through a text message and email to his supporters. Harris is hoping to make her choice known in the same manner, aides said, in hopes of building anticipation and a massive campaign list. “I want you to be the first to know who I am selecting to serve alongside me as Vice President,” Harris wrote in a campaign email last week to supporters. “Add your name to this exclusive list of supporters who will be notified immediately when the news breaks.” Her running mate selection will also help shape the ticket at a time when Harris has been trying to moderate her image with voters since her short-lived presidential campaign in 2019. Last week, her campaign clarified her position on a number of issues, including that she no longer supports “Medicare for All” or a ban on fracking. And on Sunday, Republicans for Biden relaunched in support of Harris — as the vice president’s team hopes to win over Republicans who oppose Trump and independents and make clear that she is not a “San Francisco radical.” As the running mate selection process drew to a close, observers made their case for different contenders on the Sunday shows. “I think she needs to pick someone who’s more moderate than her. I think she needs to pick someone that’s got more governing experience at the ground level,” former New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie said on ABC News’ “This Week.” “It should be Josh Shapiro, I don’t think this is a hard choice,” the one-time Trump ally said. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, whose union endorsed Harris, said he favors Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, praising him as a labor ally who was able to win a red state twice, and also approves of Walz. “Those would be our top two if we had to pick any, but ultimately, look, Vice President Harris has to pick who she’s most comfortable with because it’s her running mate,” Fain said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” While Harris has been preparing to choose a running mate, the Trump campaign has struggled over how to reshape the narrative around her. Despite his campaign’s efforts to paint Harris as “dangerously liberal,” the former president attacked Harris’ racial identity, saying she “happened to turn Black” during a panel interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week. Republicans have urged Trump to focus on policy, not race or identity. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage and not her terrible, dangerous liberal record throughout her entire political life, is a good day for her and a bad day for us,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I would encourage President Trump to prosecute the case against Kamala Harris’s bad judgment.” During a Saturday rally in Atlanta, where Harris had addressed supporters days earlier, Trump sought to blunt some of the momentum she has enjoyed since launching her campaign, while defending Vance, who’s faced scrutiny over past controversial comments. “We have to work hard to define her,” Trump said. “I don’t even want to define her. I just want to say who she is. She’s a horror show.” But he also took the opportunity to lash out at a fellow Republican in the key battleground state, disparaging Gov. Brian Kemp, who revealed last month that he did not support Trump in the state’s GOP primary. (The governor has said he’ll “support the ticket” in November.) Earlier in the day, Trump attacked Kemp and his wife on Truth Social. The rally followed hours of the Trump and Harris campaigns engaging in a public back-and-forth over when they would meet on the debate stage after the former president said he would no longer attend a September 10 ABC News debate he agreed to when Biden was still the nominee. After two weeks of sowing doubt over whether he would attend, Trump said Saturday he would instead meet Harris at a September 4 Fox News debate with a live audience or not at all. “We’re doing one with Fox, if she shows up,” Trump said. “I don’t think she’s going to show up,” he added. Harris’ campaign has said she will attend the ABC News event, and taunted the former president for backing out of that event. “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space,’” Harris wrote on X Saturday. “I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.” This story has been updated with additional reporting."
"Justice Thomas accepted previously undisclosed private jet flight to New Zealand, Senate Democrat says | CNN Politics","Updated 3:31 PM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T17:53:50.003Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-hawaii-new-zealand/index.html,"Justice Clarence Thomas took a previously undisclosed flight on a private jet owned by GOP megadonor Harlan Crow in 2010, a top Senate Democrat said Monday – the latest in a series of revelations that come as the high court is under pressure to strengthen its ethics practices. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said US Customs and Border Protection records reviewed by the committee showed Thomas and his wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, flew from Hawaii to New Zealand on Crow’s jet on November 19, 2010, and then returned on the jet a week later. The flight was not listed on Thomas’ financial disclosure reports and is the most recent example of the conservative justice accepting luxury travel from Crow becoming public. Earlier examples of that travel documented by ProPublica last year – including travel on Crow’s yacht, the Michaela Rose – prompted widespread calls for ethics reform at the court. “Neither Mr. Crow nor Justice Thomas have disclosed the full scale of the Thomas’s use of the Michaela Rose and private jets courtesy of Mr. Crow, even as the Congress continues to uncover additional international private jet travel with Mr. Crow that Justice Thomas failed to disclose on his ethics filings,” Wyden wrote in a letter to Crow’s attorney on Monday. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, is focused on the potential tax implications of the gifts Crow made to Thomas. “I am deeply concerned that Mr. Crow may have been showering a public official with extravagant gifts, then writing off those gifts to lower his tax bill,” Wyden wrote. The New York Times first reported on Wyden’s letter. A spokesman for Crow told CNN that the billionaire’s lawyers had “already addressed Senator Wyden’s inquiries, which have no legal basis and are only intended to harass a private citizen.” “It’s concerning that Senator Wyden is abusing his committee’s powers as part of a politically motivated campaign against the Supreme Court,” the spokesman said. Thomas did not respond to a request for comment. President Joe Biden has made structural changes at the Supreme Court an issue during the waning months of his presidency. Biden has proposed term limits for Supreme Court justices and also an enforceable code of conduct. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Monday said “today’s news strengthens the case” Biden made for reforms. “The most powerful court in the United States shouldn’t be subject to the lowest ethical standards, and conflicts of interest on the Supreme Court cannot go unchecked,” Bates said. Thomas has come under fire for his failure to include such trips on financial disclosure forms the justices release each year, though he and his defenders argue that he followed the court’s disclosure rules as they were understood at the time. Last year, the federal judiciary’s policy-making body said that travel on private planes should be reported by the justices – closing a loophole that Thomas said had exempted him from reporting the “personal hospitality” he had received from friends. Thomas has previously said that he was advised at the time that he was not required to disclose the hospitality he received from the Crows, but that he intended to follow the recent changes to the guidance going forward. In June, Thomas revised his disclosure form to formally disclose a 2019 trip to Indonesia paid for by Crow, a vacation that was at the center of the controversy over his travel. In response to criticism, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct last year for the first time in its history. But the document relies on the justices themselves to police their ethics and that arrangement has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and ethics experts.

"How female politicians’ first names can work for and against them, according to science | CNN","Updated 2:26 PM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-03T14:30:02.784Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/health/politicians-names-kamala-harris/index.html,"Throughout the course of US presidential races, politicians have carefully chosen what names they go by. Bernie and Pete embraced their first names while Biden, Trump and Warren favored their last names. Some, like Nikki Haley, have used both. As Kamala Harris sets her eyes on the presidency, she is using a combination. The vice president is running under the “Harris for President” slogan – a departure from the “Kamala Harris for the People” motto of her 2020 campaign – but is using her first name for social media accounts, including Kamala HQ on X, formerly Twitter. There’s a solid science behind each choice, experts say. Candidates, in particular women, can use the psychological connotation of a first name to their advantage, to help them seem more likeable and accessible. But this psychology can also serve as a disadvantage, playing off implicit biases to portray a candidate as less qualified or confident. The science comes together in a “balancing act for women,” according to Dr. Stav Atir, assistant professor in the Management and Human Resources Department at the University of Wisconsin School of Business, who has studied how gender affects the way we talk about professionals. Atir was lead author of a study that found people were more than twice as likely to describe a male professional by surname in “high-status” fields, including politics. In the medical field, other research indicates that female physicians are more than twice as likely to be called by their first names instead of “doctor,” compared with their male counterparts. This difference, the study found, can have real-life effects: People perceived those referred to by their surnames as superior and 14% more deserving of a career award, such as raising funding or being selected for a position. For Harris, Atir says, using “Kamala” could be “potentially costly.” A first-name reference may lead women to be perceived as less deserving and competent. On the other hand, using a first name can make the vice president seem more likeable and approachable, according to Atir, who noted that likeability and competence are both critical qualities in voters’ minds. To be sure, such undertones may also affect men; critics such as Harris and Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen often refer to him by his first name. “As a political scientist, I know candidates use language to their advantage. If someone wants to sound more down-to-earth, likeable and familiar, they might just go by their first name,” said Dr. Joseph Uscinski, professor of political science at the University of Miami. “This is what campaigns do. They try to market the best way possible with the best words possible.” For women, research has suggested that this likeability is often more critical for their evaluations than in evaluations of men. In turn, using a first name could become a more potent tool for female candidates, as likeability significantly influences how they are perceived, Atir said. The use of a last name could even be counterproductive. “Women in male-dominated professions, like politics, are often assumed to be less competent because of gender stereotypes, and their response is often to emulate what works for men, which can include maybe pushing the last name,” she said. “That often ends up being counterproductive. Women often face backlash or are seen as less likeable when they adopt these traditionally masculine behaviors.” The tool of first names and likeability for women can be a double-edged sword. Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College, warned that a candidate going by their first name in campaign materials could backfire, especially if that candidate is a woman. Implicit bias underlies how people choose to address female professionals, she said, describing it as an “unconscious bias against women candidates” such as Harris. Implicit biases “are unconscious feelings, attitudes, prejudices and stereotypes due to past experiences and influences, and the culture you grew up in,” Saltz said. By using a first name, “you are implying that you feel [Harris] has less expertise, confidence, stature or ability to lead, that she is less qualified for this job than her male counterpart.” Dropping the title of a female candidate can also reflect internal bias, according to Atir. “Naming conventions reveal our gender stereotypes,” she added. How people name someone can reflect what they think of that person, Uscinski said. “When we refer to someone who has a title without the title, that could be somewhat demeaning, as if they don’t deserve that title or position.” Uscinski was lead author of a 2010 study about coverage of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, which demonstrated that journalists at the time referred to Clinton more informally – either without her title or by her first name – than her male competitors. It also suggested that male broadcasters exhibited gender bias in how they referenced presidential candidates. Naming practices were just one aspect of what the study authors called the “hostile media environment” Clinton faced. The media scrutinized her menstrual cycle, pantsuits and laugh, and her husband’s infidelity, none of which were issues for her male competitors. This media coverage can “profoundly affect election outcomes,” the researchers wrote. Specifically, other research from the time showed that such gender biases in coverage disadvantage female candidates. In 2016, Clinton became the first female presidential nominee of a major US political party. As Harris looks set to join this exclusive club, it might be tempting to compare their journeys. However, things have changed since 2008 when Clinton first sought the Democratic Party’s nomination, Uscinski says, highlighting the complex nature of political analysis and the current election. “When Clinton was running, norms were still evolving for how to deal with a woman who could potentially be a major party nominee and potentially president. Things have evolved,” he said. Nonetheless, the underlying gender biases seem to remain, according to Atir. “The fact that we’re seeing the same pattern now suggests that the specific gender bias doesn’t seem to have shifted,” she said. Harris has not been outspoken on the choice between using her first or last name, but she has commented widely on the mispronunciation of her first name. During her US Senate run in 2016, a campaign ad focused how to pronounce Kamala, and she has characterized its purposeful mispronunciation as “childish.” “People ask me how to pronounce it. There are many ways,” Harris also said in a 2017 interview. “If you were asking my grandmother, she’d say ‘come-lah.’ I usually help people pronounce it by saying, ‘Well, just think of a comma and add a “-la” at the end.’” In 2020, former Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue referred to the then vice-presidential candidate as “Ka-MAL-a or Kamala, Kamala, Ka-mala, -mala, -mala, I don’t know, whatever,” to laughter from the crowd at a Trump campaign rally. A spokesperson for Perdue’s campaign later told CNN the former senator “didn’t mean anything by it.” A similar pattern has arisen in 2024. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly mispronounced the vice president’s first name, admitting in a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday that he “couldn’t care less” if he says it correctly. At a campaign event in Wisconsin on Saturday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff said, “Mr. Trump, I know you have so much trouble pronouncing her name. Here’s the good news: After the election, you can just call her Madam President.” Purposeful mispronunciation of “Kamala” can be a tool used by political opponents to “other” her, said Jamal Simmons, Harris’ former communications director. Such remarks have been characterized as “incredibly racist” by Sabrina Singh, Harris’ press secretary during her 2020 campaign. “It’s probably done to demean her,” Uscinski added. “Some people may pronounce the name wrong by accident, but other people will do it purposely when they know better.” According to Atir, “Kamala” is tied to the vice president’s identity, not only as a woman but as a person of color. “Her first name can be used to weaponize her non-Whiteness by her detractors, but it can also be used to celebrate her identity by her supporters and potentially even her own campaign,” she said. It is not clear what the optimal strategy is for Harris, experts say. The use of a name in any situation – but specifically in a political campaign – is nuanced, according to Atir and Uscinski. “People may want to draw the conclusion that surname references are always better, and that’s not necessarily the case,” Atir said. “There isn’t a clear hierarchy of which type of reference is superior to the other here. That really depends on the context and the goals you’re trying to achieve.” However, Saltz disagreed. “Because of confirmation bias, a clearly identified phenomenon, it’s not good for the candidate, Kamala Harris, to have it continue to go on ‘Kamala,’ ” she said. “For people who have been hearing [‘Kamala’] for a while, when they start saying Harris or Kamala Harris, they might not register it.” Political strategists have navigated the complexities of name recognition and voter perception in US presidential campaigns. In the current race, Harris holds a unique position as a female candidate, with the science having the potential to both benefit and challenge her. At the end of the day, it’s about respect, Harris told People magazine in 2020. “It’s about respect for all that comes with a name. … Respect the names that people are given, and use those names with respect.” CNN Editorial Research and CNN’s Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report."
Harris brings new energy to Democrats in Arizona but still faces challenges mending cracks in Biden’s 2020 coalition | CNN Politics,"Published 12:04 PM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T16:04:47.265Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/arizona-kamala-harris-energy-biden-coalition/index.html,"It is 101 degrees, the desert sun in full force. Yet Pablo Correa and Jacob Dials are smiling as they go door to door, foot soldiers in a progressive army that suddenly has a bouncy spring in its step. “There’s a lot more enthusiasm,” Dials said in an interview between canvassing stops. “There’s a lot more energy around. … Folks who were still planning on voting are a lot more enthusiastic about voting. Now we are hearing conversations like, ‘Oh, I already told my friends, my family, my neighbor to go out and vote,’ versus ‘yeah, I’m going to go out and vote, probably.’” The source of the change, of course, is the switch atop the Democratic ticket. Correa said canvassers who were loyal to President Joe Biden are now excited by Vice President Kamala Harris, seeing her as a candidate with more vigor, more diversity and, critically, more support. “We definitely feel it is our duty to defend democracy,” said Correa, who served in the Marine Corps. “Duty for us is sustainable and that is how it felt prior to Harris taking the top of the ticket. Now, there’s excitement and if you can throw excitement on top of duty … folks really want to jump in and be involved.” Canvassing is hard and often thankless work at any time. Correa, Dials and their Rural Arizona Action colleagues, though, are next-level. Their mission is to target rural areas where the homes can be far apart and where residents are sometimes unwelcoming, even hostile. Here, knock on 100 doors and, on average, just 16 or 17 people will answer and engage in at least brief conversation. Our time with Correa and Dials was spent in two neighborhoods in Casa Grande, about an hour south of Phoenix. One was a working-class development lined with modest trailers or small prefabricated homes, most of them rental properties occupied by local factory workers. The other was an area of neatly lined streets of single-family homes. Casa Grande is in Pinal County, a reliably red area where Donald Trump won both in 2016 and 2020 with nearly 60% support. Democratic voters are harder to come by here, but finding them could matter in a state Biden won in 2020 by little more than 10,000 votes. So before heading out, the office pep talk includes a mention of the calendar — inside 100 days to the election now — and one of how the mood can get more testy as the voting draws closer. “We know it is getting hot out there,” Correa told a room packed with young activists. “We definitely know it is not just the temperature. We just keep it moving. Tell them thank you, have a good day.” Along the office walls are boxes filled with handouts the canvassers can give voters or leave at the door if no one answers. Some are for local races. Others are for Congress. One is now a keepsake of a campaign like no other: a flyer urging support — in English and Spanish — for Biden and Ruben Gallego, the Democratic candidate for an open Senate seat. The new version, with Harris, was at the print shop when we visited. “We, of course, would have supported Joe Biden for the presidency,” Correa said. “But there is something closer to home with Harris atop the ticket.” Dials, likewise, explained why the switch changed so much. “It’s way easier to support a candidate who you can actually go out and see campaign,” he said. “You have that energy around you.” Our visit was part of a CNN project called All Over the Map that is following the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of critical voting blocs. Activists like these canvassers are already decided, but tagging along with them is a ground-level way of testing all the Democratic talk of new support now that Harris is the presumptive nominee. Melissa Cordero says her calendar is proof the new juice is legitimate. A Tucson resident, she was loyal to Biden and talked of the policy contrast with Trump when we first met four months ago. Now, Cordero smiles at every mention of Harris; uses the vice president’s first name; and shares that her email and calendar are full of new organizing events and ideas to help Harris, including some by Common Defense, a progressive veterans organization. “Not all veterans are for Trump,” said Cordero, who served in the Air Force. “Not all veterans are, you know, MAGA crazy Second Amendment people. There are ones out there that truly believe in democracy. And, you know, we want things like our reproductive freedom. … I think Kamala coming in has brought this just — just energy that wasn’t there.” Our Arizona visit included myriad examples of what we also found while visiting an All Over the Map group in Pennsylvania just after the president ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris: The words and expressions used by Democrats now expose plainly what was missing in Biden. “What Kamala brings is just the sharpness that I think we need right now,” Cordero said. “This exactness … is rallying the party and I don’t think that was really happening.” The challenge for Harris — and for committed supporters like Cordero — is to sustain the energy for three months. One way, Cordero said, is for Harris to draw forceful policy contrasts with Trump on immigration, national security, and issues she says are pivotal in Arizona. “The majority of us are living one accident away from being unsheltered,” Cordero said. “Jobs, money, rent caps — all the things that cause a lot of stress.” Also important, in Cordero’s view, are constant reminders of the Trump-Vance agenda. “Every election is important,” Cordero said. “But there are a lot of things coming from Trump’s camp that would just completely change life as we know it. Reproductive freedom, trans health care, all this stuff. A lot of people would be affected immediately. And we just have to stay motivated around them.” Cordero is clearly no fan of Trump. But she and many of her fellow veterans here are alarmed by the tension in today’s politics. Common Defense was among the organizers of a weekend vigil to condemn political violence, including the assassination attempt on Trump. “No one should be afraid to run,” Cordero said. “No one should be afraid to support and to vote. When you see something like that happen at that level, shooting at a former president, it’s just shaky. It’s scary.” Turning probable voters into likely voters is critical. So, too, is getting more small donors, more volunteers willing to knock on doors or work phone banks. Our Democratic voters — who for months talked of holding their breath, hoping Biden would not make things worse for their party’s chances — now express pride in seeing Harris aggressively make the case against Trump. And that kind of confidence fosters more on-the-ground action. “Door-knock and canvass and all that other good stuff,” is how Cordero put it. “That wasn’t really happening before.” But to engineer a Harris win, all that new energy would have to translate into significant progress in repairing serious cracks in the 2020 Biden coalition. Here in Arizona, struggles with Latinos and younger voters top the list. Winning back independents and moderate suburban Republicans would come next here. Nico Rios is skeptical Harris can pull it off. He was too young to vote in 2020 but supported Biden. He is 19 now, eager to vote and passionate as he compares Trumpism to fascism. But he is equally passionate as he ticks through his disagreements with Biden-Harris immigration policies. And he’s most animated when he discusses joining protests in recent months critical of Israel’s conduct in the conflict with Hamas and the Biden-Harris administration’s continued aid, including military equipment, to the Netanyahu government. “I can’t commit to the Democrats,” said Rios. “I used to think they were better. But I just don’t anymore.” Rios acknowledged Harris was forceful after her recent meeting with the Israeli prime minister, making clear it was time for Israel to accept a ceasefire and stop the killing of civilians in Gaza. But he has no faith in either major political party, lumping Harris in with a political class he believes promises a lot but follows through on little. “There’s nothing that Kamala can do in the next what, two three months, that can wash that blood from her hands in my view,” said Rios. He plans to vote for Claudia De la Cruz, the presidential candidate of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, who wants to end all US aid to Israel. Rios has no illusions that his candidate can win, but hopes the legacy of 2024 includes significant growth for third parties. “Now’s the time,” Rios said in an interview. “The two parties have never been more unpopular.” Rios took part in several marches and vigils to protest the deaths in Gaza. Most had a few hundred participants, the biggest maybe 2,000, he said. Modest numbers, but again margins matter in the close battlegrounds, and where Rios lives is a place to watch in the campaign’s final stretch. Gilbert is just southeast of Phoenix and one of the fastest-growing suburban communities in the country. In the 2000 census, Gilbert’s population was just over 117,000. Now it is above 275,000 and the median age is 34. It’s full of the younger and suburban voters behind Arizona’s shift from reliably red to competitive. Rios is determined to vote third-party. “That’s struggle, right?” he said. “You fight, you lose, you learn and then you fight again.” But he does acknowledge a change among some friends and peers since Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate. “I’ve certainly had friends who asked me, or had conversations about, you know: ‘What is Kamala’s deal? Is she better? Is she this? Is she that?’” Rios said. “And so those conversations are certainly happening. I just don’t know if they are happening in the numbers that the Democratic Party was hoping for.” Ray Flores is a different kind of challenge for Harris. He is an independent and a Tucson restaurateur. His family’s iconic El Charro, where we first met four months ago, is the building block of a business that now includes a dozen establishments. We met this time at Charro Steak, a bustling dinner stop in a brick downtown building that once housed a Studebaker dealership. His bottom line is unchanged since March: if he had to vote today, Flores said he would pick a third-party option, likely the Libertarian Party. Flores has little faith in the two major parties, seeing them as too focused on power and personalities and more eager to stir division than to make the tough compromises necessary for progress on immigration and other issues that he says make running a successful business difficult. “This is just so broken,” he said. “They just do things to win.” As an independent, Flores gets text messages and emails from campaigns and causes across the spectrum. He describes them this way: “Let’s humiliate the other one. Let’s destroy the other one. It’s not, ‘Hey, let’s win.’ It’s humiliation. It’s destruction.” He has been getting up early to watch the Olympics with his son, and Flores finds it refreshing. “I like when our country is shaking hands and hugging other countries,” Flores said. “I wish that politics had the same respect for competition that sports does.” Flores was just back from a monthlong family vacation to Europe when we met this time. He was overseas when a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania and when Biden made his dramatic decision to step aside from the campaign. “I’m a little bit lost,” Flores said. “Our system, our brand — let’s call it our brand — was being laughed at. And that was hurtful. … Our brand is important, and it was being laughed at and I didn’t like that we were the butt of the joke. I’m not without knowledge that we have issues, but to be the butt of a joke — that was painful.” Now, Flores described himself as “drinking through a fire hydrant” to get caught up on what he missed — in his business and in the presidential campaign. “I mean, this is a whole new game, right?” Flores said. “I do look forward to seeing some kind of debate between them. I think that would be more than good television. I think it would be eye-opening to see how they respond to each other.” Still third-party for now, but in the lingo of his business, Flores sees a moment to take another look at the menu. “This is fresh, new,” Flores said. “So, I think we should all kind of peel back and look at this in a fresh new way.”"
Election officials urge Elon Musk to stop his AI chatbot from spreading false 2024 election information | CNN Politics,"Published 11:51 AM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T15:51:51.956Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/election-officials-elon-musk-x/index.html,"A bipartisan group of secretaries of state blasted Elon Musk and his X platform Monday for providing “false information” about Vice President Kamala Harris’ supposed ineligibility to appear on the 2024 presidential ballot in several battleground states. The group flagged issues that emerged last month with the AI-powered Grok chatbot on X, formerly known as Twitter. Soon after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, Grok provided information to some users inaccurately stating that, “The ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election,” in nine states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas and Ohio, according to the letter. “This is false,” the letter says. “In all nine states the opposite is true: The ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.” The letter urged Musk to “immediately implement changes” on the X platform. They want him to direct users to a nonpartisan website from the National Association of Secretaries of State where voters can look up reliable information about their registration status and polling-place locations. Election officials from five of the nine affected states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington state – signed onto the letter. Four of the five officials are Democrats. Pennsylvania’s top election official, Al Schmidt, is a Republican who famously refused to support former President Donald Trump’s attempts to interfere with the 2020 election results in Philadelphia. CNN has reached out to X for comment. According to the letter, the false information about Harris’ eligibility to appear on the ballot reached “millions of people” before it was apparently corrected, after 10 days. After Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he has removed many of the prior guardrails that protected the platform from disinformation. This has allowed inaccurate information and full-blown conspiracy theories about a variety of topics, including the 2024 election, to proliferate and reach millions."
Cori Bush: Pro-Israel groups look to oust another progressive ‘squad’ member | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:40 AM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T10:00:02.429Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/politics/cori-bush-israel-democratic-primary-missouri/index.html,"Six weeks after leading the charge to oust Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a New York primary, a big-spending pro-Israel super PAC is hoping to help defeat another member of the House “squad” of progressive Democrats – Missouri Rep. Cori Bush. Already a top target for centrist and Israel-aligned groups, Bush broke ranks with her party’s leadership to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza last year and has been fiercely critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinian civilians. Bush has drawn three challengers as she seeks a third term representing Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, the most prominent of whom is Wesley Bell, the prosecuting attorney of St. Louis County. The spending in the race has not matched the campaign against Bowman – the most expensive House primary in US history. Nevertheless, the figures – for a safe blue district and one of 435 House seats – are remarkable. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s super PAC, United Democracy Project, has spent nearly $9 million on ads attacking Bush or boosting Bell. Though Bell has been more supportive of Israel’s actions, his campaign has not focused on the issue, and voters in the majority-minority, urban district in the St. Louis area are not clashing over it with the passion seen in in more typically progressive enclaves. Taking a page from Democrat George Latimer, who defeated Bowman in New York in June, Bell’s campaign has been more vibes-based – criticizing Bush for being too ideologically-driven, not being responsive enough to her constituents and – perhaps most potently – voting against President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill. “She sold out our president, and she sold out the city of St. Louis,” a person says in a United Democracy Project ad. That vote, like Bowman’s, was lodged in protest of certain aspects of the infrastructure legislation. (The measure, however, had enough support to be passed without their votes.) An ad from the Mainstream Democrats PAC attacked Bush for being the subject of a federal investigation over alleged misuse of campaign funds for security services. Bush has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that she complied with House rules. Bush’s message during the campaign has been simpler and, in many ways, mimics Bowman’s efforts to cast the race as a battle between big money and the grassroots “By supporting our grassroots campaign,” Bush said in a recent fundraising email, “you’re standing up against a grifter politician and the influence of big money in politics and demanding real representation for the people of MO-01.” It’s a tactic that had, before this summer, been effective for progressive House members facing well-financed challengers. Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee fended off a primary challenge for her Pittsburgh-area seat earlier in the year and other “squad” members, most notably New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, are now widely seen as invulnerable. The Bush-Bell contest, though, is deeper than it is wide. There is no policy gulf to speak of; they are mostly aligned on the broad spectrum of issues that come before House members. They both have strong ties to 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager, in Ferguson, which is located in Missouri’s 1st District. The outrage around Brown’s death effectively launched the Black Lives Matter movement. Bush, a pastor, became a prominent activist in those demonstrations and she parlayed that profile into twice challenge the 1st District incumbent, William Lacy Clay, in the Democratic primary, succeeding in 2020 on her second attempt. Bell, in contrast, had an earlier start in the political arena. He was elected to the Ferguson City Council in 2015. Three years later, running on a progressive platform, he unseated the controversial St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who had been in office since 1991. But like McCulloch, Bell did not charge the officer who shot Brown, irritating some supporters – including Brown’s father, who was featured last month in an ad for Bush. “I feel like he lied to us. He never brought charges against the killer,” Brown Sr. says in the spot. “He never walked the streets of Ferguson with me. He failed to reform the office.” In late October 2023, weeks after Hamas’ deadly attack inside Israel, Bell backed out of a Senate run against Republican Sen. Josh Hawley to announce that he would challenge Bush instead. At a news conference at the time, he suggested that the congresswoman’s stance on the conflict – she was among the first to call for a ceasefire – drew him to the race. “Understand this unique place that we are with the world literally on fire,” Bell said. “I think that we need to make certain that we are providing that effective leadership, not only in our district but in DC and on the world stage.” Incidentally, a few months earlier, Bell had told Bush in a phone call – first reported by KSDK in St. Louis – that he had no intention of challenging her. “Don’t even think for even a second that that’s the case,” Bell told the congresswoman. “I’m telling you, on my word, I am not running against you. That is not happening.” But now it is. Bell’s campaign hasn’t disputed what was said on the phone call, instead arguing that the assurance was given ahead of the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. His campaign manager told KSDK that Bell decided to leave the Senate primary for the House race after receiving “encouragement” from “stakeholders at the local, statewide, and national level.” Since then, it’s been a familiar proxy clash between old foes. AIPAC’s United Democracy Project and another pro-Israel group, Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, have invested in Bell’s cause, along with the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC and billionaire Reid Hoffman’s Mainstream Democrats PAC. In Bush’s corner, Justice Democrats, the group that became famous for recruiting Ocasio-Cortez to first run for office, and the Working Families Party are spending to defend their left-wing ally. The relative outlays, though, are stark – Bell-backers have outspent Bush’s side by about 3-to-1 on advertising. As the incumbent, Bush does have the backing, at least on paper, from House Democratic leadership, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are also on board. Ocasio-Cortez sent out fundraising appeals for the Bush campaign. At home, St. Louis City Mayor Tishaura Jones has also endorsed her. But support for Bell is robust locally too – often a more important mark of how a low-turnout primary will pan out than any other metric. Indivisible St. Louis endorsed Bell, who also has vast support from labor. The editorial board of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is also backing the challenger. Top Washington Democrats have been fairly quiet, not-so-subtly signaling that Bell will be welcome. Many are still cross with Bush for ousting Clay four years ago, breaking his family’s grip on a seat they’d held since before man walked on the moon.

Kamala Harris’ economic pitch just got a lot more complicated | CNN Business,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Mon August 5, 2024",2024-08-05T10:00:03.400Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/05/business/jobs-report-kamala-harris-economy/index.html,"The Biden-Harris administration couldn’t shake the “vibecession” even when the economy was on a tear. It may be even harder now that cracks are forming in the labor market. Americans have been grumpy about the economy for the better part of three years because prices have gone up, and — fairly or unfairly — many consumers have blamed the White House. Now, inflation is more or less under control, but that’s also come at a cost: The job market, while still historically strong, is starting to weaken. Last month, the economy gained just 114,000 jobs, and unemployment rose to 4.3% from 4.1%, largely because of an influx of job seekers re-entering the workforce. It was hardly a disastrous jobs report, but it was a surprisingly abrupt shift from June, when the economy added 179,000, and May, when it added 216,000. The jobs report was not a disaster, by any stretch, and it’s no guarantee of a looming recession. But it was a surprise, and economists expressed concerns about how quickly the labor market appears to have downshifted. “We don’t know just how precipitously the labor market is softening, but it seems pretty darn clear that it is softening,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. One month isn’t enough to declare a trend, but it’s enough to seriously complicate Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic pitch as the new presumptive Democratic nominee. For Wall Street, the surprise slowdown was the bitter cherry on top of a sundae of disappointing tech earnings. “The reason investors are reacting the way they are is because we are back, in many ways, to where we were during the dot-com bubble,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told me. “And at the same time, it’s just a reminder that investors are no better than hyperactive first-graders playing musical chairs, always trying to out-anticipate the other as to when the music will stop.” Investors went a little berserk on Friday, sending US stocks down sharply. The Dow shed more than 600 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 lost 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.4%, putting the tech-heavy index in correction territory (down 10% from its peak on July 10.). (In other words, Wall Street may have overreacted because, well, that’s just kinda the way Wall Street does things.) Until very recently, the labor market had held up unbelievably well under the strain of higher interest rates, which make it harder for businesses to expand. Cracks are beginning to form, though, as jobless claims rise, unemployment creeps higher and fewer people are changing jobs. Historically, that is a bad sign for the incumbent party. When the unemployment rate falls over the two years before an election, the incumbent tends to win re-election, a recent analysis by Refinitiv shows. Not surprisingly, when the unemployment rate rises before an election, challengers tend benefit. It’s not a perfect indicator — there have been a handful of exceptions to the trend in the past 64 years — but unemployment has risen 0.8 point over the past two years, and that could create an extra hurdle for Harris. Republicans have been seizing on Americans’ inflation fatigue to argue against President Joe Biden’s economic policies, while downplaying (or fully ignoring) month after month of blockbuster jobs reports. Now, with inflation coming down, the GOP has fresh material to propel its message that the economy is a shambles, even when it is, by almost all measures, historically strong. “This jobs report is one of the worst we have ever seen from the Biden-Harris Administration,” Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri said in a statement Friday. “Another dreadful jobs report under the leadership of Biden/Harris,” wrote the Connecticut GOP on X. For three-plus years, the Biden administration has been able to rebut Republicans’ attacks with a litany of good news from the labor market: wages outpacing inflation, 16 million new jobs, unemployment holding steady under 4%. Still, poll after poll showed that inflation fatigue was overshadowing just about everything else on voters’ minds. It didn’t matter how much wages went up or how abundant the jobs were — the vibes were bad. The labor market is still strong, but its strengths have more caveats. And “it’s complicated” isn’t exactly a slam dunk message to woo voters."
"Republicans for Harris launches, aiming for Biden-like appeal to anti-Trump voters | CNN Politics","Updated 11:16 AM EDT, Sun August 4, 2024",2024-08-04T11:30:02.694Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/republicans-for-harris-anti-trump-gop-voters/index.html,"The group known as Republicans for Biden is officially relaunching Sunday as Republicans for Harris, and aides on the revamped Democratic campaign are hoping that a much different candidate will be able to deliver on what had been a key part of Joe Biden’s electoral promise. The rollout will include outreach from Republicans to Republicans, targeted ads and themed events as aides aim to convince voters that Kamala Harris is not a “San Francisco radical” and that Donald Trump and others have changed. In an election that is once again looking tight, the Harris campaign is hoping that Republicans repelled by Trump and independent moderates can help make a difference for the vice president in critical states. At its core, the latest effort targets Republicans who see Trump as anathema or the kind of existential threat to democracy that would compel them to cross party lines and who had bought into Biden as an acceptable alternative. Aides who have been shifting from @joebiden.com to @kamalaharris.com email addresses acknowledge now that the outreach to these Republicans had become difficult as confidence in Biden spiraled after his dismal debate performance. A post-debate call with supporters of Trump’s former GOP primary rival Nikki Haley was marked by several expressions of diminished confidence in Biden, another reflection of how deep the president’s problems were, according to one person involved. But the Democratic energy around the switch to Harris is now reaping benefits, aides say. “There’s a lot of excitement, because I think people were feeling unsure of where things were going, and now they are all on board,” said Austin Weatherford, a onetime chief of staff to former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Weatherford had just started gearing up with the Republicans for Biden effort in June when the race took a turn. Weatherford told CNN that while Biden was “providing the alternative” on the topic of preserving democracy, “now people just see it more clearly. They feel it more clearly.” On Monday, the new group will hold kick-off events in Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, aides told CNN. Already signing on as supporters: former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld (the 2016 Libertarian nominee for vice president who then challenged Trump in the 2020 Republican primary), former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, Kinzinger, former Virginia Rep. Denver Riggleman, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh (who also challenged Trump in the 2020 primary) and former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham. Former Rhode Island Rep. Claudine Schneider, who now lives in Colorado and has been leading efforts to organize other former Republican members of Congress, told CNN via email that she believes Harris is “the PERFECT candidate to oppose Trump,” calling her “intelligent, honest, hard working” and someone who “genuinely cares about every citizen, and about justice.” Schneider said that she is interested in changing the political conversation back toward compromise and that the character differences between Harris and Trump are very much on her mind and the minds of others she’s spoken to. Harris aides have quickly announced changes to many of her previous more liberal positions. Those include her past support for defunding the police, banning fracking and a federal jobs guarantee that is part of the Green New Deal. She is a different kind of candidate in a different kind of race, her aides now argue, and they hope that voters will respond differently this fall than they did to her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, which creaked to an end just after Thanksgiving 2019. “Harris has been doing that work. Now she’s in overdrive doing that work,” Weatherford said. “There’s limited time for her to make that case, but she’s making it. The more we see of her, speaking to the issues where the broader base of the general electorate is, you’re going to have more people fall in line.” As for worries that Harris is too liberal, Schneider said, “I have a hard time these days in the application of the terms liberal and conservative — especially suggesting that addressing climate change is ‘liberal’ and other uses of conservative.” Schneider, who served 10 years in the House from 1981 to 1991, said likeminded Republicans “are working toward a decisive trifecta for the Democrats” this year, referring to helping the opposing party retain the presidency and the Senate and flip the House. Their reasoning, Schneider said, was “so that 1) we can actually move our country forward and 2) give us time to resurrect a Republican Party that reflects the values of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.” Campaign aides say Harris has been receiving support from Republicans who hadn’t previously been for Biden as well as from those who had. Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a CNN contributor who previously said he was voting for Biden, backed Harris in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed last week, declaring that “though my support for Harris didn’t come easily, it did come naturally” and calling her “the best vehicle toward preventing another stained Trump presidency.” Trump’s problems with past Republican leaders was  evident at the GOP convention in Milwaukee last month: No living previous GOP nominee for president or vice president attended, including former President George W. Bush. All of those past party leaders have expressed concerns, publicly or privately, about Trump — yet none had been supporting Biden, and to date, none have backed Harris. The closest any has come is a social media post from Trump’s former vice president turned intense critic, Mike Pence, who two weeks ago praised Biden for dropping out of the race. “After the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden’s decision to end his campaign, now is a time for leaders in both parties to project calm and send a message of strength and resolve to America’s friends and enemies alike,” Pence wrote. In the time since, though, Pence has added several posts critical of Harris’ positions on taxes and job growth. While Trump and his campaign have not done much to try to win over Democrats, Weatherford and other Harris aides will be leaning on former Trump administration officials, who will speak about how unfit for office they see him; on current and former Republican elected officials, who will speak about how the MAGA takeover means the party no longer represents traditional GOP values and principles; and on rank-and-file Republican women, who will put out testimonials on why they’re rejecting Trump. “We want Republicans talking to Republicans,” Weatherford said, “because we think that’s the best way to make it work.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of former Rep. Denver Riggleman’s last name."
How Sherrod Brown is navigating Harris in GOP-leaning Ohio with Senate at stake | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:24 AM EDT, Sun August 4, 2024",2024-08-04T05:00:02.814Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/politics/sherrod-brown-bernie-moreno-ohio-senate-race-kamala-harris/index.html,"For more on the high-stakes battle for control of the Senate, watch “Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju” on Sunday at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET. Sen. Sherrod Brown doesn’t plan to campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris. He plans to skip the Democratic National Convention. And the Democratic senator isn’t going to defend Harris’ record — or offer praise to President Joe Biden or to Harris over their handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, Brown — now embroiled in a high-stakes reelection battle central to the fight for the next Senate majority — is making this calculation: finding a way to disqualify his opponent, Bernie Moreno, in the eyes of GOP-leaning voters and independents. And it starts with attacking Moreno’s character, past business practices and position on abortion — all as he tries to avoid being tied to the top of his ticket. “It’s not left or right. It’s not who you vote for, for president,” Brown told CNN at a textile company just outside of Cleveland. “It’s who stands up for people in the state.” For Brown to win, he’ll have to defy a trend that has sunk nearly every Senate candidate who has tried to convince voters to split their tickets in the Donald Trump era. Just one candidate in the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 won when their state voted for a presidential candidate of the opposite party. With Trump the heavy favorite to win Ohio, a state he carried by eight points in 2020, Brown will need to court a sizable chunk of Trump voters — a complicated task in a polarized environment, especially given the withering criticism he’s leveled at the former president in the past and as Moreno simply tries to ride Trump’s coattails. Brown, 71, who has been in public life since 1975, is aiming to keep the race focused squarely on Moreno as he bets his own populist-tinged messaging and blue-collar brand in the Rust Belt state could appeal to enough swing voters — as long as he’s not lumped into the unpopular aspects of the Biden-Harris administration. “I’ve got my own schedule,” Brown said when asked if he would campaign with Harris. “She’s got her own schedule. I will focus on my race. My strategy is perhaps different from hers … talking about the differences on abortion rights and on the minimum wage between Bernie Moreno and me and how I fight every day for the dignity of work.” Ohio is a must-win for Democrats if they want to cling to their razor-thin Senate majority. They already are almost certain to lose in West Virginia, and in the other red state they’re defending  — Montana — Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is in a cliffhanger race against Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Plus, Democrats are defending six other heavily contested states, including through several purple states, all as they have only two pickup opportunities — Texas and Florida — which are considered long shots. Democrats say they are prepared to spend big to go after the characters of the GOP challengers. “We’ll definitely be coming out against those opponents,” said Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “They are seriously flawed.” But the GOP is banking the national environment will be enough to doom Democrats in Republican-heavy states. “He doesn’t want to have Kamala Harris showing up in Ohio,” Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who chairs the Senate GOP campaign committee, said of Brown. “I’m happy to pay for her plane ticket as well to come into Ohio.” In an interview with CNN at the state fair in Columbus, Moreno said Harris’ nomination will be a boon to his campaign. “Oh, it helps me tremendously,” Moreno said of Harris at the top of the ticket. “So maybe Scranton Joe had a little bit of credibility here in Ohio. San Francisco Kamala absolutely does not.” And while Moreno spoke at the Republican convention as he hopes to ride Trump’s coattails, Brown plans to skip his party’s convention in Chicago later this month. “I often skip conventions,” Brown said. Asked if he could defend Harris’ record, Brown said: “My job is to fight for Ohio workers. You can talk about the presidential race. That’s your job. … I know that what will matter is people vote for me because I stand up for workers and will continue to fight for workers.” To hang on to the seat, Brown and his Democratic allies have been pummeling the airwaves, spending $48.4 million in ads since March — compared with about $29.5 million on the GOP side. Moreno’s campaign itself has spent less than $1 million in ads in that timeframe, compared with a whopping $25 million by the Brown campaign. In the interview, Moreno acknowledged Brown seemed to have a narrow lead, but he argued the ads have barely changed the dynamics of the race. Republicans believe the onslaught of ads coming after Labor Day — in large part attacking Brown over immigration — will turn the race in Moreno’s direction. Both campaigns and outside groups have reserved roughly $91 million each between August and through Election Day. “He loves to waste money,” Moreno said of Brown. “We’re going to spend the right amount of resources at the right time, which is when people are really paying attention.” Yet Brown sees it differently. His campaign has launched a barrage of attack ads over Moreno’s legal issues stemming from his business. Moreno was ordered by a jury in 2023 to pay two employees more than $400,000 for overtime they say they earned, and he was reprimanded by a judge for shredding documents that could have been reviewed at trial — issues Brown is now seizing on. Moreno settled 14 other cases for undisclosed amounts before jumping into the race last year. “And that’s what this election is going to be about,” Brown said. “It’s going to be making the contrast with my fight for dignity of work, and my opponent’s background where he had to pay $400,000 in back wages to his employees.” In the interview, Moreno said he “did absolutely nothing wrong.” “I’m extraordinarily proud of the company I built. I started with nothing to buy that little dealership I put every cent that I had in my life, to buy one tiny little dealership risked it all and created a billion-dollar company in the retail automotive business,” Moreno said.  “I’m not going to attack (Brown) personally because I don’t believe in the politics of personal destruction. I’m going to attack his policies.” Asked if he had done anything wrong, given that he was ordered by a jury to pay a sizable sum to his former employees, Moreno said: “Well, that’s what that jury decided. I disagree with the verdict. We paid it. I disagree with it.” Brown has been faced with his own barrage of GOP attacks, particularly over immigration. He has tried to rebut those attacks in part by pointing to Republicans’ vote to kill a bipartisan border security bill he backed, plus legislation he’s pursued dealing with the spread of fentanyl. Yet Republicans are hoping voters’ deep disapproval of the Biden administration’s handling of the border – plus votes to provide legal status to undocumented immigrants – will sink down-ticket candidates like Brown. Asked if he thought Biden and Harris were doing a good job at the border, Brown said:  “I think presidents of both parties have failed at the border. That’s why we had our bipartisan bill that my opponent opposed that would have fixed a lot of the border problems.” Meanwhile, Democrats are preparing for the fall campaign with an onslaught of attacks on Moreno’s support for restricting abortion at 15 weeks. Moreno told CNN he’d vote for “common-sense restrictions” on abortions after 15 weeks, even though he said he doesn’t support a total ban. “What I say is that after 15 weeks is aspirationally something we can get to as a country at some point,” Moreno said, while attacking Brown’s opposition to restrictions. “Sherrod Brown makes this an issue of me not caring about women,” Moreno said. “Look at him.” Moreno, 57, who was born in Colombia and immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 5 before becoming a citizen at 18, emerged from a crowded March primary thanks in large part to Trump’s endorsement. And he has aligned himself closely with Trump and fellow Ohioan JD Vance, the party’s vice presidential nominee, who Moreno called a “huge plus” to have on the ticket. “People want to vote for the hometown guy,” Moreno said, predicting a boost in turnout. Moreno has been so aligned with Trump, he even cut an ad in 2022 — when he lost a Senate bid — saying Trump was “right” that the election was “stolen,” accusing big technology companies of rigging the election. Asked twice if he believed Biden was legitimately elected, Moreno wouldn’t say. “He’s legitimately the worst president of the United States? Absolutely,” he told CNN."
Trump and Vance rally in battleground Georgia looking to put recent struggles behind them | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:53 AM EDT, Sun August 4, 2024",2024-08-03T13:00:02.488Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/politics/trump-vance-georgia-election/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump defended his running mate and said his campaign needs to “work hard to define” Vice President Kamala Harris during a Saturday rally in Georgia, a battleground state that has taken on new importance in the wake of the shake-up on the Democratic ticket. After spending the entire campaign cycle attacking President Joe Biden and largely ignoring Harris, the Trump campaign is now trying to craft its messaging to blunt Harris’ momentum after her quick ascent to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. “Now they’re saying, ‘Oh, isn’t she wonderful, isn’t she wonderful?’ No, she’s not wonderful,” Trump told the crowd in Atlanta. “So we have to work hard to define her.” Earlier this week, Atlanta symbolized exactly how much the race had changed since Biden stepped aside and endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee. After she’d locked up the support of party delegates and announced that she’d raised more than $200 million in her first week as a candidate, Harris rallied 10,000 supporters in the city’s Georgia State University Convocation Center, telling them that her path to the White House ran through the Peach State. Trump and running mate JD Vance campaigned in the same venue Saturday but headed into the event without the fundraising spike, increased momentum or improved chances of winning a crucial state. In his remarks, Trump sought to blunt some of that momentum and defend his beleaguered vice presidential nominee, who he said is doing a “great job.” “They go after JD, you know why? He’s for the worker,” Trump said Saturday. “And frankly, they are people that have been taken advantage of, and he doesn’t like it, and he’s done great, everything we could have expected and much more so.” Four years ago, Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in nearly 30 years when he beat Trump by just under 12,000 votes. Trump was indicted last year by a Georgia grand jury on charges surrounding his efforts to overturn the results of that election, including a call asking Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to “find” the exact number of votes he needed to win. But, up until two weeks ago, Georgia – along with the other Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada – appeared to be drifting toward Trump, who was coming off a successful Republican convention with a new running mate. Polls were showing him ahead and suggested that his campaign’s effort to chip away at Biden’s support among Black voters, specifically young men, was bearing fruit. Now, however, the Harris campaign has argued that she is appealing to Black, Latino and younger voters in a way that could broaden the map beyond the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In the hours leading up to the rally, Trump said he would not participate in an ABC News debate on September 10 that he’d agreed to earlier this year when Biden was still the nominee. Instead, he had said he would debate Harris on September 4 on Fox News or not at all. The Harris campaign said Saturday she would attend the ABC News event, regardless of Trump’s plans. “We’re doing one with Fox, if she shows up,” Trump said Saturday in Atlanta. Trump also renewed his attacks on Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, whom he repeatedly referred to as “disloyal.” Kemp has been a top target for the former president over the past few years since his decision to certify Georgia’s 2020 election result. Trump recruited former Sen. David Perdue – who was in the audience in Atlanta on Saturday – to challenge Kemp in a 2022 primary, only for the governor to beat him decisively. On his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump slammed Kemp and his wife, Georgia first lady Martha Kemp, who earlier said she would write in her husband’s name instead of voting for the former president in November. “I don’t want her Endorsement, and I don’t want his,” Trump wrote, calling the governor “a bad guy.” Kemp responded on social media Saturday by posting a screenshot of Trump’s Truth Social post and telling the former president to “leave my family out of it.” Kemp revealed last month that he hadn’t voted for Trump in the state’s GOP primary earlier this year but said he would support the GOP ticket in November. As Democrats rallied around Harris over the past two weeks, the Trump campaign has struggled as it seeks to figure out how to talk about Harris and justify Vance’s place on the ticket as the Ohio senator faces more scrutiny. Republican leaders have warned party members to keep their criticisms of Harris focused on policy, not race or gender, after several Republican lawmakers called her a “DEI hire,” using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. The Trump campaign appeared to be pushing a similar focused message, spending more than $12 million this week on ads tying Harris to the current administration’s handling of border security, with a tagline calling her “dangerously liberal.” But when the former president appeared at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists on Wednesday, he shocked the Chicago audience and many of the Black voters he is seeking to appeal to when he falsely claimed that Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, “happened to turn Black” suddenly to court voters. Those remarks have been met with exasperation from many Republicans – who just two weeks ago had been touting a message of party unity following the Republican convention. “I think what the country would hope for - certainly what I’m hoping for in the campaign - is a discussion on the issues and the polices,” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN’s Manu Raju this week. “You’ve got two campaigns that are presenting very, very different views on these issues. So, let’s talk about the issues.” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said the campaign should focus on drawing policy contrasts. “I’ve known the vice president for a while – she’s always embraced her heritage proudly, as she should,” Graham told CNN. “My problem with Vice President Harris is the policy choices she’s made.” Trump, however, is not shying away from the controversial and false claims about Harris’ heritage. Instead, he has doubled and tripled down, posting online and amplifying further conspiracy theories regarding her identity. A senior Trump campaign official told CNN that the campaign would not “shy away” from the former president’s comments. Rather it plans to use them as a new line of attack framed around Harris being a “phony.” “You can expect similar messaging in Atlanta,” the adviser said. Meanwhile, Vance backed Trump up while campaigning in Arizona this week, using the “phony” line against Harris and claiming that she “caters to whatever audience is in front of her.” The Ohio senator’s defense of Trump comes after the campaign has spent weeks pushing back on criticisms of Vance’s past comments arguing that people with children should have more voting power and dismissing women without kids as “childless cat ladies.” Weeks ago, Vance’s selection was seen as a play to the MAGA base and a youthful counterbalance – Vance turned 40 on Friday – to Biden and his age-related struggles. But with Biden gone, and Vance’s history of making disparaging remarks about childless people coming to light, the campaign has already sought to reintroduce him two weeks after his primetime convention debut.

Harris meeting with VP vetting team for presentations on finalists | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:44 PM EDT, Sat August 3, 2024",2024-08-03T16:39:47.792Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/politics/harris-vp-vetting-team-finalists/index.html,"As Kamala Harris closes in on her selection of a running mate this weekend, a renewed focus is being placed on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, people familiar with the search told CNN, even as the vice president continues to weigh whether Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly would help deliver a victory in their battleground states. Harris is conducting face-to-face interviews with the final contenders, two sources said, with Walz poised to meet with her on Sunday. She will also interview Shapiro and Kelly on Sunday, according to a source familiar. In the final days of the accelerated vice presidential search, after teams of lawyers finished their exhaustive vetting work and preliminary interviews with contenders, Harris was most concerned with what one senior Democrat close to the process described as three Cs: “competence, chemistry and core values.” Harris was weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, and a small circle of confidants. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, along with Harris’ brother-in-law Tony West, were central advisers throughout the process. West served as a top lieutenant to Holder at the Department of Justice in the Obama administration. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were also said to still be under consideration, people familiar with the process said, with Harris intent on not making her final decision known this weekend or too far in advance of her Tuesday night rally with her running mate in Philadelphia. Harris was expected to meet with her vetting team Saturday for a series of in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to a source familiar with the process. Each briefing was expected to last about 60 to 90 minutes. According to multiple sources, the presentations Saturday were expected to reduce the number of candidates whom Harris would invite for final interviews Sunday. Harris’ top consideration is electability, sources familiar with her thinking told CNN. “She will be looking at what does a person bring to a ticket? Will it help in battleground states? And will it balance out the ticket?” one source said. “And she will ask questions. She will press and press — which is her (modus operandi).” This story and headline have been updated."
Trump says he’ll debate Harris on Fox News or not at all after weeks of back-and-forth over ABC News event | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:28 PM EDT, Sat August 3, 2024",2024-08-03T15:37:34.502Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump said Saturday he would not debate Vice President Kamala Harris at all if she did not agree to attend a new Fox News debate next month, the latest in the public jockeying between the campaigns over when, if ever, the two candidates will meet on stage. “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all,” the former president wrote Saturday on his Truth Social platform. Trump doubled down on that pronouncement at his rally Saturday evening in Georgia, telling attendees, “We’re doing one with Fox, if she shows up.” “I don’t think she’s going to show up,” he added, claiming the vice president “can read a teleprompter” but can’t speak off the cuff. Trump’s declaration comes after the former president on Friday night backed out of a planned September 10 debate hosted by ABC News. Trump committed to that event in May, after he and President Joe Biden agreed to move up the debate calendar and exchanged barbs about being willing to debate each other any time, any place. Harris referenced those boasts on social media Saturday. “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space,’” she wrote. “I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.” A source familiar with the matter told CNN that it was the source’s understanding that ABC News would provide airtime to whichever candidate showed up – even if that ended up being just Harris. ABC News did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Trump’s call for a debate on his terms, with a “full arena audience,” continues the back-and-forth between the two campaigns as they try to shape the narrative around a potential debate, trading taunts and digs along the way. Trump has attacked his opponent’s intelligence, writing on his social media platform that Harris, who is also a former US senator and California attorney general, doesn’t have the “mental capacity” to debate him. Harris’ campaign has argued that Trump is afraid to debate her. Last month, Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris after weeks of pressure from Democrats following his disastrous performance at a June 27 CNN debate. Trump has claimed without evidence that Democrats “staged a coup” to remove Biden from the ticket. The public exchanges also call into question whether there will be a debate at all. Trump cruised to the Republican nomination earlier this year despite his refusal to appear at any of his party’s primary debates, arguing that he didn’t need to attend because he was a known entity and was leading in the polls. He has made similar remarks in recent days when asked about a debate with Harris. The former president said Friday night that the ABC News debate could not happen because Biden was no longer the nominee and also because Trump is currently involved in litigation against the network. Trump filed a defamation suit against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos in March after the host of “The Week” said the former president had been found guilty of “rape” in an interview with Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. Trump has been found liable for sexual assault and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. In January, a court awarded her $83.3 million in damages. The ABC News lawsuit, however, was filed in March, months before the Trump and Biden campaigns agreed in mid-May on two debates. The push for a Fox News debate marks the latest goal post-shifting from the Trump campaign since Biden stepped aside nearly two weeks ago. On July 23, Trump told reporters on a press call that he hadn’t agreed to debate Harris, just Biden. “But I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different, because they have the same policies,” he said. “I think debating is important for a presidential race, I really do, you sort of have an obligation to debate.” Two days later, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign said it would not commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally announced a nominee, arguing that the party could still change its mind. At that point, Harris had secured pledges for a majority of delegates and no competitive Democrats had said they would run against her. The Democratic National Committee announced Friday that Harris had secured enough support to win the party nomination a day after delegates began voting virtually to formally nominate a candidate. On Monday, Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham he would “probably end up debating” Harris but said he could make the case for not showing up as well since they are both well known. And on Friday morning, hours before he backed out of the ABC News event, Trump told Fox Business he wasn’t sure he wanted to debate Harris. “I mean, right now I say, ‘Why should I do a debate?’ I’m leading in the polls, and everybody knows her. Everybody knows me,” he said. Last year, Trump used similar arguments to explain his decision to skip the GOP primary debates, writing on his social media site that the public “knows who I am.” Harris and her campaign have responded with taunts and calls for him to show up to the debate he committed to with Biden. “He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure have a lot to say about me,” Harris told a crowd in Atlanta earlier this week. “Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, ‘If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.’” This story and headline have been updated."
Deputy’s fatal shooting of Sonya Massey highlights risky practice of hiring America’s legion of ‘wandering officers’ | CNN,"Updated 5:13 PM EDT, Sat August 3, 2024",2024-08-03T17:57:34.876Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/us/sean-grayson-sonya-massey-wandering-officers/index.html,"The Illinois sheriff’s deputy who gunned down Sonya Massey in her home last month is now listed as suspended on a statewide registry of officers who have been fired, forced to resign or had their law enforcement licenses revoked due to misconduct. The suspension of former Sangamon County Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson’s law enforcement certificate came only after he was fired and charged with murder. On July 6, Grayson responded to a report of a prowler at Massey’s home. Bodycam footage from another deputy showed Massey saying she rebuked Grayson, and the former deputy threatening the 36-year-old woman. The encounter ended with Grayson shooting Massey in the head and failing to render aid. After being discharged from the Army for serious misconduct and a history of driving under the influence, Grayson was employed since 2020 by six Illinois law enforcement agencies – at three of them, as a part-time officer, employment records show. Grayson is part of what law enforcement officials and experts call America’s legion of “wandering officers” who drift from police department to police department – sometimes even after having been fired, forced to resign or convicted of a crime. “The shooting again underscores the critical need for police agencies to thoroughly vet potential hires,” the International Association of Chiefs of Police said in a statement Tuesday. “The pattern and nature of frequent job changes by a police officer should raise flags about their suitability for the policing profession.” The professional association of prominent police leaders called Massey’s death “a devastating and avoidable tragedy.” The absence of an exhaustive, national database for tracking and weeding out rogue cops – along with a lack of coordination among the more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the country – has allowed officers like Grayson to get hired without their checkered histories sounding an alarm, according to policing officials and experts. “There’s no question that … officers getting rehired after they’ve been let go under whatever circumstances is a huge problem and appears to be responsible for a grossly disproportionate number of tragic incidents,” said Christy Lopez, a former deputy chief in the special litigation section of the civil rights division at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. In addition, Lopez said, part-time law enforcement positions – like those Grayson held – tend not to attract the best candidates or get the most training. “It’s never a good sign when a police department is hiring officers on a part-time basis,” said Lopez, a Georgetown University law professor. A police misconduct registry funded by US Justice Department, and known as the National Decertification Index (NDI), already lists nearly 55,000 officers who had their law enforcement certificate or license revoked because of misconduct. But its coverage is spotty, according to policing officials and experts: Not every US police agency submits data to the registry or checks it before making hiring decisions. The names in the database are not public. And Grayson had never been decertified. “That certification index on its own is not enough,” Lopez said. “It wouldn’t have caught Sean Grayson. It’s not going to catch a lot of your problem officers.” Grayson, 30, was indicted by a grand jury on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. Grayson’s attorney Daniel Fultz declined comment on Saturday. Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell fired Grayson after the shooting, saying in a statement: “Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson.” “Grayson had other options available that he should have used. His actions were inexcusable and do not reflect the values or training of our office.” Campbell, in a separate statement, said no law enforcement agencies reported problems with Grayson before he was hired in Sangamon County, though previous employers had commented he “needed more training.” Grayson received 16 weeks of academy training after being hired, according to Campbell. “This is not unusual for deputies with Grayson’s experience, and is standard procedure for Sangamon County deputies,” Campbell’s statement said. Grayson’s personnel file included “references from people I know well,” said the sheriff, adding those “insights are invaluable in making informed hiring decisions.” Grayson was discharged from the US Army in 2016 due to “misconduct (serious offense),” according to a Department of Defense document included in Grayson’s personnel file during his time at the Kincaid Police Department in Illinois. The personnel file was obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB. “A red flag would be his military” discharge, said Brian Grisham, deputy director of the nonprofit International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training and chair of the National Decertification Index. “That’s a potential disqualifier in most states.” The DOD document said Grayson was separated from the Army under a general discharge after he served as a private first class at Fort Riley in Kansas. The alleged misconduct was not disclosed. Army spokesperson Bryce Dubee, in response to a CNN request for more detail, wrote: “Sean P. Grayson was a 91B (Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic) in the Regular Army from May 2014 to February 2016. He had no deployments and left the Army in the rank of private first class.” Grayson was charged with two DUI misdemeanor offenses in Illinois’ Macoupin County – one in 2015 and the other in 2016, court records show. The website of the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board, which sets professional standards for law enforcement and correctional officers, does not list driving under the influence as a “decertifiable misdemeanor.” The first incident occurred in August 2015. Grayson’s vehicle was impounded after he was charged with driving under the influence. He pleaded guilty and paid more than $1,320 in fines, according to court records. In July 2016, Grayson was charged with another DUI. Again, he pleaded guilty and paid more than $2,400 in fines, court records show. Grayson acknowledged the DUI charges when he applied to be an officer at Auburn Police Department in Illinois in 2021. He worked there from July 2021 to May 2022. CNN’s review of Grayson’s records there did not reveal any major problems or disciplinary issues. In May 2022, Grayson started working at the Logan County Sheriff’s Office in Illinois, records show. He wrote the sheriff a brief letter detailing his “terrible decision to drink and drive.” Grayson’s letter also said he lost his driving privileges for one year after pleading guilty to his second DUI, in 2016. A background check was performed prior to Grayson’s hiring in Sangamon County, Campbell said. Prior DUI convictions “are not disqualifying criteria for a deputy,” Campbell said. Grayson worked at six Illinois law enforcement agencies over a four-year period. He started working part time with Pawnee police in August 2020, followed by the Kincaid and Virden police departments. Then he started working full time with Auburn police, the Logan County Sheriff’s Office, and finally the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office in May 2023. His employment records from the Auburn Police Department indicated why Grayson said he left previous positions: In some cases, he wanted to work full time but could only get part-time hours. In another, he said he didn’t want to move. Grayson was on the Kincaid police force for only three months before he was let go “because he refused to live within a 10-mile radius,” KSHB reported. “The decertification index originally was created to keep problem officers from moving from state to state but the reality is they move from agency to agency,” Grisham said. “I do think there have been rogue officers that have gone all over the place and inadequate background checks let them continue on with potential bad acts in other jurisdictions.” Grayson did not appear to have disciplinary issues as an Auburn officer but records from the Logan County Sheriff’s Office recommended he take “high stress decision making classes.” The records said Grayson failed to slow down after his boss called off a vehicle pursuit. Grayson was driving about 110 mph before striking a deer, according to the records. A Logan County chief deputy wrote that Grayson “failed to show due caution while driving through stop intersections.” Grayson’s supervisor “terminated the pursuit” and the deputy turned off his emergency lights, the report stated. But Grayson “continued at a high rate of speed (110/55 mph zone) prior to striking the deer.” Audio recordings that appear to coincide with Logan County’s internal review of the incident captured the chief deputy admonishing Grayson for describing it inaccurately in his report despite previous orders to check for accuracy. “If we can’t trust what you say and what you see, we can’t have you in our uniform,” the chief deputy told Grayson. “I’m getting goosebumps. This is extremely concerning,” the chief deputy said later. “Everybody likes you. I gotta be able to trust you. Was this a purposefully done lie?” “No,” Grayson responded. “Deputy Grayson acknowledged he lacks experience,” the report said. A series of recommendations included “additional traffic stop training, report writing training, high stress decision making classes, and needs to read, understand and discuss issued Logan County Sheriff’s Office Policy.” It was not immediately clear if Grayson followed through with the recommendations. In April 2023, he resigned from the Logan County Sheriff’s Office. The next month, he joined the sheriff’s office in Sangamon County, where his encounter with Massey more than a year later resulted in murder charges. A psychological examination before his was hired by Sangamon County said Grayson was “a suitable fit for the position” but also noted a low score on a cognitive assessment. “He knows he can move too fast at times. He needs to slow down to make good decisions,” read the report of the March 2023 examination. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office said the agency did not receive a complete disciplinary report from Logan County about Grayson, including his reprimand for an inaccurate report of the traffic incident. Campbell did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but he told CNN affiliate WICS that “we need to take a look at” more thorough background checks of job candidates. “We did not receive all the information from some of his previous employers that came out afterward,” the sheriff said. The Logan County Sheriff’s Office has not responded to a request for comment. The union representing Illinois law enforcement officers said it will not challenge Grayson’s termination. After an evaluation of the deputy’s grievance, “the union has determined that it will not be proceeding any further,” the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council said in a statement, which expressed sympathy “for the family and loved ones of Sonya Massey.” “If you look at it, an individual can push the envelope over and over and never get to the point of being disciplined on their license, but they’ve left a cloud everywhere they’ve been,” Grisham said. Massey’s death has led to renewed calls for passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the failed legislation targeting racial bias and use of force – including the creation of a more robust nationwide police misconduct registry. George Floyd, the act’s namesake, was another Black person killed by police. The 46-year-old died in police custody on May 25, 2020, after Derek Chauvin, a White police officer, was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck and back for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for help and said he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in a state trial in 2021 and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. He later pleaded guilty in federal court of depriving Floyd of his civil rights. Chauvin had 18 prior complaints filed against him with the Minneapolis Police Department’s Internal Affairs before his fatal encounter with Floyd, according to the police department. Another officer on the scene also had a history of complaints. Floyd’s killing sparked a wave of protests around the world, along with a spate of legislative measures intended to address police brutality and racial bias. But the Floyd bill has languished for years amid partisan differences that are especially heightened today. At the same time, many police agencies have struggled in recent years to hire and retain quality officers given the low pay, dangerous work and a perceived lack of respect from the public. “There are agencies cutting corners and they always have,” Grisham said. “But with the recruitment and retention issues we have today, where agencies nationwide, on average, used to receive hundreds of applications for vacancies and they get dozens now … they’re having to dig deeper into the hiring availability. So there could be a slight uptick in misconduct.” Lopez, who led the team that investigated the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri after the 2014 killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, said having “potentially thousands and thousands of bad apple officers” on the streets “can wreak havoc” in communities. “We saw in this case, for example, there were two officers on the scene. Only one of them shot Sonya Massey,” she said. “You will see that in many of these incidents. Everything’s fine. Most officers are handling it fine, but it just takes one officer to send it spiraling off into the wrong direction.” Lopez recalled that, while investigating police in Ferguson, local officials spoke about “the muni-shuffle” where officers often sauntered “back and forth” between jobs in the 91 municipalities and 50 or so police departments in St. Louis County. “An officer at Ferguson complained to me about accidentally hiring a really terrible officer from another agency because he wasn’t aware about the officer’s misconduct history,” she said. “Agencies sometimes – especially when they’re under pressure to hire, hire, hire – will hire officers from other agencies and they don’t have to go through all the same training that a brand new officer would have to go through. So it’s sometimes seen as a cost efficient way to hire new officers when, in fact, it is a really dangerous way to hire new officers.” Smaller cash-strapped agencies often end up hiring an experienced officer who may have a checkered past instead of paying to train and hire a new officer, according to Lopez and other experts. In 2015, a report by President Barack Obama’s task force on 21st century policing called on the Justice Department to partner with the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training to expand its decertification database to help remove the worst cops from the streets. National and standardized reporting, the report said, would ensure that “officers who have lost their certification for misconduct are not easily hired in other jurisdictions.” “There’s no requirement that anybody, any local jurisdiction that has a Sean Grayson situation … send information to that central clearing house,” Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and co-chair of Obama’s task force, told CNN. “It’s something that has been going on as long as I’ve been around policing, which is 25 years.” Decertification and other employment records are kept by the Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) boards in each state, but not all boards report the information to the national registry. Only California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Tennessee, New York, New Jersey and Texas require that records be reported to the national index, Grisham said. “We are not a government agency. We can’t mandate usage of it,” he said, noting the registry is still “averaging over 200 new actions added monthly” and more than 1,000 new user requests per month. “We’ve got documented cases where officers are pretending like they’ve never been in law enforcement before and applying for jobs and this system has caught them,” Grisham said. In 2020, a Yale Law Journal study titled “The Wandering Officer” said the scope of the problem in American policing is unclear. That remains true today, according to policing experts. “Not all those who wander are lost, but in policing, many are,” the researchers concluded. “These officers, we have shown, are subsequently fired and subjected to ‘moral character’ complaints at elevated rates relative to both officers hired as rookies and veterans with clean professional histories. And we likely underestimate the prevalence of the phenomenon nationwide.” The researchers found wandering officers “tend to migrate to agencies with fewer resources in communities with slightly higher proportions of residents of color.” “Police administrators are now on notice. Even when well intentioned — as a second chance for a hard-working cop — hiring a wandering officer is risky business,” the study said. “Beyond their own misbehavior, wandering officers may undermine efforts to improve police culture, as they carry their baggage to new locales.” CNN’s Holly Yan, Bill Kirkos, Amanda Musa, Andy Rose, Chris Boyette, Brad Parks and Dakin Andone contributed to this report."
Jimmy Carter says he hopes to vote for Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 1:23 PM EDT, Sat August 3, 2024",2024-08-03T17:18:06.100Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/politics/jimmy-carter-says-he-hopes-to-vote-for-kamala-harris/index.html,"Former President Jimmy Carter, the oldest living president, is hoping to vote for Kamala Harris during the November elections, his grandson said. “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” the 99-year-old former president said, according to his grandson, Jason Carter, who relayed a conversation Carter had with his son Chip earlier this week to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. CNN has reached out to the Carter Center for a statement. Carter, who is set to turn 100 on October 1, entered hospice care in February 2023 after a series of hospital stays. Jason Carter said in May the 39th president is “coming to an end” when providing an update on his health. Carter, a Democrat and one-term president, is a survivor of metastatic brain cancer and liver cancer and underwent a brain surgery after a fall in 2019. The former president is widely revered for his championing of human rights and brokering the Camp David Accords in 1978 between Egypt and Israel. Carter, a peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before entering politics, served one term as governor of Georgia before becoming president. By the former president’s side was his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter, who passed away in November, just days after entering hospice care. The former first lady, a humanitarian and mental health advocate who was an influential figure in the White House, founded the Carter Center with her husband in his post-presidency in hopes of advancing world peace and health."
Inside the final days of Kamala Harris’s vice presidential decision | CNN Politics,"Updated 1:02 PM EDT, Sat August 3, 2024",2024-08-03T10:00:02.636Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/03/politics/kamala-harris-vice-president-decision/index.html,"Leaps of faith aren’t Kamala Harris’ style. But she’s about to have to take one. The vice president likes to take her time with decisions. However much data she has, she tends to ask for more. Go over it all again and again. Then check again if there’s more data. Heading into a weekend of interviews at the Naval Observatory with running mate prospects for a choice that will shape her campaign and the Democratic Party – and potentially her presidency and the country – she doesn’t have that luxury. Multiple people who have worked with Harris tell CNN they doubt that she’s fully comfortable with the rush as she does her final interviews. But they agree that it’s just another aspect of this accelerated and abbreviated campaign that may end up benefiting the vice president by limiting opportunities for the kind of pitfalls that have plagued her in the past. “It’s like a European-style election!” Harris joked to donors in Houston about the sprint to Election Day, according to one person who heard her at the event Wednesday night. Running mates often become political afterthoughts once they’re picked. But the Harris campaign knows that with so many Americans still getting to know her, her choice will offer a key and early window into who she is, how she thinks, what sort of politics she is going to practice and her sense of what the electoral weaknesses she needs to account for are. Outside advisers have already chimed in with suggestions for how to introduce the pick to keep the excitement and good vibes going, particularly if Harris ends up in a potentially awkward position of not going with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, even though the planned first stop Tuesday of the new ticket’s battleground blitz is in Philadelphia, miles from where the governor grew up and started out as a local politician. One idea is to repeat what Joe Biden’s campaign did in 2020 – putting out a video of his call to tell Harris she was his choice. Another is for Harris and her chosen candidate to make a surprise appearance after the news breaks. Staff for the running mate – including one of the former Biden aides who helped guide Harris through her own transition onto the ticket four years ago – have already been picked. Veterans of the process jokingly call it the “prize patrol,” like the Publishers Clearing House TV ads, when a crew suddenly shows up at the door informing people they’ve won millions. But as for whose door they’ll be showing up at, several people familiar with the current process say Harris and her small circle of advisers are trying to parse who could best help her win and to fit each of the candidates into the larger future-oriented fresh-start frame that she’s laid out herself over the past two weeks. “This is a decision that is not just a campaign decision,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an unrelated interview with CNN last week. “This is a decision that the whole country ends up being bound by.” Speaking to reporters earlier this week in Pennsylvania, Shapiro – like Buttigieg and others being considered by Harris – ducked directly commenting on his own role in the process. “The vice president has a very deeply personal decision to make right now. Who she wants to run with. Who she wants to govern with. And who can be by her side when she has to make the toughest decisions for the American people. I trust she will make that decision on her own terms when she is ready,” he said. Then asked on Friday if he would be in Philadelphia on Tuesday when Harris appears with her choice, Shapiro said, “I hope to be.” As she reaches a decision, Harris is thinking about her own process that led Biden to her four years ago. She is thinking about what, in her mind, went right and what went wrong with their dynamics over the past three-and-a-half years. She thinks often about resilience: the glare that was on her as vice president and what she endured – especially over the nightmarish July for Democrats when Biden resisted and then ultimately withdrew from the race – and now she will have to consider if others can withstand similar scrutiny. Harris will also be thinking about relationships, especially because she doesn’t have much of a connection with any of the men who have made it to the final six. Being part of the same promising young politician fellowship in 2006 with Shapiro or bantering with Buttigieg when he played Mike Pence at her debate prep four years ago is as deep as the relationships go. The others in contention don’t go much past the level of handshakes with Harris, though she did have Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and several other governors over to her residence for what became a gripe session about the Biden campaign in February. She has served in the Biden administration with Buttigieg, but their relationship wasn’t always smooth. She was still attorney general in California during Beshear’s first year as Kentucky attorney general, though she was mostly occupied with running for Senate then. She overlapped for just two weeks in the Senate with Arizona’s Mark Kelly, though that included January 6. The way Biden made a point of welcoming her into his family immediately after she was picked made an impact on Harris. With relatively short interviews to go off this time, the input of her husband, Doug Emhoff, often overlooked as a key supportive voice, will help guide who she thinks can fit in the same way. “I watched her relationship with Biden,” said Cedric Richmond, the former Louisiana congressman who has become an informal adviser to Harris and has stayed in close touch over the past two weeks. “You have to have somebody who, No. 1, shares values, but No. 2, that you have a rapport with – because they’re going to be out running their own thing and doing their own thing, and you have to trust that they know you.” Richmond said that from what he saw Harris take away from her time with Biden, this is about more than getting along at potential weekly lunches in the West Wing. “They know your voice, they know your priorities, they know your values, they know your positions, and they’re going to execute,” he said. “So it’s very, very important to have somebody who you have a great relationship with.” Over the coming days, Harris, with her prosecutor-trained mentality, will be running pros and cons, testing out theories and looking for what aides can tell her about qualities in running mates that have actually changed votes in the past. She has talked to Biden. She has talked to Barack Obama. Polling and focus groups have been conducted. Sample videos to play have been requested. Hours and hours of interviews with aides, on top of thousands of pages of hastily assembled documents, and in some cases with detailed follow-up questions, have been coalesced by a group of lawyers led by former Attorney General Eric Holder and former White House counsel Dana Remus into briefing books. Harris is expected to meet with her vetting team on Saturday for a series of in-depth presentations on each of the finalists to be her running mate, according to a source familiar with the process. Harris and her aides know, though, that there are limits to what polling can reliably say over just two weeks, particularly given the historic upheaval the race has just gone through. They know there are questions, particularly about finances and deep dives into their backgrounds, that even the prospective choices themselves might not remember to bring up amid this rush. A chunk of the message testing on prospective choices has come from their TV appearances in the past two weeks of hurried public auditions. Several involved with the process, though, say that they have walked away with one clear sense from the Harris team: no surprises. Nothing that could derail the honeymoon Harris is trying to keep going. Nothing that could give them their own version of JD Vance’s clunky start that they have been watching carefully or the clear tensions that have set in between some in Donald Trump’s and his running mate’s orbits. Advice has been streaming in. Everyone who can get in the ears of anyone near Harris – whether that is her government chief of staff Lorraine Voles or her brother-in-law Tony West or campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, who helped Biden pick Harris in 2020 – has been weighing in with advice. Some have been explicit in pitching a specific choice. Some have pantomimed subtlety, like just laying out the importance of winning Pennsylvania or Arizona. Some have tried to be reassuring, urging aides and advisers to remember that the pick probably won’t matter much politically, especially in this sprint of a race against Trump. At almost exactly this point in the summer of 2020, when Biden confided to Obama that he was worried that given the lingering bad feelings about how Harris had attacked him during their first primary debate, the two might not be able to have the same good relationship that Biden remembered having with Obama. Obama reminded his former vice president that they had not gotten along well at first. And, he stressed to Biden, none of that was nearly as relevant as who would help him win – because with Trump as the opponent, Democrats had to win. Harris is less emotionally driven than Biden. And she knows, as a woman of color leading the Democratic ticket, how much is riding on her not to be seen as failing in this moment. “She will recognize that she’s in a tough race, and she needs to pick the best running mate that will help her win,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and current candidate for Senate who has known Harris for years. “I think it’s going to be less about who does she have the best chemistry with and more about who has the best chance of helping the ticket.” This story has been updated with additional information."

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump said he has agreed to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News on September 4 and will no longer participate in the debate he previously agreed to hosted by ABC, when President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee. Trump said the new debate would be hosted in Pennsylvania with a live audience and that the moderators would be Fox News hosts Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. It is unclear whether Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted the invitation from Fox News.  “I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th. The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant,” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Trump said: “The FoxNews Debate will be held in the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at a site in an area to be determined. The Moderators of the Debate will be Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and the Rules will be similar to the Rules of my Debate with Sleepy Joe, who has been treated horribly by his Party – BUT WITH A FULL ARENA AUDIENCE!….” It’s unclear whether Harris would agree to those new terms. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Mike Donilon, a longtime aide to President Joe Biden, is returning to the White House from the former Biden campaign, at the president’s request, to help him shape the final six months of his presidency, a source familiar with the matter said. Donilon moved over to the campaign earlier this year and became its chief strategist, focusing on the campaign’s messaging and paid media strategies. Some context: Last month, questions remained about Donilon’s role on the Harris campaign. His expertise was in channeling Biden’s voice and spirit, CNN previously reported, and few saw a significant role for him after the president stepped aside from the Democratic ticket. This post has been updated with additional details. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to testify in New York state court next week defending his campaign’s petition to gain ballot access in the state. Kennedy’s name appears on a witness list submitted by lawyers defending a legal challenge against his ballot access petition ahead of a trial beginning next week. Paul Rossi, the Kennedy campaign’s senior ballot access counsel, also appears on the witness list. A person familiar with the Kennedy campaign’s legal strategy confirmed to CNN that Kennedy and Rossi are planning to testify in person in New York Supreme Court in Albany next week. A Kennedy campaign spokesperson declined to comment on Kennedy’s expected court appearance. A spokesperson for Clear Choice declined to comment on his appearance. Background: Next week’s trial centers on a legal challenge filed by Clear Choice PAC, a Democrat-aligned outside group working to combat third parties, which claims that Kennedy is violating state election law by not living at the Katonah, New York, address listed on his petition. Kennedy has lived in Los Angeles, California, for several years and has publicly referred to Los Angeles as his home on several occasions. On Monday, the New York State Board of Elections told CNN that Kennedy’s ballot access petition contains more than the required number of valid signatures for ballot access in New York. CNN’s Ethan Cohen contributed reporting. As of Friday evening, the Harris campaign does not have a set time or day for when it will announce Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate pick, a source told CNN – even as Harris heads into a pivotal weekend of final interviews and a decision that must come by Tuesday. Harris and her future running mate plan to appear together for the first time at a joint campaign event in Philadelphia Tuesday evening. President Joe Biden acknowledged to reporters Friday morning that he and Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken about her upcoming decision on a vice presidential running mate.  But he wouldn’t say much else: “I’ll let her work that out,” Biden said, when pressed on what top qualities the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee should consider.  Still, inside the White House, the president’s close advisers have a good sense of how Biden feels about several of the men currently believed to be Harris’ top contenders.  One well-known Biden favorite? Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Biden is a “big fan of Shapiro’s,” a senior adviser to the president told CNN. And given that the president himself frequently traveled to Pennsylvania as a candidate and has made no bones about the fact that he sees the state as one of the most important battleground states heading into November — just as it was in 2020 — for some of the president’s advisers, it’s hard to imagine him personally rooting for anyone but Shapiro.  That is, perhaps, anyone other than Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The most obvious reason? “He’s just a blast,” this adviser said.  In January, Walz was among a group of Democratic elected officials that joined Biden at an infrastructure event in Superior, Wisconsin. The president’s formal remarks were at Earth Rider Brewery – afterward, the group made their way over to the Cedar Lounge taproom to greet voters, where beers were freely flowing. Walz, the adviser recalled, was having a great time – and it all felt infectious. Read the full report here. This post has been updated with additional details. Vice President Kamala Harris earned enough votes to win the Democratic nomination on Friday, and will become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. The announcement came during a virtual event with supporters Friday after delegates began casting virtual ballots for the nomination Thursday. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance on Friday leaned into their personal attacks on Harris. Here’s what you else you need to know about Friday’s developments in the campaign: ##Catch Up## Some Donald Trump supporters in key battleground states said in interviews with CNN that they aren’t completely sold on JD Vance as former President Donald Trump’s running mate, saying he wouldn’t have been their first choice and that they don’t know much about him.  Gena Bivens, who lives in southeastern Pennsylvania and attended Trump’s Harrisburg rally this week, said she wasn’t sure what she thought of Vance.  “I don’t know a lot about him. I hear good, I hear some interesting things. I still have to do some research, but I support Trump if that’s his decision,” Bivens said.  Bivens said, “I hear a lot of maybe he could be a little hardcore with some of his policies and I’m a little concerned about that but it’s not going to make me not vote for Trump.”  Kelly McNew said Vivek Ramaswamy would’ve been her first choice for Trump’s running mate.  “Just because he was also a businessman and I think Trump being a businessman — I think he did a good job running, you know, with the finances and everything so I thought maybe two businessmen in the White House would be a good pick. But Trump will, you know, I trust his choice,” McNew, who was also at Trump’s Harrisburg rally, said.  Dylan All, who attended Trump’s rally in Grand Rapids, said, “Honestly I don’t know too much about him, so I don’t want to speak on that, but I’m going to look into him after this interview and learn more about him.”  Chasten Carroll, who is from Charlotte, said, “I don’t know a whole lot about him, but I’ve heard he’s a great debater and really cares about our country, so I think he’ll be great with him.”  Others had much more effusive praise for Vance and said he was their first choice for Trump’s running mate.  Jackie Ogden, who was attending Trump’s rally in Harrisburg, said, “I think he’s phenomenal. I’ve watched his movie, I’ve followed him for many years, so I know it’s not an act. I’m very pleased with the courage that he holds and with the confidence that he has and that’s what America needs.” The DC Circuit Court of Appeals received the formal notice of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Donald Trump’s 2020 election interference case. This means the case is on the move, and the Circuit is now expected to return the case back to the court of Judge Tanya Chutkan, where pre-trial proceedings will resume. Chutkan of the DC District Court will have to interpret the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity and what it means for the case against Trump going forward. Chutkan has long signaled she wanted the case presented to a jury before voters go to the polls in November, initially pushing for a March trial date. But the Supreme Court interceded earlier this year and put the case on pause to consider Trump’s claims of presidential immunity. By granting Trump sweeping immunity for official acts as president, the Supreme Court’s ruling may gut special counsel Jack Smith’s case. That leaves Chutkan with a number of crucial decisions to make, including whether Trump’s efforts to undo the 2020 election results count as official acts. Attorneys working on the case believe that Chutkan will move quickly with the case back in her jurisdiction, according to sources familiar with their thinking. She could soon set the schedule for any upcoming hearings. President Joe Biden congratulated Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on social media Friday saying that he “couldn’t be prouder” of her after she earned enough votes to win the Democratic Party nomination.  Harris has received enough votes from Democratic delegates to win the party’s nomination for president, the Democratic National Committee announced Friday. Harris said she will formally accept the nomination next week after the virtual roll call is complete. She will become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. JD Vance revealed Friday that during the GOP vice presidential vetting process, he was asked “the most invasive questions imaginable.” Vance told the Full Send Podcast that a lawyer came to his house during the vetting process and asked him several questions while sitting with his wife, including if he has a secret family.  “At one point the lawyer’s like, I’m going to ask some uncomfortable questions, and I’m like ‘OK, have at it.’ And he goes, ‘Do you have any secret family?’” Vance said. “And I’m like, ‘Are you serious? Do I have any secret family?’” “He said sometimes people have like another spouse, and they’ll have other kids in a place like Alaska. And I’m like dude, ‘I’ve never even been to Alaska,’” Vance said. “It’s all these just weird questions they ask because they want to make sure they’re prepared for the news media firestorm,” he added. Vance also said that now that he’s the Republican vice presidential nominee, the “biggest difference” is the constant Secret Service detail.  “We’re done being anonymous basically at this stage in our lives,” Vance said. “But it’s cool, we get to fly around in our nice plane and get to meet a lot of people.”  Vice President Kamala Harris is adding considerable political muscle to her campaign, bringing aboard several top party operatives and veterans of recent Democratic presidential campaigns.  Harris is retaining the entire leadership team in Wilmington, which will continue to be led by Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair. Julie Chávez Rodríguez will continue her role as campaign manager, but will focus on Arizona and Nevada and Latino voters. The consultants, many of whom are veterans of the Obama-Biden 2008 and 2012 campaigns, will be tasked with a variety of assignments, including: David Plouffe, a senior adviser for the path to 270; Stephanie Cutter, senior adviser for message and strategy; Mitch Stewart, senior adviser for battleground states. Jennifer Palmieri will serve as a senior adviser to Doug Emhoff. ##Harris## Far from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns. Here’s what to expect in the sprint to Election Day: August: Nominating Harris, picking a vice president and a convention in Chicago September: Debates? A Trump sentencing? October: Voting is underway November: Election Day Read more about what to expect beyond Election Day. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a running mate contender for Vice President Kamala Harris, reaffirmed his desire for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and for peace in the Middle East at an event on Friday. Shapiro expressed his hope for a day when “peace will reign in the Middle East,” and urged the US government to forever be a partner in peace and continue to try and find a path forward in the region. Former President Donald Trump claimed earlier Friday that Harris could lose support among Palestinian voters if she chooses Shapiro, who is Jewish, as her running mate. CNN also reported Friday that some Jewish Democrats are wondering if America would be ready for a Jewish vice president, especially alongside the first Black and South Asian woman president, who happens to be married to a Jewish man. One former Democratic statewide leader outside of Pennsylvania who is a Shapiro fan expressed concerns about whether having a Jewish first gentleman and vice president would “make it more dangerous for those of us in the Jewish community.” Meanwhile, Democratic Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, who was the president of a synagogue in the Las Vegas suburbs before getting into politics, said, “It’s really great to have representation and to have someone who understands what it means to work to fight antisemitism and all forms of hate.” Vice President Kamala Harris has received enough votes from Democratic delegates to win the party’s nomination for president, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced Friday. Harris, who said she will formally accept the nomination next week after the virtual roll call is complete on Monday, will become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. The announcement came during a virtual event with supporters. Delegates began casting virtual ballots for the nomination Thursday. GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance ripped Vice President Kamala Harris for failures at the US-Mexico border and criticized her staff turnover rate, claiming people don’t want to work for her. As CNN previously reported, during an influx of unaccompanied migrant children in 2021, Biden tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America. In the last three years, her assignment has been bundled with the administration’s larger migration issues. And on the campaign trail recently, she has gone on the offensive on the issue as she fields attacks. Vance also ripped Harris for her staff turnover rate, claiming if she were to win the 2024 election, no one would want to work for her anyway. He also argued that Harris doesn’t care about public policy. David Plouffe, the former campaign manager for Barack Obama, is joining Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign as a senior adviser, a Democrat close to the campaign said. Plouffe will not replace the existing campaign hierarchy in Wilmington, but rather will be added to the ranks of strategists and leaders guiding the Harris campaign. Politico was first to report Plouffe’s new gig. CNN previously reported that Plouffe was under consideration for a campaign role. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon and Julie Chávez Rodríguez, who were leading the Biden campaign, are remaining in their top leadership roles that Harris cemented on her first day on top of the ticket last week, the source said. Harris has also brought on two other Obama campaign alums as senior advisors for the campaign: Stephanie Cutter, who will advise on messaging, and Mitch Stewart, who will advise on battleground state operations, according to two Democratic officials familiar with the matter. The Harris campaign will also soon be announcing its top advertising strategist and media consultant. Ann Liston and the firm AL Media, a veteran of the Obama reelection fight in 2012 and a longtime EMILY’s List adviser, are among the leading contenders for the position, a Democratic adviser said. This post has been updated with additional reporting on Harris’ staffing. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a potential vice presidential pick for Kamala Harris, referred questions Friday about being her running mate to the Harris campaign. Shapiro also confirmed that the last time he spoke to Vice President Harris was on Sunday. When asked what Harris is looking for in a running mate, Shapiro said that it’s a “deeply personal decision” that she understands well because she went through it four years ago. When asked about Donald Trump’s recent attacks on Harris’ identity, Shapiro said the former president’s comments are “shameful” and reflect his character. Shapiro also described Trump’s running mate JD Vance as “a total phony baloney” and “the most inorganic candidate I think I have ever seen on the national stage.” “He doesn’t know what he believes and that is why it is impossible for him to articulate a coherent message to the American people ‘cause he doesn’t believe it,” Shapiro said. This post has been updated with additional comments from Shapiro. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is in the running for one of the highest offices, against a field with much longer resumes jostling to join Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket. That he’s made it to this point speaks to the strength of his appeal among Democrats, bolstered by years of well-received media appearances and viral moments in congressional hearings. But it also demonstrates the durability of the movement he built as a 2020 presidential candidate — particularly online — that propelled him to a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses and a close second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary. Buttigieg has continued to build his brand as a Democrat willing to talk to anyone, anywhere — including Fox News — even as transportation secretary. His digital army has kept track, amplifying department initiatives and congressional hearings. Over the past few days, as speculation over who Harris will pick for her running mate has surged, Buttigieg’s supporters have amplified clips from the wave of media appearances he’s done to promote Harris’ campaign and to mobilize on her behalf. Harris is expected to make her decision by Tuesday, when she and her running mate will hold a rally in Philadelphia. Among the candidates she is considering, Buttigieg is not considered a top contender on the level of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, CNN reported this week. Read more here. Former President Donald Trump on Friday said if Vice President Kamala Harris picks Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate, “she’s going to lose the Palestinian vote.” Trump said he thought there was more enthusiasm for Harris than for President Joe Biden.  Trump said he wants to debate Harris but also said, “Right now, I say, ‘Why should I do a debate?’”  “We’re leading in the polls it seems by quite a bit, still,” Trump said. “She’s better than he is. But I think ultimately, she’ll be worse than him. She’s more radical than him.” President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House on Friday that he has spoken to Vice President Kamala Harris about who she should pick for her running mate, but played coy about that conversation. Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign said it raked in a whopping $310 million in its July fundraising efforts — more than double the amount raised by former President Donald Trump last month. Harris’ fundraising numbers mark the latest sign of how transformative and energizing the change to the top of the Democratic ticket has been among grassroots and high-dollar supporters. A majority of that $310 million haul, more than $200 million, was raised in the first week of Harris’ candidacy, the campaign said in a statement, with two-thirds of the fundraising coming from first-time donors to the campaign. The campaign also said it has $377 million cash on hand, while the Trump campaign has $327 million cash on hand. The July haul was the second month in a row that Democrats have outraised Trump’s team, and the surge in donations lifted Democratic fundraising above the $1 billion mark – the fastest a campaign has crossed that threshold in presidential history, according to Harris’ team.

The value of Donald Trump’s stake in the corporate owner of Truth Social has dropped by $800 million since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the race for the White House on July 21. Trump Media & Technology Group’s share price has tumbled by about 20% since then. The value of Trump’s dominant stake in the conservative social media company stood at just over $4 billion as of July 19, the final trading day before President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed Harris. It has since dropped to about $3.2 billion. The selloff comes as national and battleground polls indicate a tight matchup between Trump and Harris. The stock has become a vehicle for Wall Street traders to bet on the prospects of Trump returning to the White House, as Truth Social could become the platform for presidential communications if Trump wins. Read more here. JD Vance’s Republican colleagues in the Senate say they’re largely sticking with the Ohio freshman — despite criticism over newly resurfaced comments — warning that Vance represents where Republican lawmakers see their voters moving. Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate set up the 40-year-old Ohio senator as the heir apparent to Trump’s brand of Republicanism, which has transformed the Republican Party over the past eight years. For many in the party, Trump’s populist and isolationist impulses were often met with an eye-roll, especially during his first term, when GOP lawmakers were constantly forced to comment on Trump’s latest policy stance issued via tweet. But Vance, who has been in the Senate for under two years, has fully embraced the populism mantle of the party, putting him at odds with many of his fellow senators -– including GOP Leader Mitch McConnell –- on issues like aid to Ukraine. Read more here. In the moments after President Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 race, a scramble unfolded as officials raced to reframe the Democratic National Convention around a new candidate: Vice President Kamala Harris. But the change — while abrupt — also presented an opportunity. Celebrities who had not been inclined to attend now showed new interest. Donors were energized. And a different tone for the convention began to take shape. It’s a stark pivot from the state of play only a couple of weeks ago, when celebrity endorsements and attendance were a tough sell. According to a source familiar with the DNC’s current plans, a handful of major Hollywood figures have been confirmed to attend. No performers have been set yet, though various representatives for musicians have been in talks with the Harris campaign, according to two sources. Plans are still being finalized. With the young vote being key, sources said that Gen Z stars have expressed interest in appearing at the DNC. Read more here. Voting to officially make Vice President Kamala Harris the Democratic Party’s nominee for president began Thursday, with the party’s roughly 4,700 delegates receiving digital ballots.  Delegates have until 6 p.m. ET on Monday to return their ballots.  There isn’t much suspense over the outcome of the vote. Harris is the only name on the ballot, as she was the only candidate to gather the necessary number of signatures from delegates.  The party announced Tuesday that 3,923 delegates had petitioned for Harris, or 99% of those who participated in the process. No other candidate met the 300-signature threshold to qualify for the ballot.  After Harris is officially the nominee, party rules allow her to name her running mate without a separate vote.  Democrats are nominating Harris ahead of their convention in Chicago later this month to avoid potential litigation over ballot access, especially in Ohio.  While the official voting is happening virtually, delegates will have a ceremonial roll call at the convention, which begins August 19. Former President Donald Trump said Friday he’s no longer wearing a bandage on his ear after the assassination attempt because he’s had “a good healing process.”  Trump didn’t appear to be wearing a bandage during his rally in Harrisburg on Wednesday. He has previously said he wasn’t wearing the bandage anymore. Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet over the weekend with the top finalists to join her on the Democratic ticket, according to a source familiar with the vetting process.  Among those expected to meet with Harris are Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and JB Pritzker of Illinois; Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Most of the meetings are expected to be in person, but some could be conducted virtually. It is possible that additional candidates could be added to the schedule, the source said.  According to the source, Harris has not yet made her choice, and these face-to-face meetings will play a critical role in her decision-making.  Beyond whom Harris gets along with on a personal level, two sources familiar with how Harris is approaching her decision say her top consideration is electability – how and where a vice presidential candidate will help with independents and swing voters, especially in battleground states. And, the sources add, they don’t want someone who will be a distraction.  Multiple sources familiar with the campaign tell CNN Shapiro, Walz, and Kelly are considered among the top contenders for the job. Beshear is also being looked at closely, while Buttigieg and Pritzker are considered less likely to be chosen. CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby is pushing back on comments from GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to Thursday’s prisoner exchange because he was “cleaning house” ahead of a possible Trump administration. Kirby also stressed that some of the prisoners freed under Biden were taken when Donald Trump was in office. The former president has hit the Biden administration for giving up too much in exchange for Thursday’s swap. Vice President Kamala Harris tied Thursday’s historic prisoner swap and the diplomatic efforts of the Biden administration to the 2024 election, telling reporters moments after the freed Americans arrived on US soil that it was a reminder of what is at stake in November. The presumptive Democratic nominee did not name former President Donald Trump, but alluded to his “America First” policies and isolationist rhetoric to draw a contrast."
Harris’ economic stance in spotlight as jobs data stirs concerns | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:02 PM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-03T01:29:12.527Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/harris-economic-stance-jobs/index.html,"For years, as Americans have expressed frustration about the economy and the cost of living, the Biden-Harris administration has pointed to job creation as the major bright spot and their preferred indicator of a strong economy. Friday’s jobs data casts a long shadow on that bright spot, with an underwhelming number of jobs created, slowing wage growth, and a significant increase in the unemployment rate – all putting the Federal Reserve on notice to juice the economy by lowering interest rates. The data also points a spotlight on the economic platform of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is poised to accept the Democratic presidential nomination this month amid signs of a slowing economy. In her brief time as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has touted her positions on abortion rights and her experience as a prosecutor. But her economic views are less defined, maintaining broad references to strengthening the middle class, even as her record investigating Wall Street and her farther-left 2019 primary campaign platform have executives and investors on edge. According to those close to Harris, advisers and administration officials, Harris’ economic views were described as “pragmatic,” “centrist,” and even “pro-business,” with a goal of leveraging private-sector friendships for better outcomes at the ground level. Harris has two staffers who manage economic and domestic policy issues, and she was briefed by staff on the most recent jobs data. But she has not had an economist on her staff since early 2022, when Mike Pyle departed the Office of the Vice President to join the National Security Council and National Economic Council as a policy negotiator known as a “sherpa.” Within the administration, she seeks input often from deputy secretaries – including Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves, Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo. At the Cabinet-level, Harris and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have developed a particularly close relationship, officials say. Pyle, officials said, is still on her speed dial – as are other administration alumni, including Biden’s former economic policy lead Brian Deese and Harris’ former domestic policy chief Rohini Kosoglu – to discuss how she approaches various issues. To spearhead the policy development at the campaign, Harris this week tapped Treasury undersecretary Brian Nelson, with whom she worked closely as California’s attorney general. Nelson’s first day was Friday. “He is as close to Harris and the second gentleman as almost anyone in the administration,” said an official close to Harris. Former colleagues of Nelson describe him less as a wonk and more as a “statesman” with broad managerial experience who could easily slide into a Cabinet role were Harris to win in November. But the contours of Nelson’s own policy views are elusive, leading executives and donors to keep watching closely to see whom in particular she consults on economic advice for evidence of how she’d govern. “That’s going to say a hell of a lot,” said one longtime Democratic operative, providing two examples of an establishment, mainstream economist like Jason Furman, who worked for President Barack Obama, or a progressive firebrand like Rohit Chopra, a former adviser to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and current director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2020, then-candidate Biden assembled a “unity” task force co-chaired by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders representing the full spectrum of views across the Democratic Party. The result was more progressive policies – like student debt forgiveness – being added to the platform. Now running as a continuation of the current administration, Harris already has a blueprint to work with, with the most recent fiscal year budget, published by the White House in March, as a starting point, according to three people familiar with the matter. “She can just pick a half dozen policies from there and call it a day,” said one former administration official. Friends and advisers said her top priorities are policies that help working families, small businesses and underserved communities. She also favors moderate tax policy, people familiar with her views said. “She wants to make sure the US is the place investment and capital continues to want to flow,” a friend and adviser said, noting that that position has at times put her at odds with the party. The Harris campaign says she will not raise taxes on any individual making less than $400,000. During discussions in 2023 over how to allocate roughly $100 billion in incentives for semiconductor companies, Harris insisted that the Commerce Department consider metropolitan areas like Columbus, Ohio, and Syracuse, New York, to spread the wealth, people involved in the discussions said. And while she’s been a quiet partner to Biden and continued advocating for his policies, she has also raised questions about some of his decisions. Early in the term, as Biden was deciding who to appoint to his Cabinet, Harris challenged Biden’s leaning toward appointing Tom Vilsack to lead the Department of Agriculture, an aide recalled. Harris challenged the notion of appointing an older, White man – who had already done the job during Obama’s two terms – when there were farmers of color who had secured his victory, in Georgia in particular. Biden, according to the aide, defended the decision by saying because Vilsack knew the ins and outs of the agency, he could run it – and its massive budget – remotely, as he would need to do before the country fully reopened post-pandemic. Harris has cultivated relationships in the business community that friends expect her to lean on heavily for outside advice. She speaks frequently to Ray McGuire, a longtime Wall Street executive now serving as president of Lazard, and Blair Effron, the co-founder of Centerview Partners, according to people familiar with the matter. And in recent months, she hosted JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for lunch at the Naval Observatory, a source told CNN. The broad business relationships she’s cultivated, officials say, have proven useful. When tapped by the president to address the root causes of migration, Harris developed a public-private partnership to invest in job creation in Central America. Dozens of corporations, including Meta, Target, and Columbia Sportswear, pledged roughly $6 billion – of which only about $1 billion has been spent. But the prosecutorial bent is never far away. “She’s pro-business, but she also will make sure businesses doing something wrong will be held accountable,” one longtime friend said. As attorney general of California, she secured an $18 billion settlement from banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup for their role in the housing crisis – a case that one adviser noted Nelson also worked on during his time at that office. And she’s been known to favor crackdowns on anticompetitive hiring practices – suing eBay over such policies in the attorney general role, and advocating for the Biden administration’s regulation banning non-compete clauses in employment agreements. That ban, pursued by Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan, went into effect this year. An administration official close to Harris said she has liked some of Khan’s work, but Harris “is not as strident as Lina,” whom some donors have publicly called to be replaced if Harris wins because of her crusades against business mergers."
How Biden feels about some of Harris’ top running mate candidates | CNN Politics,"Published 7:40 PM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-02T23:40:02.943Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-running-mate-candidates/index.html,"President Joe Biden acknowledged to reporters Friday morning that he and Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken about her upcoming decision on a vice presidential running mate. But he wouldn’t say much else: “I’ll let her work that out,” Biden said, when pressed on what top qualities the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee should consider. Still, inside the White House, the president’s close advisers have a good sense of how Biden feels about several of the men currently believed to be Harris’ top contenders heading into a critical weekend of final interviews with a decision to come by Tuesday. One well-known Biden favorite? Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Biden is a “big fan of Shapiro’s,” a senior adviser to the president told CNN. And given that the president himself frequently traveled to Pennsylvania as a candidate and has made no bones about the fact that he sees the state as one of the most important battleground states heading into November – just as it was in 2020 – for some of the president’s advisers, it’s hard to imagine him personally rooting for anyone but Shapiro. That is, perhaps, anyone other than Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The most obvious reason? “He’s just a blast,” this adviser said. In January, Walz was among a group of Democratic elected officials that joined Biden at an infrastructure event in Superior, Wisconsin. The president’s formal remarks were at Earth Rider Brewery – afterwards, the group made their way over to the Cedar Lounge taproom to greet voters, where beers were freely flowing. Walz, the adviser recalled, was having a great time – and it all felt infectious. “Biden was in the best mood ever,” this adviser chuckled, and they said that, at the time, advisers to the president joked with one another that perhaps the team should find ways to have Walz around Biden more “because he always put him in such a great mood.” As for Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, also seen as a serious contender for Harris’ running mate, this adviser acknowledged that Biden is not as personally close to the senator as he might be with some of the others on the list but noted that the president is very fond of both the senator and his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords. On Friday, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison announced that Harris had earned enough delegate votes to secure the party’s presidential nomination. Harris is in the final stages of choosing her running mate and is expected to meet with the top finalists – including Walz, Shapiro, Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker – over the weekend. Harris and her vice presidential pick will spend next week campaigning across the battleground states, starting with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia."
"Kamala Harris has earned enough votes to win the Democratic presidential nomination, party chair announces | CNN Politics","Updated 2:10 PM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-02T17:21:32.945Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination-election/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris has won enough votes from Democratic delegates to win the party’s nomination for president, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison announced Friday. Harris will become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major-party ticket. The announcement came during a virtual event with supporters Friday. Delegates began casting virtual ballots for the nomination Thursday, a process that will continue until Monday evening. “I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States,” said Harris, who joined the virtual event. “I will officially accept your nomination next week, once the virtual voting period is closed.” “Later this month, we will gather in Chicago, united as one party, where we’re going to have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together,” the vice president added. It’s been clear since shortly after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris that the vice president would be the only serious candidate for the nomination. Virtually the entire party, including potential challengers, quickly endorsed her, and it took less than 36 hours for her to secure unofficial endorsements from enough delegates to be the party’s nominee. Harris is the only name on the ballot, as she was the only candidate to a gather the 300 delegate signatures necessary to qualify. Harris’ path to the nomination stands in stark contrast to her 11-month presidential run in 2020, when she dropped out ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Biden later named Harris as his running mate, a decision that positioned her to take on the party mantle after he stepped aside last month. As the official nomination process has unfolded, Harris has spent the past nearly two weeks reorienting the campaign she inherited on a truncated timeline. Her campaign said Friday it had raked in a whopping $310 million in its July fundraising efforts, buoyed by renewed energy within the party over her candidacy. The haul also more than doubled what Republican nominee Donald Trump’s political operation said it had raised last month. Harris is also in the final stages of choosing her running mate. A source familiar with the vetting process told CNN that the vice president is expected to meet with the top finalists over the weekend, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Harris and her vice presidential nominee will spend next week campaigning across the battleground states, starting with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia. Though voting for the Democratic nomination began and will possibly conclude before Harris announces her running mate, party rules don’t require a separate vote to confirm the nominee for vice president. While the official voting is taking place virtually, delegates will have a ceremonial roll call at the Democratic convention in Chicago, which begins August 19."
How Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign built the base driving his VP buzz | CNN Politics,"Updated 1:21 PM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-02T17:08:32.768Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/pete-buttigieg-vice-president-harris/index.html,"When Pete Buttigieg launched his presidential bid in the spring of 2019, he acknowledged that — at least on paper — he didn’t strike the image of a winning candidate. “I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,” he told the crowd in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana, which he led for two four-year terms. “More than a little bold, at age 37, to seek the highest office in the land.” Five years later, Buttigieg is once again in the running for one of the highest offices, against a field with much longer resumes jostling  to join Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket. That he’s made it to this point speaks to the strength of his appeal among Democrats, bolstered by years of well-received media appearances and viral moments in congressional hearings. But it also demonstrates the durability of the movement he built as a presidential candidate — particularly online — that propelled him to a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses and a close second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary. “I think what we’re seeing here is an extension of the support, the excitement and the base from his presidential run,” said George Hornedo, a Democratic strategist and Buttigieg’s 2020 deputy national political director. “They’ve stayed ready, and they’ve been supportive of the many things Pete’s been doing in the administration.” Buttigieg has continued to build his brand as a Democrat willing to talk to anyone, anywhere — including Fox News — even as transportation secretary. His digital army has kept track, amplifying department initiatives and congressional hearings. Over the past few days, as speculation over who Harris will pick for her running mate has surged, Buttigieg’s supporters have amplified clips from the wave of media appearances he’s done to promote Harris’ campaign and to mobilize on her behalf. Buttigieg isn’t the only politician to exit a Democratic presidential primary with an enduring army of online super fans. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ grassroots supporters continued to propel him long after his 2016 campaign, and the 2020 campaign birthed Andrew Yang’s “Yang Gang.” Harris’ “K-Hive” formed before she ran for president and has spent the years since the 2020 election hyping her wins and defending her record. “Team Pete” didn’t disappear, but the “veepstakes” reactivated his supporters, said Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign manager. “Joe Biden making this incredible, selfless, historic decision created this explosion of energy for Kamala Harris in the Democratic Party, but it’s also created a mini campaign for who’s going to be her running mate,” he said. “And I think that these folks are just passionate about Pete.” On Thursday evening, a few hundred supporters gathered on a “Team Pete for Kamala Harris” Zoom, one of several affinity group-based fundraising calls, to bond over their appreciation of the secretary and raise money for the vice president. The call included several of Buttigieg’s top 2020 endorsers, including mayors and local election officials, and organizers. Attendees agreed to follow the “rules of the road,” the 10 principles that guided Buttigieg’s presidential bid, and “no VP talk!” The call raised about $16,000 for the Harris campaign, according to Joseph Guarino, a call organizer who hosted “Team Pete” debate watch parties in New York City during the 2020 campaign. “Our event was in no way affiliated with Pete Buttigieg in any way, nor did he provide instruction or inspiration in any form,” Guarino said in an email. “Just some grassroots enthusiasts looking to flex their muscles for Kamala Harris.” Harris is expected to make her decision by Tuesday, when she and her running mate will hold a rally in Philadelphia. Among the candidates she is considering, Buttigieg is not considered a top contender on the level of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, CNN reported this week. This week, though, he joined the list of vice presidential hopefuls to cancel a planned event with limited explanation. Buttigieg toured a manufacturing training labs at a community college in Kokomo, Indiana, on Friday and spoke with reporters, but a Department of Transportation spokesperson said he would no longer be hosting a roadway safety roundtable later in the day due to “unforeseen scheduling constraints.” Asked Friday if he could explain what those conflicts were, Buttigieg responded, “No.” Buttigieg is among the contenders expected to meet with Harris over the weekend, either virtually or in person, as she nears a decision, a source familiar with the vetting process told CNN. The former mayor’s fans and allies frequently refer to him as the most effective communicator in the Democratic party and praise his ability to break down Republican arguments in a plainspoken manner. They reject the idea that America isn’t ready for a major-party ticket featuring both a Black woman and the first out gay vice presidential pick. Rep. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat who supports Buttigieg, brought up the topic, calling it “incredibly frustrating.” “I harken back to serving in combat,” he said. “We didn’t care if the person next to us was gay or straight, whether they were male or female, Black or White, whatever their religion was. We cared about getting the job done. And clearly that’s what Secretary Buttigieg is about.” Ryan, who is facing a competitive reelection race in upstate New York, was among the first House Democrats to call for Biden to step aside. He’s since publicly backed Buttigieg for Harris’ running mate. “It’s an existential situation to stop (Donald) Trump and MAGA and all he stands for, so my decision to call on Biden was really grounded in that,” Ryan told CNN. “It’s the same rationale that drove me to to say that I think Secretary Buttigieg would be the strongest teammate, with Vice President Harris, to make clear what the threat is.” But some also acknowledge that, if the debate centers around battleground math, the Indiana native doesn’t bring as much to the ticket as rivals like Shapiro. (Though Buttigieg switched his residency to his husband’s home state of Michigan a few years ago, he’s never run for office there.) “I think if you left it up to the delegates, he’d be a shoo-in,” said Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, an early 2020 Buttigieg endorser who knocked on doors in Iowa for his campaign. “But I completely respect that Vice President Harris has to make a decision based on what helps her win the most Electoral College votes. And I don’t know that that’s Pete.” Nina Smith, a traveling press secretary for the Buttigieg 2020 campaign, pointed to his work as transportation secretary promoting the administration’s policies as she made the case for him. While she’d like to see him chosen, the mini campaign around the possible picks had showcased a broad range of candidates. “It’s kind of delightful, as a Democratic operative, to look and see how deep of a bench we have,” Smith said. And if it doesn’t work out this time, there’s always next time. “I definitely think in my lifetime he will be on a ticket,” said Brandon Neal, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser to the 2020 campaign. “There’s no doubt about it. It’s just a matter of when.” This story has been updated with additional reporting."
Some Jewish Democrats wonder if America is ready for a Jewish vice president | CNN Politics,"Updated 11:02 AM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-02T09:00:02.427Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/shapiro-jewish-identity-scrutiny-democratic-party/index.html,"Josh Shapiro’s advisers debated the early seconds of his first ad of the 2022 Pennsylvania governor’s campaign: He was going to start by saying that he makes sure to be home every Friday night for dinner with his family. But should his script call it “Sabbath dinner”? Should the shot of the table show a challah bread? After all, the last time a guy named Shapiro had been elected governor of Pennsylvania, he had years earlier anglicized his name to Shapp. The answers were yes and yes. Shapiro’s wife Lori even baked the braided loaves herself. Now, with Shapiro very much in contention in Kamala Harris’ rushed running mate search, the Democratic world – already divided over the politics of Israel in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack – is wondering whether the US would really be ready for a Jewish vice president — and the first Black and South Asian woman president, who happens to be married to a Jewish man. While there is another Jewish governor, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who has also already been through two rounds of vetting interviews with Harris’ staff, it’s the Pennsylvania governor – with his outspoken views on Judaism and Israel – who has been the focus as Harris aides are looking at who would help the ticket. Shapiro’s home battleground state isn’t the only factor; the conversation is also about his potential wider appeal in the “Blue Wall” states, about how Jewish populations are bigger than the 2020 margins of victory in many battlegrounds, and how his selection would play with the Arab American population in Michigan and progressives overall. Some pro-Palestinian organizers, amplified by groups like the Democratic Socialists of America and the Sunrise Movement, have been taken to calling him “Genocide Josh” on social media — even though the governor has never cast a vote on any foreign policy issue and the statements he has made about Israel have been more pointed than other prospects, but not substantively different. “I’m not aware of how his position on Israel differs from the other potential vice presidents,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who is both Jewish and a proud progressive, told CNN. Among even many Jewish Democrats who are Shapiro fans, excitement about the prospect of his being the pick is mixed with pride, anxiety and fear of what sort of divisions and conspiracy theories his selection could set off. “Is the antisemitism going to increase because now you’d have the person who sleeps next to her and the person who would be her closest political ally are both Jewish?” asked one Jewish former Democratic statewide leader outside of Pennsylvania who is a Shapiro fan. “Does it make it more dangerous for those of us in the Jewish community?” Rep. Greg Landsman – an Ohio congressman whose tattoos include a passage from the Book of Micah in Hebrew on his left shoulder – said it’s a real question of whether America would be ready for a Jewish vice president, or at least a Jewish running mate. “Some folks would be, others no,” Landsman told CNN. “There is a lot of Jew hate out there. I’ve experienced it. We all have. And there are folks on the far right that have made it worse, and folks on the far left that have made it worse. But that’s true for most issues.” Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, who was the president of a synagogue in the Las Vegas suburbs before getting into politics, said she’d be “thrilled” if Shapiro were the choice. “It’s really great to have representation and to have someone who understands what it means to work to fight antisemitism and all forms of hate, what it means to do a lot of these things,” she said. Simone Zimmerman – a co-founder of the group IfNotNow, made up of Jews opposed to the Israeli offensive in Gaza and American support for the Israeli government – said Shapiro would be a problem with the party base because he has “significantly more divisive positions on one important issue that a lot of us care about in a way that is disqualifying.” “Chalking all of this up to antisemitism,” Zimmerman said, “is once again a way to distract from an honest conversation about his agenda.” Others argue that the risk of dividing the party is too high. “The party is incredibly united at this moment. Of the VP’s choices, Shapiro is the one who stands out as the most divisive and could put a stop in everyone being on the same page,” said one Jewish Democratic operative. “We have to be realistic. We have to understand the stakes and what it takes to win and that’s going to require a lot of Democratic energy.” Shapiro has set a record for getting more votes than any other Democrat in Pennsylvania in each of his races, although he faced weak GOP opponents. Along the way, he earned support from Black ministers who have talked about connecting to him through faith, Catholics who trusted him when he took on the church in a massive abuse scandal he investigated and prosecuted while state attorney general, and just this week a Muslim leader wrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer about how the governor for years has “had our back.” But Shapiro is a different kind of Jewish politician than many who have come before. He’s not an Orthodox Jew like the late Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — whose stringent adherence was so infamous that his friend, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, even made a joke about it at his memorial service in Washington last week. Shapiro is nonetheless more observant than many in public life and more apt to talk about it. There have been more than two dozen Jewish governors in the US, but he’s the first to perform the ceremony making the kitchen in the governor’s mansion kosher, and nearly every speech he gives includes a riff on a famous Jewish teaching that “no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it.” His aides and advisers argue that rather than a liability, Shapiro’s faith has been a way of making connections, of building trust. They say polling can’t empirically measure the impact, but argue it demonstrates his authenticity and helps explain his high popularity in a big and diverse state with a very small Jewish population. “He’s been pretty powerfully talking about his faith in a way that doesn’t just appeal to Jews, but folks across a pretty wide swath who are religious and not religious,” said one Jewish Democratic operative who has worked with Shapiro. “It is a part of how he’s been able to earn such significant support across different parts of the electorate.” But that was all running on his own, not as the potential addition to a ticket going up against a Republican nominee who this week agreed with a radio host that second gentleman Doug Emhoff is “a crappy Jew,” said that Harris herself “doesn’t like Jewish people” or that Jews who vote for Democrats “should have their head examined.” Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor who is Jewish but was never affiliated or observant, recalled a time in his first campaign, for Philadelphia district attorney in 1977, when he was introduced to a local political leader as running against “some Yid.” Rendell said then that he had been so shocked and so cowed that he didn’t even point out the slur technically applied to him as well. Rendell said he believes things have changed in the last 45 years. “There were a lot of people who don’t like Jews who voted for Josh Shapiro because they said he’s different,” Rendell said. Shapiro has been keeping a low profile through the vetting process and declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed. But speaking to CNN on his campaign bus riding through western Pennsylvania in late October 2022, days before being elected governor, Shapiro said he was eager for people to know about his connection to Judaism. “That is what motivates me. It really is. I think if you want to be someone’s governor, they’ve got to know who you are as a person, what motivates you,” Shapiro told CNN. “That’s why I always talk about it. I talk about my faith because I want people to know what calls me to service.” Shapiro brushed aside questions about how his Republican opponent in that race attacked him for going to a Jewish day school, trafficked in antisemitic tropes and faced criticism for his ties to a website known for its antisemitic content. “I’m not going to let him or his attacks on my faith dictate how I practice my faith or how I speak. But I will say his attacks, this might surprise you, don’t bother me personally,” Shapiro said at the time. “They really don’t. What bothers me is the way he shows others that he’s disrespecting them by virtue of how he attacks my faith.” Long before Shapiro started plotting his political career, he and his father traveled to a variety of Jewish communities to raise awareness about the “refuseniks,” or Soviet Jews who felt oppressed but were being stopped from emigrating to Israel or the United States. He formed a group called Children for Avi, named after his pen pal, of 50 kids across the country writing letters protesting the situation. An article in the local paper in 1986 about Shapiro’s bar mitzvah includes a photo of the rabbi blessing the 13-year-old future governor and the Soviet boy, who was able to attend because Sen. Ted Kennedy appealed to Mikhail Gorbachev to get the family out of the country after 14 years of their trying. That sensibility carried through Shapiro’s political career including in June, when he and Emhoff were among the featured speakers at a groundbreaking for the new Tree of Life synagogue outside of Pittsburgh to replace the building where, in 2018, an antisemite with an assault rifle killed 11 and wounded six others at Saturday morning services. Shapiro used the Hebrew phrase referring to the connection between generations and the Yiddish word for praying. He spoke about seeing the bullet holes when he toured the sanctuary with his children. “Remembrance cannot be a passive act,” he said, and later decried that at this moment, “Some leaders at times offer permission slips to hate.” With these roots, several people who have known Shapiro for years say it’s no surprise that he has stood up strongly in support of Israel and called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “one of the worst leaders of all time,” but that when he saw some protests on campuses tipping into antisemitism, he felt the need to speak out. Pushing back on some advisers who urged him to hold back, Shapiro said he was listening to the tone of some of the protests and believed that that the atmosphere was getting dangerous. After joining the criticism of the university presidents who struggled to condemn antisemitism during congressional hearings last fall, Shapiro said universities were failing in their obligation to keep students safe. He said that people who had moved into antisemitic chants and behavior were being excused and that there would be no tolerance for people “dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia,” outraging some pro-Palestinian activists with the comparison. Shapiro’s popularity stayed high in Pennsylvania throughout. But some of the loudest voices on the left, perhaps most prominently the Democratic Socialists of America and related groups, are now pointing to that rhetoric to argue he should be disqualified from Harris’ consideration. And some are using that to claim Shapiro is not actually a progressive, pointing to issues like his support for school vouchers or suggesting that he was too pro-police as attorney general. Criticizing Shapiro about policy disagreements is fair, said Jewish Council for Public Affairs CEO Amy Spitalnick, but “when you are running a campaign around ‘Genocide Josh’ and he is the only potential candidate being labeled as such, that is singling out the Jewish candidate.” “I think it’s clear why. You’d be hard pressed to find any Jewish member of Congress that hasn’t on occasion faced a similar double standard,” said Adam Schiff, the California congressman and Senate candidate. “It’s offensive and wrong and I regret that Governor Shapiro has to endure this.” Even a “Case for Tim Walz for Vice President” document circulated by supporters – which a spokesman said is not connected to the Minnesota governor – makes an implicit reference to Shapiro’s perceived liability, arguing, “He has no known personal skeletons, major drawbacks or divisive stances that might depress Democratic base enthusiasm (eg. Israel/Gaza policy, charter schools, etc.)” Several Jewish Democratic operatives confided privately to CNN that though they think the attacks on Shapiro may be unfair and have at least tinges of antisemitism, they are anxious about him being the pick because of what putting him on the ticket could set off, from renewed protests at the Democratic convention later this month to larger splits in the party. But calling what’s coming at Shapiro “pure antisemitism,” Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, warned against that defensive way of thinking. “I strongly disagree with the notion that because bad actors would act badly that we should therefore avoid the possibility of those bad actors acting badly. That way lies madness,” Goldman said. “That’s how extortion happens — where the victims avoid what would be a confrontation with the bullies.”"
"‘There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons’: How Harris’ candidacy has energized plans for the DNC | CNN Politics","Updated 7:29 AM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-02T10:00:02.305Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/harris-celebrities-democratic-national-convention/index.html,"In the moments after President Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 race, a scramble unfolded as officials raced to reframe the Democratic National Convention around a new candidate: Vice President Kamala Harris. Officials quickly moved to tailor the Chicago convention to Harris with only four weeks, in part drawing from the 2008 convention when Barack Obama accepted the nomination given the historic candidacy of Harris herself. But the change — while abrupt — also presented an opportunity. Celebrities who had been uninterested in attending now showed renewed interest. Donors were energized. And a different tone for the convention began to take shape. “Before Biden decided not to run, it was going to be very anti-Trump, that was our best bet,” one source familiar with the planning told CNN. “Now, it’s going to be more positive and optimistic.” It’s a stark pivot from the state of play only a couple weeks ago, when celebrity endorsements and attendance were a tough sell. “There was no excitement. Now, there’s tons,” a Democratic strategist with deep Hollywood ties told CNN. “I’m getting hundreds of texts with people asking me to get them credentials.” In a little over a week, there’s been a groundswell of support for Harris, manifesting in millions of dollars of fundraising, multiple Zoom calls rallying voters, and a slew of endorsements from across the Democratic Party. She’s also already flexed some star power, including with a performance from Megan Thee Stallion at her Atlanta rally. Nominee acceptance speeches for the convention, which begins the week of August 19, are currently scheduled for that Wednesday and Thursday night, according to convention officials. Themes for each night of the convention are still being locked in and the schedule remains in flux. Conventional officials maintain that the general infrastructure hasn’t changed regardless of a change in who’s leading the party’s ticket. But sources described a convention geared toward reintroducing Harris, including setting up a lineup of people who know her best to deliver remarks. “The convention is our opportunity to tell our story directly to the American people, rally behind the Democratic nominees, and grow our broad and diverse coalition to defeat Donald Trump,” Democratic National Convention spokesperson Matt Hill said in a statement. “We look forward to sharing more soon about our convention in Chicago where Democrats will offer a forward-looking vision for our country that stands in stark contrast to the extremism from Donald Trump’s convention that would take America backwards.” The convention program if Biden were the nominee was expected to feature a sizable amount of pre-produced content, drawing from the televised storytelling during the virtual 2020 convention that some officials felt was effective in telling the party’s story. Some of that content is expected to remain. But now, as organizers prepare for a high-energy event and field input from new parties interested in participating, decisions must be made about what taped programming will end up on the cutting room floor, according to a source familiar with the planning. CNN previously reported that Biden — who was slated to close the convention as the nominee — is expected to deliver a primetime speech during the opening night of the Chicago convention, with the evening’s programming centering on Biden’s legacy and achievements. That programming will include highly produced televised content aimed at telling the story of how the country moved beyond the pandemic-era of four years ago, before literally and figuratively passing the baton to Biden’s onetime running mate. “Monday night is Joe’s night,” said a source familiar with the planning. “And then he’ll turn the keys over” to allow the event to focus on Harris. There’s history to such choreography. At the August 2000 convention, outgoing President Bill Clinton helmed the opening night keynote. After a camera crew filmed Clinton’s dramatic, three-minute entrance to the arena, he was welcomed to the lectern with an uproarious applause. Clinton used the opportunity to highlight the hallmarks of his almost eight years in office before officially passing the torch to his vice president, Al Gore. The Hollywood community is clamoring to support Harris at the DNC, according to numerous agents, publicists and Democratic strategists who spoke to CNN. There are so many celebrities interested in getting involved; the convention has become the hottest ticket in town. According to a source familiar with the DNC’s current plans, a handful of major Hollywood figures have been confirmed to attend. No performers have been set yet, though various representatives for musicians have been in talks with the Harris campaign, according to two sources. Plans are still being finalized. Aside from A-listers, Hollywood strategists told CNN that the type of celebrity who will appear at the convention will be very specific and strategic. For instance, besides Megan Thee Stallion’s performance at her Atlanta rally earlier this week, Harris had the support of the rapper Quavo, who spoke about gun violence prevention. Both stars appealed to Black voters and young voters. The young vote will be key, and, sources said, the Gen Z stars have expressed interest in appearing at the DNC. “The Republicans had Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan. It was just so yesterday,” a Democratic strategist told CNN. “Our story is about what’s next.” One of the considerations, according to a strategist in touch with the Harris campaign, is not going overboard with Hollywood players and making sure the focus remains on the issues. “It can’t look like an award show. That didn’t work for Hillary,” this strategist said, referencing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had an overwhelming level of celebrity support when she ran and lost to Trump in 2016. Even if they’re not in the room at the DNC, celebrities are expected to be in Chicago throughout the week and are already receiving invites to attend convention-related events and parties, according to an individual who is hosting an event. “They love the president and have so much respect for him, but there is clearly a different energy now,” according to a Hollywood executive who works with celebrities on political causes, referring to the apathy among celebrities last month. “There is a strong excitement about not only beating Trump, but also about the VP being the president. There is definitely energy on no Trump, but there is genuinely excitement in the context of the future,” this executive said."
"Harris campaign says it raised $310 million in July, doubling Trump’s haul | CNN Politics","Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri August 2, 2024",2024-08-02T09:00:03.505Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/harris-fundraising-july/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign said it raked in a whopping $310 million in its July fundraising efforts – more than double the amount raised by her Republican rival last month – and has $377 million cash on hand, marking the latest sign of how transformative and energizing the change to the top of the Democratic ticket has been among grassroots and high-dollar supporters. A majority of that $310 million haul, more than $200 million, was raised in the first week of Harris’ candidacy, the campaign said in a statement, with two-thirds of the fundraising coming from first-time donors to the campaign. President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection on July 21, endorsing Harris the same afternoon. Harris swiftly consolidated support among the party and had secured enough delegate endorsements to win the nomination the following night. Prior to Biden’s decision to step aside, Democratic donors had expressed deep concerns about the president’s viability as a candidate, holding back big checks and standing down on planned fundraising events. The July numbers signal a remarkable turnaround and more than double former President Donald Trump’s fundraising this month: the Trump campaign announced Thursday that its political operation had raised $138.7 million in July, with $327 million cash on hand. Even so, July was a strong fundraising month for Trump that saw him accept his party’s nomination at the Republican National Convention, announce his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and survive an assassination attempt. The July haul was the second month in a row that Democrats have outraised Trump’s team, and the surge in donations lifted Democratic fundraising above the $1 billion mark – the fastest a campaign has crossed that threshold in presidential history, according to Harris’ team. The Harris campaign said July also marked the “best grassroots fundraising month in presidential history” with 94% of its donations falling under $200. “This is a history-making haul for a candidate who will make history this November. The tremendous outpouring of support we’ve seen in just a short time makes clear the Harris coalition is mobilized, growing, and ready to put in the work to defeat Trump this November,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement, adding that the campaign’s money “is going to the work that wins close elections.” The campaign also highlighted some key demographic trends it saw in July donations: more than 10 times the number of Gen Z donors contributed compared to June, and more than eight times the number of millennial donors than the previous month. Sixty percent of donors, the campaign noted, were women. And as several coalition groups have held organizing Zoom calls in recent days, the campaign noted that groups “like Black Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris, and yes, White Dudes for Harris raised more than $20 million for Team Harris.” Harris’ team has more than 260 coordinated campaign offices and more than 1,400 coordinated campaign staff in battleground states, it said. The money raised by Harris’ political operation in July falls short of the record high set in September 2020 when Biden’s campaign and the Democratic Party raised $383 million, but it underscores how much her surprise candidacy swiftly changed the fundraising trajectory for the party. The challenge ahead for Harris: sustaining the blistering fundraising pace. “These are unprecedented amounts to be raising in such a short timeframe,” Brendan Glavin – deputy research director at OpenSecrets, which tracks political money – said of the $200 million Harris raised in the first week of her candidacy. But, he added, “the campaign will have to maintain momentum and convince donors to keep giving throughout the fall, when fundraising is traditionally at its peak.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Rep. Bob Good on Thursday conceded the Republican primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District after a recount.  “While I am disappointed in the ultimate outcome, it has been my distinct honor to serve as the congressional representative for Virginia’s 5th District over the past 3.5 years,” Good said in a statement on Facebook. Good requested the recount, which he had to fund, after the certified results found him 374 votes, or 0.6 percentage points, behind state Sen. John McGuire.  Both former President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy endorsed McGuire against Good, who chairs the hard-line House Freedom Caucus.  Republican Rep. Andy Ogles, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, will survive a primary challenge in Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District, CNN projects. Ogles, a freshman lawmaker who had former President Donald Trump’s endorsement, is projected to defeat challenger Courtney Johnston, a member of Nashville’s Metro Council who outraised him in the race. Ogles will be heavily favored in the general election for the Middle Tennessee seat, which Republicans redrew two years ago to favor their party. Since taking office, Ogles has been dogged by questions about his resume. A series of investigative reports by WTVF, the CBS affiliate in Nashville, raised questions about the congressman’s campaign finances, his academic background, his work history, his claims of volunteer work and more.   On July 23, following Kamala Harris’ elevation as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Ogles introduced two articles of impeachment in the House against the vice president, accusing her of willfully refusing to uphold immigration laws and a breach of public trust. The effort has no chance of advancing in the House. Former President Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, said Thursday in an interview with NewsMax that he doesn’t “really care” who his opponent is. “I don’t really care about who my opponent is,” he said. Vance also took a dig at Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a potential running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming he did “nothing” during the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment and toxic spill. Vance’s comments come as anticipation mounts around who Harris will choose to join her atop the Democratic ticket. Her campaign announced earlier this week that she and her vice presidential pick will embark on a swing state tour next week, starting in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Gloria Johnson, who made national headlines last year as one of three Tennessee state lawmakers facing expulsion over their protest on the state House floor for more gun control, will win the Democratic nomination for Senate in the Volunteer State, CNN projects. Johnson will take on Republican incumbent Marsha Blackburn, who will be heavily favored in the deep-red state. Tennessee hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1990. Johnson made headlines in 2023 when she, along with fellow Democratic state Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, faced expulsion from the state Legislature after advocating gun reform measures following a mass shooting at a Nashville school. Republicans in the chamber accused the trio – who soon earned the moniker “Tennessee Three” of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives.” Jones and Pearson, who are Black, were expelled, though they later won back their seats. Johnson, who is White, narrowly avoided expulsion. In an interview with CNN at the time, Johnson slammed the votes to expel Jones and Pearson as racist. “I am a 60-year-old White woman, and they are two young Black men,” Johnson said, noting that both Pearson and Jones were questioned in a “demeaning way” by lawmakers before their expulsion.  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear heads to the Windy City Monday, where he’s set to headline a fundraiser for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. The fundraiser is hosted by Christie Hefner; former US Ambassador to the Netherlands Fay Hartog-Levin; and the Joint Action Committee for Political Affairs, a Jewish-Dem organization. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, one of several Democratic politicians being considered as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, joked about reports of other vice presidential contenders cancelling events over the coming days ahead of Harris’ expected decision. In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Pritzker confirmed that “people have called to talk to me about the possibility of being the vice presidential candidate,” and he acknowledged reports of other candidates clearing their schedules this weekend as the vice presidential decision draws closer. The Harris campaign has announced that her running mate will make their first public appearance at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. “Lollapalooza is happening this weekend here in Chicago, and my kids and, I mean, tens of thousands of others are going to be there,” Pritzker said, referring to the popular music festival in his home state that began Thursday. “I’ve heard other governors talk about how they’ve cancelled their weekend plans. I was going to perform, of course, with Blink-182 on Sunday, but I’ve cancelled in order to clear my schedule,” he said. A Pritzker spokesperson told CNN he does not have any planned public appearances this weekend. The governor’s comments come after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg scrapped some plans they had been slated to attend this weekend. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is set to go on a swing state tour next week with her running mate. But she has yet to announce who that will be. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro had been scheduled to do a series of donor and fundraising events in New York this weekend, including in the Hamptons, but those have now been canceled, two people informed of the plans tell CNN. Shapiro has had multiple meetings with Harris aides who are leading the vetting process. Another possible running mate, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has also changed some of his plans. A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told media on Thursday that a roadway safety roundtable Buttigieg was slated to attend Friday afternoon was canceled “due to some unforeseen scheduling constraints.” Meanwhile, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker had initial and follow-up running mate vetting interviews with aides, a person familiar with the process told CNN. Both interviews were conducted virtually, with the second one taking place on Wednesday. CNN’s Donald Judd and Alison Main contributed to this report. This post has been updated with additional reporting. Voting to officially make Vice President Kamala Harris the Democratic Party’s nominee for president began earlier today, with the party’s roughly 4,700 delegates receiving digital ballots.  Delegates have until 6 p.m. ET on Monday to return their ballots.  There isn’t much suspense over the outcome of the vote. Harris is the only name on the ballot, as she was the only candidate to a gather the necessary number of signatures from delegates.  The party announced Tuesday that 3,923 delegates had petitioned for Harris, or 99% of those who participated in the process. No other candidate met the 300-signature threshold to qualify for the ballot.  After Harris is officially the nominee, party rules allow her to name her running mate without a separate vote.  Democrats are nominating Harris ahead of their convention in Chicago later this month to avoid potential litigation over ballot access, especially in Ohio.  While the official voting is happening virtually, delegates will have a ceremonial roll call at the convention, which begins August 19. Vice President Kamala Harris gave solemn remarks on Thursday’s historic prisoner swap, nodding to her work with President Joe Biden on the release of wrongfully detained Americans Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva and US permanent resident Vladimir Kara-Murza. Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said that it was “my honor to work alongside our president, Joe Biden, to bring home more than 70 Americans in the last three-and-a-half years.” “Today, in spite of all of their suffering, it gives me great comfort to know that their horrible ordeal is finally over,” she told reporters on a tarmac as she prepared to depart Houston for Washington, where she is expected to meet with the freed Americans later Thursday.  “Over many years, President Biden and I and our team have engaged in complex, diplomatic negotiations to bring wrongfully detained Americans home. We never stopped fighting for their release,” she added. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren downplayed Vice President Kamala Harris’ shift to the middle on key policy issues in an interview with CNN on Thursday. “She’s her own person. She’s going to figure out her views around fracking and other issues,” Warren said. In the past, Harris had indicated that she supported “Medicare for All” and banning fracking, but her campaign has since said her position has changed on those issues.  “But at the end of the day, I’ve watched her year after year after year on issue after issue after issue show up for working families and fight back against the giant banks, fight back against Wall Street, fight back against the Republicans and their donors in order to stand up for those working families,” Warren continued. “So, I’m really excited about the fact that I think Kamala Harris is going to pull us together. She’s going to take on Donald Trump, toe to toe, and she’s going to win,” she added. The Trump campaign said Thursday it and authorized committees raised $138.7 million in July for former President Donald Trump’s reelection effort and that it now has $327 million cash on hand. Context: Trump’s total is a jump from June when the former president’s campaign and aligned committees reported bringing in nearly $112 million, but the July total is expected to be dwarfed by the fundraising haul of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.  Harris’ campaign and affiliated committees have not yet released full July fundraising numbers, but her campaign has said it collected an eye-popping $200 million in roughly the first week of her candidacy. This post has been updated with additional details. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Thursday defended Donald Trump’s false comments about Kamala Harris’ racial identity, saying that it was “totally reasonable” for his ticket mate to describe the vice president as someone who “pretends to be somebody different, depending on the audience she’s talking to.” The Ohio senator’s comments, in an interview with CNN’s Steve Contorno, came the day after Trump said at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention that Harris – the biracial daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father who both immigrated to the United States — “happened to turn Black” in recent years. Vance, who is the father of three biracial children, said Trump’s comments “don’t give me pause at all.” “Look, all he said is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon,” said Vance, who was on a visit to the US-Mexico in Cochise County, Arizona. Read more here. Vice President Kamal Harris stepped into the role of “consoler-in-chief” at the celebration of life service for the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee on Thursday, praising her legacy of service, dedication to the people she served and their friendship. When recognizing Jackson Lee’s efforts in designating Juneteenth as a federal holiday, Harris accidentally referred to herself as “president” before quickly correcting to say “vice president.” Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for the presidential ballot in Colorado, the state’s elections office announced on Thursday. In July, Kennedy’s campaign submitted more than 30,000 signatures to the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. The secretary of state’s office said in a press release that of the signatures submitted by the campaign, 21,702 signatures were deemed valid. Independent presidential candidates are required to submit 12,000 valid signatures to appear on the state’s ballot. Kennedy’s campaign submitted signatures to qualify him as an independent candidate despite his having received the endorsement of the Libertarian Party of Colorado, which said it planned to nominate Kennedy on its party line in Colorado. Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver has also said he will submit paperwork to fill the Libertarian party line in the state. Kennedy has also gained ballot access in 12 other states: New Mexico, Tennessee, Minnesota, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Nebraska, North Carolina, Michigan, Hawaii and Utah. That means Kennedy is eligible to receive 155 electoral college votes. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday called for the Biden administration to provide details of the prisoner swap that resulted in Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Whelan and others being released as part of the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since the Cold War.  The swap involved 24 detainees and seven countries, and Turkey said it played a mediator role. A host of Russian dissidents were also freed and Moscow also got a convicted Russian assassin who had been jailed in Germany. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Thursday toured the US southern border in Arizona, using the opportunity to blame Vice President Kamala Harris for what he called the “crazy border mess” and the Biden administration’s border policies. During his brief remarks, Vance did not mention President Joe Biden by name but repeatedly railed against the “Harris administration.” He blamed Harris for having “kept those promises to open” the border, stopping deportation on “day one,” and halting construction on the border wall. He derided the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration and border security policies as “terrible and idiotic” and argued that the policies “cause real human beings to suffer.” Mentioning his own mother’s struggle with drug addiction, Vance accused Harris of allowing fentanyl to cross into the US. He also falsely referred to Harris as “border czar.” Vice President Kamala Harris praised the multinational prisoner swap with Russia, saying it gives her “great comfort” to know the released prisoners will soon be reunited with their loved ones. Four American citizens or residents were released as part of the complex prisoner exchange between Russia, the US and other Western nations: Wall Street reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Whelan, Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and Russian opposition politician and human rights defender Vladimir Kara-Murza. Harris is in Houston today to deliver the eulogy at a service for Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. A New York appeals court has rejected Donald Trump’s attempt to lift a gag order that continues to restrict the former president’s public statements in the wake of his New York criminal conviction. As it stands, the gag order bars Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, from publicly discussing the prosecutors, court staff and their families. Judge Juan Merchan had previously lifted parts of the gag order after Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records, allowing him to discuss trial witnesses and the jury. Read more here. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Thursday that the prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia and other Western nations was made possible because “Donald Trump’s about to be back in office.” In an interview with CNN’s Steve Contorno, Vance said the prisoner exchange was “great news, at least what little we know.” “We certainly want these Americans to come back home. It was ridiculous that they were in prison to begin with,” Vance said in the interview, which followed his visit to the US-Mexico border Thursday morning in Cochise County, Arizona. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis would not say if JD Vance was the right pick to be former President Donald Trump’s running mate. Pressed on whether Vance, a first-term Ohio senator, was a good candidate, Tillis replied: “I know JD well. I’ve gotten to know him pretty well over the past couple of years. I think he’s a smart guy. I think that the Biden – or the Trump campaign picked him for a reason. I’m behind the ticket.” Tillis’s comments come as Vance has hit some bumps in his first several weeks as the Republican vice presidential nominee.  CNN reported earlier Thursday that Vance has a more active calendar going forward, as he looks to make a second pass at introducing himself to voters following an uneven rollout. The value of Donald Trump’s stake in the corporate owner of Truth Social has dropped by $800 million since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the race for the White House on July 21. Trump Media & Technology Group’s share price has tumbled by about 20% since then. The value of Trump’s dominant stake in the conservative social media company stood at just over $4 billion as of July 19, the final trading day before President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed Harris. It has since dropped to about $3.2 billion. The selloff comes as national and battleground polls indicate a tight matchup between Trump and Harris. The stock has become a vehicle for Wall Street traders to bet on the prospects of Trump returning to the White House, as Truth Social could become the platform for presidential communications if Trump wins. Read more here. Donald Trump’s campaign is deploying its top Black surrogates to span the airwaves Thursday, a senior Trump adviser told CNN, following the former president’s controversial and false claims regarding Vice President Kamala Harris’ heritage during a panel conversation at the National Association of Black Journalists convention a day prior. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and the campaign’s director of Black media, Janiyah Thomas, are all expected to do television interviews on Thursday, the adviser said. Trump himself has continued to double down on his Wednesday remarks, sharing a series of posts to social media questioning and mocking Harris’ identity.  The former president shared a photo Thursday of Harris — whose father is from Jamaica and mother was from India — wearing a sari in a family photo, writing on Truth Social: “Thank you Kamala for the nice picture you sent from many years ago! Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian Heritage are very much appreciated.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has already spent more than $1 million airing its first TV ad as she hits the ground running and works to reintroduce herself to voters, booking about $6.5 million worth of ad time this week across key battleground states. Harris’ campaign and allied Democrats have also poured more than $20 million into digital advertising efforts since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, a strategic investment that has contributed to Harris’ massive $200 million haul during her first week as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Including all campaigns, allied committees, and outside groups, Democrats have roughly doubled Republicans’ ad spending, about $50.6 million to about $25 million, since Biden dropped out. Meanwhile, with the political landscape shifting underneath former President Donald Trump, his presidential campaign is ramping up its ad spending, booking more than $7 million worth of ad time this week and next — each more than the campaign has spent on ads all year. Overall, including all presidential ad spending to date – past spending and future reservations, primary campaigns and outside groups, from both parties – ad spending on the 2024 presidential election now totals more than $1.1 billion. Former President Donald Trump’s rant about likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ racial identity, headlined by the false and offensive claim that the first Black woman elected vice president “happened to turn Black” only recently as an act of political expedience, kicked off a fresh yet disturbingly familiar chapter in this increasingly bitter presidential campaign. After President Joe Biden announced that he would stand down and effectively pass the Democratic nomination to Harris, Trump’s rivals – and some of his supporters – wondered aloud how a man with a history of making racist and sexist remarks would handle running against a Black woman. His appearances and social media posts Wednesday made that answer clear. The questions for the coming days and weeks are more fraught. What will Trump – a leader of the racist “birther” conspiracy movement against former President Barack Obama, who saw “very fine people” among the neo-Nazis and White supremacists who marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 – say or do if Harris maintains or even accelerates the momentum driving her candidacy? Read more here. JD Vance is making a second pass at introducing himself to America as the Ohio senator faces questions on whether he was the best choice for former President Donald Trump’s running mate after his past comments came to light. Simply put, the plan to get past this stretch is more Vance, not less, and the vice presidential nominee’s days have been filled with visits to battleground states. He spoke at a campaign rally in Nevada on Tuesday and another in Arizona on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, he is scheduled to go to the US-Mexico border, a regular campaign pilgrimage for Republicans. He will also appear in Georgia with Trump on Saturday. There are plans for Vance to sit for a series of interviews with conservative and mainstream media outlets, according to people with knowledge of his upcoming schedule. The Trump campaign also hopes to capitalize on the generational contrast Vance brings to the race — he turns 40 on Friday — by having him appear on longer-form podcasts and digital shows that target younger audiences. Vance is also expected to begin holding news conferences with reporters as early as this week, a source said. And he will be tasked as the campaign’s policy attack dog, a role he embraced Tuesday as he stumped across Nevada trashing Vice President Kamala Harris’ past immigration stances and tying her to the current administration’s recent battles with inflation.  Harris, meanwhile, is set to travel to several battlegrounds next week with her running mate, whom she is expected to announce in the coming days. Read more here. Following a series of personal attacks hurled by Donald Trump on Kamala Harris, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu told CNN that his advice to the former president would be to focus on the “issues that Americans care about.” Sununu, who is not seeking reelection this year, added that if Trump continues his current rhetoric, which the former president’s surrogates have adopted, “you’re gonna hand something over to Vice President Harris, who, frankly, hasn’t earned it on the issues.” Sununu’s comments on CNN follow an op-ed published Thursday in The New York Times in which he stressed that “any time spent on personal attacks or distracting rhetoric is not just time wasted, it’s time lost.” The governor also told CNN that Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, could effectively connect with voters by sharing his personal story instead of adopting Trump’s attacks. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock slammed former President Donald Trump for the remarks he made about Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity on Wednesday during a panel discussion at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago. Earlier Wednesday, the former president questioned Harris’ Black identity, falsely claiming that until recently she only promoted her Asian Indian heritage. As CNN’s Daniel Dale fact-checked following Trump’s remarks, Harris — a graduate of Howard University, a historically Black institution — has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her Indian heritage. Warnock defended Harris on “Laura Coates Lives,” saying Trump “doesn’t even recognize the sad irony of his remark.” He added that “Harris’ story is an iteration of the American story.” When asked if the former president was fixated on what Harris is, as opposed to what she stands for, the senator said Trump “has no agenda” or vision. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is in Houston today to deliver the eulogy at a service for longtime Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, will travel to several swing states next week alongside her running mate, whom she is expected to announce in the coming days. Here is the presidential nominee’s schedule for next week, as shared by her campaign: Tuesday: Evening stop in Philadelphia. Wednesday: Afternoon appearance in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, followed by a rally in Detroit, Michigan, that evening. Thursday: Evening stop in Research Triangle, North Carolina, an area between Raleigh and Durham. Friday: Afternoon event in Savannah, Georgia, followed by an evening appearance in Phoenix, Arizona. Saturday: Afternoon stop in Las Vegas."
Vance defends Trump over former president’s false claims about Harris’ racial identity | CNN Politics,"Published 4:00 PM EDT, Thu August 1, 2024",2024-08-01T20:00:14.596Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/chameleon-trump-vance-harris-ethnicity/index.html,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Thursday defended Donald Trump’s false comments about Kamala Harris’ racial identity, saying that it was “totally reasonable” for his ticket mate to describe the vice president as someone who “pretends to be somebody different, depending on the audience she’s talking to.” The Ohio senator’s comments, in an interview with CNN’s Steve Contorno, came the day after Trump said at the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention that Harris – the biracial daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father who both immigrated to the United States — “happened to turn Black” in recent years. Vance, who is the father of three biracial children, said Trump’s comments “don’t give me pause at all.” “Look, all he said is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon,” said Vance, who was on a visit to the US-Mexico in Cochise County, Arizona. Vance said Harris was “raised in Canada” – she spent her teenage years in Montreal, where her mother had moved for work – and claimed the vice president used “a fake Southern accent” earlier this week while campaigning in Atlanta before a largely Black crowd in the battleground state. “She is everything to everybody, and she pretends to be somebody different depending on which audience she is in front of. I think it’s totally reasonable for the president to call that out, and that’s all he did,” Vance said. A spokesperson for Harris’ campaign responded to Vance’s remarks by calling him “the most unpopular Vice Presidential nominee in history.” “JD Vance and Donald Trump are trafficking in hatred and lies to divide the American people, because with no positive vision to move our country forward, all they can do is drag us back,” spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. Trump ignited a political controversy, and potentially endangered his campaign’s efforts to make inroads with non-White voters, with his answer Wednesday to a question at the NABJ convention about whether he agreed with Republicans on Capitol Hill who have described Harris as a “DEI hire” – the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said. Trump’s remarks are false – Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, and attended the historically Black Howard University in Washington, has never downplayed her racial identity. They are also reminiscent of his similar attacks on Black political rivals in the past, including the years he spent pushing the false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Harris, in a Wednesday night speech at a Black sorority gathering in Houston, responded to Trump’s remarks, saying that “it was the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect. Let me just say, the American people deserve better.” Previously, Vance was a harsh critic of Trump, whom he once called a “moral disaster” and “reprehensible,” and accused of campaigning using racist rhetoric. The Ohio Republican has also changed his positions on other issues: In emails with a former law school friend a decade ago, Vance said he hated the police – which is at odds with his vocal support for police now. Asked by CNN if he, too, would be a chameleon by his own definition, Vance said Harris has not explained her reversals on policy stances she took in 2019, as a candidate for president. He said Harris should “explain why she wanted to ban fracking and now she doesn’t, or why she wanted to defund the police and now she doesn’t, or why she wanted to open the border but now she doesn’t.” “It’s reasonable to change your mind,” Vance said. “It’s not reasonable to run and hide from the media and not answer the American people’s questions.” In the interview, Vance also defended Trump after the former president did not directly answer a question at the NABJ convention about whether the Ohio senator was ready to be president. Trump said voters generally cast their ballots based on the top of the ticket, not the vice presidential pick. “I’m absolutely ready to be president on Day One,” he said. “I’ve been a businessman, I’ve been a United States Marine, I’ve been a senator. I can do the job. But politically, he’s just right. People are voting for Donald Trump.” Vance credited Trump – not the Biden administration – for the prisoner swap between the United States, several other Western nations and Russia that freed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan, among others, from Russian prisons. Vance said the exchange was “great news, at least what little we know.” “We certainly want these Americans to come back home. It was ridiculous that they were in prison to begin with,” Vance said. “But we have to ask ourselves, why are they coming home?” he said. “And I think it’s because bad guys all over the world recognize Donald Trump’s about to be back in office, so they’re cleaning house. That’s a good thing, and I think it’s a testament to Donald Trump’s strength.” Vance criticized how the Biden administration has handled border security as he visited the US-Mexico border in Arizona on Thursday. He and Trump have highlighted Harris’ task of addressing the root causes of migration in Central America – calling her Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has disputed. Harris’ work on the border dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden entrusted the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America, seeing the assignment as a sign of respect, having done the same job himself under Obama. Harris, meanwhile, has lambasted Trump for opposing a bipartisan immigration and border security measure that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory – leading Republicans on Capitol Hill to oppose that bill. Vance said the bill “was actually a massive giveaway to illegal immigrants. It would not have solved any of the problems that Kamala Harris has caused.” He said the Biden administration should instead take executive action. “They have the tools necessary,” Vance said. “They just need to empower Border Patrol to tell people who want to come in illegally, ‘You’re not allowed to do that.’ They just need to use the authority that the border czar, Kamala Harris, has.”"
Trump’s net worth has plunged $900 million since Harris entered the race for the White House | CNN Business,"Updated 2:32 PM EDT, Thu August 1, 2024",2024-08-01T15:01:24.341Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/investing/trump-net-worth-harris-truth-social/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump’s social media fortune is shrinking. The value of Trump’s stake in the corporate owner of Truth Social has dropped by $900 million since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the race for the White House on July 21. Trump Media & Technology Group’s share price has tumbled by about 23% since then, including another sharp drop on Thursday amid a broader market selloff. The value of Trump’s dominant stake in the conservative social media company stood at just over $4 billion as of July 19, the final trading day before President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed Harris. It has since dropped to about $3.1 billion. The selloff comes as national and battleground polls indicate a tight matchup between Trump and Harris. The stock has become a vehicle for Wall Street traders to bet on the prospects of Trump returning to the White House, as Truth Social could become the platform for presidential communications if Trump wins. In June, Trump Media’s share price briefly popped following Biden’s disastrous debate performance. The stock spiked again last month after Trump survived an attempted assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. At the same time, Trump’s Truth Social struggles to gain traction in the social media world. In June, Truth Social’s unique visitors tumbled by 38% year-over-year, marking the platform’s third straight month of declines, according to Comscore data analyzed by TheRighting. Trump Media’s share price has experienced extreme turbulence since going public in late March. Experts have said Trump Media amounts to a meme stock, trading on hype and momentum instead of fundamentals. Trump is the dominant figure in the company, owning 114.75 million shares, serving as its chairman and the most popular user on Truth Social. Trump’s net worth is estimated at $5.9 billion by Bloomberg. Even after the recent selloff, Trump Media is still valued at $5.1 billion. Some experts have warned the company is drastically overvalued because it makes very little revenue and Truth Social remains a tiny player in social media. For context, Trump Media’s market value is still more than twice the $2.2 billion of JetBlue. That’s despite the fact that JetBlue generated 2,300 times more revenue last year than Trump Media’s paltry $4.1 million."
Trump’s comments about Harris’ race kicks off a new – yet familiar – chapter in the 2024 presidential campaign | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:36 AM EDT, Thu August 1, 2024",2024-08-01T13:51:26.824Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/nabj-trump-harris-analysis/index.html,"Meet the new Donald Trump, same as the old Donald Trump. The former president’s rant about likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ racial identity, headlined by the false and offensive claim that the first Black woman elected vice president “happened to turn Black” only recently, as an act of political expedience, kicked off a fresh yet disturbingly familiar chapter in this increasingly bitter presidential campaign. Not three weeks ago, Trump and some hopeful allies suggested that his narrow escape from a would-be assassin’s bullet would set about a renaissance in the 78-year-old’s worldview. In his scripted remarks at the Republican convention a few days later, Trump declared, “The discord and division in our society must be healed.” That high-minded rhetoric lasted a few minutes. Ditching the teleprompter and diving back into his typical fare, the GOP nominee delivered a historically long and often petty acceptance speech. Wednesday’s interview-turned-confrontation with reporters at a convention of Black journalists in Chicago made perfectly clear that nothing has changed. Alongside his comments about Harris, Trump berated one of the journalists onstage, ABC News senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, and belittled his own running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, saying his pick was unlikely to “have any impact” on the election. After President Joe Biden announced, 10 days earlier, that he would stand down and effectively pass the Democratic nomination to Harris, Trump’s rivals – and some of his supporters – wondered aloud how a man with a history of making racist and sexist remarks would handle running against a Black woman. His appearances Wednesday made that answer clear. Trump’s social media posts and remarks at a Wednesday night rally in central Pennsylvania, where the crowd roared in anger at the mention of Obama, doubled down on his comments from Chicago. “Crazy Kamala is saying she’s Indian, not Black. This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Alina Habba, a Trump lawyer who introduced him in Harrisburg, gave another, unsavory taste of what’s to come. “Unlike you, Kamala,” she said, boisterously mispronouncing the vice president’s name. “I know who my roots are and where I come from.” The questions for the coming days and weeks are more fraught. What will Trump – a leader of the racist “birther” conspiracy movement against former President Barack Obama and someone who saw “very fine people” among the neo-Nazis and White supremacists who marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 – say or do if Harris maintains or even accelerates the momentum driving her candidacy. Harris – the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother who was raised in Oakland and attended a historically Black university – would be the first woman, the first woman of color, the first Black woman and the first Indian American elected president if she triumphs in November. She first responded to Trump’s remarks with a blistering statement from her spokesman, who described the episode as “a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump’s MAGA rallies this entire campaign.” The candidate, addressing a historically Black sorority event in Houston hours after Trump comments on the panel, ticked off her usual talking points from the top. Then, with a wry smile, she pivoted to her highly anticipated rejoinder. “This afternoon,” she said, pausing to let the buzz heighten, “Donald Trump spoke at the annual meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists and it was the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect. Let me just say, the American people deserve better.” She continued, “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us. They are an essential source of our strength.” Moments later, Harris was back on message, warning of a “full-on attack on hard fought hard won fundamental freedoms and rights” by Trump-aligned Republicans, who have danced around questions but not uniformly rejected a federal abortion ban. (Trump has said the decision, per the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, should be made by the states.) Harris speaks more – and more comfortably – about abortion rights than Biden before her. With 96 days until the election, she is poised to press Democrats’ advantage on that issue and, if Wednesday night’s remarks were any indication, mostly leave Trump to his own devices. Other Democrats, including Harris’ husband, the second gentleman Doug Emhoff, offered harsher verdicts. Trump’s remarks, he told donors in Maine Wednesday, put on display “a worse version of an already horrible person.” But he also cautioned against focusing too narrowly on the former president’s words. “We can’t get distracted by Hannibal Lecter,” Emhoff said of Trump, according to the Washington Post. “Even the insults hurled at myself and my wife … that’s to distract us and get us talking about that.” Harris supporters, led by a handful of potential running mates, praised the tone and content of her response. “This guy (Trump) is a homophobe, a xenophobe, he’s a racist and misogynist. But here was just a perfect example of it for the American public to see,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker told CNN’s Anderson Cooper late Wednesday. Harris “doesn’t need to take him on directly. The rest of us can see it for ourselves and we’re going to talk about it.” Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, one of the leading contenders to be her vice presidential pick, told reporters on Capitol Hill that Trump’s comments in Chicago were those ”of a desperate, scared old man who is, over the last week, especially, is having his butt kicked by an experienced prosecutor.” “He’s done this before, he’s not going to change,” Kelly said of Trump. “Pretty obvious to me why he’s doing this.” Meanwhile, Vance, less than two weeks after officially becoming the GOP vice presidential nominee, defended his new boss, telling supporters at a rally in Arizona that Harris is a “phony” who “caters to whatever audience is in front of her.” “President Trump showed up and took some tough questions (at the NABJ event),” Vance said. “The press, however, treated him the same way they have since he came down that escalator in 2015. They were rude. They cut him off. And they didn’t want to hear – much less report – the truth.” To that point, the ultimately abbreviated interview was broadcast live, and the questions posed to Trump were lean, direct and fairly simple. His reaction – his attack on Harris – was largely unprompted and strayed from the reporters’ line of questioning. Trump went where he went by choice, on his own. Like Vance, Trump-friendly Republicans on Capitol Hill blamed the media. Asked for his take, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio held up a screenshot of an Associated Press article headlined, “California’s Kamala Harris becomes first Indian-American US senator,” before insisting he’s heard Harris identify “multiple times” as Indian-American, not as Black. “I don’t care what someone’s background is,” Rubio added. “I care about the fact that she’s a leftist.” Others, while stopping short of condemning Trump’s lie, sought to nudge him in a similar direction. North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer took a different tack, dismissing Trump’s remarks as “satire,” but also suggesting  it was “not wise” politically to raise the issue. “It was President Biden who referenced her racial identity when he nominated her,” Cramer said. “I mean, that was said, that’s the reason. He promised he’s gonna have a woman of color.” Biden pledged to choose a woman as his running mate in 2020, not a woman of color. But that, of course, is what he did. Whether Trump can channel his disdain for Harris into other, less noxious lines of attack is, just a few months out from the voting, an open question. How voters react is a better, more important one."
Donald Trump falsely suggests Kamala Harris ‘happened to turn Black’ | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:03 PM EDT, Wed July 31, 2024",2024-07-31T18:52:13.165Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his 2024 Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, “happened to turn Black” a few years ago, saying that “all of a sudden, she made a turn” in her identity. Trump’s comments at a gathering of Black journalists in Chicago came when an interviewer asked him whether he agreed with Republicans on Capitol Hill who have characterized Harris as a “DEI hire.” Trump responded by questioning Harris’ heritage. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said. “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a Black person,” he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. “I think somebody should look into that too.” Later Wednesday, speaking in Houston at a gathering of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, Harris described the former president’s comments as “the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect.” “Let me just say, the American people deserve better,” she said. Trump’s comments are reminiscent of his similar attacks on Black political rivals in the past, including the years he spent pushing the false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Harris’ mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. Harris was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically Black university, Howard University, in Washington. She is the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. Trump on Wednesday was interviewed by a panel that included ABC News’ Rachel Scott, Semafor’s Kadia Goba and Fox News’ Harris Faulkner. Scott began the interview by asking Trump: “You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have told four congresswomen of color, who were American citizens, to go back to where they came from. You have used words like ‘animal’ and ‘rabid’ to describe Black district attorneys. You have attacked Black journalists, calling them a ‘loser,’ saying the questions they ask are, quote, ‘stupid’ and ‘racist.’ You’ve had dinner with a White supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. So my question, sir – now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?” A combative Trump responded: “Well, first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question so – in such a horrible manner, first question. You don’t even say, ‘Hello. How are you?’” He asked Scott if she was with ABC, saying the network was “a fake news network” and “a terrible network.” “I think it’s disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country. I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country, including employment, including opportunity zones with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina,” the former president said. “I’ve done so much, and, you know, I say this: Historically Black colleges and universities were out of money, they were stone cold broke, and I saved them. I gave them long-term financing, and nobody else was doing it.” “It’s a very rude introduction. I don’t know exactly why you would do something like that,” Trump said. Scott asked if Trump found it acceptable that some Republicans on Capitol Hill have referred to Harris as a “DEI hire” – using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. “I really don’t know. Could be. Could be,” he said. Harris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, said Wednesday that Trump’s remarks in Chicago reflected “a worse version of an already horrible person.” “The insults, the B.S. – it’s horrible, it’s terrible, it shows a lack of character – but it’s a distraction,” Emhoff said at a campaign fundraiser in Maine, according to The Washington Post. “It’s about what’s at stake in this election.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre issued a fiery rejoinder to Trump following his remarks at the convention, calling them “repulsive” and “insulting.” “As a person of color – as a Black woman, who is in this position that is standing before you at this podium, behind this lectern – what he just said, what you just read out to me, is repulsive. It’s insulting, and, you know, no one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify,” Jean-Pierre told reporters during a news briefing Wednesday. “That is no one’s right. It is someone’s own decision.” Harris’ campaign did not specifically respond to Trump’s comment about her racial identity but said the former president “lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency.” “Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us,” Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said in a statement. In Chicago on Wednesday, Trump also repeatedly criticized the NABJ for the event’s set-up, which he said made it difficult to hear other panelists and delayed the start of the event. A spokesperson for NABJ told CNN that technology issues had delayed the start of the panel discussion. Trump in his remarks called himself “the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,” a comment that drew audible groans from the journalists in attendance. He ignored a follow-up question about whether he was better than Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. “I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,” he said. “For you to start off a question-and-answer period, especially when you’re 35 minutes late because you couldn’t get your equipment to work, I think it’s a disgrace. I really do, I think it’s a disgrace.” Asked by Scott Wednesday if he would pardon January 6 rioters who violently attacked police officers at the US Capitol in 2021, Trump said, “Absolutely, I would.” “If they’re innocent, I would pardon them,” he said. Scott responded that they had been convicted. “Well, they were convicted by a very tough system,” Trump said. The former president criticized Capitol police officers for shooting and killing rioter Ashli Babbitt, who was attempting to crawl through a broken window leading to the Speaker’s Lobby outside the US House chamber. And he complained that “nothing happened” to those who caused property damage during Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. “Nothing happens to those people, but you went after the J6 people with a vengeance,” Trump said. Trump did not answer directly when asked by Fox News’ Faulkner whether his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, would be “ready on Day One to be president. “Historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact – I mean, virtually no impact,” Trump said. “You have two or three days where there’s a lot of commotion,” he said, pointing to Harris’ consideration of a running mate, “and then that dies down, and it’s all about the presidential pick. Virtually never has it mattered.” “You can have a vice president who’s outstanding in every way, and I think JD is … but you’re not voting that way. You’re voting for the president,” Trump said.

CORRECTION: This story and headline have been updated to correctly reflect Trump’s exact wording of one quote at the NABJ convention in Chicago."
Fact check: Trump’s lie that Harris ‘all of a sudden’ embraced a Black identity | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:25 PM EDT, Wed July 31, 2024",2024-07-31T22:14:09.335Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/fact-check-debunking-trumps-lie-that-harris-suddenly-embraced-a-black-identity/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew gasps on Wednesday when he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had suddenly adopted a Black identity. Harris’ father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. Trump claimed: “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian, or is she Black?” As one of the journalists who was interviewing Trump on stage tried to tell him that Harris had always identified as Black and had attended a historically Black college, Trump continued, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she went – she became a Black person. And I think somebody should look into that, too.” Trump’s comments prompted immediate bipartisan criticism. Leaving aside the issue of the appropriateness of the remarks, his claims are just not true. Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. Harris did not “all of a sudden” begin identifying as Black. She has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her South Asian heritage. Harris graduated in 1986 from Howard University, a historically Black institution where she was a member of a historically Black sorority. After that, she was elected president of the association of Black law students in her second year at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, she wrote in her 2019 memoir. Politico reported in 2021 that, as a third-year student at the law school in 1989, Harris rose to speak against anti-Black racism at a campus demonstration prompted by the discovery of racist vandalism. Politico reported: “For Black students, she said, according to archives of the Hastings Law News, the cartoon was an example of ‘what we deal with all the time.’” A profile of Harris in the publication AsianWeek in 2003, when she was running for San Francisco district attorney, was focused on her South Asian heritage. But it quoted Harris discussing her father as “a Black man” and saying, “I grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community. All my friends were Black and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt uncomfortable with my cultural background.” Harris’ official online biography in 2005 as San Francisco district attorney referred to her as “the first African American woman in California to hold the office” and noted that she had attended “America’s oldest black university.” She wrote in a 2009 book about her childhood trips to both India and Jamaica, where, she wrote, “my father and uncles would talk to us about the complicated struggles of the people of Jamaica - the history of slavery, colonialism, and immigration.” Her official online biography as California attorney general referred to her as “the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office” of San Francisco district attorney. In 2017, her first year as a US senator for California, she spoke about how she was “the second Black woman elected to the United States Senate.” Harris wrote in the 2019 memoir about how her mother’s family instilled her and her sister Maya with “pride in our South Asian roots,” but also that “my mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.” Harris said in another 2017 speech: “Look at my own life, where a daughter of a South Asian mother and a Jamaican father concluded her own interfaith wedding with her husband breaking a glass and everyone yelling, ‘Mazel tov.’” Trump made numerous other false claims in his remarks at the Wednesday gathering.
Among other claims we have fact-checked before, Trump: - Wrongly referred to Harris as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” Her actual immigration-related assignment from Biden, to lead a diplomatic effort to tackle “root causes” of migration in three Central American countries, was much more limited. - Falsely claimed that the US has its worst inflation in “over 100 years.” Even at its 9.1% peak during the Biden presidency, inflation was at about a 41-year high, and it has since plummeted to 3%. - Falsely claimed he was “protected” under the Presidential Records Act for taking official documents after his presidency. That law actually requires presidents to return all documents to the federal government when they leave office. - Falsely claimed that “everybody,” including Democrats, wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the issue of abortion policy returned to individual states. In fact, polls have consistently shown about two-thirds of the public as a whole and an even higher percentage of Democrats had wanted Roe to be preserved. - Repeated his never-substantiated claim about foreign countries opening up their prisons to allow criminals to migrate to the US. - Falsely claimed that Haris “didn’t pass” the bar exam. Harris failed on her first attempt, which is common in California, but then passed; she was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school. (Trump, appearing to respond to an objection from someone in the crowd, conceded a bit later that Harris “maybe” had passed.) - Falsely claimed that “nobody died” on January 6, 2021. Four Trump supporters at the Capitol died that day, three from medical emergencies and one after she was shot by police while trying to break into a sensitive part of the building. (Trump mentioned the shooting right before he claimed nobody died.) In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.” CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, Em Steck and Julie In contributed to this article."
Look of the Week: Megan Thee Stallion and Kamala Harris serve the power pantsuit two ways | CNN,"Published 2:12 PM EDT, Wed July 31, 2024",2024-07-31T18:12:10.736Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/style/megan-thee-stallion-kamala-harris-pantsuit-lotw/index.html,"Two suits, two women, one message: “Hotties for Harris.” At least that was the phrase scrawled across banners at Kamala Harris’ campaign rally in Atlanta Tuesday night. The event — part of Harris’s bid to secure the Democratic presidential nomination — was headlined with a performance from rapper Megan Thee Stallion, 29, whose fans nickname themselves “hotties,” after the chart-topping 2019 track “Hot Girl Summer.” The three-time Grammy winner arrived on stage to perform in a pair of second-skin cobalt flares, a matching cropped blazer and tie by designer Abdul Sall. Underneath, her white collared shirt was similarly slashed at the midriff, exposing her gleaming belly button stud. Minutes later, Harris walked onto her podium to rapturous applause — also in a blue pantsuit. Considering Megan’s typical stage wear features thong leotards and sheer catsuits, it doesn’t take a seasoned fashion critic to pick up on the sartorial message. At first glance they might have been twinned; two women from very different corners, at the top of their respective careers, defining power dressing on their own terms. (Harris did, however, adopt some of Megan’s swagger with her challenge to Donald Trump to debate her: “If you have something to say, say it to my face.”) The choreographed spectacle was a continuation of the Harris team’s modus operandi: Meeting the Gen Z voters where they are. From being endorsed by Charli XCX and co-opting the album of the summer, “Brat,” to capitalizing on the 32.3 million-strong fandom of Megan Thee Stallion, her advisors have been honing in on the 18-27 demographic. But how do you capture the attention of younger voters without alienating your core audience? What Harris seems to be trialing is the power of association: While she remains unchanged, and stylistically understated (the New York Times’ chief fashion critic Vanessa Friedman went further, calling her a “dull” dresser, while acknowledging the double standard), her endorsers do the heavy lifting. So, if the Vice President remains set on cycling through a rotating wardrobe of near-identical neutral pantsuits eternally paired with her trusty “70-millimeter Manolo Blahnik heels,” — then perhaps Megan was a kind of proxy, doing the daredevil, eye-catching dressing for her. Megan isn’t the first musician to offer an endorsement to a presidential candidate (though Harris won’t be officially selected at the Democratic National Convention until August). During Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016, pop culture patronage was there in equal measure, from Madonna to Bon Jovi to Lady Gaga. Perhaps one the most memorable celebrity supporters of Clinton’s campaign eight years ago was Beyoncé, who made a surprise appearance during a rally in Cleveland, Ohio. The superstar arrived onstage in a polka dot Givenchy pantsuit and a black sequinned collared shirt — something one could even imagine Harris wearing for an evening engagement today. It’s hard to picture Clinton signing off on a decision to have Megan Thee Stallion “shake cheeks,” as one fan on Instagram wrote, in a cropped suit at a rally. But in the age of TikTok, outfits have to be grabbier and performances more dramatic. While it’s safe to assume Harris’ will stick to her uniform, we might expect a constellation of fearless dressers to emerge around her — lending her some of their star power, and Gen Z appeal, along the way."
Secret Service detains man for incident involving security detail for Harris’ stepdaughter | CNN Politics,"Published 1:19 PM EDT, Wed July 31, 2024",2024-07-31T17:19:43.042Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/secret-service-detail-ella-emhoff/index.html,"The US Secret Service protective detail of Vice President Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhoff was involved in an incident Tuesday in which a man caused damage to two of her protective detail’s vehicles in New York City. “On Tuesday afternoon, an individual approached two United States Secret Service vehicles parked in lower Manhattan and, without provocation, caused damage to the rear license plate area of both,” USSS spokesperson James Byrne said in a statement shared with CNN. The man was detained by USSS with New York authorities putting him in police custody. The incident comes at a moment of heightened scrutiny for the Secret Service just weeks after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump – and days after the agency’s director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the fallout. “Secret Service Agents quickly detained the individual until local authorities arrived and placed the individual into police custody,” Byrne said. “At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident.” Spokespeople for the vice president and second gentleman did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. It’s not the first incident involving a USSS protectee’s vehicle. Last November, a USSS agent on President Joe Biden’s granddaughter Naomi Biden’s security detail shot at individuals attempting to break into a US government vehicle in Georgetown."

They want to keep it that way. It’s phenomenal.” The next day, Harris said at a fundraising event in Pittsfield, Massachusetts: “He intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You guys remember what that was? It was real. Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.” Facts first: Neither Trump’s nor Harris’ claims reflect their rival’s most recent positions on health insurance. Trump most recently said he wants to improve the Affordable Care Act, not terminate it, though he promised for years that he would repeal it. Harris included a role for private insurers in the plan she released during her 2020 presidential campaign, though she had previously said she wanted to eliminate private insurance. Health insurance has been one of the most contentious issues in recent elections, both for the White House and Congress. Trump and Harris have both changed their stances on health care coverage, though neither has issued a detailed policy solution in this campaign. (Note: Harris only jumped into the race a little over a week ago when President Joe Biden announced he would not be running. She has yet to issue her policy platform.) Here’s a look at how their public positions have evolved. Let’s start with Trump’s claim that Harris wants to do away with private health insurance. At a CNN town hall in January 2019, Harris, who was then a California senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance proposal promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Harris was a co-sponsor of Sanders’ bill, which called for essentially getting rid of the private insurance market. “The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don’t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require,” Harris said at the town hall, arguing that private health insurers are motivated by profits. “Who of us has not had that situation, where you’ve got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, ‘Well, I don’t know if your insurance company is going to cover this?’ Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.” A furor erupted, and her national press secretary and an adviser quickly walked back her comment, saying she was open to multiple paths to Medicare for All. And the plan she rolled out in July 2019 included a role for private insurance. “We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.” Since she was named Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market. Harris’ campaign confirmed this week that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system. Trump has long wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, making it one of his top priorities in his 2016 presidential campaign and first term. However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House the following year, they failed to unite behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely overhaul the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare. The former president revived the debate over the law’s fate in November 2023, when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he’s “seriously looking at alternatives” and that the failure to terminate it “was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!” Some Republicans, however, were alarmed by Trump’s call, concerned that the issue is a political loser with Americans. Trump also quickly walked back his comments, posting a few days later that he doesn’t “want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE.
Obamacare Sucks!!!” In April, Trump said in a video posted to Truth Social: “I’m not running to terminate the ACA as crooked Joe Biden says all over the place. We’re going to make the ACA much better than it is right now and much less expensive for you.” However, he has yet to release a proposal on how he would make the Affordable Care Act better and less expensive. Asked for comment, Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika noted that Trump has said to never give up on terminating Obamacare. “Donald Trump, a known liar, has been clear about one thing: if he’s elected, he will repeal the Affordable Care Act, rip away health care from tens of millions of Americans, eliminate coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions like diabetes or cancer, and kick young people off their parents’ insurance – just as he tried to do multiple times the last time he was in the White House,” she said. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment."
Team USA women’s basketball squad emphasizes endorsement of Kamala Harris for president | CNN,"Updated 11:25 AM EDT, Wed July 31, 2024",2024-07-31T13:47:20.883Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/team-usa-womens-basketball-endorse-kamala-harris-spt-intl/index.html,"The head coach and players of Team USA’s women’s basketball emphasized their endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid on Wednesday. It’s the first major political statement from a top American team at this year’s Olympics and comes as the presidential race is heating up back home. Harris took over the Democratic nomination earlier this month after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection bid and endorse his No. 2. She’s now attempting to gain momentum in the race against former President Donald Trump, who is running to regain the office he lost to Biden in 2020. The players on Team USA – and the WNBA in general –have been far more willing to engage in political statements than some of their other professional sports peers. “We have been talking, especially with the social justice committee, finding a way to make sure that we can obviously back Kamala as much as we can. Because everything that we’ve been kind of working for this year … has been about voting rights, reproductive rights,” said Breanna Stewart, a power forward who plays her professional ball for the New York Liberty, on July 27. “The things she stands for, we also stand for. So making sure that we can definitely stay united and continue to push the message of registering to vote, knowing where to vote and all the resources behind it.” Women’s basketball players have had influential voices in key elections before. In 2020, the Atlanta Dream protested against their then co-owner – then Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was running for reelection against Rev. Raphael Warnock – over her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement. That race ended up going to a run-off and Warnock defeated Loeffler. He’s now serving as a senator from Georgia. “I think that’s a really important thing that our league has done through the years, using our voice as a vehicle for change, and I think no question that we would step to the plate in this scenario,” said Team USA head coach Cheryl Reeve, who also coaches the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx, on Wednesday. “I think it’s really important that we don’t go backwards as we’ve seen, some of the threats to basic human rights, the things that we care about in our league, and so I’m proud to stand with the players in this in backing Kamala Harris.” WNBA legend Diana Taurasi added Wednesday that she was thrilled to see Harris taking over the Democratic presidential ticket. Ultimately, it comes down to policy, she said. “What are you going to do for the people of America that need you? And I think there’s a big portion of us that see a lot of us in her and what she wants to do with our country,” Taurasi said. “For me, that is one of the proudest and most amazing moments, so yeah, we’re going to back her and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins and we go forward in this country in the right way.” The endorsement from the women’s Team USA comes a little less than a week after men’s star Stephen Curry said he was excited about Harris’ candidacy. Harris had visited the men’s basketball team during their training camp ahead of the Games. “If she’s on the ticket winning the election, like it’s, it’s a big, big deal to say the least and she represents the Bay Area,” Curry said last week. “She’s been a big supporter of us. And so I want to give that energy right back to her and just excited knowing, obviously, we’re representing our country here and this is a very monumental next couple of months for, for our country and the direction that we’re headed.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated with additional reporting and corrects the name of Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia."
Harris coalition takes shape with ‘new energy’ from fraying Biden alliance | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:54 AM EDT, Wed July 31, 2024",2024-07-31T04:00:02.361Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/kamala-harris-coalition-michigan-democrats/index.html,"For Charity Dean, the weight of the presidential race is suddenly a bit heavier as she moves beyond the exhaustion of a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump to a fresh start with Vice President Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic nominee. “It’s refreshing. There’s a new energy that we didn’t have previously,” said Dean, who owns a coffee shop in northwest Detroit. “Folks that were not interested in a Biden-Trump race are definitely interested now that we have the vice president on the top of the ticket.” A week after Harris secured enough delegate support to effectively lock down the Democratic nomination, the whirlwind of excitement coursing through the party is giving way to the urgent work of building a Harris coalition – after spending a year trying to shore up Biden’s fraying one. “It’s not just we have an opportunity to make history,” said Dean, who also leads the Michigan Black Business Alliance. “It’s also, ‘Oh my gosh, what happens if we don’t?’” Michigan will be a critical laboratory for how the Harris campaign builds and sustains its coalition and the degree to which it will look different from Biden’s winning 2020 alliance that he struggled to keep together this year, particularly with younger voters and voters of color. Conversations with more than two dozen voters, party activists and Democratic officials in Detroit and the surrounding communities underscored a surge in interest toward Harris among women, voters of color and younger voters. It’s an open question how her support holds among independent voters and rank-and-file labor union members, particularly as Trump and Republican groups race to define her. “Instead of having something to vote against, now we have something to vote for,” said Rev. Charles Williams, pastor of Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, who sounded the alarm months ago about a lack of enthusiasm among many voters for Biden, despite the achievements of his first term. “Pre-Joe Biden’s announcement, we were stirring molasses,” Williams said in an interview outside his church this week. “Post-Joe Biden’s announcement, we’re on a rocket ship.” Just 10 days into her presidential candidacy, Harris’ campaign is still ramping up – conducting a vice presidential vetting process on a short deadline, rewriting plans for next month’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago and beefing up advertising and fundraising teams after she raised $200 million in her first week. Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, began unleashing a fresh wave of attacks on Harris on Tuesday with a $12.2 million television advertising buy across six battleground states, including Michigan. One new ad labels Harris the Biden administration’s “border czar” and highlights her role in serving as the administration’s point person in terms of addressing the root causes of migration from Central America. “This is America’s border czar – and she’s failed us,” a narrator says over video of Harris dancing at an event. The narrator describes the vice president as “Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.” Trump won Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in 2016 – cracking the Democratic “blue wall” of must-win-states. Biden won those states back four years later. And before his exit from the race, his campaign had identified the three states as his most realistic path to securing the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win this fall. Though Harris’ appeal among women, voters of color and young people could expand the map and put in play Sun Belt battlegrounds – including, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, where Harris held a rally Tuesday night – the blue wall states are certain to be a focus for both Harris and Trump. That’s not lost on ardent supporters of the vice president like Dean, who named her coffee shop Rosa after her great-grandmother, someone who she said would be thrilled by the historic nature of Harris’ candidacy. “We have a fear in our country because we’ve seen racism and we’ve seen sexism,” Dean said. “I’ve heard a lot of comments about, well, will they vote for her? I said there is no ‘they,’ it is us. And with that confidence and with that momentum, it becomes contagious.” Though Harris’ candidacy is in its early stages, and Trump’s attacks are only beginning, some Michigan Democrats say the vice president has the opportunity to shed the skepticism many felt toward Biden. In Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary in February, more than 101,000 people – 13.2% of the primary electorate – cast their votes for “uncommitted,” rather than Biden, in what was largely seen as a show of opposition to the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. “Uncommitted” won 57% of the vote in Dearborn, home to large Arab American and Muslim communities, to Biden’s 40% – an outcome that served as a glaring warning sign in a Democratic stronghold in the must-win swing state. Though Harris will have to tread carefully over the war in Gaza to avoid undermining Biden – and her statements, choice of running mate and more will play roles in how she is judged – she could win back some voters in communities that have largely broken with Biden. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who supported the campaign to lodge “uncommitted” protest votes during the primary, said he sees a potential opening for Harris. “Wth Vice President Harris, you see a renewed spark,” Hammoud told CNN, “especially amongst a younger population, a more diverse coalition and an opportunity to rebuild that coalition that helped put President Biden over the top.” Asked whether he would support Harris and encourage others in his community to do the same, Hammoud said it was too early to say. He said he wanted to hear more from Harris – amplifying on her empathetic comments about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week – and wouldn’t likely reach a decision without a conversation with her or her foreign policy advisers. “It really falls down to the values and priorities. That has not changed for me,” he said. “I’m hopeful that Vice President Harris will chart a new course.” Here in Michigan, the contours of the new race are settling in, which Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens heard first-hand as she knocked on doors in her Oakland County district north of Detroit. A blue and white sign in bold letters, “Dump Trump,” was planted in a front yard only a few houses down from one that read, “Michigan for Trump. Make America Great Again.” “I do think you’re seeing people activated in a new way,” Stevens said. While many residents weren’t home – or didn’t answer their doors – Stevens forged ahead until she found two cars in the driveway and the lights on inside a white, two-story house. “How are you feeling about the switch from Biden to Harris?” Stevens asked. “I feel good,” replied Reuben Maxbauer, who held his young son in his arms as he answered the door. “If the last seven days are representative of the next 100 days, it will be quite the roller coaster, but very exciting.” But Maxbauer, who has family members living in Israel, said he wanted to learn more about Harris’ positions, especially on the Middle East. “I don’t think she has a clearly enough defined position, at least that we’re aware of,” he said, “that I can say whether she makes us comfortable or not.” As she continued her walk, Stevens acknowledged that is one of the lingering challenges for Harris and Democrats in Michigan – a critical balancing act of foreign policy and domestic politics. “Where we’re standing, every vote really matters Every conversation carries a lot of weight,” Stevens said. “But I’m not going to sugarcoat. There’s also still a lot of passions and tensions and emotions around the Middle East.” But in the closing three months of the race, Stevens said, Trump may end up a unifying force – for Democrats too. “I think that’s what we’ll see happen,” she said. “I really do.”"

Facts First: The viral posts are false. A source connected to Burrow, a source connected to Goff and a source connected to Jones told CNN Tuesday that each of them was not on the call. The three quarterbacks have not publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential election. Posts claiming the quarterbacks were on the pro-Harris call - or that they “reportedly” or “apparently” were on the call - generated millions of views on X. The claims also made their way to some sports websites. The claims were previously debunked Tuesday by publications including Front Office Sports. The claim about Burrow in particular had been propelled by a Harris supporter account called Kamala’s Wins, which has more than 500,000 followers. The account received more than 3.5 million views on a post Monday night claiming the Bengals star is supporting Harris and was on the call. Kamala’s Wins deleted the post Tuesday. The account, which is run anonymously, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment later in the day."
Kamala Harris has energized Democratic voters. But can she expand the map? | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:56 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T09:00:03.158Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/kamala-harris-atlanta-rally/index.html,"During the first whirlwind week of her second presidential campaign, Kamala Harris locked up the support of the Democratic Party, recruited thousands of volunteers and hauled in $200 million in donations. But the challenge over the next 98 days will be whether she can harness that energy to power electoral victories in both traditional party strongholds and the newer battlegrounds that had appeared to be slipping away under President Joe Biden. The latest test of Harris’ appeal took place Tuesday in Georgia, where she held a rally in Atlanta with nearly 10,000 attendees, according to her campaign. The vice president was joined by Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, two-time Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and rappers Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo. “I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right though this state,” Harris told the crowd. That Harris would make a high-profile visit to Georgia early in her White House bid indicates the renewed push the campaign is making in a state that’s now back in play for Democrats. Any Democratic path to victory almost certainly runs through the so-called “Blue Wall” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where polls showed a tied race between former President Donald Trump and his then-Democratic opponent, Biden, for months. But, with Harris now the party’s presumptive nominee, keeping Sun Belt states like Georgia – as well as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina – competitive could give Democrats much needed breathing room. Democrats became disillusioned months ago with the prospect of winning in Georgia, according to party strategists involved in conversations. Frustrations over inflation and the suffering in Gaza were mounting among voters, whose turnout was becoming increasingly uncertain. A mid-May commencement address by Biden at Morehouse College was marked by drama around the possibility of protests over his handling of the war in Gaza. Following the presidential debate in Atlanta in late June, Biden flew directly to North Carolina to rally voters there, a decision that sources involved suggested was rooted in the greater likelihood at that point of flipping the Tar Heel State – with its heavily college-educated, suburban voter base and growing minority population – than keeping Georgia, which he won in 2020 with a narrow majority, this year. Now, Georgia again is seen as within the party’s grasp – with a senior Democratic strategist describing Harris’s candidacy as a “defibrillator,” jolting voters back into awareness. For young people and voters of color, the strategist said, that jolt was more noticeable, and producing an expectation that Harris could engender more support among the African Americans who comprise roughly a third of Georgia’s population. But the opportunity in the state, whose former Republican lieutenant governor says is “absolutely” back in play, could extend well beyond those coalitions. “Any electoral advantage Donald Trump had has been erased,” Geoff Duncan told CNN. “The suburbs of Atlanta are back up for grabs.” In a new campaign memo shared with CNN Monday evening, Harris’ Georgia state director Porsha White outlined what the campaign hopes is a winning strategy in the state. “We turned Georgia blue for the first time in three decades in 2020, and we’re feeling the energy we need to win the state again in 2024,” White wrote. “Tomorrow, Vice President Harris’ visit will highlight her brighter vision for the future, where our freedoms are protected and every American has a fair shot. And we’re going to make the choice clear to every voter across our state.” Per the campaign, more than 7,500 volunteers have signed up in the week since Harris moved to the top of the ticket, with more than 1,000 signed up on the day after Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race. The campaign has 24 coordinated offices and 170 Democratic coordinated campaign staff across the state. Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams, who is also the chair of the state Democratic Party, told CNN her Georgia Democrats gained 1,000 volunteers and saw a more than 300% uptick in donations in the last week. “The last eight days have been a whole vibe in battleground Georgia,” Williams, who will appear at the Atlanta rally, told CNN. “We are seeing people energized and volunteering in ways that we have not seen in the past.” Early polls have shown Harris outperforming Biden against Trump with key groups within the Democratic coalition and erasing much of the popular vote lead Trump held over Biden. A Siena/New York Times poll released last week found that, in a head-to-head match up against Trump with likely voters, Hispanic voters favored Harris over the former president by a 24-point margin and voters ages 18-29 favored her by a 21-point margin. In an earlier poll released July 2, Biden held only 3- and 1-point leads with those groups, respectively, against Trump, within the margin of error. During Georgia’s 2020 election, the Biden-Harris ticket won 88% of Black voters, 62% of Latinos, 54% of women and a majority of voters ages 18-49, according to CNN exit polls. To win the state again, Harris will need a broad coalition of support from younger voters, suburban women and people of color. This will require shoring up parts of the coalition that frayed during the president’s time in office, particularly Black men. In interviews, men who attended Monday night’s gathering of the Black Man Lab – an organization that holds events for Black men to build community – in Atlanta shared mixed views on what they wanted to see from Harris. Some called on the vice president to articulate a message specifically aimed at Black men, while others pointed to the enthusiasm around her run and condemned efforts from Republicans to paint her as a DEI candidate despite her record. One participant, Mario Reyes, rejected the narrative that Black men wouldn’t vote for Harris in November. “One thing I’ve noticed for years is that Black women show up for us all the time,” Reyes said. “This is the time in which Black men are going to show up for her in big numbers, in a way that they’ve never seen before in America.” Henry Caslin, who also attended, was also skeptical of the notion of Black men drifting toward Trump, calling it a “myth.” But he said he wanted to see Harris make a unique pitch to him. “I want to hear a message for me that’s not talking to me through the language of social justice,” he said. “I would like for her to speak more to Black men.” For Democratic organizers, winning in Georgia isn’t just about keeping the White House, but maintaining hard won gains in a state that has been promising to tilt blue for years. Biden’s 2020 win in Georgia, when he beat former Trump by just under 12,000 votes, marked the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state in nearly 30 years. Weeks later, voters sent two Democratic senators – Ossoff and Warnock – to Washington. Jay Williams, a Georgia-based Republican strategist, argued that those races were unique. “At the end of the day, Georgia still is a right-leaning state,” he said. “It’s not wildly right, but it is a right-leaning state.” Despite the gains in late 2020 and early 2021, Abrams, Democrats’ gubernatorial pick, was unable to win in a 2022 rematch against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Democrats are hoping for a different outcome this November. Hillary Holley, who leads Care in Action, a group that advocates for domestic workers, said she believed the Democratic base was consolidating around Harris. “Georgia was looking for something refreshing, something new that we could bring to voters and a sense of renewed hope,” she said. “And I think that’s what we are now seeing.” LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said Harris has invested a lot of time in the state, which could help her now that she’s the presumptive nominee. But the vice president may also benefit from the work grassroots groups in the state have done to help make the state more competitive, Brown said. “I think we’re breaking up this red wall that many of us feel has created an agenda and policies that have been hurtful and harmful,” Brown said. “We have been working diligently over the last decade to actually build a real movement infrastructure.” This story has been updated with additional reporting."
"Harris goes on offensive on immigration, comparing her record with Trump’s | CNN Politics","Updated 8:34 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-31T00:07:24.127Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-immigration-trump/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris went on the offensive on immigration at her rally in Atlanta Tuesday, attempting to counter former President Donald Trump’s attacks on the issue. She touted her role as a California attorney general who prosecuted transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers, then blamed Trump for “tanking” this year’s bipartisan border bill on Capitol Hill “because he thought it would help him win an election.” “Donald Trump does not care about border security, he only cares about himself,” Harris said, adding that she would work to pass the bill as president. “In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day,” she said in a high-profile visit to Georgia that comes early in her bid and signals the campaign’s renewed push to put the state in play for Democrats. She also called on Trump to debate her, drawing loud cheers from the crowd when she said, “Because as the saying goes, if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.” The Harris campaign earlier Tuesday previewed how it will be responding to Trump’s attacks falsely casting her as the administration’s “border czar” with a new 50-second campaign video. It paints Trump as unserious on border security and cites his decision to scuttle the bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory. “Kamala Harris supports increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. Donald Trump blocked a bill to increase the number of Border Patrol agents,” the voiceover in the video states, similarly citing Harris’ support for investing in new technology to block fentanyl from entering the US. “Kamala Harris prosecuted transnational gang members and got them sentenced to prison. Trump is trying to avoid being sentenced to prison,” it continues, concluding with: “There’s two choices in this election: The one who will fix our broken immigration system and the one who is trying to stop her.” The video will be shared on social media, though it’s unclear whether the campaign will put money behind it and blast it on airwaves. It doesn’t make mention of the Republican label “border czar.” The management of the US-Mexico border had been a political liability for President Joe Biden, and it is now following Harris as Trump seizes on her task to address the root causes of migration in Central America. The video comes on the heels of two Trump campaign ads taking direct aim at Harris’ immigration portfolio. Both Trump campaign ads, released this week, pull from a 2021 NBC interview where Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn’t yet visited the US-Mexico border and she stumbled through a response by claiming she also hadn’t yet gone to Europe — an answer that perplexed administration officials at the time. While another shows a video of Harris dancing at an event, stating: “This is America’s border czar — and she’s failed us.” Both ads conclude by describing Harris as “failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.” Harris’ root cause work dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America, but in the last three years, her assignment has been bundled with the administration’s larger migration issues. Biden administration officials have repeatedly maintained that Harris focused on long-term fixes, while the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. This story has been updated with additional remarks from Harris."
"Exclusive: Quavo to speak at Harris rally in Atlanta, endorsing VP and raising awareness for gun violence prevention | CNN","Updated 7:31 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T18:31:10.107Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/entertainment/quavo-kamala-harris-rally-gun-violence/index.html,"Rapper Quavo is set to appear at a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night in Atlanta, according to a Harris campaign official. Quavo, known as the frontman of the now defunct hip-hop trio Migos, is expected to make remarks on the issue of gun violence at the rally, two sources say. A source familiar with his speech says the rapper will endorse Harris for president onstage, and will remind the crowd how important the Georgia vote is in an effort to galvanize rally-goers to register to vote. Gun violence is an issue that hits close to home for Quavo, who lost his nephew and Migos bandmate, Takeoff, after a fatal shooting outside a Houston bowling alley in 2022. Migos disbanded after Takeoff’s murder, and Quavo released a song dedicated to Takeoff in 2023. Quavo and Migos’ Offset reunited at the BET Awards in 2023 for a tribute performance in honor of Takeoff. After his nephew was murdered, Quavo launched the Rocket Foundation in 2022 to honor the life and legacy of Takeoff. The foundation works towards creating gun violence prevention and criminal violence intervention. Quavo is an institution in the Atlanta rap scene, being born and raised in the area. A source close to Quavo says the rapper is excited to welcome Vice President Harris to his hometown for her first presidential rally in Georgia; the two have formed an authentic bond over the past year, having worked closely together to raise awareness for gun violence prevention. Last month, Harris joined Quavo for a conversation about gun violence at the Rocket Foundation Summit in Atlanta on what would have been Takeoff’s 30th birthday. And last September, Quavo visited Harris in the White House with his mother and Takeoff’s mother to discuss the fight to end gun violence, also meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The day after Quavo’s visit in Washington D.C., President Joe Biden established the first-ever White House office of gun violence prevention, which has been overseen by Harris. Performing at the Harris rally on Tuesday night is rapper Megan Thee Stallion. On Monday, Megan Thee Stallion posted a flyer on her Instagram – where she has 32 million followers – to announce her performance at the Harris rally. “ATL HOTTIES SEE YOU TOMORROW,” she wrote, along with an American flag emoji. The rapper’s publicist, Didier Morais, also posted about the performance on Monday, tagging the vice president on his Instagram. CNN has reached out to Morais for additional comment. Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion are the latest young stars to endorse Harris, as she sets out on her presidential campaign, which has quickly garnered overwhelming Hollywood support. The Atlanta rally will target, in part, Black voters who will be key to Harris in the race, as well as Gen Z and millennial voters, who are likely engaged with musicians like Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion. Arlette Saenz contributed to this report. An earlier version of the story incorrectly stated that Quavo would be performing at the rally."
Harris nears vice presidential announcement as her team tests out top contenders | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:15 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T20:30:03.530Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-vice-presidential-selection/index.html,"(CNN) — Kamala Harris is in the thick of choosing a vice presidential running mate, with her campaign eying an announcement in the coming days that would be immediately followed by a joint tour of a series of battleground states beginning next Tuesday. Harris, abruptly thrust into the role of presidential candidate fewer than 10 days ago, has been studying notebooks filled with information about each of the top vice presidential contenders, has had preliminary conversations with some of those candidates, and has been asking close advisers involved in the process who would make the strongest governing partner for her at the White House, sources familiar with the process said. Harris has not yet conducted formal interviews with the top contenders, one source familiar told CNN. That process is expected to begin this week. Meanwhile, her team – working on an extraordinarily condensed timeline in the aftermath of President Joe Biden abruptly abandoning his reelection campaign just a little over three months out from Election Day – has been swiftly researching and testing out the top candidates, including by studying videos of those being vetted. The top contenders include Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has taken himself out of the running and declined the campaign’s request to be vetted, CNN reported Monday. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear are also still in conversation, but people close to the process believe they are not top contenders. The vice president’s choice will be revealed by Tuesday, when she and her running mate will kick off the battleground state blitz beginning with their first joint rally in Philadelphia, according to a campaign official. The pair will then travel to western Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Eric Holder, the former attorney general, is leading a vetting team of a few dozen Democratic lawyers who are poring over financial records and family histories of the contenders. Tony West, a former associate attorney general and Harris’ brother-in-law, is also playing a leading advisory role in the search process. As is typical in vice presidential searches, the Harris campaign has been intently focused on who could help strengthen the Harris ticket’s electoral chances. Polling has been conducted of how at least some candidates, particularly Shapiro and Kelly, could influence the race in battleground states. The Harris campaign declined to comment for this story. “She, better than anyone aside from a couple other people on earth, knows what the job of VP entails, for better and for worse,” a longtime Harris friend said. The vice president is looking for a partner who could “do the job that she currently holds, do it in a way that is additive and not distracting, and ideally helps shore up any weaknesses she has electorally right now because governing doesn’t matter if you don’t win,” the friend added. In a memo at the outset of her candidacy, the Harris campaign argued it saw “multiple” pathways to 270 electoral votes across the so-called Blue Wall states, which include Shapiro’s Pennsylvania, and the Sun Belt, which includes Kelly’s Arizona. But internally, campaign strategists have acknowledged that Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes could be make-or-break for the outcome. “Pennsylvania is the tipping point,” one strategist close to the campaign told CNN. “Once you acknowledge that, it becomes pretty obvious who [Harris] should pick.” On policy, selecting Shapiro, who is Jewish, is seen by some advisers as providing political cover for Harris on the Middle East, where she has spoken out more forcefully in recent days against the humanitarian suffering in Gaza than Biden, even as the two have pursued the same policy of assisting Israel in its military defense. But as Shapiro has emerged as a top candidate for her running mate, the team is also examining his potential weak spots – including the resignation last year of Shapiro’s close top aide, Mike Vereb, amid a sexual harassment investigation. The governor’s administration paid nearly $300,000 to settle the claims, but Shapiro has not been implicated. “Although the Commonwealth does not comment on specific personnel matters, it takes allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously,” Manuel Bonder, spokesperson for Shapiro’s office, said in a statement, noting that “robust procedures are in place for thoroughly investigating reports of discrimination and harassment.” While some Democrats have urged the campaign to reveal the running mate at the Democratic convention in Chicago, which opens August 19, Harris has expressed a desire to have a partner sooner. With about three months remaining in the race, advisers say, a vice presidential candidate is needed on the campaign trail as soon as Harris makes her decision.

Analysis: What this election proves about the importance of running mates and vice presidents | CNN Politics,"Published 5:12 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T21:12:23.889Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/vice-presidents-what-matters/index.html,"One major lesson from Vice President Kamala Harris’ sudden ascension to be the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is that running mates matter. Backup quarterbacks need to be ready for big games, and vice presidents need to be ready for the Oval Office, as this election year has proven on both sides of the political aisle. Former President Donald Trump was nearly killed by a would-be assassin before he officially selected Sen. JD Vance. Harris is set to be Democrats’ consensus nominee only because President Joe Biden stepped aside after questions were raised about his ability to do the job for four more years. It’s a point not lost on some Republicans who are second-guessing Trump’s selection of Vance and Democrats who are anticipating Harris’ pick any day. “Veepstakes,” as the informal selection process is frequently called, can feel irrelevant and overwrought as pundits pick apart the attributes and drawbacks of potential vice presidents. Trump compared the process to his old reality show, “The Apprentice,” in which he picked the best person to hire. CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports the Harris campaign plans to hold up Trump’s pick of Vance as evidence that the former president is not good at hiring people and that Vance is unqualified to be president. Harris’ selection of a running mate – the first major decision of her unexpected campaign – is expected before planned joint appearances next week and in time for Democrats to include the potential veep’s name when delegates officially select the Democratic ticket during the first week of August. Read CNN’s latest report on the process. Trump picked Vance on the first day of the Republican National Convention in July at the urging of one of his sons and to carry his MAGA movement into the future. Old-school Republicans were immediately alarmed because the pick also signaled a new direction for the GOP, at least rhetorically, on issues from organized labor to foreign policy. The public’s introduction to Vance, the young senator from Ohio – he turns 40 in early August – who first became famous for writing a by-the-bootstraps memoir of his path to success, has been rocky. Vance’s past comments about women could hurt Republicans’ chances with a key voting bloc. His past opposition to Trump, before a conversion to a MAGA true believer, makes Vance now seem like an opportunist. Sofia Nelson, a Yale Law School classmate of Vance’s who now works as a public defender in Detroit, released a trove of old emails and text messages with Vance and argued he is a “chameleon” who has changed his views on “literally every imaginable issue.” A large portion of the public still has either not heard of Vance or has no opinion of him, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released last week – but a larger portion of registered voters in the poll had an unfavorable view of him than a favorable one. And that was before Vance’s previous comments, such as those uncovered by CNN’s KFile, were reported. Trump, not usually one to back away from a controversial position, appeared to modulate Vance’s description of Democrats like Harris as “childless cat ladies” during an appearance on Fox News. “You know, you don’t meet the right person, or you don’t meet any person. But you’re just as good, in many cases, a lot better than a person that’s in a family situation,” Trump said. Vance also undercut Trump’s public argument that Harris is a “worse” candidate than Biden. In audio obtained by The Washington Post, Vance can be heard admitting that Harris lacks some of the baggage that was dragging Biden down and that her rise was a “sucker punch.” Harris’ pick could come within days, according to CNN’s MJ Lee and Jeff Zeleny, who write that the pool of candidates has shrunk by one. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper made sense for Harris on paper as a Democratic governor who won twice in a red state. But at 67, he is older than Harris and would complicate Democrats’ goal of presenting a younger ticket as a contrast to Trump. There are similar advantages and drawbacks for each of the people reportedly on Harris’ list. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly has the glittering resume of a former astronaut and is married to Gabby Giffords, the congresswoman turned activist after she was shot at a political event. But he lacks executive experience and might not help Harris in the “blue wall” states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – that most strategists see as Democrats’ most likely path to the White House. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro could help Harris in Pennsylvania, but he is relatively unknown. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg may be Democrats’ most effective communicator in his frequent appearances on Fox News, but he is barely older than Vance. Read more about potential running mates from CNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Karl de Vries and Eric Bradner. Democrats frequently view the decision as a way to balance their ticket. Barack Obama, the first Black president, may have tried to appeal to working-class, White voters when he picked Biden, the old-school senator born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Biden went on to pick Harris, the first woman of color to be on a national party’s presidential ticket. She now seems to be focused on a list of relatively moderate, White, male Democrats as she runs to be the country’s first female president. Running mates rarely seem to help presidential candidates, but recent history shows they can hurt them – particularly when it comes to Republican picks. In 2008, John McCain picked then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin almost on a whim, hoping for a campaign reset but instead getting a gaffe-prone political neophyte who projected unpreparedness. This is now the textbook example of a flawed running mate pick, although Palin’s contribution to McCain’s ultimate loss has probably been overstated. In 2012, Mitt Romney picked then-Rep. Paul Ryan, a swing state rising star with good looks and a wonkish vibe. But Ryan’s signature policy attribute, his budget proposal aimed at controlling government spending, may have ultimately hurt Romney’s campaign. In 2016, Trump picked then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who didn’t seem to affect the race and played the part of loyal sidekick – right up until the moment in 2020 when he refused to reject electoral votes, endangering his own life and forever moving to Trump’s bad side."
Harris recalibrates policy stances as she adjusts to role atop Democratic ticket | CNN Politics,"Published 4:58 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T20:58:44.876Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-shifts-policy-stances/index.html,"As the burgeoning Kamala Harris campaign works behind the scenes to refine its policy platform, the vice president has increasingly found herself clarifying which of her positions have shifted over the years. From fracking to single-payer health care, several cornerstones of her 2020 presidential run, as well as her time as a US senator and California attorney general, now appear at odds with the policies that have crystallized during the Biden-Harris administration and emerged as critical issues in battleground states. The policy changes reflect the differences between the moderation that has come with governing during the current administration’s time in office and the demands of the 2020 Democratic primary, when both Joe Biden and Harris reversed course on certain policies in an attempt to move to the left. Harris ended her 11-month bid as one of the more progressive candidates in a crowded field. But the recent clarifications on her current positions, and the speed at which her fledgling campaign moved to make them, also demonstrate the Harris team’s need to define the presumptive Democratic nominee – lest Republicans beat them to it. Even as Harris has energized Democrats and boosted the ticket’s appeal to Black, Latino and younger voters, she is also seeking a running mate who is likely to be a White man with a more centrist persona. The push to bolster a more moderate image comes as former President Donald Trump and his campaign have ratcheted up criticisms of Harris, seeking to frame her as more liberal than Biden and highlight her California roots. The Trump campaign is up with two ads attacking Harris on border security and describing her as “dangerously liberal.” The $12 million ad buy will air in six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. During a Saturday rally in Minnesota, Trump called Harris the “number one most radical left Democrat in the entire Senate,” a reference to a since retracted GovTrack legislator ranking that rated her the most liberal member of the Senate in 2019 based on the bills she introduced and co-sponsored. At that same rally, Trump accused Harris of trying to hide her past opposition to fracking, the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations – and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. A Harris campaign official said Monday she no longer supports a fracking ban. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked if she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,” Harris said at the time. Harris acknowledged that it would take legislation to restrict fracking beyond federal lands, and pointed to the residual health impacts of fracking on local communities. Harris’ campaign also confirmed this week that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system. The vice president’s shifting stances on health care plagued her throughout her 2020 campaign. During her first year in the Senate, she co-sponsored independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation, which would create a government-run health insurance program and essentially end the private insurance market. During a January 2019 CNN town hall right after she launched her first presidential campaign, Harris said she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All. “We need to have Medicare for all,” she said in response to a question. The health care plan she rolled out that July stopped short of completely eliminating private insurance. Instead, it would have shifted the US to a government-backed health insurance system by transitioning to a Medicare-for-All-type system over 10 years and continuing to allow private insurance companies to offer Medicare plans. Harris argued that she adjusted her plan based on feedback she received from voters, and was willing to deal with the political fallout. “I said to my team, ‘We need to do a better plan, this is not good enough.’ And I said to my team, ‘I know we’re going to take a political hit for it,’” Harris said during an interview with “Axios on HBO” that aired October 2019. “I knew I’d be called a flip flopper for that.” Since becoming Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market. As a presidential candidate in the leadup to 2020, Harris suggested that Democrats needed to “critically examine” the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), when asked whether she sided with Democrats arguing to abolish the department. “We need to probably think about starting from scratch because there’s a lot that is wrong with the way it’s conducting itself,” Harris told MSNBC in an interview at the time. As apprehensions and border crossings skyrocketed over the course of Biden’s term, the Biden-Harris administration moved to support increasing resources for ICE and implementing tighter policy controls to try to limit the surge of migrants. As vice president, Harris supported a bipartisan border bill that would have ramped up enforcement at the US-Mexico border. The package, which ultimately failed to advance, would have provided thousands of additional customs and asylum officers, as well as tens of thousands of additional detention beds for ICE. In June 2024, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing the flow – a policy that Harris’ campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, indicated would continue under a Harris administration. “I think at this point, you know, the policies that are, you know, having a real impact on ensuring that we have security and order at our border are policies that will continue,” Chavez Rodriguez told CBS News. In the midst of nationwide 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer, Harris voiced support for the “defund the police” movement, which argues for redirecting funds from law enforcement to social services. “This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,” Harris said in a June 2020 radio interview, CNN’s KFile reported. Throughout the summer, Harris supported the movement and called for demilitarizing police departments. Biden, the 2020 Democratic nominee, called for policing reform but denounced the idea of defunding departments. As a ticket, they also opposed the movement. “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,” former Harris press secretary Sabrina Singh said in October 2020. “Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.” Democrats largely backed away from calls to defund the police after Republicans attempted to tie the movement to increases in crime during the 2022 midterm elections. Mitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, walked back a “defund the police” sentiment voiced by Harris in 2020, saying what she meant is she supports being “tough and smart on crime.” “Her position has always been that you can both be tough and smart on crime, and it requires funding police, but it also requires funding rehabilitation and things that might criminal justice system safer,” Landrieu told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “You can do both.”"
Longtime Biden aide Anita Dunn departing the White House | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:33 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T20:10:39.974Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/anita-dunn-biden-harris/index.html,"Longtime Biden aide Anita Dunn is leaving the White House next week, according to a source familiar, and joining a super PAC supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. This marks the first big departure from the White House in the wake of President Joe Biden’s decision to step down from the 2024 Democratic ticket. Biden thanked Dunn for her work at the White House in a statement Tuesday, calling her “an invaluable part of our White House.” Dunn is departing the White House to serve as a senior adviser to Future Forward and Future Forward USA Action. The Washington Post first reported her departure. “She’s tough and tested, and her experience and intellect have helped us deliver historic results for the American people,” Biden said. “I deeply value her counsel and friendship and I will continue to rely on her partnership and insights as we finish the job over the next six months.” Dunn called it an “an honor and privilege to serve in this White House” in a statement to CNN. “I am grateful to President Biden and Vice President Harris for their leadership and giving me the opportunity to be part of what they have accomplished for the American people.” Dunn spent much of the Biden administration as one of the president’s closest advisers. However, as Biden mulled departing the 2024 race earlier this month, CNN reported that Dunn was “left in the dark until minutes before he posted his announcement on social media.” Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, were among Biden’s debate prep team and had faced the ire of the president’s family in the aftermath of the performance. Lorraine Voles, Harris’ chief of staff, praised Dunn in a statement on Tuesday, writing, “As she has throughout her influential and consequential career, Anita has served the President and the Vice President with distinction. She gives her all every day, and is a valued colleague to me and so many others on these 18 acres.” Chauncey McLean, president of Future Forward, called Dunn “a great asset as we work to elect Kamala Harris and defeat Donald Trump once and for all.” This story has been updated with additional information."
Ad wars heat up between Trump and Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 4:02 PM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T19:16:05.429Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/ad-wars-trump-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris each unleashed a new wave of television ads Tuesday as they race to secure an advantage in a presidential campaign dramatically altered in recent weeks. In its first major ad blitz targeting Harris, the Trump campaign is zeroing in on her immigration record in ads running across several key battleground states. It’s a sign that the former president has settled on a longstanding GOP line of attack against the vice president, after grappling with the abrupt change atop the Democratic ticket. Harris, meanwhile, unveiled a minute-long ad entitled “Fearless” that offers highlights of her career dating to her tenure as a prosecutor in the Bay Area of California – as she scrambles to introduce herself as the prospective nominee to voters following President Joe Biden’s decision to end his reelection bid. It’s part of what the Harris campaign said will be a $50 million blitz in the run-up to next month’s Democratic National Convention – fueled, in part, by the record-breaking fundraising the Harris campaign has seen since Biden’s departure from the race and endorsement of her candidacy a little more than a week ago. Trump, in two new campaign ads, seeks to define Harris on his terms by relying on what has been a political liability for the Biden administration: the management of the US-Mexico border. Republicans have jumped on an assignment given to Harris – the task of addressing the root causes of migration in Central America – to cast her falsely as the nation’s “border czar” and as solely responsible for the record number of migrant arrivals at the US southern border over the last three years. Both Trump campaign ads pull from a 2021 NBC interview during which Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn’t yet visited the US-Mexico border and she stumbled through a response by claiming she also hadn’t yet gone to Europe – an answer that perplexed administration officials at the time. Another shows a video of Harris dancing at an event, stating: “This is America’s border czar – and she’s failed us.” The ads conclude with a description of Harris as “failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.” In response, Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said Trump is “running on his trademark lies” and said the former president opposed a congressional border deal that would have helped with enforcement. Harris’ root cause work dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. As the vice president’s campaign takes shape and as immigration remains a top issue for voters, her team is forced to contend with an assignment that, sources say, has showed early success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment but that’s been bundled with the administration’s larger migration issues. The Trump campaign so far has reserved about $12.2 million in advertising across six battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – through August 12, according to data from AdImpact, which tracks media buying. Even as she seeks to introduce herself to voters, Harris’ new campaign ad also goes on the attack against Trump, using some of the vice president’s remarks at her first rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. “Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,” Harris can be heard saying in the ad. “To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.” In a statement, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon noted the former president’s May felony conviction for falsifying business records and said that Harris’ career – ranging from a courtroom prosecutor and California attorney general to her current role in the Biden administration – makes her “uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump.” The new Harris ad, according to the campaign, will air during the Olympics along with other programs – such as “Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,” “The Bachelorette” and “The Daily Show” – that target demographic groups the campaign is trying to reach."
"In Harris, business leaders tired of Biden see a potential friend | CNN Business","Updated 10:14 AM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T10:00:04.354Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/business/kamala-harris-economy-ceo-donor-business/index.html,"As vice president, Kamala Harris was a leading player in a remarkably progressive Biden administration that fought mergers, battled Big Tech and called out corporate greed. As the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Harris finds herself in the middle of a tug-of-war as she crafts her own economic agenda on major issues like taxes, trade and regulation. Some business leaders and wealthy donors are hopeful that Harris will adopt more centrist policies as she outlines her agenda, especially by dialing back Biden-era antitrust crackdowns. “CEOs are wildly excited about Harris,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN in a phone interview. Sonnenfeld pointed to confidence that Harris will protect the rule of law and hopes for recalibrated trade, regulatory and tax policies. Progressive groups, suspicious of billionaire donors and their deep pockets, are already trying to persuade Harris to continue and build on Biden’s legacy. In just one example of this emerging battle, the two sides are clashing over the fate of Lina Khan, the head of the Federal Trade Commission and arguably the highest-impact regulator of business in the Biden administration. Some businesses have been furious with her unprecedented antitrust crackdowns. Progressives have championed Khan’s leadership. Meanwhile, Harris, somewhat of an unknown commodity on business policy, hasn’t said much about where she stands. “She’s a blank slate. She can’t afford to go too far to the left because it would erode business confidence. And so much of the economy is all about confidence,” said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments. Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman raised eyebrows by telling CNN last week that Harris should replace Khan, the antitrust cop confronting Big Tech, Big Oil and even Big Mattress. Of course, some of Khan’s critics have a stake in the outcome of this battle. Hoffman sits on the board of Microsoft, a company that the FTC has tried and failed to prevent from buying “Call of Duty” video game maker Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. The FTC is also investigating a recent Microsoft deal with artificial intelligence startup Inflection. Another Democratic donor, billionaire Barry Diller, told CNBC on Friday that he would lobby Harris to replace Khan, saying the FTC chair is “a dope” who is against “almost anything” business wants to do. Diller, the chairman of conglomerate IAC, also has a stake in what happens to Khan. CNN has learned that the FTC has multiple ongoing investigations into subsidiaries of IAC, the company that owns dozens of media brands including Angi, People and Care.com. It’s not clear which IAC subsidiaries are being actively investigated by the FTC. In a statement to CNN, IAC said the company “doesn’t comment on the status of investigations.” Diller told CNN in a statement on Tuesday that he “misspoke” about Khan in the CNBC interview. “I said ‘she’s a dope.’ She isn’t. She’s smart but I believe overreaches in disrupting sensible business combinations,” Diller said. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on news of the investigations, which haven’t been previously reported. Now, an alliance of more than 20 pro-consumer groups led by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee is calling on Harris to “publicly signal” support for Khan. In a letter from the alliance, shared first with CNN, progressive groups including Public Citizen, the AFL-CIO and the NAACP, express “concern” about Hoffman’s call to fire Khan and about “billionaires choosing their own regulators.” “Removing Lina Khan from her position would hurt millions of families, make Americans cynical about government at a time when you are inspiring hope, and be a retreat from finishing the unfinished business (and building on) the legacy of the Biden-Harris Administration,” said the letter, which is being sent Tuesday morning. One of the organizers, PCCC co-founder Adam Green, told CNN in a phone interview that publicly supporting Khan “should be a lay-up” for Harris – and suggested there could be a backlash if she doesn’t. “There is a high degree of default trust in Kamala Harris that she will build on – not subtract from – the legacy of economic populism of the Biden-Harris administration,” Green said. “But that could be punctured very easily if she signaled that Lina Khan – one of the administration’s shining stars – could even potentially be fired.” Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor who has been dubbed the “CEO whisperer,” predicted Khan will not get that public endorsement. “It’s not going to happen. Her days are numbered,” Sonnenfeld said. FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar previously told CNN that Khan is “honored to serve in the Biden-Harris administration, where she has protected consumers, workers and entrepreneurs from illegal conduct and corporate abuse.” A Harris campaign aide told CNN last week that there have been “no policy discussions” about replacing Khan at the current time. Beyond antitrust, CEOs are watching to see what priorities Harris lays out on taxes. Former President Donald Trump wants to not only extend the 2017 tax cuts, but he has also called for lowering the corporate tax rate from 21% to 20% or even 15%. President Joe Biden proposed raising the corporate rate to 28% and promised not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year. Harris has yet to detail where she thinks the corporate tax rate should be, but as a presidential candidate in 2020, she pushed for the rate to go back to 35%, where it was before the Trump tax cuts. Another key sticking point is energy, where Trump has tried to blame the Biden-Harris administration for periods of high gas prices. Trump has also highlighted Harris’ previous support for a fracking ban – a dramatic step that could significantly hurt US supply of oil. “She wants no fracking,” Trump said during a rally last week in North Carolina. “You’re going to be paying a lot of money.” It’s true that as a presidential candidate in 2020, Harris supported a fracking ban, but she later walked that back. Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement to CNN that “Trump’s false claims about fracking bans are an obvious attempt to distract from his own plans to enrich oil and gas executives at the expense of the middle class.” Notably, Hitt highlighted that the Biden-Harris administration didn’t just pass the country’s largest-ever climate change legislation, it has presided over record-setting US domestic energy production. That includes not just clean energy like solar but record US oil and natural gas production. Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor, argued the Harris campaign should talk more about that. “They may not want to brag about it because they don’t want to draw the ire of environmentalists,” he said. “But it’s a very strong counter to the drill, baby, drill mantra.”"
Fact check: Harris campaign falsely claims 2021 video shows Vance endorsing Project 2025 | CNN Politics,"Published 8:48 AM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T12:48:20.255Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/fact-check-harris-vance-project-2025/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has falsely claimed on social media that a video clip from 2021 shows Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance endorsing a conservative initiative known as Project 2025. Project 2025, an effort to lay out an agenda for a potential second Donald Trump presidency, was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed along with a variety of other conservative organizations. The 920-page Project 2025 blueprint for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have been a central focus of Democratic attacks during the 2024 election campaign. On the social media platform X on Saturday, the Harris campaign posted a video of Vance being interviewed by conservative media outlet The Federalist. The Harris campaign account @KamalaHQ, which has more than one million followers, described the video like this: “JD Vance endorses Project 2025: ‘We really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power … I don’t think there’s a compromise that we’re gonna come with … Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re gonna keep losing.’” Facts First: The Harris campaign’s claim that the video shows Vance endorsing Project 2025 is false. The video does not show Vance talking about Project 2025 at all. In fact, Project 2025 had not even been created at the time Vance made these comments in May 2021. The initiative was launched by The Heritage Foundation in April 2022, and its policy recommendations were released in April 2023. The Harris campaign, which declined to comment for this article, did not acknowledge in the social media post that Vance’s comments were from more than three years ago. A Harris campaign official told CNN last week – when Harris herself inaccurately described some of the contents of the Project 2025 policy document – that the campaign “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.” No broad endorsement from Vance or Trump There is no doubt that Trump and Vance have extensive ties to the people behind Project 2025. CNN previously reported that at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025. Vance wrote the foreward for a forthcoming book by The Heritage Foundation president and Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts. But Roberts was not yet working for Heritage at the time of the May 2021 Vance comments the Harris campaign posted on Saturday, and contrary to the Harris campaign’s claim, Vance has not issued a broad public endorsement of the initiative itself. Vance said earlier in July, days before he became Trump’s running mate, that Project 2025 includes “some good ideas” and “some things that I disagree with” – adding that “most importantly, it has no affiliation with the Trump campaign.” Trump has called unspecified Project 2025 proposals “seriously extreme” and “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” but has also said “many of the points are fine.”"

JD Vance – a pair of “weird dudes” using populist and, in Vance’s case, implausibly homespun rhetoric to disguise their dangerous political agenda. That kind of clear and caustic messaging, delivered with an ebullient Minnesota accent, has transformed Walz from a relatively anonymous – despite his estimable progressive record – Midwestern Democrat to a potential vice presidential pick for Harris. At the same time, Walz is carving out a new – at least to polite liberal politics – line of attack on MAGA movement Republican leaders, whom he has repeatedly described as “strange” while railing against both their political agenda and public manners. Walz was, again, a swirl of acid and honey during his remark on Monday night to the “White Dudes for Harris” Zoom fundraiser. This time out, though, he also sounded every bit the former high school football coach, first asking supporters to “keep hammering on” Trump and Vance, to “shrink them.” Then he offered the evening’s headline. “How often in a hundred days do you get to change the trajectory of the world? How often in a hundred days do you get to do something that’s going to impact generations to come?” Walz asked. “And how often in the world do you make that bastard wake up afterwards and know that a Black woman kicked his a**, sent him on the road?” The host of the call, Ross Morales Rocketto, thanked the governor, before drolly observing, “I see why everybody is so excited about you.” For allies in Minnesota, Walz’s happy introduction to the national political stage is surprising more for the unpredictable nature of the moment than his chops, which they told CNN can go underappreciated in part because of the focus on the so-called “Blue Wall” state leaders lined up to his east. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, another potential running mate, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have been unavoidable since Biden stood down and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, with a similar political style to Walz, has also raised his profile over the past 10 days. Walz’s six years in charge of Minnesota have seen a remarkable series of political and social upheaval. First came the Covid-19 pandemic and then, in its midst, the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, which set off global anti-racist demonstrations. Walz navigated it all – alongside more usual complaints over wasteful spending – well enough that, by the beginning of 2023, he was leading a Democratic trifecta in the state government. An approving tweet from former President Barack Obama in May 2023 was a notable marker on Walz’s deliberate ascent, when he linked to a MinnPost report about the legislature’s “transformational” session – a progressive “wish list” turned “to-do list,” as Walz said then, which included codifying abortion rights in a post-Roe v. Wade world, adding protections for transgender people, passing paid sick and family leave, expanding voting rights and investing public funds in affordable housing. “If you need a reminder that elections have consequences,” Obama wrote, “check out what’s happening in Minnesota.” It took some time, but now they are. Fergus Falls, Minnesota, Mayor Ben Schierer, who has worked closely with the governor, said he isn’t surprised. “Whether he is on Fox News or MSNBC or at Union Pizza in Fergus Falls with me, he’s the same guy,” Schierer, first elected to his nonpartisan office in 2016, told CNN. “The thing that people probably didn’t understand – he’s entirely unafraid. Entirely unafraid. I would also add, he’s entirely undefeated.” Walz spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard, which included a deployment overseas after the 9/11 attacks, working as an educator and coach, before shockingly defeating a six-term Republican incumbent congressman in 2006, a wave year for Democrats. Walz remained when the tide rolled out, reelected to the typically red district repeatedly until he left to run for his current job in 2018. (The seat quickly returned to GOP control after his departure.) “He is able to connect with people who you don’t necessarily think about as being part of the Democratic coalition in these Midwestern states, which means rural Whites,” a progressive strategist with close ties to Minnesota Democrats told CNN. “They seem to like the way he speaks, they seem to like the little turns of language, the metaphors he will use.” As his hand in St. Paul has grown stronger over the past few years, Walz has seemed emboldened. In a time when progressive Democrats frequently criticize the party and its moderate leadership for not being ruthless enough with the power they have, the charge has rarely been leveled against Walz. “When he first ran for governor, his slogan or mantra was called ‘ONE Minnesota’ and he kept emphasizing the idea that ‘I can work across aisle.’ ‘I can unite people,’” Hamline University political science professor David Schultz told CNN. “But once he got that trifecta, his message shifted to: ‘This is what we can do with single party control, the era of gridlock is over.’” Schultz did suggest that Walz has been running out an even feistier side of late as he vies for a place on the Democratic presidential ticket. “One of the things that’s really surprised me in the last few weeks is how good of a pit bull Walz is becoming,” Shultz said. “Especially with his comments about Vance.” Walz appears to relish going after Trump’s running mate and fellow “small-town” Midwesterner. That familiarity, as Walz frames it, has bred severe contempt. “There’s one golden rule in a small town, (for) those of you aren’t from a small town. Mind your own damn business,” Walz said. “We don’t need ‘em. I don’t know who’s asking for this crazy stuff that they’re pushing. Who’s asking to ban birth control? Who’s asking to raise the price of insulin?” He was just getting started. Addressing a virtual gathering that raised $4 million for the Harris campaign by Monday night’s end, Walz also tested the foreign policy waters, insisting that Americans in the coming election have a responsibility to the rest of the planet. “We’re not in this alone. The rest of the world needs us to be here,” he said. “These guys throwing our NATO allies under the bus, the idea that they don’t care what happens in the rest of the world, not addressing climate change that’s going to impact communities that are less fortunate than anyone else.” He closed with a mix of Minnesota nice and partisan spice, beseeching Democrats to get organized, ruthless and on the offensive. “Don’t ever shy away from our progressive values,” Walz said. “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness.”"
Analysis: How Harris may win back a critical group of voters who abandoned Biden | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 AM EDT, Tue July 30, 2024",2024-07-30T04:00:02.424Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-abortion-message-biden-analysis/index.html,"The quickest way for Kamala Harris to grow her support may be to consolidate the voters who agree with her on abortion. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has been a much more comfortable and cogent messenger on the issue than President Joe Biden, who wasn’t winning nearly as much support in 2024 as he did in 2020 – or major Democratic candidates did in 2022 – among voters who support legal abortion, according to previously unpublished results from multiple public polls. Biden’s slippage with voters who support legal abortion partly reflected the same problems that hurt him with other segments of the electorate, such as concerns about his age. But his decline with those voters also underscored the risk to Democrats that abortion’s relevance has been reduced since 2022 by voter concerns about other problems, especially inflation, and former President Donald Trump’s efforts to downplay the issue. With Harris at the top of the ticket, Democrats now see a chance to refocus voters on the issue and restore their margins among the abortion rights voters who had notably drifted away from Biden. “She is able to talk about it in a way that, quite frankly, that Biden was not,” said Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg, expressing a widely held view in the party. “It’s not that the issue hasn’t been talked about at a national level, but it hasn’t been articulated in the way she does.” Biden’s lackluster showing in polls this year among voters who support abortion rights, though rarely discussed, represented one of the most important changes in the political landscape from the past two national elections. In both the 2020 and 2022 campaigns, voters who backed legal abortion provided overwhelming support to Biden and other Democratic candidates. In 2020, Biden won almost exactly three-fourths of voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In 2022, the exit polls found that Democratic House candidates again won almost exactly three-fourths of voters who said abortion should always or mostly remain legal. Democrats maintained that elevated level of support even as the share of voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances spiked from 51% in the 2020 exit poll to fully 60% in the 2022 election coming just a few months after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned the constitutional right to abortion with the Dobbs decision. In an array of recent national public polls before he quit the race last week, Biden this time was not winning nearly as large a share of voters who support abortion rights. A merge of the results from three national Marquette Law School polls this year found Biden carrying a little less than two-thirds of the voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to results provided by Charles Franklin, the poll’s director. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS this April, Biden won exactly three-fifths of the voters who said they disapproved of the Dobbs decision, according to data provided by the CNN polling unit. Two other recent polls put Biden’s support among voters who support abortion rights even lower: surveys this spring by Quinnipiac University and Yahoo News/YouGov, which measured attitudes about abortion in different ways, each showed Biden winning only about half of voters who identified as supportive of abortion rights, according to results provided by the pollsters. The Marquette, CNN and Quinnipiac polls each showed Trump winning about 85% of voters who opposed legal abortion, even more than his 76% support among them in 2020, according to the exit polls. State level polls told the same story. In 2020, Biden won between 72% and 77% of voters who supported legal abortion in all or most circumstances in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, according to the exit polls. In 2022, most Democratic gubernatorial candidates did even better: the exit polls found that Democrats Tony Evers in Wisconsin and Katie Hobbs in Arizona each carried about three-fourths of the voters who supported legal abortion, while Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer won more than four-fifths of them in Pennsylvania and Michigan respectively (the 2020 exit poll did not ask about attitudes on abortion in Michigan.) Across all of those battleground states, Biden this year was performing well below that level with voters who support legal abortion, polls have found. A large YouGov survey for a consortium of major US universities and the Times of London earlier this month found that Biden did not exceed 59% support among voters who say abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances in any of the seven major battleground states, according to results provided by YouGov. Even among women who support legal abortion in all or most circumstances, Biden’s best showing in the poll was exactly 60% in Michigan. By contrast, in the 2020 exit poll, Biden carried at least 75% of women who supported abortion rights in each of the four states where the question was asked; in 2022, Whitmer won 82% and Shapiro 85% of women who supported legal abortion. This declining support among voters who support abortion rights came after the Biden campaign and allied Democratic groups spent nearly $26 million in this campaign cycle on ads that addressed abortion, according to the ad tracking service AdImpact. One reason for Biden’s decline with voters who support abortion rights, strategists in both parties agree, is that they were not immune to the same factors that had soured all voters on the president. Results from the Marquette Law School national polls provided by Franklin validate that observation: Even among voters who support legal abortion, the survey found that three-fourths believed Biden was too old to serve as president. Those abortion rights voters also split about evenly on whether Biden or Trump was better for the economy. Another factor is that Biden was always an uneasy crusader for the abortion rights cause. Biden resolutely supported national legislation restoring the national right to abortion. But as an 81-year-old devout Catholic, who initially criticized the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, he was often hesitant even to mention the word “abortion.” “A lot of voters thought that Biden was personally against abortion and in his public policy [position] was for it,” said Celinda Lake, a pollster for his 2020 campaign. “Ironically,” she added, many voters think Trump “is personally for it, and in public policy against it.” Voters, Lake said, see none of that ambivalence in Harris. From the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs decision, the vice president has taken the lead for the administration on defending abortion rights. She has parachuted into red states to denounce abortion bans and limits, rallied about the issue on college campuses and met repeatedly with women and medical providers affected by the new restrictions. This week, her campaign is holding a “Fight for Reproductive Freedom” series of events around the country tied to the Iowa law banning most abortions after six weeks that went into effect on Monday. “It was always true that Kamala Harris was going to be a better messenger on abortion,” said Melissa Williams, who runs the independent expenditure program for Emily’s List, a group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. “Part of that is relatability. Part of that is living her life. But part of that is her experience and the way she talks about it. She is out there visiting a Planned Parenthood, talking to providers and talking to patients. She is stridently offended by where Republicans are on this issue and that’s a compelling position.” Harris not only brings more passion than Biden to her defense of abortion rights, but she connects it to two larger messages more effectively than he did. One is to place abortion at the center of a much broader effort by red states, the GOP-nominated Supreme Court justices and Trump to roll back an array of rights and liberties – voting rights, protections for LGBTQ people and potentially access to contraception and IVF. The fact that her first campaign video revolved around the idea of protecting “freedom” (complete with the sanctioned use of a Beyonce song of that title) underscored how central that argument will be to her campaign. “A majority of women in America feel they are losing their rights – and men agree,” said Tresa Undem, a pollster for progressive causes. “I often hear women say, ‘what’s next, our right to vote?’ They are angry and scared. Harris is mirroring exactly how most women are feeling. This is why candidate gender matters. Harris – the most powerful woman lawmaker in the country – has had her rights taken away just like every other woman in the country. It’s not an abstraction.” The other way Harris has enlarged the abortion debate is by arguing that it reflects a desire among conservatives to roll back the broader gains women have made in society over the past generation. In her comments about abortion, she is often most passionate when she bristles at the idea that “our daughters will have fewer rights than our grandmothers,” as she put it at the Essence Festival earlier this month. That framing could help Harris hold older White female voters who may be receptive to Trump’s arguments on other issues that touch on race and identity, such as crime and immigration, said Greenberg. “The anger about abortion is very much concentrated with college women and older women over 50,” Greenberg said. After Dobbs, she said, “a lot of these [baby] boomer women who remember Roe v. Wade being decided and the women’s movement” were outraged — and remain so. “They may not be feminists,” Greenberg continued, “but they were part of the generation that got rights” and they have a growing concern that those rights are now slipping away. Conversely, Harris’ comfort and fervor in discussing abortion could help mobilize more younger female voters, who were losing faith not only in Biden but in the prospect of restoring reproductive rights, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. In focus groups of young women this year, Della Volpe said he found that many of them “across the country seemed resigned to the new reality, that it’s a state-by-state situation.” With Biden as the messenger, abortion “didn’t have that fire and that urgency that so many Democrats felt through public opinion and the ballot box in 2022 and 2023,” added Della Volpe, who is advising a super PAC attempting to mobilize younger voters for Democrats. In all these ways, Harris may deliver the Democrats’ case on abortion rights more effectively than Biden and energize more of the voters who support abortion rights but were unenthusiastic about his candidacy. But Republicans express confidence that even if Harris does all that, she is unlikely to restore the crushing levels of support that Democrats reached in 2020 and 2022 among voters who back abortion rights. That’s because Republicans believe both that the issue is less salient in this year’s presidential race and that Trump is less vulnerable on it than other GOP candidates were two years ago. Jason Cabel Roe, a GOP consultant in Michigan who’s a former executive director of the state Republican Party, said that while abortion often overshadowed other national issues in gubernatorial and Senate races in 2022, this year all signs suggest the order will be reversed. The 2022 midterm, he said, “was the Dobbs election: It was super charged but it also sucked up all the oxygen” from other concerns, he said. “I think a lot of the issues that were underlying issues in 2022 will come back to the forefront in 2024” including inflation, immigration and crime. Not that many swing voters, Roe predicted, “are going to vote [primarily] based on abortion when all these other factors are part of the debate.” Trump has also tried to limit his exposure on the issue. He’s repeatedly declared that he opposes a national ban on abortion (a position echoed by GOP legislative leaders), and now prefers to allow states to set their own differing rules. His team carefully suppressed discussion of abortion at the party’s recen﻿t national convention and in its platform (though the platform still contains language that suggests support for national restrictions by endorsing the idea of “fetal personhood” under the 14th Amendment.) “Donald Trump has taken a relatively centrist, common sense position: He has basically said — let the states decide,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump’s campaign. “It’s up to the states, you don’t like what your states are doing, vote them out. It’s democracy.” Trump’s deference to states, McLaughlin continued, has made some voters who support abortion rights “less fearful” of what a second term for him would mean on the issue and encouraged them to back him because of other issues. “Many of them aren’t single issue abortion voters; they are worried about the economy and inflation, they are worried about immigration,” McLaughlin said. Williams, the Emily’s List political operative, agreed that convincing voters to see a risk that Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress might seek a nationwide abortion ban “is work we have to do. … We have to tell people where Trump is. We have to define him and set the stakes.” But, Williams added, Trump repeatedly bragging that he was responsible for overturning Roe through his Supreme Court nominations makes that easier, as do the starkly anti-abortion comments and policy positions of his vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, as well as the abortion restrictions proliferating across red states. “In all of these states where Republicans have control, they have rolled back rights, so it is very much a watch what they do, not what they say,” Williams said. Any look at Trump’s position today among voters who support abortion rights, Williams said, doesn’t reflect the impact of the large amount of paid advertising that is coming on the issue from outside groups like hers. “My guess is that’s a communications problem, not a problem problem,” she said. In fact, while polling has consistently found that fewer than half of Americans blame Trump for the court’s decision overturning Roe, Democrats and advocacy groups say their own surveys show that most voters believe Republicans will still seek a national abortion ban if they win unified control of the White House and Congress, despite the GOP’s promises to the contrary. A KFF poll late this spring supported those findings: in that survey, nearly three-fourths of women nationwide said they believed a reelected Trump would sign a nationwide abortion ban into law. Biden could not convert those concerns into enough support in his bid for reelection, given all the other headwinds he faced, and the erosion of his ability to drive a message on abortion or anything else. Harris still must confront many of the same obstacles as Biden, particularly the discontent among many voters about the rising cost of living since the administration began. But she has already shown she can deliver the Democratic case on abortion, and rights more broadly, far more pointedly than the president. Raising the relevance of abortion rights for more voters may not be sufficient to erase all Trump’s advantages in the race — but, for Harris, it looks like the necessary first step on any path toward overtaking him."
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper removes himself from Harris VP consideration | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:00 PM EDT, Mon July 29, 2024",2024-07-29T23:13:40.112Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/harris-vice-president-roy-cooper/index.html,"Roy Cooper on Monday said it isn’t the right time for him to join a national ticket, as two sources familiar with the discussions told CNN the North Carolina governor had removed himself from consideration as Kamala Harris’ running mate in a sign that the accelerated search has entered a new phase. Harris’ decision on a running mate could come within a week, two people familiar with the matter said, with Harris’ goal to make an announcement before August 7. She intends to have private conversations with top contenders, sources said, but it was unclear whether those discussions have started. “I strongly support Vice President Harris’ campaign for President. I know she’s going to win and I was honored to be considered for this role. This just wasn’t the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket,” Cooper said in a statement posted to his personal account on X. “As l’ve said from the beginning, she has an outstanding list of people from which to choose, and we’ll all work to make sure she wins.” Cooper was approached by the Harris campaign about being vetted, and he declined, a source familiar told CNN. The governor, whose friendship with Harris dates back to their time serving as the attorneys general of their respective states, was also the oldest candidate under consideration. His age, 67, was seen by some Democrats to be at odds with Harris’ push for a vigorous and younger ticket, the sources said. There also was concern among some Democrats about elevating Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican lieutenant governor whom the state constitution says would perform the governor’s duties when the governor is absent from the state. Other Democrats in the state and Washington, DC, told CNN that Cooper may instead look at the 2026 Senate race for the seat currently held by Republican Thom Tillis. Polling and extensive research is underway for other top Democratic running mate contenders, sources said, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are also seen as prospective running mates. CNN has reached out to a representative for Cooper. The Harris campaign declined to comment. On a “White Dudes for Harris” Zoom call to rally support for the vice president Monday night, Cooper praised Harris’ record, calling her a “strong woman” that the nation needs. “Kamala Harris is a strong woman. She’s going to run this country in a way that she cares about the pocketbook issues. … She’s going to work to clean our environment. She’s going to work to make sure that people have health care and quality education. That’s the kind of person that we need,” he said on the call. Cooper did not mention taking himself out of consideration to be Harris’ potential running mate. Cooper, who was viewed as one of the top contenders for the role, leads a state that is a crucial battleground in 2024. He was narrowly elected for the first time in 2016 by just over 10,000 votes. He won reelection in 2020 and is term-limited out of running for a third time. He endorsed Harris earlier this month, saying she “has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity.” Throughout his time as governor, Cooper has clashed with lawmakers in the state legislature, where Republicans have a supermajority, over abortion rights and voting rights, among other things. Cooper had previously waved off speculation that he might be on the shortlist for vice presidential nominees if President Joe Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and Harris became the nominee. “I don’t want to play into this new favorite political parlor game, because it’s too important for America to stop Donald Trump,” Cooper told CNN in July.  After Biden announced he would step aside and endorsed Harris, a wave of endorsements from state delegations made her the presumptive Democratic nominee. The Democratic National Committee’s rules panel last week adopted the rules the party will use to choose its presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin August 1. The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7. This story has been updated with additional reporting."
"Fact check: Vance falsely claims Harris is ‘calling to end the child tax credit,’ which she is actually calling to increase | CNN Politics","Published 6:35 PM EDT, Mon July 29, 2024",2024-07-29T22:35:36.901Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/fact-check-vance-false-harris-child-tax-credit/index.html,"Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance is facing criticism over his previous comments about people without children, including one 2021 remark denouncing “childless cat ladies” in government and another in which he said that, in order to “tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good,” people without children should pay a higher tax rate than people with children. Vance is now trying to turn the tables on the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. In a Fox News interview that aired Sunday, Vance said, “I think a lot of parents and a lot of non-parents look at our public policy over the last four years and ask, ‘How did we get to this place? How did we get to a place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?’” Facts First: Vance’s claim that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit is false. In fact, it is the opposite of reality: Harris has called for years to increase the child tax credit. As vice president, she has advocated for the permanent adoption of the enhanced child tax credit that was temporarily in effect in 2021 under a pandemic relief law – a law that was signed by President Joe Biden after it was passed by Congress with only Democratic support. Spokespeople for Vance and the Trump-Vance campaign did not immediately respond to CNN’s Monday requests to offer any substantiation for Vance’s claim. But a Vance spokesperson, William Martin, argued to ABC News last week that “the policy Senator Vance proposed is basically no different than the Child Tax Credit, which Democrats unanimously support.” That’s a far more debatable assertion than Vance’s own claim on Fox News that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit, which is just wrong. Erica York, senior economist and research director at The Tax Foundation think tank, said in a Monday email that Vance’s claim is “false.” “VP Harris has not called to end the child tax credit, has regularly highlighted the significant expansion of the credit the Biden-Harris administration oversaw during the pandemic, and has a history of supporting expansions to the credit,” York said. Vance prefaced his 2021 comments about tax policy and children by speaking of his desire to use policy to “reward the things that we think are good” and “punish the things that we think are bad.” York noted that the “ultimate effect” of the child tax credit is that people with children have lower tax rates than people without children, but she said Vance “misleadingly” equated the Harris campaign’s criticism of his 2021 comments with opposition to the existence of the child tax credit. Vance’s claim on Fox News was not a one-time slip. He made a similar comment last week in an interview with conservative host Megyn Kelly, saying, “Why do we have the Harris campaign coming out this very morning, Megyn, and saying that we should not have the child tax credit?” The Harris campaign has not said that. Harris’ support for an expanded child tax credit predates her vice presidency. In 2018, as a US senator for California, Harris co-sponsored a Democratic bill to increase the credit. She co-sponsored another version of that expansion bill in 2019, when she was running in the Democratic presidential primary. As vice president, Harris has made numerous comments in support of returning to the enhanced child tax credit that was authorized as a one-year temporary measure by Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan pandemic relief law. The temporary expansion – which increased the maximum amount of the credit, made the credit fully refundable so the lowest-income families could qualify and sent out half of the credit in monthly payments – was a major contributor to a steep decline in child poverty in 2021. Child poverty then spiked in 2022, roughly to pre-pandemic levels, after Congress allowed the expanded credit to expire against the wishes of Biden and Harris. A bipartisan House bill that would expand the child tax credit again has stalled in the Senate this year amid Republican opposition. Harris posted on social media in March: “President Biden and I cut child poverty nearly in half after expanding the Child Tax Credit for millions of working families. It’s time for Congress to restore the full expanded Child Tax Credit.” She posted in March 2023: “The expanded Child Tax Credit cut the child poverty rate nearly in half during the first year of our Administration. Our budget restores this tax credit permanently because we believe it is our duty to invest in our nation’s children.” She has also talked up the 2021 expansion of the child tax credit on the campaign trail in recent weeks. In a July 18 speech before Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, she said, “Whereas the last administration gave tax cuts to billionaires, we gave tax cuts to families through the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in America by half.” She touted the expansion again in a speech to a historically Black sorority after Biden dropped out, saying, “We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, which is why I helped pass the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half and cut Black child poverty even more.”"
Analysis: ‘Weird’ election turns to how Harris laughs and Trump does not laugh at all | CNN Politics,"Published 5:03 PM EDT, Mon July 29, 2024",2024-07-29T21:03:57.897Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/laugh-harris-trump-what-matters/index.html,"It’s funny, really. In an election where the two leading presidential candidates are miles apart on weighty issues from abortion rights to border policy, for some reason both sides are talking about how Vice President Kamala Harris laughs and former President Donald Trump doesn’t. Trump, trying out new material to mock Harris, has dubbed his opponent as “Laffin’ Kamala.” “She’s crazy. She’s nuts,” he said at a recent rally in Michigan, implying there is something maniacal about her laugh. His supporters might hear a funny joke, but hers hear a sexist attack in line with the resurfaced comments of JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, who described childless Democrats in a 2021 interview as “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” If you don’t hear any sexism in any of this, consider that Trump also mocked Hillary Clinton for her laughter. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying a new tactic to deal with Trump’s most outrageous claims – laughing at them to take their power away. Allies of Harris are shifting gears to emphasize not the danger they think Trump poses to the country but instead how “weird” he sounds when he makes outlandish claims. “Listen to the guy,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” of Trump. “He’s talking about Hannibal Lecter, and shocking sharks, and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind. And I thought we just give him way too much credit.” Calling Trump and Vance “weird” helps “ratchet down some of the scariness,” Walz, a potential vice presidential pick, said. He went on to add that Trump is rarely seen laughing. “If he has laughed, it’s at someone, not with someone. That is weird behavior. And I don’t think you call it anything else. It’s simply what we’re observing,” Walz said. It is certainly true that Trump rarely laughs. CNN’s Gregory Krieg wrote about it in 2016. The magician/comedian Penn Jillette, who spent time with Trump during “The Apprentice” years, has talked about how Trump does not laugh. And so has former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump controversially fired back in 2017. While Trump himself rarely laughs, his supporters often dismiss his more controversial statements as jokes. For instance, look at when he told a gathering of conservative Christians on Friday that if they vote for him in November, they won’t have to vote again in four years because “it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine.” What’ll be fixed? The next election? Division in the country? We don’t know. Tapper asked Sen. Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, how he interpreted Trump’s baffling remark. “I think he’s obviously making a joke,” Cotton said. That’s a recurring theme among Trump supporters – that outrageous claims are clearly jokes. No, Trump doesn’t really want to be “dictator” for a day, it’s just a joke he said with a straight face, they’ll argue, adding that people who don’t get the jokes need to stop taking things so seriously. Jokes don’t require laughter, obviously, but laughter certainly helps people know when you’re joking. Trump’s niece Mary, who is no fan of her uncle, has said Trump gets his intentionally straight face from his father, her grandfather, who “also didn’t laugh.” “Laughing is to make yourself vulnerable, it’s to let down your guard in some way, it’s to lose a little bit of control,” Mary Trump told Virginia Heffernan of Slate in 2020. “And that can’t happen. That is not allowed to happen.” While Democrats are using Trump’s lack of laughing as evidence of his larger “weirdness,” Republicans hope that sharing clips of Harris belly laughing will make her seem “weird” to the people who don’t yet have much of an impression of her. It’s a tactic that so far seems to have backfired, since Harris supporters also like to share clips of her laughing. She’ll laugh at herself in the midst of a speech, like the viral “coconut tree” moment that has gotten so much attention. She’ll laugh in the midst of a press conference or during a “60 Minutes” interview – otherwise serious moments when another politician might try to keep a straight face throughout. Harris likes to bring up the subject of her laughter, as she did with Drew Barrymore a few months ago. “Apparently some people love to talk about the way I laugh,” Harris said. “I have my mother’s laugh. And I grew up around a bunch of women in particular, who laughed from the belly. … They would sit around the kitchen and drinking their coffee, telling big stories with big laughs.” Harris said she’s not going to tone down her laughter because it’s important to remind each other and teach younger people a lesson. “Don’t be confined to other people’s perception about what this looks like, and how you should act in order to be,” she said."

Harris sees opening in Vance pick as she considers her own choice for vice president | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:51 AM EDT, Mon July 29, 2024",2024-07-29T10:00:02.456Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/kamala-harris-jd-vance-vp-pick/index.html,"Kamala Harris’ plan as a running mate was to brush past JD Vance as nothing but a rubber stamp for Donald Trump. But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, her campaign is seizing on the Ohio senator as a major liability, looking to her own vice presidential selection process and the contenders’ public auditions to drive home the point. Vance’s elevation — despite his relative lack of government experience — is giving Harris a new opportunity to go after Trump. The message is not just that Vance is “weird,” as the vice president said at a fundraiser this weekend, or that he has objectionable views, advisers said; it’s that the Ohio senator shouldn’t be a heartbeat away from the presidency, and that Trump picking him raises more questions about the top of the ticket. The strategy is also a way to put Trump’s age in focus, now that President Joe Biden is not part of the conversation, by highlighting how close Vance could be to occupying the Oval Office if something were to happen to a 78-year-old president. And poking holes in Vance’s resume — as some potential Harris running mates are doing — is a way for them to argue that Republicans are holding the presumptive Democratic nominee to a different standard when they attack her as a “DEI hire.” “We have a Black woman, we have a White guy, and nobody asked the white guy” about experience, Harris campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told CNN. After Vance was announced as Trump’s pick and while Democrats were still waiting to see whether Biden would exit the race, Harris told several advisers she saw Trump’s choice as doubling down on his MAGA base rather than expanding the appeal of the ticket. She and her team were excited to face Vance as opposed to the others on the former president’s short list, eager to tag him as a hypocrite and Trump sycophant. But now, as her prospective running mates take turns whacking Vance over his controversial comments about women without children and his flip-flopping on Trump, as well as questioning his Appalachian roots, Harris’ team is holding Vance up against the people on her own short list to try to strike a contrast. The 39-year-old Ohio Republican is “one of the most unprepared people that we have ever put up to hold the vice presidency of the United States,” Landrieu said, with qualifications that don’t go much beyond the constitutional minimum of being a naturally born American citizen who is 35 years old. “He didn’t even run a business. He’s never run anything. And he’s about to be one heartbeat away from the largest entity in the world, and the one that’s the most important,” Landrieu said. “So it’s a fair question to ask: How would we know whether you have the capability to run domestic and national security policy for the most powerful country in the world, which you may be called to do on a moment’s notice?” Harris, who was first elected to the Senate in 2016, spent as much time in the chamber as Vance, who was first elected in 2022, before she started preparing in 2018 to run for president. And while Vance has won statewide office, those on Harris’ short list — which includes several governors, a senator and one Cabinet secretary — have served more time in government than Vance and have leadership experience in a variety of previous offices, business and the military (and NASA). Cedric Richmond, the former Louisiana congressman and Biden White House adviser who also serves as a campaign co-chair, said he is “terrified” to think about Vance being in a position to become president overnight. Several people hoping to get picked as Harris’ ticket mate echoed that message as they angle for the job. “I’ve done a lot of hiring in my life — in business and nonprofits, in government — and it’s pretty obvious when someone’s resume shows that they can’t hold down a job or haven’t held down a job for more than a year or two at a time, that there’s something wrong with them,” said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who’s among those being vetted, referring to Vance’s brief stints in business positions before jumping into the 2022 Senate race in Ohio. Pritzker said that not only are the potential Democratic picks more experienced, but they also have been more consistent in their positions than Vance, who has shifted from worrying privately eight years ago that Trump could be “America’s Hitler” to saying he was won over completely by how Trump performed as president. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — who ran for president four years ago after serving as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana — made a similar point between interviews in his own public auditioning to move up Harris’ list. “I’m somebody who believes that younger people can bring something to the table,” said the 42-year-old Buttigieg, who argued that his relatively few years in government service weren’t an issue since Trump had changed the game for what counted as political experience. “But I think when you have no executive experience at all, certainly not in public administration, and very little experience in public office in general, that’s a real concern.” Trump communications director Steven Cheung called Vance “the best choice to be the next vice president of the United States, while Kamala has been cosplaying the role since she was selected by Biden.” He attacked Harris as “the most unserious presidential candidate in a generation,” adding, “No matter who Kamala chooses, she can’t whitewash her dismal record serving as Biden’s failed border czar, overseeing out-of-control inflation, and releasing violent criminals back into communities.” While former Attorney General Eric Holder is supervising the official vetting for Harris, the actual decision-making is kept to a tight circle around the vice president, led by her campaign chief of staff, Sheila Nix, and her vice presidential office chief of staff, Lorraine Voles. They’re making many of the calls themselves, and getting even more from old and new friends assured of their own political expertise as they push their preferred picks. Harris, 59, has the unique experience of leading a selection process only four years after going through it herself. That process — and the way she then had to navigate the job under intense scrutiny — has been on her mind in conversations with, among others, Biden and former President Barack Obama, people familiar with her thinking told CNN, with Biden’s forceful comments about her readiness resonating for her as she makes this choice. Though she will be looking not just at what jobs the contenders held but also what they did in those positions, advisers say her process is not going to be as simple as comparing resumes. “We’re in a position where somebody has done the job of vice president,” a Harris adviser told CNN. “She knows the challenges of this world in a way that you have to have somebody who has a deep amount of resilience.” Those considerations are intertwined with immediate concerns that she has continued to stress in internal meetings: needing to unify the party and remember that, despite her meteoric first week as a candidate, “We’re the underdogs in this race,” as she put it at a fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday afternoon. As was the case when Biden was in his final deliberations about her four years ago, Harris believes that the foremost factor has to be who is going to help her win, her advisers say. “Harris will select a vice president who is qualified and ready to serve the American people, protect their freedoms, and fight for their future,” said campaign spokesperson James Singer, again trying to paint a contrast by reiterating a charge Harris herself has made — that Trump picked Vance because he supported his bid to overturn the 2020 election. With Biden out of the race, Trump is now the much older candidate. He is overweight, known to love fast food and has a philosophical objection to exercise. He has never released his full medical records. To Harris aides, that makes who he picked as a running mate an even more pressing issue. When then-Arizona Sen. John McCain picked then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate in 2008, he faced charges of recklessness for selecting someone with so little experience, given that he was then the oldest first-time presidential nominee and had already been through a bout of cancer. McCain in 2008 was about six years younger than Trump is now. Palin had a few more months as governor of Alaska — and before that, as mayor and a City Council member of her little town of Wasilla — than Vance has spent in the Senate. Trump is the only American president elected without previous government or military experience. And even if he picked Vance to be less of a governing partner than someone who could carry on his political movement, Trump has said he believes the Ohio Republican would be a good president. Asked about Democrats highlighting Trump’s age, his national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, made an argument similar to one Democrats were making just a few weeks ago: “It’s not about age, it’s about competence.” Still, that doesn’t change the actuarial realities that Democrats are much more eager to talk about now that they’re no longer defending Biden. “It has to make you wonder about Donald Trump’s judgment. He knows how old he is,” Pritzker said. “And so the idea that he would pick somebody a heartbeat away from the presidency, with so little experience — and in particular has so little experience running anything — it should just raise a lot of questions in people’s minds.” “Given questions about President Trump’s health, as well as his advanced age, the selection of a running mate here is as important as any since FDR’s last campaign — and JD Vance is no Harry Truman,” Buttigieg said. Roosevelt was 62 during his last campaign in 1944. “Father Time is undefeated,” Richmond said, “and [Vance] being that close to it, with that amount of experience and with the lack of seriousness or appreciation for the job — that should concern a lot of people.”"
"July 28, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-07-28T12:32:08.204Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kamala-harris-trump-election-07-28-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Sunday said his comments about “childless cat ladies” were a “quip” and not a criticism of people without children. “But there are a whole host of people who don’t have children for a whole host of reasons, and they certainly are great people who can participate fully in the life of this country, and that’s not what I said,” the Ohio senator told Fox News’ Trey Gowdy. Vance said in 2021 that the US was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies.” He said: “And it’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” But on Sunday night, Vance said, “This is not a criticism and was never criticism, Trey, of everybody without children,” accusing Democrats of taking his comments “out of context.” What he was attempting to convey, Vance said, was that it’s “important for us to be pro-family as a country.” “Of course, for a whole host of reasons, it’s not going to work out for some people. We should pray for those people and of course have sympathy for them. I still think that means we should be pro-family, generally speaking, as a party,” he argued. With 100 days to go until the election, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spent Sunday largely allowing their political allies to spread their messages after the two candidates hit the campaign trail the day earlier. Here’s what both candidates’ teams were up to Sunday: Harris announces fundraising haul: The vice president’s campaign said in a memo that it has raised $200 million since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her, with 66% of those donations coming from first-time donors. Trump and Harris take a breather: Trump, the Republican nominee for president, and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, both held off from hosting large campaign events after they each hit the trail Saturday to fundraise and rally potential voters. Harris and allies call Republicans “weird”: Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, seen as a contender to be Harris’ running mate, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that he’s been labeling Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, “weird” in an attempt to “ratchet down some of … the scariness” he sees in the campaign’s policy proposals. It’s a motif other Democrats have latched on to, with Harris saying Saturday that some of what Trump and Vance are saying is “just plain weird.” Running mate hopefuls back Harris: Democratic officials who have been floated as possible vice presidential picks took the opportunity to defend the vice president on morning news programs and campaign events. Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker all went on the attack for Harris as the vice president vets potential running mates. Vance hits a diner: Trump’s running mate, meanwhile, passed through a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, as the Ohio senator seeks to sway voters in the Midwestern battleground away from Harris. Vance argued that voters will turn on the vice president’s liberal record and will “turn Minnesota red.” Former Rep. Gabby Giffords rallied volunteers at a canvassing event for Vice President Kamala Harris in Rochester Hills, Michigan, on Sunday, just 100 days before Election Day. Giffords, who was shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting, spoke about her work to make the world safer, saying, “It can be so difficult, losses hurt. Setbacks are hard. But I tell myself, move ahead.” The former congresswoman is married to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who CNN has reported is being vetted as a possible running mate for Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Oakland County Executive David Coulter reminded the group that gun violence is an issue that impacts their own community, referencing a shooting last month at a splash pad in Rochester Hills that injured nine people, including two children. The walls of the newly opened Democratic campaign office in Rochester Hills were adorned with “Harris for President” signs, one week after President Joe Biden stepped aside from the race and endorsed his vice president. After Giffords spoke, volunteers prepared to knock on doors on a warm evening. Earlier Sunday, Harris’ campaign said it had 170,000 new volunteers. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont told supporters at a rally in Portland, Maine, on Saturday that “our job is not just to defeat Donald Trump, it is to elect Kamala Harris as our next president.” Sanders’ remarks come as the progressive senator has previously stopped short of formally endorsing Harris for president. On Monday he told CNN regarding a Harris endorsement: “I’m sure that I will, I want to just chat with her.” Former President Donald Trump endorsed two candidates who have been feuding in a closely watched Republican primary in Arizona to replace GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko. Trump endorsed Hamadeh for the seat last year, but his support of Masters comes just ahead of Arizona’s Tuesday primary elections. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, previously endorsed Masters.  Masters and Hamadeh ran on the same ticket in 2022, losing their races for US Senate and Arizona attorney general, respectively. But their campaigns for the 8th Congressional District seat have turned ugly, with Masters attacking Hamadeh as “dishonest Abe” and Hamadeh calling Masters a “snake.” Meanwhile, Lesko endorsed state House Speaker Ben Toma as her replacement. Other candidates vying for the seat include state Sen. Anthony Kern, one of the Republicans charged in the Arizona fake electors case, and former US Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress in 2017 in lieu of an ethics investigation for discussing surrogacy with two of his female staffers. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Sunday that former President Donald Trump is not reconsidering JD Vance as his running mate after the Ohio senator faced backlash for previous comments. In a recently resurfaced 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson, Vance used the term “childless cat ladies” to describe Vice President Kamala Harris and other politicians who don’t have biological children. Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is a stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children. The backlash to comments was widespread among fellow politicians and celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. Vance on Friday tried to defend those comments, saying his criticism was directed at the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family” — not at those who don’t or can’t have children. When asked Sunday whether Trump was reconsidering choosing Vance following the backlash, Graham — who also does not have children — said, “not at all.” He added, “Yeah, I don’t have children, but I’m going to vote for JD and Trump because I think we’ll be safer and more prosperous and more secure. … No, you should never say anything to hurt anybody’s feelings. But when you look at all these interviews by JD, he was talking about how the Democratic Party has abandoned the traditional family.” Former Vice President Al Gore on Sunday endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, citing her record on handling big oil companies and the climate crisis.  Former President Bill Clinton — who Gore served as vice president — and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed Harris the same day Biden dropped out of the race. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. During her 2020 campaign, she supported a fracking ban but walked that back later when she became Biden’s running mate. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, one of the Democratic politicians in contention to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, continued his attacks on former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance while campaigning for Harris in Georgia on Sunday. Speaking to a crowd gathered in Forsyth County, the suburban Atlanta county that could play a pivotal role in determining the winner in battleground Georgia, Beshear responded to attacks from Trump, who called Harris a “bum” at a recent campaign rally. Beshear doubled down on his attacks on Vance, who he has repeatedly criticized for claiming roots in Kentucky. Vance shared in his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” that he regularly visited parts of eastern Kentucky, where he has family. In response to Beshear’s initial attacks, Vance criticized Beshear for belittling his “origin story.” Beshear said Vance’s use of that phrase suggests his claims to Kentucky roots are inauthentic. Beshear also praised Harris and her campaign, and appeared to acknowledge concerns about the vice president being thrust to the top of the Democratic ticket without a traditional primary election process taking place. “She has not won this nomination through a coronation. She’s won this nomination through acclamation,” he said. Former President Donald Trump has revived his four-year-old false claim about how he and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz handled the civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz is among the Democrats whom sources say Vice President Kamala Harris is considering as a potential running mate. Trump, the Republican nominee, claimed during a Saturday campaign speech in Minnesota: “Every voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago — remember me? I couldn’t get your governor to act. He’s supposed to call in the National Guard or the Army. And he didn’t do it. I couldn’t get your governor. So I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis.” (Trump went on to criticize Harris for her own response to the unrest.) CNN fact-checked this Trump story in July 2020. But he has repeated the tale on multiple subsequent occasions, including an abbreviated version during his June 2024 presidential debate with President Joe Biden. Facts First: Trump’s claims that he sent the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 and that Walz refused to do so are both wrong. Walz, not Trump, sent the National Guard to Minneapolis — and Walz first deployed the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.  The Minnesota National Guard, the entity that Walz deployed, is under the command of the governor, not the president. The president has the power to federalize states’ Guard troops under certain circumstances, but Trump never did so during the 2020 unrest in Minnesota. After Trump began telling this false story in June 2020, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann provided a statement to CNN in the form of a question-and-answer sheet. It said, among other things: “Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No.” “Did Gov. Walz call out the Guard? Yes.” “Did Gov. Walz call out the National Guard at the direction of the President? No. He activated the Minnesota National Guard at the request of the Mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before he talked to the White House.” Read a timeline of events based on public evidence that refutes Trump’s claim here. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, one of several Democratic politicians being considered as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, said voters should look at which campaign promises former President Donald Trump didn’t fulfill and which ones he did. “He actually did keep two promises. He kept his promise to destroy the right to choose this country. And he kept his promise on tax cuts for the rich. And if you want to know what a second Trump term would be like, I would start by looking at those rare promises that he actually managed to keep,” he continued. Buttigieg also attacked the 78-year-old Trump for his age and for comments he characterized as “rambling,” echoing other Democratic politicians including Harris, who have labeled Trump and his allies as “weird,” while defending President Joe Biden’s decision to stay in office while dropping out of the presidential race. Buttigieg also pushed back on the suggestion that Harris has not been properly vetted through a primary election process, a point raised by some Republicans who have casted doubt on her qualifications for office.  “The idea that somebody hasn’t been tested or vetted when they have been Vice President of the United States for nearly four years just doesn’t make any sense.” An ABC/Ipsos poll released Sunday finds Americans’ opinions about Vice President Kamala Harris closely split, with 43% viewing her favorably and unfavorably while another 14% have no opinion. That’s an improvement for her from a poll released the previous week, where 35% viewed her favorably and 46% unfavorably. Former President Donald Trump’s rating, meanwhile, stands at 36% favorable to 52% unfavorable. That’s down slightly from a week ago in the aftermath of the Republican National Convention and the assassination attempt against him, but still higher than his ratings during most of this campaign cycle. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, saw an uptick in negative sentiment, from 31% unfavorability last week to 39% this week, with the shift largely reflecting a drop in the share who had no opinion of him. Overall, the poll finds that 7% of Americans hold negative views of both Harris and Trump — cutting the shares of so-called “double haters” roughly in half from the 15% who said last week they held negative views of both Biden and Trump. Other recent polling has found similar movement. The poll finds that 88% of Democrats say they’re at least somewhat enthusiastic about Harris as the Democratic nominee for president, while 82% of Republicans say they are at least somewhat enthusiastic about Trump as the GOP nominee. Overall, about half (48%) of Americans say they’re enthusiastic about Harris becoming the Democratic nominee, with 39% expressing enthusiasm for Trump as the GOP nominee. The survey did not directly ask about vote preference. The ABC News/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,200 US adults on July 26-27, using a nationally representative online panel. The results have a margin of error of 3.0 percentage points. Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance while speaking with diners in Waite Park, Minnesota, acknowledged that Vice President Kamala Harris “got a little bit of a bump” after becoming the new Democratic presidential candidate but said voters will ultimately reject her liberal record.  “The people are going to learn her record. They’re going to learn that she’s a radical,” Vance said outside Park Diner. “They’re going to learn that she’s basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.” Vance said those policies won’t work for Minnesotans and also told diners “we’re going to turn Minnesota red.” Vance also attempted to clarify what Donald Trump meant when he urged Christians to vote, telling them they “won’t have to do it anymore” after this election. He said the media “totally distorted” what he said and is “lying about what he meant.” Asked if he’s spoken to Trump about his prior criticism of the former president, Vance said no.  “Donald Trump accepts that people can change their mind,” Vance said. “He doesn’t care about what I said eight years ago.” Inside the diner, Vance was joined by his wife, Usha, and two of his three kids, who sipped on chocolate milk at the counter.  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is being considered as a running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris, downplayed the importance of Harris’ pick being from a battleground state. Pritzker told ABC News on Sunday he believes Harris should choose a candidate who has “got the message right” rather than using her pick to try to win a particular state, even as he acknowledged that “winning those battleground states is most important.” His comments come as the Harris campaign is reportedly considering Pritzker for the vice presidential role along with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton on Sunday defended former President Donald Trump’s recent comments about conservative Christians not needing to vote in four years, saying Trump’s comments were “obviously a joke.” The former president said Friday at the gathering of conservative Christians, “Let’s get out and vote, just this time. You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed. It’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” Cotton brushed off the comments during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Cotton also defended comments from Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, on a podcast in 2022 where he said he was sympathetic to the idea of using federal power to prevent women from leaving states where abortion is restricted to seek abortions elsewhere. “What JD is saying – or what JD has said since he became the vice-presidential nominee, it’s the same thing that President Trump has said. He is pro-life,” said Cotton. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is seen as a contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, continued to attack former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as “weird” while defending Harris and the Biden administration’s record. Walz told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday that he began labeling Trump and Vance as “weird” in an attempt to “ratchet down some of … the scariness” he sees in the Trump campaign’s policy proposals. “Listen to the guy, he’s talking about Hannibal Lecter and, you know, shocking sharks and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind. And I thought we just give him way too much credit. And I think one of the things is, is when you just ratchet down some of the, you know, the scariness or whatever, and just name it what it is,” he continued. Harris has been trying out a similar attack on Trump and Vance in recent days, saying at a Massachusetts rally Saturday that the former president was “resorting to some wild lies about my record” and that some of what he Vance were saying was “just plain weird.” Walz would not share whether he’s been asked to submit vetting materials to the Harris campaign. When asked if he would join the Democratic ticket if offered the role, Walz said he “would do what is in the best interest of the country.” Maryland’s Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that’s he flattered his name has been floated as a potential running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris, but he stressed that he loves his job and wants to continue as governor. Moore, who has long been seen as a rising star in the Democratic party, said Harris needs to look for someone that gives her “a sense of comfort.” Moore has been floated in some circles as a potential pick, though the Harris campaign appears to be focusing on others during the vetting process, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Moore endorsed Harris for president last week. In the run-up to President Joe Biden dropping out, Moore revealed he had conversations with Biden, saying: “When you care about somebody you tell them the truth.” Responding to questions about what ‘the truth’ he told Biden was, Moore said he told the president he was hearing “real concerns” from fellow Democrats. In an episode of “The Assignment,” Audie Cornish speaks with activist Deja Foxx, who worked on Kamala Harris’ 2019 presidential campaign as a social media strategist. She explains how old Harris memes have been transformed in a positive way, and why that might be happening: Former President Donald Trump painted his new chief rival, Kamala Harris, as worse than President Joe Biden at a Saturday night rally, calling her “the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.” Moments into his remarks in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump again blamed a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights earlier in the day on the “incompetent Biden-Harris administration.” He then quickly pivoted to Harris, calling her the “border czar,” as Republicans have been hammering the presumptive Democratic nominee over how she has handled her task of stemming the root causes of migration. “She’s terrible. She’s worse … she’s worse than he is,” Trump said of Harris and Biden. Trump compared Biden to a fighter who was “badly beaten” and taken out of the fight. Trump also called Harris “evil” over her handling of the border and said that if “a crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead.” A Harris spokesperson responded to Trump’s Minnesota speech by slamming the GOP nominee as a “bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has raised $200 million since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her, with 66% of those donations coming from first-time donors, according to a Harris campaign memo.  The memo, written by the campaign’s communications director Michael Tyler, also highlights organizing efforts and says the campaign has 170,000 new volunteers. Tyler concludes the memo by digging at the Trump-Vance ticket, saying they are “scrambling” and claiming the former president is “scared” of debating Harris.  Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are entering the last 100 days of one of the fastest-moving and least predictable campaign seasons in memory, after a historic month upended the 2024 presidential race. The ground has shifted under both political parties since June 27, when President Joe Biden’s poor performance in his debate with Trump threw the Democratic Party into chaos and prompted Trump’s team to eye an expanded electoral map. The race was rattled yet again after the former president survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Just days later, he chose Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and rallied the Republican Party at its convention in Milwaukee. Then, a week ago, Biden announced his exit from the race – and pointed to Harris, his vice president, as his successor. Within 36 hours, Harris had rallied the party behind her candidacy, locking down enough support from Democratic National Convention delegates to become the party’s presumptive nominee. Then she hit the ground running, holding events with voters in the swing state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, a Black sorority on Wednesday and teachers on Thursday. Friday morning, she touted the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama. Trump has responded to Harris’ apparent momentum with a series of personal attacks. At recent campaign stops, he has referred to her as “evil,” mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that “the American dream is dead” if Harris wins in November. The vice president responded at a Saturday fundraiser that the attacks by Trump and his running mate were “plain weird.” Polls are only beginning to capture the new state of play in a race that now has no clear leader. A Democratic vice presidential pick and convention, as well as potential debates between Harris and Trump and between their running mates, could further shake up the 2024 contest in the 100 days between now and Election Day, November 5. Democrats’ substitution of Vice President Kamala Harris for President Joe Biden on the ballot in November obviously resets the presidential race. It could also have a major impact on House and Senate races. Both chambers of Congress are narrowly divided; Republicans hold a slim advantage in the House and Democrats narrowly control the Senate. Either chamber could go either way in November. I went to Simone Pathe, a senior Washington editor for CNN Politics and the author of an occasional series, “The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip.” Read the most recent version here. Does Harris change the Senate equation? WOLF: The presidential race got a total reset when President Biden dropped out. Does that reset anything in the battle for the Senate? PATHE: The extent to which the change at the top of the ticket shifts Senate races will be one of the most interesting things to watch over the coming months. Remember that a big part of the pressure on Biden to step aside was the warning from Democratic lawmakers about his drag on down-ballot races. So now the big question is whether the Democratic brand itself is toxic or whether that was a particular vulnerability attached to Biden. It’s still early days of this new political reality, but there are some early signals of how Harris as the nominee could be giving Democratic incumbents a sense of relief. Read more here on the state of play for the House and Senate and how the shake-up in the presidential race might change things. Vice President Kamala Harris praised the power of young people and pledged to earn their vote in prerecorded remarks Saturday to a summit held by Voters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z organizing group. In her remarks, Harris also talked about her “Fight for Our Freedoms” college tour, during which she convened young leaders to hear about the issues that mattered to them. Harris’ campaign team began conducting outreach to several youth grassroots organizations shortly after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race last week. Some of Harris’ campaign staff, including Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director, were expected to attend the Voters of Tomorrow Summit in Atlanta, where hundreds of youth activists, content creators and grassroots organizations gathered to discuss the November election. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign criticized Elon Musk on Saturday after the billionaire Tesla CEO and X owner shared a video with doctored or fake audio of Harris purportedly describing herself as the “ultimate DEI hire.” Musk re-shared the video — originally posted by a separate X account, which labeled it as a parody — for his more than 190 million followers on Friday, with the caption, “This is amazing.” The video had been viewed more than 73 million times by Saturday morning, according to data from X. “I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire,” a voice falsely purporting to be Harris says in the video. It goes on to describe Harris and Biden as “puppet(s)” of the “deep state.”  CNN ran the fake Harris audio through an AI detection tool on Saturday, which found there was “substantial evidence” the voice had been generated using AI. A new line of attack: Republicans have used the term “DEI,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, to attack Harris and imply she rose to her status as the presumptive Democratic nominee on the basis of her race and gender. Critics say that amounts to a racist dog whistle, including Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost, who told CNN’s Jim Acosta this week that Republicans were using the “DEI” line as a “racial slur.” Combating misinformation: Bipartisan concern over AI-generated election interference has prompted a patchwork of laws across the country, as state lawmakers seek to blunt the impact of misinformation and keep deepfakes from overwhelming voters. More than a dozen Republican and Democrat-led states have enacted legislation this year to regulate the use of deepfakes – realistic fake video, audio and other content created with AI – in campaigns. The laws come amid warnings from the Department of Homeland Security over the ability for deepfakes to mislead voters. CNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed reporting to this post."
Trump and Harris enter final 100-day stretch of a rapidly evolving 2024 race | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:01 PM EDT, Sun July 28, 2024",2024-07-28T05:33:29.367Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/trump-harris-election-100-days/index.html,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are entering the last 100 days of one of the fastest-moving and least predictable campaign seasons in memory, after a historic month upended the 2024 presidential race. The ground has shifted under both political parties since June 27, when President Joe Biden’s poor performance in his debate with Trump threw the Democratic Party into chaos and prompted Trump’s team to eye an expanded electoral map. The race was rattled yet again after the former president survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Just days later, he chose Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and rallied the Republican Party at its convention in Milwaukee. Then, a week ago, Biden announced his exit from the race – and pointed to Harris, his vice president, as his successor. Within 36 hours, Harris had rallied the party behind her candidacy, locking down enough support from Democratic National Convention delegates to become the party’s presumptive nominee. Then she hit the ground running, holding events with voters in the swing state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, a Black sorority on Wednesday and teachers on Thursday. Friday morning, she touted the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama. Trump has responded to Harris’ apparent momentum with a series of personal attacks. At recent campaign stops, he has referred to her as “evil,” mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that “the American dream is dead” if Harris wins in November. The vice president responded at a Saturday fundraiser that the attacks by Trump and his running mate were “plain weird.” Polls are only beginning to capture the new state of play in a race that now has no clear leader. A Democratic vice presidential pick and convention, as well as potential debates between Harris and Trump and between their running mates, could further shake up the 2024 contest in the 100 days between now and Election Day, November 5. The issues and lines of attack that are animating both campaigns are increasingly coming into view. Trump’s campaign has focused on inflation, border security and crime – and the former president is arguing that Harris bears just as much blame as Biden on those issues and that she is more liberal than her boss. However, Trump has also escalated his attacks on Harris, criticizing her in deeply personal terms at campaign events Friday and Saturday. At a conservative Christian gathering in Florida on Friday, he said that Harris had been “a bum three weeks ago” before her ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket and dubbed her “the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.” He also said he “couldn’t care less” about mispronouncing her first name. Then, at a Saturday night rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump called Harris “evil” over her handling of the border and said that if “a crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead.” He also mocked his Democratic opponent’s laugh, claiming that the media was trying to portray Harris as a “Margaret Thatcher,” referring to the late British prime minister, but that “it’s not gonna happen,” because “Margaret Thatcher didn’t laugh like that.” A Harris spokeswoman responded to Trump’s Minnesota speech by slamming the GOP nominee as a “bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.” On Friday, Trump said protesters who sprayed pro-Hamas graffiti in Washington on Wednesday were Harris supporters, even though the vice president condemned their actions. He criticized her for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, without noting that Harris met privately with Netanyahu and that his own running mate also didn’t attend the speech. And Trump said that Harris “doesn’t like Jewish people. She doesn’t like Israel. That’s the way it is, and that’s the way it’s always gonna be.” Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. Trump, who continues to peddle falsehoods and raise fears about election fraud, also drew heat on social media for telling the Florida audience that if he wins in November, they won’t have to vote again. “You won’t have to do it anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I’m a Christian. … You gotta get out and vote,” the former president said. “In four years, you won’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Harris, at a Western Massachusetts fundraiser on Saturday, said that the former president was pushing “wild lies” about her record and that the attacks by Trump and Vance were “plain weird.” “I mean, that’s the box you put that in, right?” Harris told supporters. In campaign events since emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris is taking on Trump over abortion rights and casting him as a threat to freedom. “We are seeing a full-on agenda that is now about restricting rights, and one of the most fundamental rights, the right to make decisions about your own body,” she said at the Massachusetts fundraiser. “If there are those who dare to take the freedom to make such a fundamental decision for an individual, which is about one’s own body, what other freedoms could be on the table for the taking?” Harris has also been pointing to the former president’s legal troubles. In remarks to campaign staffers Monday – her first time delivering a brief version of her new stump speech – she recalled her time as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she “took on perpetrators of all kinds.” “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” Among the next orders of business for Harris’ campaign is to accomplish two tasks in a period of days or weeks that Trump’s campaign achieved over months. First, she must choose a running mate. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a team that is poring through financial documents, family histories, public statements, published documents, voting records, campaign experience and social media postings. Tony West, Harris’ brother-in-law and a former associate attorney general under Holder, is also playing a central role in the search. Democrats close to the process say the roster of leading contenders being vetted still includes North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sources say. Many of those potential picks have been offering Harris’ campaign informal glimpses of how they’d perform as her running mate through appearances on cable news shows. Democratic pollsters have been asked to test how Harris and the prospective candidates would fare in their home states – and in key battlegrounds – in hypothetical matchups against Trump and Vance. Harris has told the team of lawyers and advisers conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history that she plans to name her running mate before August 7. Then, Harris’ campaign and its allies must rapidly revise plans for the Democratic National Convention, which is set to start on August 19 in Chicago. Instead of nominating Biden for a second term, Democrats will use the convention to showcase the outgoing president passing the baton to Harris – and could alter the party’s programming to better align with the vice president’s personality and political appeal. Her campaign must also identify Harris’ best path toward 270 Electoral College votes. Biden’s hopes of a second term were thought to reside primarily in sweeping the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris, though, has been polling better among young and non-White voters – and could prove more viable in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina that appeared to be moving away from Biden. One of the biggest questions, now that Harris has replaced Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, is whether she will face Trump on the debate stage. The June 27 clash on CNN between Trump and Biden had already transformed the race. And a Trump-Harris debate could shape the race’s final weeks perhaps more than any other event. Biden and Trump had agreed to another debate – one that would take place on September 10, hosted by ABC. Harris said she would participate in that debate. “I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage. And so, I’m ready. Let’s go,” she told reporters Thursday. However, Trump’s campaign released a statement indicating that the former president wouldn’t commit to any future debates until the Democratic nominee is formally selected. “Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement Thursday. That prompted Harris to reply on social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place?’” Perhaps the clearest indicator of the political earthquake that’s taken place in recent days is the shift in cultural vibes and viral moments. Just a week ago, Republicans were riding high after a convention in Milwaukee at which Trump’s reaction to the assassination attempt days earlier – his right fist raised in the air as he mouthed “Fight” to the crowd – had become a rallying cry. Now, Democrats – who were previously fretting about slow fundraising, a disengaged base and slippage in support among young, Black and Latino voters – are rallying behind a candidate with more cultural cachet among those same voters. And Republicans are on defense, with Trump’s vice presidential pick, Vance, having to defend prior comments that could alienate the suburban women the Trump ticket is courting. Vance has come under fire over comments he made as a Senate candidate on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in 2021. He told Carlson that the United States is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He then specifically mentioned Harris, Buttigieg and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as examples. Vance did not acknowledge that Harris has two stepchildren with her husband. Buttigieg, who has since become a father to two children, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that he and his husband were struggling with “a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey” when Vance made the remark. Actress Jennifer Aniston criticized Vance for the comment as someone who has struggled to have children and said she prays his daughter is “fortunate enough to bear children.” In an interview Friday with conservative host Megyn Kelly on SiriusXM, Vance said he was being sarcastic and the substance of what he said has been lost. He said he was criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family.” “The simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective, and in a pretty profound way,” Vance said. Vance said it’s a “catastrophic problem” that the United States has the “lowest birth rate in our history in this country.” As CNN previously reported, the United States’ fertility rate has been trending down for decades, and in 2023 it reached the lowest rate in a century. Vance said his remarks about childless adults had been motivated in part by a conversation with his wife about balancing life as a working mother. “What a weird society that we’ve set up where moms who want to work, the thought that a lot of them are having is, ‘I can’t have more babies because it’s going to be bad for my career,’” Vance said. “How about we make the workplace more accommodating to working moms and working dads so that we can promote a real culture of life?” Harris, on the other hand, has been the beneficiary of a series of viral moments. Charli XCX, the British pop singer, declared the vice president “brat,” which is the title of her sixth studio album and a Gen Z summer soundtrack. It set off an avalanche of posts on TikTok, X and other social media platforms featuring the same shade of bright green as the album cover and video compilations of Harris. Then, there were the coconut memes, revisiting a May 2023 speech in which Harris spoke about “a difference between equality and equity.” “None of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,” she said in that speech. “My mother used to – she would give us a hard time sometimes – and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’” Since then, coconuts and coconut tree imagery have been used online in support of Harris, with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis even posting an endorsement of the vice president communicated through three emojis: a coconut, a palm tree and an American flag. “What we’re seeing is a really classic example of when pop culture really gets intertwined with politics, and it takes a special kind of candidate and a special kind of leader to inspire that,” Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 27-year-old Democrat, said on CNN. “It has to be organic. You can’t make it happen.” There were signs that after a launch that had gone better than Democrats could have hoped, Harris’ previous remarks were coming under fresh scrutiny. CNN’s KFile reported Friday that Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amid nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign. “This whole movement is about rightly saying, ‘We need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,’” Harris said on a New York-based radio program on June 9, 2020, adding that US cities were “militarizing police” but “defunding public schools.” On Saturday, ahead of the campaign rally in Minnesota, the Trump campaign released a video that slammed Harris for her “soft on crime policies,” highlighting her 2020 support on social media for a fund that bailed out protesters in the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Minnesota Freedom Fund is one of several US charities dedicated to helping low-income defendants post bail that boomed in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. However, the fund, in addition to other charitable bail groups, later came under fire after some defendants who were bailed out were arrested again for alleged acts of violent crime. As Trump’s campaign adjusts its tactics for the race against Harris, the former president has made clear on social media and on the trail that he plans to make political ideology an issue. “We’re not ready for a Marxist President,” Trump said Thursday on Truth Social, “and Lyin’ Kamala Harris is a RADICAL LEFT MARXIST, AND WORSE!” Trump had long criticized Biden over border security. He is similarly blasting Harris – who early in Biden’s presidency was tapped to tackle the root cause of migration from Central America. The Republican National Committee on Thursday posted a video on social media featuring assorted clips of Harris saying that an undocumented immigrant was not a criminal. Down-ballot Republicans have similarly begun attacking Harris as too liberal. In Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in one of the year’s most important races, posted a video Tuesday featuring Casey praising Harris – followed by a series of clips of Harris speaking in support of eliminating private health insurance, passing the progressive “Green New Deal,” abolishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a mandatory gun buyback program and more. On Friday, McCormick posted a slightly shorter version of the video. “Starting this Monday, Pennsylvanians watching the Olympics will also see Bob Casey and Kamala Harris’ dangerously liberal agenda on display,” he said."
Harris and Trump want to strengthen the middle class. It could use the help | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Sun July 28, 2024",2024-07-28T09:00:02.459Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/kamala-harris-trump-middle-class/index.html,"As soon as Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail this week, she made it clear what one of her top priorities would be if she wins the presidential election in November. “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said at a Wisconsin rally on Tuesday. “Because here’s the thing we all here (in) Wisconsin know: When our middle class is strong, America is strong.” Similarly, former President Donald Trump has also promised to help the middle class, which he says has been hurt by the steep rise in prices in recent years. “Under Biden and the radical left Democrats, inflation is wiping out our middle class,” he said at a Michigan rally last weekend. Harris and Trump, like many political candidates starting with Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, are targeting the middle class in part because it captures a broad swath of the nation. There’s no hard-and-fast definition of the middle class; it’s more about self-identification. And just over half of Americans consider themselves middle class, according to a recent Gallup poll. The group’s amorphousness also makes it hard to campaign on targeted policies and then live up to those promises in office, said David Roediger, an American studies professor at the University of Kansas and author of “The Sinking Middle Class: A Political History of Debt, Misery, and the Drift to the Right.” “When you have a group of people that’s so ill-defined and so heterogeneous, it’s hard to know what the policy outcomes would be,” he said. Both Harris and Trump have made big – but very general – promises to aid the middle class, as well as those who consider themselves working class, who make up just under a third of US residents, Gallup found. Harris, who only announced her candidacy last Sunday after President Joe Biden said he would not stand for reelection, has yet to unveil a platform with specific policy recommendations. But she’s provided a glimpse into her areas of focus in her speeches over the past week: forgiving student debt; making health care, child care and elder care more affordable; enacting paid family leave; and enabling seniors to retire with dignity. Some of her prior solutions as a 2020 presidential candidate and senator centered on tax credits. To help middle-class and working families keep up with their living expenses, she proposed providing them with a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year (per couple). Titled the LIFT the Middle Class Act, or Livable Incomes for Families Today, the bill would allow taxpayers to receive the benefit – up to $500 – on a monthly basis so families don’t have to turn to payday loans with very high interest rates. As a senator, she introduced the Rent Relief Act, which would establish a refundable tax credit for renters who annually spend more than 30% of their gross income on rent and utilities. The amount of the credit would range from 25% to 100% of the excess rent, depending on the renter’s income. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the Child Care for Working Families Act in 2017, which would have capped the cost of care at 7% of household income for certain parents. And in her initial run for the White House, she proposed up to six months of paid family and medical leave as part of her “Children’s Agenda.” Other parts of that package included Black entrepreneurship plans, an equal pay proposal and a push for higher salaries for teachers. Plus, Harris has been a forceful proponent of the White House efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, which she said is critical to people’s financial health. The Biden administration proposed such a ban last month. “Medical debt makes it more difficult for millions of Americans to be approved for a car loan, a home loan or a small business loan, all of which in turn makes it more difficult to just get by, much less get ahead,” Harris said on a call with reporters in June. “And that is simply not fair, especially when we know that people with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those without medical debt.” Medical debt is a big burden for the middle class, with about a quarter of this group having unpaid medical bills in 2020, according to Third Way, a think tank. That’s a larger share than those lower and higher on the income ladder. Trump, meanwhile, is focusing on how the swift jump in prices under the Biden administration is “wiping out our middle class,” as he put it at one recent rally. Reversing inflation is one of the top promises in the platform Republicans released ahead of the party’s convention earlier this month. “The Biden/Kamala record-high inflation crisis has hurt middle class working families by robbing them of thousands of dollars every month just to have the same quality of life as they did a few years ago under President Trump,” Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national press secretary, said in an email to CNN. “When re-elected, President Trump’s top priority will be reigniting our energy industry to bring down inflation and the cost of living for all Americans,” she continued. “President Trump has also promised to cut taxes for the middle class once again and end taxes on tips for service workers to put more hard-earned money back into their pockets.” The former president last month floated eliminating the tax on tips – a new campaign promise – at a rally in Nevada, a key swing state and one with a sizeable number of service industry workers. He vowed “to do that right away, first thing in office.” Trump has mentioned a middle-class tax cut but has yet to provide details on it. The individual tax provisions of the Republicans’ 2017 tax cut law, which reduced taxes for most Americans but benefited the wealthy the most, are set to expire at the end of next year. Trump has promised to extend all the expiring measures. The party platform lists several general measures long favored by Republicans that they say will bring down prices. If Trump wins the election, he and the GOP will lift restrictions on domestic energy production and terminate the Biden administration’s green energy efforts, which the platform says will “immediately slash inflation” and power homes, cars and factories with affordable energy. Republicans aim to stabilize and grow the economy by reining in what they call wasteful federal spending and cutting costly regulations, and the party intends to reduce commodity prices by restoring “peace through strength,” according to the platform. Another top policy is to stop illegal immigration, which the party says has driven up the cost of housing, education and health care for American families, the platform says. However, other Trump proposals could potentially hike the cost of living for the middle class. Trump’s tariff proposals – including a 10% tariff on all US imports – would cost the typical middle-income household at least $1,700 a year, according to researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. There’s good news and bad news to tell about the middle class these days. The middle class is smaller than it was in 1971, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. Only 51% of Americans lived in middle-class households last year, compared with 61% just over five decades earlier. Pew defines middle-income households as those with an income that is two-thirds to double that of the US median household income, after incomes have been adjusted for household size. The median household income for the middle class was $106,092 last year. The good news is that more middle-class families have moved up the income ladder than down – a sign of economic progress, according to Pew. Some 19% of Americans were in upper-income households last year, compared with 11% in 1971, while 30% were in lower-income households last year, compared with 27% in 1971. However, the bad news is that middle-class income has grown more slowly than that of their higher-income peers – 60% compared with 78% between 1970 and 2022, Pew found. Income among the lowest tier grew 55% during that period. Plus, the share of total household income held by the middle class has plummeted – from 62% in 1970 to 43% in 2022, while upper-income families accounted for 48% of total income in 2022, compared with 29% in 1970. However, income can be a poor measure of defining the middle class, some experts say. About one-third of middle-income earners are unable to spend as if they are middle class, a 2022 RAND study found. “Many middle-class households consistently stretch their budgets or break even to afford a basic standard of living,” RAND researchers found. “Others spend within their means but doing so requires them to live in ‘consumption poverty,’ which we define as necessity spending lower than the federal poverty level.” “In both of these cases, households that are middle class by income may not have access to a middle-class lifestyle,” the researchers said. Inflation has worsened the financial anxiety of some middle-class Americans, particularly renters looking to buy a home or parents who want to help pay for their children’s college education. These are two accomplishments that many people think are necessary to maintain their middle-class status, though home prices and tuition have risen faster than incomes, making them harder to afford, said Jeffrey Wenger, senior economist at RAND. “There’s a sense of uncertainty that’s worse now in this generation of the middle class than previous generations,” he said."
Black women are quickly joining forces to support Kamala Harris’ presidential bid. Here’s what that looks like. | CNN,"Published 3:00 AM EDT, Sun July 28, 2024",2024-07-28T07:00:15.326Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/us/black-women-kamala-harris-campaign/index.html,"Jotaka Eaddy was sitting on her parents’ porch in South Carolina on Sunday afternoon when she got a text from an activist friend with a link to President Joe Biden’s letter announcing he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. Eaddy said she started texting in a group chat with other Black women political organizers, where she learned that Biden was endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Eaddy, founder of the grassroots group Win With Black Women, immediately jumped into organizing mode. If Harris had a chance to become the nation’s first Black female president, Eaddy said, she wanted to do her part to support her. “It was time to go to work,” Eaddy said. “It was clear that it was time to turn it up 10 times.” The women in Eaddy’s group chat started discussing how they could mobilize as many Black women as possible around Harris, she said. They agreed to spend the next five hours spreading the word about their weekly Sunday night Zoom call. That call ended up attracting some 44,000 attendees — with 50,000 more listening on other platforms when Zoom reached capacity. It raised $1.5 million for Harris’ campaign, Eaddy said. The call, activists say, was the start of a brewing movement of Black women who are quickly joining forces to help Harris secure a historic win in November. Thousands of Black women organizers across the country are mapping out voter registration efforts and planning conference calls, campaign events and fundraisers. Harris’ sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., announced Monday it was partnering with other Black Greek letter organizations to launch a massive nonpartisan voter mobilization campaign. These types of collective efforts have helped Democrats win previous elections, and many Black female organizers believe they can do it again. Black women are the most loyal voting bloc of the Democratic Party, with 90% supporting Biden in 2020. Harris herself has been working to reach Black women voters with stops at Black sorority conventions in recent weeks. Earlier this month, prior to Biden dropping out the race, she spoke at the AKA Boule in Dallas. And on Wednesday she delivered remarks at the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. conference in Indianapolis. Both AKA and Zeta Phi Beta are part of the National Pan-Hellenic Council, commonly called the Divine Nine, which is made up of nine Black sororities and fraternities. AKA has more than 360,000 members and Zeta Phi Beta has more than 125,000. “There is so much at stake in this moment,” Harris said in her speech at the Zeta Phi Beta conference. “Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize, to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve.” While many Black women were ready to support Biden’s reelection bid, the news that Harris would likely replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket energized a lot of Black female voters, said Shavon Arline-Bradley, president of the National Council of Negro Women. Arline-Bradley said Black women were excited to have a candidate they could identify with and one they believe will fight for the issues they care about such as health care, education and economic development. “To see a person who represents your community, that looks like you, has the lived experiences that you’ve had, an HBCU grad, Divine Nine member, you have someone who is in church on Sunday with her family,” Arline-Bradley said. “These are Black women values.” Harris is an alumna of Howard University, a historically Black institution. Several prominent lawmakers and activists said they attended Sunday’s Win With Black Women call and pledged to join the movement coalescing around Harris. Among them was Texas Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who said in a statement to CNN that Black women would be crucial to a Harris victory over former President Donald Trump. Crockett said Harris is “qualified, capable, and fit to lead this country as our next President.” “Black women have been strong supporters, seeing her as a symbol of breaking barriers and pushing for more diversity in leadership,” Crockett said. “Her leadership isn’t just about her achievements; it’s about what she represents: progress, equality, and opportunity for all.” Activist Tamika Mallory told CNN that while Black women are celebrating Harris’ presidential bid, many are hoping that in return she will address the issues they care about. Some of those top concerns include inflation, the need for higher-paying jobs, police brutality and a ceasefire in Gaza. “The euphoria of the moment will pass,” Mallory said. “And then we have to get down to the business of a commitment from Kamala Harris to adopt the goals of our movement. There is work that has to be done. People in communities across the country are suffering.” Political experts and organizers acknowledged Harris’ path to victory would not be easy. According to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Wednesday, Trump holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Trump and other Republicans have already made race- and gender-based attacks on Harris. Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett suggested in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that Harris was a “DEI hire” whom Biden chose solely because she is a Black woman. And in a Fox News interview, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, took a jab at Harris for not having children, saying the country is being run by “childless cat ladies.” In an interview with CNN’s Jim Acosta, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms called the attacks on Harris “absolutely ridiculous.” “I’m not sure what the campaign strategy is when your intent is to offend everyone but straight white men,” Bottoms said. Eaddy said Black women are expecting this form of “dog whistle politics” and are prepared to defend Harris. “We are going to call out the platforms that give space to racism and sexism and we are going to shut it down,” Eaddy said. Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University, said Harris also will face the challenge of winning over voters who supported Biden in 2020 but aren’t satisfied with his record. Between July 1 and July 21, national polls showed Biden had an average approval rating of 37%, with 58% of respondents disapproving. “If people are unhappy about how Biden has handled policy, she (Harris) is going to be held responsible,” Gillespie said. “She has to craft a message to figure out how to combat that.” But Eaddy said she believes the Biden-Harris administration’s investment in HBCUs and small businesses; its success capping insulin prices for more Americans; and its advocacy for Black maternal health has helped maintain the support of most Black voters. She said she expects Black women will have a significant impact on voter turnout in November. “When we go to polls, we don’t just take ourselves,” Eaddy said. “We take our households, we take our communities, we take our churches, we take our sororities, we take our community groups, we take our brothers, we take our sons. That’s what we have seen and what will continue to see.”"
Tammy Baldwin looks to maintain edge over top of the ticket in battleground Wisconsin | CNN Politics,"Published 2:00 AM EDT, Sun July 28, 2024",2024-07-28T06:00:02.600Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/tammy-baldwin-wisconsin-senate-harris/index.html,"When Kamala Harris held her first campaign rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee last week, one of the most vulnerable senators in the country was on hand to welcome her. Tammy Baldwin, the two-term Wisconsin Democrat, didn’t attend President Joe Biden’s post-debate rally in the state earlier this month. But her appearance with Harris signaled the new excitement Democrats are feeling from their base. That enthusiasm will be key to helping the party defend one of the so-called blue wall states, where Biden won by half a point in 2020 and where Baldwin needs to win if Democrats are to have any shot at retaining their narrow Senate majority. But a reshaped presidential contest won’t change the calculus for Democrats in the most competitive Senate races – many of them in states former President Donald Trump won or narrowly lost in 2020. Baldwin isn’t nearly as endangered as her Democratic colleagues in Montana and Ohio, states Trump twice won big. But she will likely need to rely on some percentage of ticket-splitters to win, which even she has acknowledged may be harder than during her 2018 reelection race given the polarization of today’s politics. “We are the battleground state,” Baldwin told the friendly crowd in Milwaukee on Tuesday before Harris took the stage. Baldwin had spent the two days before Biden ended his reelection bid meeting with older Democrats in southwest Wisconsin, recording the “Pod Save America” podcast in Madison and shaking hands with voters at a fish festival in a conservative suburban county north of Milwaukee – a reflection of her need to both harness the base and reach beyond it. Like many Democratic incumbents this year, Baldwin was already polling better than Biden. Even if Harris improves the overall landscape for Democrats at the top of the ticket – which it is too early to say – Baldwin’s challenge will be to keep up her advantage as her Republican opponent, Eric Hovde, becomes better known. The senator and her allies have painted Hovde as a wealthy bank CEO and frequently knock him for his ties to California. “We have a Green County. We have a Brown County. We do not have an Orange County, Wisconsin,” she says on the stump, citing Hovde previously being named one of the most influential people in the Southern California county. But Hovde, who Republicans believe is a more formidable challenger than Baldwin’s 2018 opponent, has millions of his own money to spend. Brandon Scholz, a former executive director of the state Republican Party, doesn’t see Baldwin’s numbers changing much just because Harris is running. “I think Republicans have underestimated Baldwin over the years,” he said Friday when asked about her ability to overperform the top of the ticket. “She has a very liberal voting record in Washington, no question about it. But she also spends time in Wisconsin and has some Wisconsin-centric legislation that she has pushed.” But he cautioned that it’s still early in the campaign; voters aren’t tuned in yet; and Baldwin has been running much longer than Hovde, who entered the race in February. “It’s gonna take him time to close that gap,” he said. “And he’s got 100 days to do it.” Spectators at last weekend’s Port Fish Days parade in Port Washington along Lake Michigan sprawled over the curb to watch the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies; a trampoline act; and a stream of shiny Corvettes and firetrucks. Whether they wanted to be or not, voters who said “Tammy sucks” were sandwiched next to those who wanted to see her run for president. “Is Hovde that guy who’s from California?” asked 59-year-old Cheryl, who didn’t want to give her full name. “He’s from Wisconsin,” yelled another woman sitting a few chairs away. Baldwin’s strategy has relied on defining Hovde before he defines himself. Besides going after his California connections (he’s the CEO of Sunwest Bank and owns a home in Laguna Beach), her campaign is also attacking him on the air for a string of controversial comments – including saying that most nursing home patients aren’t in a condition to vote. Hovde, who’s also CEO of a prominent Madison-based development company bearing his name, has so far poured $13 million of his money into his Senate campaign – his second after an unsuccessful bid in 2012. He’s responded to Baldwin’s ads with his own spots laying out his Wisconsin roots. But like many GOP challengers this year trying to catch up to Trump’s poll numbers, Hovde is also trying to nationalize the race. After running an ad pressuring Baldwin to say where she stood on Biden after his disastrous debate performance (she never publicly called for the president to bow out of the race), he has pivoted to trying to tie her to the administration, specifically Harris, on inflation and the border. “We deserve better than leaders who bob along while America crumbles,” the narrator in one Hovde ad says over footage of the vice president laughing, with a Baldwin bobblehead featuring throughout the spot. It remains to be seen how that will play out. The Hovde campaign did not make him available to reporters in the state last weekend and did not respond to CNN’s subsequent inquiries about the race. At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee earlier this month, the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm said Hovde had closed the gap in his race more than any of their other Senate recruits, specifically touting his ability to get on TV early because of self-funding. Still, a Fox News poll released Friday showed Baldwin leading Hovde 54% to 43% among registered Wisconsin voters, while there was no clear leader in the presidential race. At least several attendees at the parade in Port Washington – which falls in one of the three GOP-leaning “WOW” counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee, Washington) in the Milwaukee area – said they were voting for Trump because they were Republicans, but hadn’t made up their minds about the Senate race yet. That kind of indecision creates an imperative for Hovde to consolidate the GOP base – and an opportunity for Baldwin to peel off some of those voters. Working her way down the refreshment line at the Port Fish Days festival after the parade, Baldwin didn’t skip a beat when she got to Patrick Barnett, who was wearing a Trump polo shirt. He got a handshake and friendly conversation. “I like her, and she has done a lot of good things,” said Barnett, 65, of nearby Mequon. “But her party has done too much to outweigh that.” Reached by phone on Friday, Barnett said that the process by which Harris ascended to the top of the ticket only confirmed his distaste for the Democratic Party. He recalled voting for Baldwin at least once before and praised her for helping pass bipartisan legislation. “And honestly not voting for her after that wasn’t really on her – it was more, like I say, to do with the party,” he added. But this year, he’s taken issue with the tone of some of Baldwin’s ads going after Hovde’s past statements – including one that features a farmer saying, “Eric Hovde, what the hell is wrong with this guy?” Some 170 miles west of Port Washington, close to the Iowa border, the chatter at the Grant County Democratic picnic gave way to chants of “Tammy, Tammy, Tammy” as soon as the senator walked into the room on July 19, two days before Biden dropped out of the race. Baldwin’s supporters in Platteville – a city that backed Biden but lies in a county that pivoted from Barack Obama to Trump – were fired up, even if there was hesitation about whether Biden could win Wisconsin. “I give him a 50-50 shot,” said 72-year-old Tom Caywood, who didn’t want Biden to step aside. (“Don’t the voters have some say in this?” he asked.) But reached by phone a week later, Caywood said Biden did the right thing — even if he doesn’t like the pressure he thinks the party put on him. And he likes Harris. “She’s very familiar with the role, strong woman, and she’s got a legal background,” he said of the former California attorney general. He likes what she could mean for Baldwin and other down-ballot Democrats too: “Chances are, if they’re going to vote for her for president, they’ll probably just vote straight ticket.” Tracey Roberts said she wanted Biden to make his own decision, but that the presidential race was too close for comfort. “I’m very pleased,” the 66-year-old Platteville resident said by phone a week later, after Biden’s exit from the race. “I think it’ll really change the enthusiasm level – among the people I know, it’s so much higher.” Local parties are feeling it, too. “The amount of enthusiasm I have seen is unprecedented,” said William Garcia, the Democratic Party chair for Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Grant County and is one of just two US House seats seen as competitive in the state. “I’ve had dozens of people contacting us to volunteer. I’ve had people donating money to the local party without us even asking.” Garcia, who also chairs the La Crosse County Democratic Party, said he sees that excitement flowing both ways on the Democratic ballot. “Baldwin does not need presidential coattails to win here in Wisconsin,” he said Friday. “But I think that a lot of people who were going to support Baldwin – those kind of undecided swing voters who were definitely going to support Baldwin but weren’t yet decided about the top of the ticket – I think they’re far more likely to go for Harris now.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail Saturday, continuing to attack each other and drawing a contrast between their visions for the country. Appearing at a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Harris pushed back against the former president’s attacks, saying that he was “resorting to some wild lies about my record” and that some of what he and his running mate JD Vance were saying was “just plain weird.” The presumptive Democratic nominee also made her freedom-focused pitch to voters – highlighting reproductive health and gun violence – and argued that her campaign was the “underdog” in the race. Meanwhile, Trump’s first appearance Saturday was at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville, where he appeared to refer to the Biden administration’s Department of Justice – which has seized significant bitcoin assets – as a “fascist regime.” He also made the case that a Harris administration would be “vicious” to bitcoin investors. At a Minnesota rally Saturday night, both Trump and Vance sharpened their attacks against Harris, focusing on her previous role as San Francisco district attorney to slam her record on the border, economy and crime.  Later in the rally, Trump repeatedly slammed Harris’ political record, saying she “destroyed San Francisco” as district attorney. “A crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead,” he said. Trump also painted Harris as worse than President Joe Biden, saying, “She’s terrible. She’s worse … than he is.” He added later: “He’s losing. Then, they took him out of the fight, and they put in a new fighter. We have a new victim now, Kamala, we have a new victim. We have a brand-new victim. And honestly, she’s a radical left-wing person.”  Former President Donald Trump painted his new chief rival, Kamala Harris, as worse than President Joe Biden at a Saturday night rally, calling her “the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.” Moments into his remarks in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump again blamed a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights earlier in the day on the “incompetent Biden-Harris administration.” He then quickly pivoted to Harris, calling her the “border czar,” as Republicans have been hammering the presumptive Democratic nominee over how she has handled her task of stemming the root causes of migration. “She’s terrible. She’s worse … she’s worse than he is,” Trump said of Harris and Biden. Trump compared Biden to a fighter who was “badly beaten” and taken out of the fight. Trump continued upon earlier remarks by his running mate, JD Vance, as he slammed Harris’ political record, saying that she “destroyed San Francisco” as county district attorney.  “A crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead,” Trump said. Trump went after Harris on topics that included abortion, gun policy, climate change, entitlement programs and inflation. In a less substantive dig, he also mocked Harris’ laugh, claiming that the media was trying to portray her as a “Margaret Thatcher,” referring to the late British prime minister, but that “it’s not gonna happen,” because “Margaret Thatcher didn’t laugh like that.” Though Trump still did partake in his usual mocking of Biden, including by imitating the president playing golf, he acknowledged that the hits weren’t as effective now that Biden had dropped out of the race. Trump also drew a contrast between himself and Harris by recalling the racial justice protests in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis, while Kamala Harris sided with the arsonists and rioters and raised money to bail out the criminals,” he said, referring to a 2020 tweet from Harris encouraging donations to bail out protesters. The fund, in addition to other charitable bail groups, later came under fire after some defendants who were bailed out were arrested for alleged acts of violence.  The Harris campaign released a statement shortly after Trump’s speech concluded, blasting the Republican nominee as “a bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.” Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said Trump “kept clinging to his lies about the 2020 election he lost being ‘rigged,’ rambled about his former opponent and golfing, and made excuses for why he’s afraid to debate Vice President Harris.” Former President Donald Trump targeted his new chief political rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, on Saturday, claiming that the presumptive Democratic nominee wanted to “flood our country with refugees from the Hamas-controlled terrorist epicenter … Gaza, the Gaza Strip.” “She wants to deposit thousands of jihadist sympathizers in Minnesota. You know that. You already have enough. I mean, how the hell do you have these congresspeople elected … Ilhan Omar,” he said at a rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Omar was one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018. Born in Somalia, she and her family fled civil war and sought asylum in the United States in 1995. Omar became an American citizen in 2000 at the age of 17. Trump said that Omar has become a “major voice in Congress” and that “she’s a sick woman, and she’s destroying your state.” “She’s hurting our country. And we shouldn’t be electing people like that,” Trump said, before making baseless claims that the congresswoman wants to make the Midwest similar to the Middle East.   Trump and his allies have previously faced criticism for waging racist attacks against Omar, including for falsely implying in 2020 that the US congresswoman was not American. Trump also on Saturday reiterated his vow to restore a travel ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries and practices that tamp down on refugee resettlement. “We’re not gonna have terrorists in our country. It’s no wonder the Democrat Party and their thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them,” he said. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Saturday sharpened his attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, focusing on her “San Francisco liberal” record on the border, economy and crime.  During a fiery speech at President Donald Trump’s rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Vance used Harris’ 2020 primary run against her, arguing that Democrats rejected her then and would reject her again in November.   Vance also claimed the media “told us that Joe Biden was Abraham Lincoln. And now the media tells us that Kamala Harris is Martin Luther King Jr.” “We all know, she’s not MLK, just as Joe Biden was not Abraham Lincoln. We know that she is a card-carrying member of the San Francisco lunatic fringe,” Vance said of Harris, who previously served as the California city’s district attorney. Repeatedly referring to the vice president as “the border czar,” Vance said if Harris wins, she will not only “give jobs to illegal aliens,” but will provide them “free health care, free tuition, all paid for at your expense.” Harris’ immigration work in the Biden administration has become a central line of attack from Republicans. The vice president’s work, however, focused on long-term diplomatic efforts, while the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security. Vance also defended his and Trump’s loyalty to the country, seemingly in response to Harris saying he “will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country” following his selection as running mate. Former President Donald Trump hosted a Saturday fundraiser that was attended by a Republican bitcoin advocate who has endorsed conspiracy theories about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump posed for a photo alongside Bruce Fenton, a former New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate and vocal cryptocurrency investor, at the fundraiser, which took place ahead of Trump’s remarks at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville. “I told him I believe God is on his side,” Fenton said in a post on X sharing his photo with Trump. Fenton, who served as New Hampshire co-chair for Vivek Ramaswamy’s presidential campaign, previously questioned the 9/11 Commission’s explanation for what happened on September 11. In one social media post, Fenton falsely suggested a building on the World Trade Center complex collapsed “for no reason.” He labeled the official government account of September 11 “laughable” and called the relative lack of video of the plane hitting the Pentagon “extremely suspicious” in other posts. Fenton also drew headlines for calling Israel “an apartheid state” last year while working for Ramaswamy’s GOP primary campaign. Ramaswamy publicly distanced himself from Fenton’s comments at the time. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Vice President Kamala Harris’ platform will likely be in the same vein as that of President Joe Biden, whom she has supported for the past four years. But Harris is expected to put her own stamp and style on matters ranging from abortion to the economy to immigration. Here’s where Harris stands on key issues. Abortion: Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national “reproductive freedoms tour” and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. Climate: Biden has been the most pro-climate president in history, and climate advocates find Harris to be an exciting candidate in her own right. Harris has been a champion on climate and environmental justice for decades. If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the US would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 — a requirement of the Paris climate agreement. Read more on Harris’ views here. Donald Trump appeared to refer the Biden administration’s Justice Department as a “fascist regime” as the former president laid out his plan to create a national bitcoin stockpile by redirecting bitcoin seized by the US government. The Department of Justice has seized significant bitcoin assets during both the Biden and Trump administrations. In 2020, while Trump was president, the US seized $2 million worth of cryptocurrency from terrorist groups in the Middle East. Later that year, the DOJ seized more than $1 billion in bitcoin linked to Silk Road, the underground criminal market place founded by Ross Ulbricht, who is now serving a life sentence. Trump has repeatedly promised to commute Ulbricht’s sentence, and he reiterated that promise during his remarks in Nashville. Former President Donald Trump made a series of cryptocurrency-friendly policy commitments during remarks at a bitcoin convention Saturday, including promising to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and creating a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” Trump said if reelected he would redirect bitcoin seized by the US Department of Justice into what he called “a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans,” one of a number of promises he made to cryptocurrency investors at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville. Trump repeated the promise to fire the SEC chair “on Day 1,” earning a standing ovation, to which the former president quipped: “I didn’t know he was that unpopular.” Trump also promised to “immediately” establish a “bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council,” which he said would provide “transparent regulatory guidance” for the cryptocurrency sector.   The Republican nominee also warned that bitcoin investors in the audience will be “crushed” if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected. Some background: For a time, Trump would have made for an unlikely headliner at a cryptocurrency confab. As president, he declared bitcoin “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever,” Trump wrote on Twitter in 2019. “It is called the United States Dollar!” But Saturday marked the culmination of a total reversal on the issue during the former president’s latest White House bid. Despite cryptocurrency’s troubling recent history and his own past reservations, Trump has fully embraced the hype and hopes of the nascent industry. His campaign now accepts bitcoin donations — and has collected about $4 million worth, a source with knowledge of his fundraising said.  Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Houston on Thursday to attend funeral services for Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who died earlier this month after a battle with pancreatic cancer, Harris’ office confirmed to CNN. The news was first reported by NBC News.  Following the Democratic congresswoman’s death, Harris issued a statement describing her as “a tenacious advocate for justice, a tireless fighter for the people of Houston and the people of America, and a dear friend for many years.” The vice president said she bonded with Jackson over the years, giving Harris the “opportunity to work closely with her on many issues and to observe her leadership firsthand.” The two were also both members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation’s first historically Black sorority. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt on Saturday defended vice presidential nominee JD Vance amid the backlash he’s faced this week for previous comments.  Rubio was on the shortlist of candidates Trump was considering to be his running mate before he picked Vance, an Ohio senator. Minutes after Rubio’s post, Schmitt chimed in as well, using similar language to defend Vance.  Vance has faced backlash, including from actor Jennifer Aniston, over recently resurfaced comments he made in 2021 about “childless cat ladies.” In a 2021 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s former Fox News show, Vance, who was then a candidate for the Ohio Senate, told Carlson that the US was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Vance on Friday tried to defend those comments, saying his criticism was directed at the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family” — not at those who don’t or can’t have children. Vice President Kamala Harris praised the power of young people and pledged to earn their vote in prerecorded remarks Saturday to a summit held by Voters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z organizing group. In her remarks, Harris also talked about her “Fight for Our Freedoms” college tour, during which she convened young leaders to hear about the issues that mattered to them. Harris’ campaign team began conducting outreach to several youth grassroots organizations shortly after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race last week. Some of Harris’ campaign staff, including Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director, were expected to attend the Voters of Tomorrow Summit in Atlanta, where hundreds of youth activists, content creators and grassroots organizations gathered to discuss the November election. Democrats’ substitution of Vice President Kamala Harris for President Joe Biden on the ballot in November obviously resets the presidential race. It could also have a major impact on House and Senate races. Both chambers of Congress are narrowly divided; Republicans hold a slim advantage in the House and Democrats narrowly control the Senate. Either chamber could go either way in November. I went to Simone Pathe, a senior Washington editor for CNN Politics and the author of an occasional series, “The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip.” Read the most recent version here. Does Harris change the Senate equation? WOLF: The presidential race got a total reset when President Biden dropped out. Does that reset anything in the battle for the Senate? PATHE: The extent to which the change at the top of the ticket shifts Senate races will be one of the most interesting things to watch over the coming months. Remember that a big part of the pressure on Biden to step aside was the warning from Democratic lawmakers about his drag on down-ballot races. So now the big question is whether the Democratic brand itself is toxic or whether that was a particular vulnerability attached to Biden. It’s still early days of this new political reality, but there are some early signals of how Harris as the nominee could be giving Democratic incumbents a sense of relief. Read more here on the state of play for the House and Senate and how the shake-up in the presidential race might change things. Former President Donald Trump condemned a deadly rocket attack in northern Israel on Saturday, calling it “terrible” while insisting it “never would have happened” under his administration. “You probably heard that Israel was just attacked, very severely attacked,” Trump said at the beginning of his remarks at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville. Trump cited early indications from Israeli officials that blamed the attack on the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which has rejected the accusation. The former president, who met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, frequently says on the campaign trail that Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel wouldn’t have happened if he were president. At least 11 people, including children, were killed when multiple rockets hit a village in the Golan Heights on Saturday in what Israel described as the deadliest attack against it since October 7. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across the border for almost 10 months, and regional leaders have been warning the conflict is reaching a boiling point. The White House on Saturday also condemned the attack, saying in a statement, “Our hearts go out to the families of those who lost loved ones today, and we are praying for a speedy recovery for those who have been injured.” Second gentleman Doug Emhoff shared personal stories of both his and his wife’s families at a Saturday festival in Wisconsin for Hmong Americans, a significant minority population in the battleground state. Emhoff told the story of Harris’ late mother, breast cancer researcher Shyamala Gopalan, who immigrated to the US from India and whom the vice president often speaks about passionately on the campaign trail. The Hmong population is the largest Asian American ethnic group in Wisconsin, according to 2020 census data. Many Hmong people found refuge in the US during the Vietnam War and other violence in the region. Emhoff said Harris’ vision for the country is “a future where everyone has a place.” Emhoff was joined by Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, allies of Harris who appeared with her in Milwaukee at her first campaign event after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race. Vice President Kamala Harris fought back Saturday against former President Donald Trump’s new attacks against her, saying that he is pushing “wild lies” and that some of his statements are “just plain weird.” Her remarks came at a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where she also made her freedom-focused pitch to voters — highlighting reproductive health and gun violence — and argued her campaign is the “underdog” in the race. Harris made her freedom-focused pitch to voters at the event — highlighting reproductive health and gun violence — and argued her campaign is the “underdog” in the race. In one notable moment, she seemed to allude to President Joe Biden’s comments on passing the torch to a younger generation. She continued by reiterating her call for gun safety measures, including universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. And in a part of her speech that led to the loudest cheers, Harris attacked Trump on reproductive health care. “We who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans,” she said. “We trust women to make decisions about their own bodies.” Harris also argued her campaign is the “underdog,” describing the recent surge in financial support and volunteers since Biden ended his reelection bid as “momentum” building.  Former President Donald Trump’s campaign on Saturday released a video attacking Vice President Kamala Harris for what it’s calling “her soft on crime policies” — specifically highlighting a 2020 tweet in which Harris encouraged donations to a fund that bailed out protesters in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis. The Minnesota Freedom Fund is one of several US charities dedicated to helping low-income defendants post bail that boomed in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. However, the fund — in addition to other charitable bail groups — later came under fire after some defendants it bailed out were later arrested for alleged acts of violence.  The video, which will be shown Saturday night during Trump’s rally with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in St. Cloud, Minnesota, opens with a photo of Harris’ June 2020 tweet.  “If you’re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,” the tweet says. The narrator goes on to list some of the defendants the fund helped post bail for who later went on to be arrested again for alleged crimes including assault, rape, kidnapping and attempted murder.  Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa called the Trump campaign’s claim “a desperate lie from a desperate campaign that can’t change the facts.” Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, one of the elected leaders being considered as Vice President Kamala Harris’ potential running mate, rallied with supporters in St. Paul Saturday afternoon and marveled at the developments over the last week in politics. At a news conference following the event, the governor said he was “honored to be in the conversation” about potentially being Harris’ running mate, but that ultimately it is her decision to make. “This is the vice president’s pick and I’ll tell you what, I trust her judgement,” Walz said. “I trust how she picks. And so it’s an exciting time, I think, for the country, and you are hearing a lot of voices out there talking about Democratic policies.”   Walz went on to blast Republicans as “weird” and “a threat democracy.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign criticized Elon Musk on Saturday after the billionaire Tesla CEO and X owner shared a video with doctored or fake audio of Harris purportedly describing herself as the “ultimate DEI hire.” Musk re-shared the video — originally posted by a separate X account, which labeled it as a parody — for his more than 190 million followers on Friday, with the caption, “This is amazing.” The video had been viewed more than 73 million times by Saturday morning, according to data from X. “I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire,” a voice falsely purporting to be Harris says in the video. It goes on to describe Harris and Biden as “puppet(s)” of the “deep state.”  CNN ran the fake Harris audio through an AI detection tool on Saturday, which found there was “substantial evidence” the voice had been generated using AI. A new line of attack: Republicans have used the term “DEI,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, to attack Harris and imply she rose to her status as the presumptive Democratic nominee on the basis of her race and gender. Critics say that amounts to a racist dog whistle, including Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost, who told CNN’s Jim Acosta this week that Republicans were using the “DEI” line as a “racial slur.” Combating misinformation: Bipartisan concern over AI-generated election interference has prompted a patchwork of laws across the country, as state lawmakers seek to blunt the impact of misinformation and keep deepfakes from overwhelming voters. More than a dozen Republican and Democrat-led states have enacted legislation this year to regulate the use of deepfakes – realistic fake video, audio and other content created with AI – in campaigns. The laws come amid warnings from the Department of Homeland Security over the ability for deepfakes to mislead voters. CNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is sharply criticizing former President Donald Trump’s speech at the Turning Point Action Believers’ Summit on Friday night. Harris spokesperson James Singer issued a statement on what the campaign called “Trump’s strange speech.” “America can do better than the bitter, bizarre, and backward looking delusions of criminal Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris offers a vision for America’s future focused on freedom, opportunity, and security,” the spokesperson added. The statement comes after Trump called Harris a “bum,” complained about President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race, and told Christians at the conservative event that they “won’t have to vote anymore” if they get him reelected this November, because the country will be “fixed” after four years. Former President Donald Trump sought to appeal to Christian voters, who he claimed tend to vote in low numbers, at a conservative Christian event on Friday, telling attendees they “won’t have to vote anymore” if they just get him reelected this November. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on his Friday remarks. The former president claimed at the event that, “Christians are a group that’s known not to vote very much.” “You have to go out at least this election, and just get us into that beautiful White House,” he said. “You have tremendous power, you just don’t know that.” Trump campaign comments: Asked for clarification on Trump’s remarks and what would be “fixed” under his presidency, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said, “President Trump was talking about uniting this country and bringing prosperity to every American, as opposed to the divisive political environment that has sowed so much division and even resulted in an assassination attempt.” Previous statements: The former president’s appeal echos similar comments he has made during his reelection campaign, including last month when he said “I don’t care” whether Christian voters cast a ballot at all in the 2028 presidential election.  “You gotta get out and vote. Just this time. In four years, you don’t have to vote, OK? In four years don’t vote, I don’t care,” he said at a Faith and Freedom Coalition event in June. This post has been updated with a statement from Trump’s campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris, whose warp-speed campaign launch has upended the 2024 race, is less than two weeks away from naming her running mate. That’s the timeline the presumptive Democratic nominee has given to a team of lawyers and advisers who are conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, people familiar with the process tell CNN, with a goal of announcing a nominee before August 7. The truncated process means that nearly four years after Harris answered the call from Joe Biden to be his running mate — on August 11, 2020 — she intends to shape a Democratic ticket of her own. Who is under consideration: Democrats close to the process say the roster of leading contenders being vetted still includes North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sources say. Read the bios for those candidates and more potential contenders here. Former President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social Saturday that he will continue to hold outdoor rallies after surviving the assassination attempt at his event in Butler, Pennsylvania, this month. CNN previously reported that the US Secret Service has urged the Trump campaign against holding outdoor rallies because of the security risk they pose. On Friday, Trump announced he would be doing another rally in Butler. Senior advisers said plans for that rally were still under discussion. The Secret Service declined to substantively comment Saturday when asked about Trump continuing to hold outdoor rallies. “Ensuring the safety and security of our protectees is our highest priority. In the interest of maintaining operational integrity, we are not able to comment on specifics of our protective means or methods,” Anthony Guglielmi, the agency’s chief of communications, told CNN in a statement. This post has been updated with a response from the Secret Service. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign in Arizona says it will be opening a new field office in south Tucson, as the presumptive Democratic nominee tries to court Latino voters.  The campaign already has an office in the Midtown neighborhood, and now plans to open their south Tucson office in the coming days. The less-than-week old Harris campaign inherited the dozen Biden campaign offices across the battleground state, with more than 80 full-time staff staying on. “Southern Arizona is the way to win Arizona, and the way into the White House. So southern Arizona has the enthusiasm and the votes to be able to win Arizona for Vice President Harris,” Romero said during Friday night’s event. For a time, Donald Trump would have made for an unlikely headliner at a cryptocurrency confab. As president, Trump declared bitcoin “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” He cautioned that crypto assets helped facilitate illegal underground markets. But on Saturday, Trump will address the cryptocurrency industry’s largest annual gathering in Nashville — not as a cynic, but as one of its best-known supporters. It marks the culmination of a total reversal on the issue during the former president’s latest White House bid. Despite cryptocurrency’s troubling recent history and his own past reservations, Trump has fully embraced the hype and hopes of the nascent industry. His campaign now accepts bitcoin donations, and has collected about $4 million worth, a source with knowledge of his fundraising said. He has also attacked the Biden administration’s efforts to regulate the industry as a “war on crypto,” without acknowledging the massive fraud schemes that have shattered public confidence in digital currencies. And he has vowed as president to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the United States. “Otherwise, the other countries are going to have it,” Trump said earlier this month in Wisconsin. The industry, in turn, has embraced Trump. Its leaders and investors have donated millions of dollars to his campaign and aligned political committees. They are cheerleaders for his candidacy to their sizable online audiences and are now providing him a platform to speak directly to 20,000 of their most engaged followers expected at this year’s Bitcoin Conference. Read more here on cryptocurrency’s largest annual gathering in Nashville. ABC News is continuing preparations for an upcoming presidential debate, despite former President Donald Trump saying he won’t consider participating in a debate until the Democratic Party formally chooses its nominee.  “Full steam ahead,” an ABC network source told CNN on Friday. Despite ABC’s preparations for the debate, set to be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, the network’s plan could still be upended like so many other institutions and traditions this year.   Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, later told reporters she had agreed to the September 10 debate and accused Trump of “backpedaling.”  Even before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the campaigns did away with the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, which had arranged the debates for decades, instead agreeing to debates directly arranged by television networks. A person familiar with the matter said Friday that NBC is “in ongoing discussion with the campaigns,” but it’s unclear whether that involves plans for a debate, or other events like town halls with the candidates. Former president Donald Trump unleashed a stump speech against Vice President Harris Friday, referring to her as “a bum,” questioning her support for Israel and claiming she would pack the US Supreme Court and defund the police.  Trump mocked President Joe Biden for changing his mind about stepping out of the race and shifted his focus to his likely new opponent, Harris. “Together, four months from now we are going to defeat Kamala Harris, who a short time ago strongly fought to defund the police and the radical left Democrat Party,” he said. Read a fact check on some of Trump’s initial attacks on Harris here. Defending prior comments about childless adults that have resurfaced and faced backlash this week, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said his criticism was directed at the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family” — not at those who don’t or can’t have children. “This is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child,” Vance said. Directly responding to his comment in 2021 on Fox News that the country is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies,” Vance said he was being sarcastic and the substance of what he said has been lost. “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats. I’ve got nothing against dogs. I’ve got one dog,” Vance said. “People are focusing so much on the sarcasm, and not on the substance of what I actually said and the substance of what I said, Megan, I’m sorry. It’s true. It is true that we become anti-family. It is true that the left has become anti-child.” Former President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. It comes on the heels of the prime minister’s address to Congress and meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, conveyed a forcefulness on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister. Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach. Trump said Harris was “disrespectful to Israel” in her remarks to reporters after her meeting with Netanyahu. “I think her remarks were disrespectful,” Trump told CNN’s Kristen Holmes on Friday. “They weren’t very nice pertaining to Israel. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.” Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, Harris’ office rejected on Friday the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the vice president’s remarks could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach. “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in The Times of Israel. “President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”"
Analysis: How the Harris 2024 shake-up could affect House and Senate races | CNN Politics,"Published 5:00 PM EDT, Sat July 27, 2024",2024-07-27T21:00:02.428Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/politics/harris-house-senate-what-matters/index.html,"Democrats’ substitution of Vice President Kamala Harris for President Joe Biden on the ballot in November obviously resets the presidential race. It could also have a major impact on House and Senate races. Both chambers of Congress are narrowly divided at the moment; Republicans hold a slim advantage in the House and Democrats narrowly control the Senate. Either chamber could go either way in November. I went to Simone Pathe, a senior Washington editor for CNN Politics and the author of an occasional series, “The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip.” Read the most recent version here. We talked by email about the state of play for the House and Senate and how the shake-up in the presidential race might change things. WOLF: The presidential race got a total reset when President Biden dropped out. Does that reset anything in the battle for the Senate? PATHE: The extent to which the change at the top of the ticket shifts Senate races will be one of the most interesting things to watch over the coming months. Remember that a big part of the pressure on Biden to step aside was the warning from Democratic lawmakers about his drag on down-ballot races. So now the big question is whether the Democratic brand itself is toxic or whether that was a particular vulnerability attached to Biden. It’s still early days of this new political reality, but there are some early signals of how Harris as the nominee could be giving Democratic incumbents a sense of relief. For starters, the new CNN poll released Wednesday shows Harris doing better against former President Donald Trump than Biden did with some key demographic groups — young voters, female voters and Black voters. (The topline showed no clear leader between Harris and Trump, but that in itself could be good news for Democrats given that the margin-of-error finding was closer than some earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.) You can also look at candidates’ behavior. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who’s running for reelection in a key battleground, didn’t attend Biden’s first post-debate rally in Madison. But she was very publicly with Harris on Tuesday — greeting her as she boarded Air Force Two and delivering remarks at her rally in Milwaukee. I was covering Baldwin in Wisconsin in the days before Biden announced he was dropping out of the race, and she was clearly in a bind. Unlike some of her fellow vulnerable colleagues, Baldwin had not called for Biden to step aside, but reiterated that she’d heard concerns from her constituents. After Biden exited, she quickly endorsed Harris and called Biden’s decision “an incredible act of patriotism.” Not everyone has publicly endorsed Harris, though — and that’s telling too. Sen. Jon Tester, the most vulnerable incumbent up for reelection, has not. He’s running in a very different state from Baldwin. (Wisconsin is No. 8 on CNN’s list of seats most likely to flip, whereas Montana is No. 2.) Given Trump’s strength in Montana, Tester was always going to have a tough race regardless of who the party nominates for president, and it’s not necessarily clear that the voter groups among whom Harris is doing better than Biden will help Democrats all that much in a conservative state like Montana, where she’ll be tarred as a California liberal. The Senate GOP campaign arm put out a memo this week in which it acknowledged that attacks on Biden’s mental fitness didn’t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. For that reason, the NRSC (National Republican Senatorial Committee) argued, Harris may be a bigger drag on Senate Democrats because they can paint her policies as extreme. (Calling her a “border czar,” which, as our colleague Priscilla Alvarez noted, hasn’t actually been her role, fits right into the biggest themes of GOP attack ads — the border and immigration.) Even in a more evenly divided state like Pennsylvania, the GOP Senate nominee is already digging up 2019 footage of Harris to cast her as “the most liberal (presidential) nominee in US history.” WOLF: If the Senate map this year favors Republicans, is it fair to say that the House map favors one party or the other this year? PATHE: The House playing field is very different from the Senate’s. The Senate map favors the GOP because the seats that are up for reelection are either in Trump states or closely contested battlegrounds. But in the House, where there are many fewer competitive districts than there used to be, much of the playing field is concentrated in two traditionally blue states — New York and California. (There are others scattered around in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and New Mexico, among other places.) The low-hanging fruit for both parties are the races in so-called crossover districts – where a Republican represents a district Biden won or a Democrat represents a district Trump won. And because Republicans are on defense in more of those crossover seats — and there are so many of them in California and New York during a presidential year — there’s an argument to be made that Democrats could pick up the net gain of four seats they need right there. But of course, it’s more complicated than that because Democrats also represent crossover districts that they have to defend. So even if they pick up seats in California, for example, they could also lose seats in Maine or Alaska districts, for example, where Trump is likely to win. WOLF: The House is just as closely divided as the Senate. What are the dynamics that will affect control of the House? PATHE: House races are typically more nationalized than Senate races because the candidates are lesser known; therefore, it’s harder for them to separate themselves from their party and the top of the ticket. But partisanship isn’t everything — that’s how we got to the current situation, where Republicans won some New York and California districts in 2022 that voted for Biden in 2020. Still, the dynamics that affect control of the House are likely to be shaped by the national environment in the fall — what does the presidential race look like? Are economic concerns still top of mind? Is there some new foreign crisis making voters feel uneasy? A lot can happen in three-and-a-half months. But, of course, candidate quality and fundraising also matter. A bad candidate without money will have a harder time taking advantage of favorable national winds. And on the flip side, strong candidates with independent brands can withstand headwinds. WOLF: Senate races in Ohio and Montana feature sitting Democratic senators running in states that go reliably red in presidential elections. Is there any indication voters are interested in ticket-splitting this year? PATHE: Yes, there are lots of indications, with the caveat that there hasn’t been much Senate polling that meets CNN standards that captures the tumultuous past month in American politics. But even before Biden dropped out of the race, Democratic senators were consistently outperforming the top of the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized elections, that separation has been one of the most fascinating dynamics of the 2024 election, and there are a few explanations for what could be going on. Many of these incumbents, particularly Tester and Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, are very well known in their states. In Ohio, for example, Brown’s campaign is running an ad that features voters imitating the senator’s gravelly voice — it speaks to just how familiar he is there. And in Montana, Tester doesn’t hesitate to portray himself as a seven-fingered dirt farmer. Those strong brands are the theory of the case for how Democrats think they can hold on in those states — especially against GOP recruits that they view as flawed. And this is where money comes in. Democrats’ significant fundraising advantage has allowed them to define themselves and their opponents early in the race. Brown, for example, spent a whopping $18 million in the last quarter (which ended June 30). In fact, as our ace campaign finance team has noted, four of the party’s most endangered incumbents — Tester, Baldwin, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jacky Rosen of Nevada – spent at least $10 million during that three-month period. That could change as Republican recruits —– many of whom are wealthy businessmen — put more of their own money into these races and become better known. There’s also a theory, which would fly in the face of the trend away from ticket-splitting, that some voters who are planning to vote for Trump may be looking for a check on the executive branch and are therefore entertaining voting for Democratic senators. But that’s just a theory, and it’ll have to be tested now that there’s a new presidential matchup. WOLF: The presidential primary process is over, but we’re still in the thick of statewide primaries for House and Senate races. What are the looming questions that will be answered in the key states where primaries remain? PATHE: The top Senate matchups are effectively set, even if there are a few outstanding primaries in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. The biggest-name Republicans in each of those races, for example, has the backing of the national GOP and, more importantly for a primary, Trump. Remaining House primaries should be a bit more consequential because not all matchups in competitive seats are settled yet. WOLF: Democrats are expected to lose one Senate seat, in West Virginia, no matter what happens. Is there any race where they are on offense and could conceivably make up for that likely loss? PATHE: Democrats are really only on offense in two places — Texas and Florida. Both had been at the bottom of CNN’s list of seats most likely to flip until April, when Maryland (another GOP target) was added to the list and Florida fell off. Florida isn’t necessarily off the table for Democrats — GOP Sen. Rick Scott, despite his millions, has never won election by more than about a point. And Democrats hope that an abortion measure on the ballot could help former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell defeat him. But the party’s better prospect is in Texas, where Rep. Colin Allred is putting up a formidable challenge to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. Allred’s campaign has repeatedly raised more than Cruz’s principal campaign account, and there’s been some polling that shows a close contest for a state that votes red. Cruz led by just 3 points, for example, in a recent University of Houston/YouGov poll. However, we’ve seen Democratic challenges in red states generate enormous fundraising and energy before — and then fall short at the ballot box. Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 race against Cruz and Jaime Harrison’s 2020 race against South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham come to mind. Democrats argue that Allred — who first came to Congress by flipping a GOP-held seat — is a different kind of candidate, but it’ll be worth watching to see whether that momentum can translate to votes. WOLF: If there’s one Senate race that could be a bellwether for the country as a whole, which one is it and why? PATHE: That’s a great question — I’d say maybe Michigan. It’s one of the so-called “blue wall” states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden won back for Democrats in 2020. And it’s also an open seat this year because Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring. That means there isn’t an incumbent who starts with the clear advantage because of statewide name ID, which I think makes the race a better sample of how the national winds are blowing down ballot. Still, neither candidate is unfamiliar either — it’s likely to be a matchup between Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and former House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers."
The US economy Kamala Harris inherits and how she may run on it | CNN Business,"Published 2:00 PM EDT, Sat July 27, 2024",2024-07-27T18:00:02.886Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/economy/economy-harris-presidential-race/index.html,"President Joe Biden arrived at the White House in 2021 at a time of heightened chaos and uncertainty across a country reeling from the pandemic. Biden used his inauguration address to promote unity, in hopes of delivering a nation that’s “stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future.” But, as Biden has acknowledged throughout his time in office, there’s more work to be done. That task could now fall to Vice President Kamala Harris, who inherits Biden’s campaign promises to rebuild the middle class, invest in infrastructure, boost domestic manufacturing and lower health care costs. Since Harris kicked off her presidential campaign, there’s been a string of good news for the US economy. Strong GDP numbers on Thursday — and the possibility that the US is pulling off the rare feat of bringing down inflation without throwing the economy into reverse — give Harris another point to bring out on the campaign trail in her effort to persuade Americans to give her the White House in November. And on Friday, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge fell closer to the central bank’s 2% target — all but cementing a rate cut in September. Harris will have Biden’s mostly strong economy to run on. Still, one of her biggest challenges is lifting the negative feelings many Americans have about the economy, stemming from sharply higher prices for everything from groceries to rent over the past four years. It remains to be seen whether those perceptions will improve now that Biden is out of the race. Here’s where the economy stands as the presidential race heads into its final 100 days. When Biden took office, inflation was barely noticeable, with consumer prices rising 1.4% annually. That quickly took a turn for the worse. By June 2021, Biden’s sixth month in office, the nation’s inflation rate jumped to more than 5%. A year later, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring, inflation hit 9.1%, the highest level in over 40 years. But much of that inflation was also the product of hefty spending under both Trump and Biden administrations in the wake of the pandemic. Inflation has since cooled down a lot, and for the first time since the start of the pandemic, prices fell last month. But, on the whole, Americans are paying 20% more for goods and services compared to January 2021, according to Consumer Price Index data. After the Federal Reserve hiked interest rate hikes to a 23-year high to stamp out inflation, the economy — eventually — started to run at a slower pace. However, it hasn’t slipped into a recession, which is one of the risks that comes with the Fed lifting rates so rapidly. Gross domestic product, a measure of all the goods and services produced in the economy, was solid in the first half of the year. GDP rose at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal swings, according to Commerce Department figures released Thursday. In April 2020, as the US economy came to a screeching halt due to the pandemic, the nation’s unemployment rate soared to nearly 15%, its highest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking it in 1948. By the start of Biden’s term, the unemployment rate had already fallen to 6.4%. But for much of his presidency, the ongoing strength of the labor market defied expectations. The unemployment rate stayed below 4% for more than two years, the longest such stretch of time since the 1960s. But it’s since gone above 4% as cracks in the labor market are starting to form. The Biden-spearheaded bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act put more than $1.6 trillion toward rebuilding and modernizing infrastructure, fueling clean energy investments and bolstering America’s manufacturing industry. While it will take years, if not decades, to realize the full effects of the sweeping legislation — the funding, construction and implementation processes take time — the US economy has already seen some of the near-term effects, including booms in industrial facilities, electric vehicles and manufacturing jobs and the start of long-awaited municipal projects to replace bridges and lead pipes. Biden’s energy legacy has generally been tied to clean energy, not fossil fuels. His 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included more than $350 billion in support for electric vehicles, charging stations and similar items. He was often seen as anti-oil, attacking oil companies for record gasoline prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But domestic oil production hit a record in 2023, with a daily average of 12.9 million barrels of oil produced. That’s more than any country has ever produced. So far 2024 production is up another 3%. Dubbed the most “pro-union president in our lifetimes” by the AFL-CIO, Biden has often been a good friend to organized labor. His National Labor Relations Board has frequently sided with unions and workers. During the 2023 United Auto Workers strike he became the first sitting president to join a picket line. Union membership and organizing rose during his tenure, and unions won double-digit pay hikes for close to one million members last year. But he and Congress also imposed unpopular contracts on freight railroad unions, rather than let them go on strike. And even some labor allies expressed concerns about his reelection bid. From forgiving millions of student loans to clamping down on junk fees, the Biden administration has focused on ways to save consumers billions of dollars every year. That includes a campaign to eliminate or cap “hidden junk” fees and require businesses to be transparent about all fees up front. The Biden administration also finalized a rule to make it easier for airline passengers to get prompt, automatic cash refunds when flights are canceled or significantly changed and to see upfront information about fees for baggage and changing flights. His administration also provided economic relief for US families during the pandemic: Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, which represented one of the largest federal efforts to reduce poverty in the last half-century. Among a bevy of economic relief measures, ARPA temporarily expanded the child tax credit, which cut the US child poverty rate nearly in half. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration capped monthly insulin costs for Medicare enrollees at just $35, among other drug-cost-lowering provisions. His administration has also reduced student loan debt so that, as Biden put it, higher education can be “a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.” To date, his administration has canceled $168 billion in student loan debt for 4.8 million Americans. The Biden administration led a regulatory crackdown on some of the biggest names in corporate America, particularly challenging the market dominance of tech giants Apple, Amazon, Meta and Google. Together, the Federal Trade Commission, led by Lina Khan, and the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, led by Jonathan Kanter, sued aggressively to block corporate mergers, spearheading an attempt to fulfill Biden’s campaign promise to curb what he framed as corporate greed driving prices higher. The agencies took big swings, throttling proposed deals among major grocery chains, airlines and pharmaceutical companies. It wasn’t a perfect record — the FTC notched some notable losses, including its effort to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard. And many efforts, including the DOJ’s landmark case against Apple, could be tied up in litigation for years. Biden has taken a largely protectionist stance toward the tech industry, including signing a high-profile bill in April 2024 to ban Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok unless it finds a new owner, citing national security concerns. He also gave a huge boost to domestic chip production and research with the CHIPS and Science Act, which passed in 2022 and enjoyed bipartisan support, as part of a bid to help the US regain its position as a leading semiconductor chip manufacturer. But his reception in Silicon Valley was less than friendly as his administration gave more scrutiny to Big Tech mergers. In 2023, the Justice Department and FTC unveiled new guidelines aimed at blocking deals thought to be anticompetitive. Harris, by contrast, wants to become the first president from Silicon Valley and has received a mostly warm reception from the tech industry. Here’s how the stock market performed during each year of President Biden’s term. 2021: The S&P 500 jumped 27%. The stock market prevailed once again despite the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. But investors began bracing for the possibility that the Fed could hike rates for the first time since March 2018 and end the era of “easy money.” 2022: The S&P 500 nosedived 19%. Stocks fell as the Fed began quickly hiking near-zero interest rates to tame wayward inflation, stoking worries that high borrowing costs could eat into corporate profits. 2023: The S&P 500 popped 24%. Stocks logged a powerful year despite the Fed’s continued rate-hiking campaign. That was largely thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, which led to a surge in seven key tech stocks, known as the Magnificent Seven, poised to be at the forefront of the revolution. 2024: The S&P 500 is up about 16% for the year after notching repeated record highs. Strong corporate earnings this year have helped push stocks higher, as well as the continued AI boom. Cooling inflation data in recent months and hopes the Fed will soon cut rates have sparked more euphoria, though stocks have tumbled in recent sessions."
Kamala Harris praised ‘defund the police’ movement in June 2020 radio interview | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:15 AM EDT, Sat July 27, 2024",2024-07-26T09:00:03.693Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kfile-kamala-harris-praised-defund-the-police-movement-in-june-2020/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amidst nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign. Harris said in the June radio interview the movement “rightly” called out the amount of money spent on police departments instead of community services such as education, housing, and healthcare, emphasizing that more police did not equate to more public safety. “This whole movement is about rightly saying, we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,” Harris said on a New York-based radio program “Ebro in the Morning” on June 9, 2020, adding that US cities were “militarizing police” but “defunding public schools.” Harris made her comments just weeks after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer galvanized the “defund” movement among progressive activists. At the time, Harris was six months removed from ending her own presidential campaign and was still two months away from being tapped as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee. In an interview a day earlier, Harris also lauded Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for his decision to slash $150 million from the police budget and move it into social services. As Harris works to replace Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee following his decision to drop out of the 2024 race, the newly unearthed interview could complicate her strategy of highlighting her history as a tough on crime prosecutor in a potential matchup against Donald Trump, who is facing numerous legal challenges, including multiple felony convictions. Before she was elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris spent seven years as the district attorney in San Francisco before serving as California’s attorney general for six years. Mitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Biden-Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, on Friday walked back Harris’ 2020 statements, saying Harris meant that she supports being “tough and smart on crime.” “Her position has always been that you can both be tough and smart on crime, and it requires funding police, but it also requires funding rehabilitation and things that might criminal justice system safer. You can do both,” Landrieu told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.” “Our actions indicate that she wants to fund the police, but she wants to do the other things as well,” Landrieu said. After June 2020, Harris rarely if at all mentioned the “defund the police” movement. The Biden campaign later tried to clarify after adding her to the ticket that she supported funding the police. But in June 2020, Harris argued the “defund” movement was correct to examine police budgets, and also talked about police departments needing to be demilitarized. “We need to have this conversation and critically examine and understand this is not working,” Harris said on “Ebro in the Morning.” “It’s not working. So, this is an important conversation and not just a conversation – cause to your earlier point, can’t just be about talk. It has to be about forcing change.” “And this is why, you know, I was out there with folks and we’ll, any movement, any progress we have gained has been because people took to the streets,” Harris added. A day before her “Ebro in the Morning” radio interview, Harris appeared on MSNBC where she explicitly called to “demilitarize police departments” and said it was “backward” to think more police officers created more safety. “Part of what we have to do here is also look at the militarization of police departments and, and the kind of money that is going to that. And we need to demilitarize police departments,” Harris said. “At its core, one of the issues that I think we should all agree on is that it is old thinking. It is outdated and is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.” In another interview on “The View” on June 8, 2020, Harris engaged in an exchange on defunding the police where she directly suggested the funding for police could be used in other social programs. “In many cities in America, over one third of their city budget goes to police. So, we have to have this conversation. What are we doing? What about the money going to social services? What about the money going to helping people with job training? What about helping with the mental health issues that communities are being plagued with for which we’re putting no resources?” Also on June 8, 2020, Harris praised the mayor of Los Angeles for removing money from police and investing it in social services in an interview on “Good Morning America. “ “I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he’s done,” she said. In the same interview, Harris added she didn’t support “getting rid” of police. “We have to be practical about this,” she said. At the time “defund the police” became a rallying cry for protestors, with some arguing that police departments should be abolished altogether. Others, like Harris, framed it as a means of questioning spending on police budgets and investing more in areas like education, mental health services, and affordable housing as essential for creating safer communities. “Defund the police, the issue behind it is that we need to reimagine how we are creating safety,” Harris said in the June 2020 radio interview. “And when you have many cities that have one third of their entire city budget focused on policing, we know that is not the smart way and the best way or the right way to achieve safety.” “For too long, the status quo thinking has been, you get more safety by putting more cops on the street,” Harris added. “Well, that’s wrong, because by the way, if you wanna look at upper middle class suburban neighborhoods, they don’t have that patrol car.” Harris, citing suburban communities, said that true safety comes from well-funded schools, homeownership, thriving small businesses, and access to health services – not increased police presence. Despite the nationwide movement, polling showed reducing police budgets remained heavily unpopular, even in 2020. A Pew Research poll found that just 25% of adults supported reducing police budgets that year and, by 2021, that support had decreased to 15%, with 47% of adults supporting more police spending. After Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate in August 2020, the Biden campaign tried to make it clear she opposed defunding the police – and said she supported increasing police funding. “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,” Sabrina Singh, Harris’ then-press secretary said in October 2020. “Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.” According to a POLITICO-Morning Consult poll published in mid-June 2020, almost 60% of registered voters supported major reforms or a complete overhaul to police departments in 2020, but only 29% backed the “defund the police” movement. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time of the protests in the summer of 2020,  made clear repeatedly throughout his campaign that he opposed the “defund” movement – saying he supported increasing spending for both police and social services. In a joint interview on ABC News from August 2020 featuring both Biden and Harris, Biden answered the question on whether the campaign supported the “defund the police” movement. “I don’t want to defund police departments. I think they need more help. The vast majority of the police – they’re ashamed of what they saw,” Biden said in reference to the Floyd murder. “But you have to take action and it has to be national.” Harris’ record as a prosecutor was heavily scrutinized during her failed 2020 presidential campaign. Harris was known for her “smart on crime” approach, initiatives like truancy prosecution, and the creation of the “Back on Track” program for first-time drug offenders. She also defended the death penalty as California attorney general, opposed a statewide ballot measure to legalize marijuana, and pushed for higher bails for certain gun charges as district attorney.

Harris’ team rejects Israeli notion that her comments could harm ceasefire talks | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:10 AM EDT, Sat July 27, 2024",2024-07-26T17:03:23.830Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ office on Friday is rejecting a suggestion from a senior Israeli official that the vice president’s remarks on Thursday that forcefully criticized Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach. “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in The Times of Israel: “Hopefully the remarks Harris made in her press conference won’t be interpreted by Hamas as daylight between the US and Israel, thereby making a deal harder to secure.” Harris declared that she would “not be silent” about the suffering in Gaza amid the war after her meeting with Netanyahu. She also said that Israel has a right to defend itself but “how it does so matters,” staking out her lane as an empathetic and strong voice for the Palestinian suffering, just days after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. But the vice president’s office on Friday sought to clarify that her message to Netanyahu behind closed doors mirrored that of Biden. “President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” an aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that the meeting was “serious and collegial.” Harris has already made some public comments about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that had a similar tone to her remarks after the Netanyahu meeting on Thursday. She emphasized the need for an “immediate ceasefire” in March, taking a long pause before adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.” Harris’s office pointed out that her comments on Thursday “tracked with her previous comments on the conflict.” “She started with rock-solid support for Israel and then she expressed her concern about civilian causalities and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as she always does,” said the aide, responding to reporters’ questions. But her comments marked the first time that she spoke about the conflict since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee as she is faced with the challenge of defining her position on the politically charged issue of the Israel-Hamas war. Her remarks on Thursday were not a major surprise to some administration officials who have been privy to her team’s views in interagency meetings. Multiple US officials say that Harris’ team has often advocated for putting more pressure on Israel during interagency conversations over the course of recent months since October 7. For example, Harris’s aides have been advocates for sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, one source said. Harris’s aides have also opposed the idea of possible low-level engagement with far-right members of Netanyahu’s Cabinet – such as Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir – making the case that engagement would be elevating their views, one official said. So far, the Biden administration has decided against reaching out to them. Biden administration officials acknowledged that there might be some tension in the coming weeks as Harris develops her voice and her policy on the Israel-Hamas war. She has created that tension within the administration in the past on this issue. But now, they say that the tension could be worth it, given the ultimate goal of trying to draw in voters as she is at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket. “She’s not substantively different than the president, but she’s tonally different,” one administration source told CNN. A close friend familiar with Harris’ views expected “zero” chance she would break with Biden on policy, while acknowledging the opportunity for her to introduce more nuance, especially now that she’s the party’s candidate. “She’s allowed to support Israel but also want the war to end.” Arab American leaders say that throughout the course of the Israel-Hamas war, Harris’ team has been “much more responsive” to the frustrations of their community when it comes to the Biden administration’s policies. “Harris and her office threw us a lifeline early on,” Dr. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. “I spoke with her and she demonstrated compassion and empathy. She wanted to know what she could do to be responsive to our concerns.” CNN’s Tim Lister and Tamar Michaelis contributed to this report."
"July 26, 2024, presidential campaign news | CNN Politics",No Edits Made,2024-07-26T11:58:00.478Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kamala-harris-trump-election-07-26-24/index.html,"Our live coverage of the 2024 presidential race has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or scroll through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump was booed by people at a Florida summit on Friday after expressing his belief in certain exceptions to abortion.  “I think it’s very important, don’t forget,” Trump continued, as some people in the crowd started booing. “You have to go with your heart, but you also have to win elections.”  Praising his three conservative Supreme Court appointments and the ultimate overturning of Roe v. Wade, Trump said. “Now it’s up to the will of the people in each state.” “Some will be more conservative in what they vote for, and some will be more liberal,” Trump added. “The people will decide and that’s the way they always wanted it.” Trump previously suggested he could support a 15-week federal ban with exceptions in the cases of incest, rape and when the life of the mother is in danger, but in April he said abortion rights should be left to the states, offering his clearest stance yet on one of the most delicate and contentious issues in American politics. His decision not to back a national ban was swiftly denounced by a major anti-abortion rights organization, which said his position did not go far enough. Former NSYNC member Lance Bass posted a video on Instagram Friday with Vice President Kamala Harris where the duo said they’re saying “Bye Bye Bye” to former President Donald Trump this November, a reference to the 2000 NSYNC hit. Harris also appeared with Bass on the season nine finale of “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” Friday encouraging viewers to vote in the upcoming election. Former President Donald Trump is no longer wearing a bandage on his ear. Trump’s right ear was bloodied after an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally this month. He appeared at the Republican National Convention days later after the incident in Milwaukee wearing a large white bandage over the injured ear. The FBI said Friday that Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, or a fragment from it, fired by the would-be assassin at his July 13 rally. The new statement is the most direct from federal law enforcement so far about the nature of Trump’s injury. But it changes little in practical terms.  Some law enforcement officials had previously said publicly that it was unclear whether Trump was hit by a bullet or by shrapnel, which is a fragmented piece of ammunition. Earlier this week, FBI Director Wray testified to congress that “there’s some question about whether or not it’s bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear.”  Other officials questioned whether what struck Trump was the bullet at all, or if he was actually hit by a piece of glass — or even injured while falling down.  Trump himself has repeatedly asserted that he was hit by an in-tact bullet, writing on Truth Social that “it was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard. There was no glass, there was no shrapnel.” Former White House physician Rep. Ronny Jackson, who has been monitoring Trump since the assassination attempt, said Friday that “there is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet” and suggested Wray was “wrong and inappropriate” for stating otherwise. Read more on the FBI’s investigation Mitch Landrieu, the national co-chair for the Biden-Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, walked back a “defund the police” sentiment voiced by Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020, saying what she meant is she supports being “tough and smart on crime.”  CNN reported that Harris voiced support for the “defund the police” movement in a radio interview in June 2020 amidst nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she joined the Biden presidential campaign.  Pressed to clarify the campaign’s stance on police funding, Landrieu touted Harris’ record as a prosecutor, saying she put sex abusers and businesspeople who committed fraud in jail. But he also said the campaign believes in finding alternatives to police force when someone is having a mental health episode. “Our actions indicate that she wants to fund the police, but she wants to do the other things as well,” Landrieu said. Four new Fox News polls released Friday show that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are locked in margin of error races with no clear leader in the following races: Harris leads Trump by 6 points in Minnesota (52% Harris to 46% Trump, nearly identical to the 2020 margin there). The polls were fielded from July 22 -24, after President Joe Biden stepped aside in the race for president. Across all four states, more than three-quarters of voters say they approve of Biden dropping out of the race, with a slightly smaller majority saying they think he should finish his term as president. In three of the four states, Harris’s performance against Trump is similar to Biden’s in earlier Fox News polls conducted before the CNN presidential debate in late June (earlier polls were in April for Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, there was no prior poll this cycle in Minnesota.) A new national poll from the Wall Street Journal released Friday found former President Donald Trump at 49% and Vice President Kamala Harris at 47% in a two-way matchup among registered voters. In the last Wall Street Journal poll, released in early July, President Joe Biden trailed Trump by 6 percentage points. The survey is the latest to find Harris outperforming Biden among voter groups that traditionally lean Democratic but that had been trouble spots for the president, such as voters of color and younger voters. The survey also suggests a spike in enthusiasm among Democrats for their presumptive nominee. Overall, 76% of voters say they “feel enthusiastic about my preferred presidential candidate,” up from 44% who said the same previously. That shift comes largely among Democrats: While the Journal’s June 30-July 2 poll found that Democrats were far less likely than Republicans to say they were enthusiastic about their chosen candidate, now, about 4 in 5 voters in both parties are enthusiastic about their nominee.  When independent and third party candidates are included in the presidential matchup, 45% of voters say they back Harris, 44% Trump and 4% independent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., with others at 1% or less.  Second gentleman Doug Emhoff was “sitting having coffee with my friends” in Los Angeles, fresh out of a spin class last Sunday, approximately 15 minutes before President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race.  Reminiscing on the whirlwind of the past week on the podcast “Stay Tuned with Preet,” Emhoff, away from his phone, said “my friend’s partner gives me his phone and says ‘I think you need to see this’” before showing him Biden’s letter to the nation announcing his decision.  Sprinting to his car a block away, Secret Service agents chasing after him, Emhoff grabbed his phone that had been sitting in his car. “My phone was literally like self-immolated,” he said. “You could feel the smoke coming out of that phone.” Emhoff said there were a series of messages, all of which read “Call Kamala!”  “So, I finally call,” he said. “She said ‘Where the [pauses without saying expletive] were you?’”  “Then all of a sudden phone’s ringing and I was connected with her and her team but it was a bizarre, surreal experience to then have to go through this alone,” he said. CNN previously reported that Emhoff was also making calls to prominent Democrats on Sunday to rally support for his wife. He said he was not reunited with his wife until the next day at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, where Vice President Kamala Harris gave a speech to rouse the campaign staff. “I cannot tell you how proud I am of her,” he said. “We’re just moving fast.” In the past week, Emhoff has become enmeshed in his wife’s presidential bid — attending events, speaking with donors and finding his place in the campaign. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the voter outreach group Black Voters Matter, said Vice President Harris should not be limited to selecting a straight White man as her running mate.   Brown issued a statement this week that encourages Harris to “think outside of the box.” She argues a bold choice will only extend the momentum Democrats are currently enjoying, and that Americans are “ready for something different.” The statement goes on to suggest Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg should be given equal consideration and that Democrats need to get out of their comfort zones. Roger Hochschild, former CEO of Discover Financial Services and a major Democratic donor, told CNN that there was “palpable enthusiasm” on a call as Vice President Kamala Harris and top campaign officials discussed what needs to get done in the next 100-plus days leading up to Election Day.  Reproductive health: One of the questions the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee answered was about reproductive health, according to Hochschild. Swing states: Officials on the call made clear that spending time in battleground states would be a top priority for Harris, and indicated that the new Harris campaign is quickly figuring out the best way to reshuffle her calendar and attend upcoming events, given her new role.  DNC: One other topic of discussion on the call was the upcoming Democratic National Convention, Hochschild said. The campaign made clear now that it is Harris — rather than President Joe Biden — that the party is planning the August convention in Chicago around, they are quickly rethinking everything from the music to performers to guests that would be featured at the DNC. Defending prior comments about childless adults that have resurfaced and faced backlash this week, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said his criticism was directed at the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family” — not at those who don’t or can’t have children. “This is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child,” Vance said. Directly responding to his comment in 2021 on Fox News that the country is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies,” Vance said he was being sarcastic and the substance of what he said has been lost. “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats. I’ve got nothing against dogs. I’ve got one dog,” Vance said. “People are focusing so much on the sarcasm, and not on the substance of what I actually said and the substance of what I said, Megan, I’m sorry. It’s true. It is true that we become anti-family. It is true that the left has become anti-child.” Watch: Former President Donald Trump announced that he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, for a rally in honor of the victims of the failed assassination attempt on him there nearly two weeks ago.  Trump said there will be a “big and beautiful” rally for firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died in the shooting, and others who were injured. “WHAT A DAY IT WILL BE — FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT! STAY TUNED FOR DETAILS,” Trump posted on Truth Social. ABC News is continuing preparations for an upcoming presidential debate, despite former President Donald Trump saying he won’t consider participating in a debate until the Democratic Party formally chooses its nominee.  “Full steam ahead,” an ABC network source told CNN on Friday. Despite ABC’s preparations for the debate, set to be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, the network’s plan could still be upended like so many other institutions and traditions this year.   Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, later told reporters she had agreed to the September 10 debate and accused Trump of “backpedaling.”  Even before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, the campaigns did away with the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, which had arranged the debates for decades, instead agreeing to debates directly arranged by television networks. A person familiar with the matter said Friday that NBC is “in ongoing discussion with the campaigns,” but it’s unclear whether that involves plans for a debate, or other events like town halls with the candidates. Vice President Kamala Harris just called into a meeting of her National Finance Committee, where she thanked donors for their support, per a source familiar.  The call was organized by finance chair Rufus Gifford. Former White House physician Rep. Ronny Jackson, who has been monitoring former President Donald Trump’s physical well-being since the assassination attempt earlier this month, said in a statement that the former president was shot in the ear. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified on Capitol Hill this week that there was still “some question” about whether Trump was hit with a bullet or shrapnel. Jackson took on Wray’s testimony directly and wrote “there is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet” and suggested Wray was “wrong and inappropriate” for stating otherwise.  Jackson said in a letter he has reviewed Trump’s medical records from Butler Memorial Hospital, which say the former president was treated for a “Gunshot Wound to the Right Ear.”  Trump’s hospital records from the night of the attempted assassination have not been released. Trump posts about Wray: The former president also posted a photo of the assassination attempt on Truth Social, writing: “Perhaps FBI Director Christopher Wray will notice there is no shrapnel or glass flying through the ear, only a bloodstained bullet. It’s all so damaging to the Great People that work in the FBI.” Rally tomorrow: Trump, along with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, are expected to hold a rally on Saturday in Minnesota as security around Trump’s rallies and events have been put into question, including where they should be held — whether indoors or in more secure outdoor locations. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said he supports in vitro fertilization for parents with fertility problems, but argued that the religious liberties for Christian hospitals, which prohibit some reproductive health services, need to be protected. Vance argued that the “problem” with Democrats’ approach on IVF “is they’re trying to take away religious liberty” and he attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing her of suggesting that Christian hospitals “should have to do IVF in the way that Democrats want them to do it.”   “I’m talking about religious liberty here. I think we have to protect the rights of Christian hospitals to operate the way that they want to operate, but of course that’s totally consistent with promoting fertility treatments for parents who need it,” he said. Vance faced backlash this week over prior comments about childless adults, but he said his criticism was directed at the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family” — not at those who don’t or can’t have children. Donald Trump’s campaign released a statement on the former president’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Netanyahu thanked Trump “for working to promote stability in the region through, among many historic achievements, the Abraham Accords, moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, eliminating Qasem Soleimani, ending the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal, as well as combatting anti-Semitism in America and abroad,” the statement said. Trump “expressed his solidarity” with Israel following the October 7 Hamas attack, according to the statement, adding that he “pledged that when he returns to the White House, he will make every effort to bring Peace to the Middle East and combat anti-Semitism from spreading throughout college campuses across the United States.” Former top White House cyber officials in the Biden administration will hold a fundraiser for Vice President Kamala Harris on the sidelines of two of the world’s biggest hacking conferences in Las Vegas next month, according to a flyer for the event viewed by CNN. Tickets for the “Hackers for Harris” event, as one organizer called it, run at $10,000 for co-sponsors and $2,700 for “VIPs,” according to the flyer. The event targets a lesser-known source of potential funding for the Harris campaign: corporate executives and security experts who support the Biden administration’s focus on cybersecurity. Many in the cybersecurity community were alarmed by former President Donald Trump’s firing of Chris Krebs, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security’s cyber agency, for calling the 2020 election was secure. The fundraiser will feature Kemba Walden and Jake Braun, who held leadership positions at the White House Office of the National Cyber Director, which coordinates federal cybersecurity policy and has oversight of agencies’ cyber defenses. The event will be held on the sidelines of Black Hat and Def Con conferences that draw tens of thousands of security researchers, government officials and corporate executives to Las Vegas each year. Def Con is home to the “Voting Village” where researchers pick apart voting equipment, looking for vulnerabilities with the aim of making the equipment more secure. Vulnerable Democratic Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina announced that he is endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper to be her vice president pick, one day after voting for a GOP resolution condemning Harris on the border.  However, he continued, “At the same time, the administration and Congress must address the concerns of the southern border. These issues cannot be overlooked. I will continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, including securing the border and other issues impacting eastern NC families.”  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he hoped Vice President Kamala Harris’ comments forcefully criticizing Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas in Gaza would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.  Harris’ office earlier Friday rejected a suggestion from a senior Israeli official that echoed Netanyahu’s remarks. “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN. Netanyahu also said he believed the recent movement closer to a deal was because of Israel’s military pressure on Hamas. “I think there’s been some movement because of our military pressure that we exerted,” said Netanyahu. “I hope there will be sufficient movement to get a deal completed.” Netanyahu said Israel will be sending a team to Rome for further negotiations “probably in the beginning of the week.” Former President Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris was “disrespectful to Israel” in her remarks to reporters after her private meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.  Asked how Harris’ remarks may have impacted negotiations on a ceasefire deal, Netanyahu said, “Well, we’re trying to get one. To the extent that Hamas understands that there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States that expedites the deal.” “I would hope that those comments don’t change that,” he added. Netanyahu said he hopes that after this trip they will be closer to a ceasefire, but “time will tell.”  Trump said he doesn’t have to talk about what his working relationship with Netanyahu would look like if he is elected in a second term. “We’ve had a good relationship. I was very good to Israel, better than any president has ever been,” Trump said. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a possible contender for Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, attacked Sen. JD Vance over his stance on abortion, Ukraine and his comments about childless women. Kelly also said that Vance’s opposition to aid for Ukraine is deeply concerning. “If Donald Trump and JD Vance were back in the White House, it would be an utter disaster, and it would have a significant negative impact on our national security and the national security of our allies for decades,” he told reporters. Asked about Vance’s comments about childless women, Kelly replied: “You know, it’s a ridiculous thing to say about someone. You know, it’s obnoxious, it’s rude, it’s also not surprising.”  The Arizona Democrat refused to say what he spoke about with Harris, but indicated that he is ready to serve as her running mate if asked. “I’ve been a public servant since I was, even before I was in the Navy. I drove an ambulance when I was in high school. You know, I was a astronaut for 15 years. I flew with an aircraft carrier,” said Kelly. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a contender for the Democratic vice presidential nomination, slammed former President Donald Trump for refusing to commit to debate Vice President Kamala Harris until a Democratic nominee is officially selected. “Let me tell you something: he’s pretty afraid,” Shapiro said in a video posted to X on Friday. “He’s afraid to stand toe-to-toe with our vice president.” Shapiro claimed that Trump was “scared” because he “can’t run away from his record any longer.” CNN previously reported that Shapiro was a leading possibility as Harris attempts to select a running mate within the next two weeks. In a statement Thursday, Trump’s communications director Steven Cheung said it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.” Harris has gained public support from enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee, according to a CNN estimate. Democrats on Wednesday adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin August 1. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently meeting former US President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the office of the prime minister said. Trump greeted Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, at the steps of Mar-a-Lago. Trump gave Sara two kisses on the cheek and shook Netanyahu’s hand. Facing cameras, Trump gave a thumbs up standing in between them.  As Netanyahu’s motorcade crossed near the property, a group of pro-Palestinian supporters chanted “we want Justice for Palestine now.”  Roads in the area are closed and expected to remain closed for several hours as Netanyahu meets with Trump.  The meeting comes less than a week since the US Secret Service enacted new road closures at Mar-a-Lago following the attempted assassination of the former president. It’s the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said President Joe Biden sullied his legacy by not dropping out of the presidential race sooner, and compared Biden’s decision to step aside to former President Donald Trump’s role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Kennedy said in an interview with CBS News that aired Friday he respects Biden’s long career in public service but said he believes Biden’s handling of the months leading up to his decision to drop out will be a blemish on his record. Kennedy then offered a comparison to the January 6 Capitol attack, noting “a lot of Americans blame” Trump for the riot centered around the procedure to certify Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory. Kennedy appeared to equate Trump’s role in the insurrection to Biden’s decision earlier this month, noting that neither president stepped away from the office “graciously.” Vice President Kamala Harris’ office on Friday is rejecting a suggestion from a senior Israeli official that her remarks on Thursday that forcefully criticized Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas in Gaza could have made a ceasefire deal harder to reach.  “I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to the senior Israeli official being quoted in Israeli outlets as saying: “Hopefully the remarks Harris made in her press conference won’t be interpreted by Hamas as daylight between the US and Israel, thereby making a deal harder to secure.”  Harris declared that she would “not be silent” about the death and destruction in Gaza during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war after her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She also said that Israel has a right to defend itself but “how it does so matters.” But the vice president’s office on Friday sought to clarify that her message to Netanyahu behind closed doors mirrored that of President Joe Biden, who also met with Netanyahu on Thursday. Harris’ office said that her comments on Thursday “tracked with her previous comments on the conflict.” “She started with rock-solid support for Israel and then she expressed her concern about civilian causalities and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as she always does,” said the aide.   Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza, launched in the wake of the October 7 attacks, has displaced almost all of the strip’s 2 million people and reduced swathes of the territory to rubble. State of negotiations: High-level ceasefire and hostages negotiations are expected to resume in Rome in the coming days, according to a diplomat familiar with the planning. CIA Director Bill Burns would meet with mediating counterparts from Egypt and Qatar, as well as Israeli intelligence. The CIA declined to comment.  CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed reporting. The five days since Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign launched at warp speed have remade the 2024 race – and given Democrats new hope of preventing a second Donald Trump presidency. Bright green, pro-Harris memes have erupted across social media. Fundraising exploded, with Harris’ campaign saying she raised $126 million between Sunday afternoon and Tuesday evening. And Democrats were more eager to devote their own time to working to elect Harris: More than 100,000 people signed up to volunteer for her bid, and more than 2,000 applied for campaign jobs, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a Wednesday memo. New polls show a race in which Trump had been ahead now having no clear leader. It’s all made clear how desperate much of the Democratic Party was for a change at the top of the ticket – and how eager its donors and loyalists are to back a candidate who can take on Trump in a more consistent and aggressive way. The Democratic message is largely the same. Though Harris has put her own spin on it, much of what she’s focused on in recent days – defending women’s reproductive freedom; rejecting “trickle-down economic policies”; standing up for democratic norms and values – mirrors what President Joe Biden had campaigned on. But it’s coming through more clearly with a new messenger, whose energetic performances on the campaign trail in recent days have laid bare the limitations of the 81-year-old Biden. Read the full story. Over a dozen youth organizing groups announced their endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid on Friday. The press release cites the vice president’s record on various issues, including combating youth gun violence, climate change and student loan debt. The list of organizations includes Voters of Tomorrow, College Democrats of America and Young Democrats of America. In effort to mobilize young voters, the campaign will host events focused on the key constituency across battleground states this weekend as part of the “100 Days Weekend of Action,” including organizing its first youth phone bank of the cycle and launching a national distributive program for young voters that includes a youth Discord channel. “She is fighting to guarantee a future where every young person has affordable quality health care, where everyone has the freedom to make decisions about their own body, where we have dramatically reduced the pace of climate change, and where guns no longer terrorize our classrooms or our streets,” Levenson added. White women elected officials, celebrities and activists on Thursday rallied support and raised money for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. Women for Harris organizer Elizabeth Minnella said the “White Women: Answer the Call 2024” fundraising call was inspired by the “Win With Black Women” Zoom call, which thousands of Black women joined to support Harris. “We were inspired by the 44,000 Black women who organized a call in the eight hours following the announcement of Vice President Harris’ candidacy,” she said. Some of the big names on the call included Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, singer Pink, soccer icon Megan Rapinoe, and actress Connie Britton. She also announced that the call raised over $2 million. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for Nebraska’s presidential ballot, the Nebraska Secretary of State’s office said on Friday.  A spokesperson for the Nebraska Secretary of State said in a statement on Friday the office has validated 4,442 of the signatures submitted by Kennedy’s campaign, surpassing the 2,500 signatures legally required to qualify for Nebraska’s ballot. The secretary of state’s office deemed Kennedy has fulfilled all the requirements to appear on November’s ballot.  The office also considered an objection filed by the Nebraska Democratic Party earlier this month, which argued Kennedy’s past membership in the Democratic Party and affiliations with minor parties in other states make him ineligible to appear as a nonpartisan candidate in Nebraska. The office decided “the matters raised did not require that Kennedy be kept off the ballot.” Nebraska marks the latest potential battleground state where Kennedy has gained ballot access, putting him in play for the state’s five electoral votes, including the sole electoral vote awarded to the winner in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Former President Donald Trump won that electoral vote in 2016, but President Joe Biden flipped it in 2020. Including Nebraska, Kennedy has gained ballot access in 12 states. He’s qualified for the ballot in battleground states Michigan and North Carolina, along with California, Utah, Hawaii, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Delaware and South Carolina. In total, Kennedy is eligible for 145 electoral votes. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley offered no apologies Thursday for the “tough things” she said about former President Donald Trump during their bruising Republican primary fight, but she told CNN’s Jake Tapper she does not doubt her choice to support the former president over presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election. In her first interview since endorsing Trump and speaking at the Republican National Convention, Haley said President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race Sunday did not come as a surprise. Haley added: “I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and I think that’s what’s playing out.” Haley’s comments come in the wake of her decision to endorse Trump and speak at the GOP convention last week following a tumultuous primary, during which she repeatedly attacked the former president as “toxic,” “unhinged” and lacking “moral clarity.” In a wide-ranging interview, Haley brushed aside the rhetoric as just part of a campaign — which included Trump’s attacks on Haley and her husband while he was deployed overseas. Read more from the interview with Haley. Vice President Kamala Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amidst nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign. Harris said in the June radio interview the movement “rightly” called out the amount of money spent on police departments instead of community services such as education, housing, and healthcare, emphasizing that more police did not equate to more public safety. Harris made her comments just weeks after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer galvanized the “defund” movement among progressive activists. At the time, Harris was six months removed from ending her own presidential campaign and was still two months away from being tapped as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee. After Harris was selected as Biden’s running mate in August 2020, the Biden campaign tried to make it clear she opposed defunding the police – and said she supported increasing police funding.

However, he would not say whether she would consider herself a Zionist, similar to how President Joe Biden has described himself. Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance echoed former president Donald Trump’s criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she is a more liberal candidate than President Joe Biden. He argued that Biden stepping down and handing the reins to Harris is “fundamentally illegitimate” and that Republicans, by contrast,” respect the democratic process. “Kamala Harris has no democratic legitimacy,” Vance said. “Look at her record, Don. It is the worst record imaginable.” Claiming that the media is disinterested in focusing on Harris’ record, Vance said she will be rebranded as a moderate to win over voters in November. Vance criticized Harris for supporting an end to fracking and providing universal healthcare for undocumented immigrants as well as her policy on the US border.  The election authorities of at least 48 states, both Republicans and Democrats, say there are no obstacles that would prevent Vice President Kamala Harris from getting on election ballots if she becomes the official Democratic presidential nominee, as expected. The findings of a CNN survey of all 50 states undercut the claims of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said both before and after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday that there are legal “impediments” in some states to a party switching presidential candidates as the Democrats did.  There was not a single state election authority that told CNN Harris would face a ballot issue as the official nominee; election authorities in two states — Florida and Montana — did not respond to requests for comment, but a review of the states’ ballot access rules suggests Harris is not likely to face an issue there either. Johnson, a lawyer, said on ABC News Sunday that “it would be wrong and I think unlawful in accordance to some of these state rules for a handful of people to go in the backroom and switch it out because they’re – they don’t like the candidate any longer.” He said on CNN Monday that “in some of the states, there are impediments to just switching someone out like that.” The 48 states (plus the District of Columbia) whose election authorities have said the official Democratic nominee will not have ballot issues include the seven states with the closest margins in the 2020 election, which are widely considered the key swing states again in 2024: Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada. The 48 states also include the 15 states where former President Donald Trump, the Republicans’ 2024 nominee, had his highest share of the vote in 2020. Johnson’s office did not respond to CNN’s requests to identify the “impediments” he claimed some states have.

Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, stopped by the beloved reality show to remind viewers about the importance of voting. Her message will appear in Friday’s finale, which airs on Paramount+. “So as we fight back against these attacks, let’s all remember — no one is alone,” Harris said. “We are all in this together. And your vote is your power.” Harris ended her message by encouraging viewers to register to vote and clapping along to RuPaul’s optimistic anthem “A Little Bit of Love.” Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid in a video released Friday. Harris thanked the Obamas for their support and expressed gratitude for their decadeslong friendship. “Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. I’m looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road,” the vice president said. “But most of all, I just want to tell you the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express, so thank you both. It means so much. And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she added. The former first lady said she is proud of Harris and expects the upcoming election to be historic. “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic,” she told Harris. After Vice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of “backpedaling” on a debate, the Trump campaign said Thursday it would not commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee. President Joe Biden’s decision to step down from the Democratic ticket threw previous debate plans into doubt. While the Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, it is unclear if it will go on as planned. Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, said Thursday that it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds,” since Harris is only the party’s presumptive nominee. Harris quickly hit back on social media. “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” she said. Democratic delegates are expected to vote virtually to confirm Harris as the party’s nominee by August 7. Trump, for his part, officially clinched the Republican nomination last week at the Republican National Convention. Read the full story."
How Doug Emhoff is amplifying his wife’s historic presidential bid | CNN Politics,"Updated 1:38 PM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T08:00:02.751Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-2024-bid/index.html,"Confronted with a barrage of negative social media posts from former President Donald Trump aimed at his wife, second gentleman Doug Emhoff eschewed machismo or defensiveness. “That’s all he got?” he said Tuesday of the attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris, the new and historic presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. His response in that off-the-cuff moment offered insight into the Harris-Emhoff dynamic: The second gentleman is uniquely positioned to confidently serve in a supporting role to a woman vying to the most powerful person in the country. Emhoff has spent the last four years getting comfortable with being the first – serving as the first “second gentleman,” an unelected role with no manual and an automatic global platform. But with his wife’s swift ascension to presumptive nominee, he is now auditioning for another first: the potential first gentleman to the first woman president. And the second gentleman’s role is coming into sharper focus: Harris’ hype man, her closest confidante and best surrogate, and an ally amplifying her historic position and message on reproductive rights. Already an active presence on the campaign trail, Emhoff is expected to continue his work supporting Harris’ candidacy across the country at campaign and fundraising events, in addition to his official duties, an Emhoff spokesperson told CNN. “There has been life breathed into the Democratic campaign for president and they do not have one minute to waste or lose. And so you are going to put out your biggest guns on this – and he is just important a surrogate as anyone,” said Anita McBride, who served as a top aide to former first lady Laura Bush. Emhoff is stepping in for first lady Jill Biden to headline a trio of previously scheduled New England fundraisers in Yarmouth, Maine, and Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. On Martha’s Vineyard, he’ll be in conversation with former late night host David Letterman. He is also expected to headline a rescheduled Jill Biden fundraiser aimed at Americans living abroad in Paris, when he leads the US delegation to the Olympics closing ceremony next month. He will hit the trail for other campaign events in the coming days and weeks as well, including Wausau and Stevens Point, Wisconsin, on Saturday. Emhoff, Harris campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster added, “will be a vigorous and active campaigner, speaking directly to our coalition about the issues they care most about and mobilizing the voters who will decide this election to ensure that Vice President Harris becomes President Harris.” Emhoff has carved a portfolio for himself in the past three-and-a-half years, focused on advocating for gender equity, fighting antisemitism, and promoting justice and equality in the legal system. He stepped down from a beloved decades-long career as a lawyer focused on media, entertainment, and intellectual property, opting to teach at Georgetown Law instead. He’s served as an emissary on trips abroad and has spent significant time on the campaign trail. He is also the father of two adult children. In the days since President Joe Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris, Emhoff has offered a preview of how he will approach the role in the coming months – an extension of the work he was already doing, now under a bigger microscope. On Tuesday, Emhoff proceeded with an appearance scheduled before the whirlwind events propelling his wife to the top of the ticket, visiting a reproductive health care clinic in McLean, Virginia. “It was important for me to be here today. I just wanted to make sure we kept this on the schedule,” he told fellow participants, going on to lambast what he cast as the “post-Dobbs hellscape that Donald Trump created.” He discussed the importance of abortion access for women – and the need for family planning resources for men, as well. And Monday, he leaned into a cheerleader role as he introduced the vice president at her Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters. “I get to support my wife, Kamala Harris, running for president of the United States. Let me tell you: We are going to win this election,” Emhoff said, hyping her up to a receptive crowd of staff. “We have an amazing team, you have done an amazing job, and you’re gonna continue to do that so we can elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States of America.” Emhoff has also made history as the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, and his efforts to combat antisemitism have taken on new urgency amid the Hamas-Israel conflict, serving as one of the administration’s most vocal messengers on the issue and meeting with key stakeholders. While Emhoff has said it’s not what he “expected to be doing” as second gentleman, he views his role amplifying the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism as one of “responsibility” and “accountability.” “I take it very seriously,” he said during a Yom Kippur conversation last year, calling on Jewish Americans to “be proud you’re Jewish – and just have joy in it, and just live openly and proudly.” He will be key to bolstering her support with that coalition – and joined a Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala, seeking to clarify the vice president’s stance on Israel. “Let me just make this clear: The vice president has been and will be a strong supporter of Israel as a secure democratic and Jewish state, and she will always ensure that Israel can defend itself, period. Because that’s who Kamala Harris is,” Emhoff said. As the husband of a presumptive presidential nominee, Emhoff is offering voters a modern model of what it can mean to be a husband in 2024. “He’s a wife guy, and he owns it,” said Capricia Marshall, who served as US chief of protocol during the Obama administration and White House social secretary during the Clinton administration. “He doesn’t shirk that – he embraces it – and that’s magic for a campaign,” Marshall added. As he supports his wife in her quest to make history as the nation’s first female president, Emhoff has shared his own thoughts on masculinity and gender dynamics, telling CNN’s Dana Bash in a 2022 interview that he actively thinks about destigmatizing spousal roles. “I’m here because I’m her husband. I’m here to support her,” he told Bash at the time. “I’ll be giving speeches and one of the things I say is, ‘Men need to support women.’ One, it’s the right thing to do, then, man, OK you need to actually do it. … If I can set an example doing it, I’m very grateful for that.” He added, “Masculinity is loving your family, caring about your family, and being there for your family.” McBride said that Emhoff will be key to showing voters that there is a source of personal support behind Harris in her pursuit of the presidency. “This is a person who is confident in who he is, what he’s accomplished in his life. This is an extraordinary period in their life as a couple: her role as a major party candidate,” she said. Emhoff’s time as second gentleman could offer a blueprint for how he would approach the East Wing if his wife is elected. “He’s kind of balanced the role of being the supportive spouse, maintaining a personal professional role, and then also taking over some leadership of a presidential initiative. So I think that gives you a fairly good indication of if he now would move into a precedent-setting first gentleman role,” McBride said. Like Jill Biden before him, Emhoff has already learned the structure of a White House, how to live with full-time security and how to navigate a ceremonial leadership role that puts him on the world stage. Should Harris win this November, Emhoff would inherit a role that includes a long tradition of entertaining on a global stage and welcoming visitors to the People’s House. Marshall, the former chief of protocol, told CNN that Emhoff could be instrumental in a potential Harris administration’s diplomacy and helping the White House evolve. “How you entertain and welcome someone and show respect for them are powerful tools for engagement in international diplomacy. … He will understand what President Harris will be trying to achieve and why it’s important, including what they can add and emphasize in this new way of entertaining that would feel more in line with the times,” Marshall said. But above all, Marshall said, his role would be defined by supporting his wife through the challenges of the American presidency. “This first gentleman role is being a supportive spouse and understanding better than anyone the administration’s goals and how to go about best achieving that,” she said. CNN’s Arlette Saenz and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report. "
Leslie Uggams wishes Ryan Reynolds would give her some investment advice | CNN,"Updated 10:01 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T11:00:02.483Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/entertainment/leslie-uggams-deadpool-wolverine/index.html,"With more than half a century’s experience in Hollywood, you would think that veteran actor Leslie Uggams has plenty of words of wisdom for her “Deadpool & Wolverine” costar Ryan Reynolds. “Are you kidding me? I get advice from him,” she laughingly told CNN in a recent interview. “I mean, look at all the projects that he’s doing. He’s absolutely terrific.” Uggams is reprising her role of Blind Al in the “Deadpool” franchise’s latest film, as Wade Wilson/a.k.a. Deadpool’s (Reynolds) foulmouthed roommate, after appearing in both 2016’s “Deadpool” and the sequel “Deadpool 2” two years later. At 81, Uggams would be forgiven if she wanted to slow down, but she loves playing the visually challenged, crotchety “Deadpool” character. “She’s feisty, she’s wild,” Uggams said of Blind Al (full name: Althea). “She says what she means and it’s nice to do something that’s totally different from anything that I’ve ever been associated with.” Turns out, she even based her performance on someone she knew growing up. “I remember when I was like 12 or 13, there was a guy in our neighborhood who was sightless and he liked to drink a lot, so he was always kind of nasty,” she recalled. “So one day he was about to cross the street, and I happened to be there and I thought, ‘Oh my goodness, you know, traffic, I’m worried about him.’ And I went to help him. And he cussed me out and he hurt my feelings because I thought I was doing a good deed.” She continued to say that she always remembered that situation and “kind of applied it to Blind Al.” “’I can do what I could. Leave me alone. I don’t need your help!’ That’s her attitude,” she added of the character. Uggams said Reynolds has been “welcoming” since they worked together on the first film eight years ago. “When we finished the first one, finished shooting it and everything, I remember he knocked on the dressing room door,” she recalled. “He said ‘I just want you to know, I’m so excited about you doing this role.’ And then he talked about my audition and how he felt about it.” “He’s so smart,” she added. “I wish he would tell me about some of these investments he’s making. That would be nice.” Reynolds is a pretty successful entrepreneur, with a phone company, liquor brand and soccer team in his purview, but he also clearly has an eye for casting because Uggams’ character is beloved by fans. A native of Harlem, New York, the actress is revered for her long career, which has spanned Broadway, iconic TV projects like 1977’s “Roots” – for which she was nominated for an Emmy – and critically acclaimed films like last year’s “American Fiction.” She began performing as a child and never stopped, and has seen the industry change. “Some of the roles that were offered to you (in the past) were not great,” she said. “I remember I was doing a movie with Charlton Heston, and the director said to me, ‘Why do you wanna do acting? You know, you sing.’ And I said ‘Well, why can’t I do both?’” Uggams said she would love to see more opportunities for actors of color and more moguls like Tyler Perry who are invested in making sure diverse stories are told. That’s one of the reasons she’s proud of her work as the dementia-stricken matriarch in the Oscar-winning “American Fiction.” The film stars Jeffrey Wright as an author who finds success when he writes a book filled with racist tropes. Uggams said the movie is special in “that you saw family in a different kind of way.” “They own two homes, but it doesn’t matter because we all have our problems and you got to see that side of it,” she said, adding that trying to get stories like the one seen in “American Fiction” out there “is not easy, as Jeffrey told everybody. So I wanna see more of that, then I’ll be happy.” So can she share any fun stories about what happened on set filming “Deadpool & Wolverine” with Reynolds and Hugh Jackman? “Unfortunately, no, because there’s always some good ones,” Uggams said, smiling. “But my lips are taped.”"
Trump campaign says it won’t commit to Harris debate until she’s confirmed as nominee | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:19 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T03:41:03.856Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-presidential-debate/index.html,"After Vice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of “backpedaling” on a debate, the Trump campaign said Thursday it would not commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally chooses a nominee. President Joe Biden’s decision to step down from the Democratic ticket on Sunday threw previous debate plans into doubt. While the Biden and Trump campaigns had agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, it is unclear if it will go on as planned. “I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10th debate, he agreed to that previously,” Harris told reporters after landing at Joint Base Andrews Thursday. “Now it appears he’s backpedaling. But I’m ready. And I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so, I’m ready. Let’s go.” Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director, said in a statement late Thursday that it “would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds,” since Harris is only the party’s presumptive nominee. Harris quickly hit back on social media. “What happened to ‘any time, any place’?” she said in a post on X. Democratic delegates are expected to vote virtually to confirm Harris as the party’s nominee by August 7. Trump, for his part, officially clinched the Republican nomination last week at the Republican National Convention. Trump told reporters earlier this week he wants to debate Harris but has not yet agreed to anything. “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,” Trump said on a press call. “But I want to debate with her, and she’ll be no different because they have the same policies. I think debating is important for a presidential race, I really do. You sort of have an obligation to debate.” Biden’s exit from the race came weeks after a disastrous performance at the CNN debate last month. He endorsed Harris shortly after his announcement, and the vice president quickly racked up enough delegate endorsements to win the Democratic presidential nomination. While those endorsements are not binding, Harris is still the favorite to take Biden’s place. Harris would not say on Thursday whether she was open to another proposed debate hosted by Fox News. Before Biden withdrew from the race, Harris had positioned herself to go up against Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on the debate stage. In a brief call earlier this month, both candidates said they looked forward to debating one another but didn’t discuss specifics about when that would happen, CNN previously reported.  It’s now becoming clear those debate plans won’t be made after all, as Vance noted at a campaign stop in his hometown of Middletown, Ohio, earlier this week. “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her?” Vance joked. “I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.” This story’s headline has been updated."
Harris says she ‘will not be silent’ on Gaza suffering while telling Netanyahu to get ceasefire deal done | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:49 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-25T23:09:03.527Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to “not be silent” about suffering in Gaza amid the Israel-Hamas war, saying she expressed her “serious concern” to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday while telling him it is time to lock down a ceasefire deal. “Israel has a right to defend itself and how it does so matters. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,” Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters in remarks after her meeting with Netanyahu in Washington. Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza, launched in the wake of the October 7 attacks has triggered a humanitarian crisis, displacing almost all of the Strip’s 2 million population and reduced swathes of the territory to rubble. “The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,” Harris said. Harris’ comments provided the clearest explanation yet of her views on the conflict as she works to balance the issue that has not only divided the country but caused friction within the Democratic Party. Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about America’s “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, but she conveyed a forcefulness on ending the war. Recalling the details of the proposed US-backed ceasefire and hostage deal, Harris said that “it is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.” The vice president said there has been “hopeful movement” in the talks and that she pushed the prime minister to bring the conflict to a close. “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” she said. “So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.” The Hostages Families Forum in Israel has accused Netanyahu of stalling in the negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. “This foot-dragging is a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back,” the Forum said, adding that families were demanding an urgent meeting. But far-right members of the Israeli cabinet have pushed against a deal, criticizing pressure from Harris to secure one. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that committing to the deal in its current form would mean “surrendering” to Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. A deal would “allow Hamas to rehabilitate… abandoning most of the hostages in Hamas captivity.” Smotrich wrote on X. “Do not fall into this trap!” The Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir wrote on X Friday, “The war won’t be ceased, Madame candidate.” Following Harris’ remarks, Israeli media have been quoting a “senior Israeli official” as saying that pressure from the US vice president to reach a ceasefire and hostages deal in Gaza is counter-productive and may put at risk efforts to reach an agreement. The reports appear to reflect worries among Netanyahu’s inner circle that the emergence of Harris as the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate might herald a tougher US line on the conduct of Israel’s war with Hamas. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan also told Israel Army Radio (GLZ) Friday that the tone used by Harris “is raising concerns” among Israeli officials. Plans are in the works for another round of ceasefire-hostage talks that includes CIA Director Bill Burns and his fellow mediators early next week, according to an official familiar with the planning. The talks are also expected to include representatives from Israel, Egypt, Qatar. Among the hostages held in Gaza are eight dual-American citizens, which Harris said the Biden administration is working to bring home. Three of those have been confirmed dead. The vice president, who has met with the families, listed the names of those being held by Hamas. Several of the families US hostages held in Gaza were represented in discussions with US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu in Washington on Thursday. Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of Israeli-American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told CNN he was able to pose “very difficult questions” to Netanyahu during the meeting. Dekel-Chen could not provide many details about what Biden and Netanyahu spoke about with the families of hostages, but told CNN’s Erin Burnett that both leaders offered “a promise” that they “completely understand the urgency of this moment.” The Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday it had recovered the bodies of five hostages from southern Gaza on Wednesday, adding the bodies had been held in a tunnel in an area previously designated as a “humanitarian area” by the IDF. With the latest announcement, the Israeli authorities say 111 hostages remain in Gaza, of which 39 are believed to be dead. The October 7 attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel and saw more than 250 others taken hostage. The war in Gaza has dragged on for months, killing more than 39,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. In a notable moment near the conclusion of her remarks, Harris told reporters that “it is important for the American people to remember, the war in Gaza is not a binary issue.” “However, too often the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but. So I ask my fellow Americans to help encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the history of the region.” “Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. And let us condemn antisemitism, islamophobia and hate of any kind. And let us work to unite our country,” she said.

"Exclusive: CNN survey finds 48 states say Harris can get on ballot instead of Biden, rejecting claim switch breaks state laws | CNN Politics","Published 6:00 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T10:00:02.544Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-ballot-legal-obstacles-48-states/index.html,"The election authorities of at least 48 states, both Republicans and Democrats, say there are no obstacles that would prevent Vice President Kamala Harris from getting on election ballots if she becomes the official Democratic presidential nominee, as expected. The findings of a CNN survey of all 50 states undercut the claims of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said both before and after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday that there are legal “impediments” in some states to a party switching presidential candidates as the Democrats did. There was not a single state election authority that told CNN Harris would face a ballot issue as the official nominee; election authorities in two states, Florida and Montana, did not respond to requests for comment, but a review of the states’ ballot access rules suggests Harris is not likely to face an issue there either. Johnson, a lawyer, said on ABC News Sunday that “it would be wrong and I think unlawful in accordance to some of these state rules for a handful of people to go in the backroom and switch it out because they’re – they don’t like the candidate any longer.” He said on CNN Monday that “in some of the states, there are impediments to just switching someone out like that.” But experts on election law say that is not true, since the Democrats never named Biden as the official 2024 nominee or submitted his name to the states as their 2024 nominee. And election authorities around the country have now confirmed – telling CNN or saying in public statements that Harris will not face any obstacles getting on their ballots if she is formally chosen as the Democratic nominee next month. The 48 states (plus the District of Columbia) whose election authorities have said the official Democratic nominee will not have ballot issues include the seven states with the closest margins in the 2020 election, which are widely considered the key swing states again in 2024: Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada. The 48 states also include the 15 states where former President Donald Trump, the Republicans’ 2024 nominee, had his highest share of the vote in 2020. Johnson’s office did not respond to CNN’s requests to identify the “impediments” he claimed some states have. The election authorities in 48 states and the District of Columbia offered highly similar comments explaining why Harris does not face any hurdles getting on the ballot there. In general, they explained that they receive the names of a major party’s presidential nominee after the nominee is officially chosen by the party; that the Democratic convention has not been held yet (it’s scheduled for in-person events on August 19-22, with an official nomination vote to be held virtually earlier in the month); and that their state’s deadline for receiving the party nominees’ names has not arrived yet. Patrick Gannon, spokesperson for the bipartisan North Carolina State Board of Elections, said in an email: “Political parties nominate their presidential and vice-presidential candidates at their conventions and then inform the State Board of Elections of those persons’ names. The Democratic Party has not yet had its convention, nor has it informed the State Board of its presidential and vice-presidential candidates’ names.
When they do, those candidates’ names will be placed on the ballot.” Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, wrote on social media: “So it’s understood, Biden dropping out will not impact Georgia ballots. As the Democrats haven’t had a convention, there is no ‘nominee’ to replace.” Even the Republican election authorities of reliably pro-Trump states throughout the country definitively said Harris would not have issues there if she were chosen as nominee at the convention. Chelsea Carattini, spokesperson for Republican Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, said in an interview: “There’s no issue. We basically just wait for the major parties to do their national conventions, and once completed, they send us the certificate of nomination for whomever is selected.” Michon Lindstrom, spokesperson for Republican Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, said in an interview: “No, there is no issue with Kamala being on the ballot because Joe Biden was never the official nominee.” Rachel Soulek, director of South Dakota’s elections division under Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson, said in an email: “South Dakota will have no issues with the Democratic Party’s nominations.” Landon Palmer, a spokesperson for Republican West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, said in an email: “The candidate that will appear on West Virginia’s ballot in November will be the candidate that is nominated by the DNC. Presuming that is Kamala Harris, then there will be no issues.” Laney Rawls, spokesperson for Republican Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, said in an email: “Major parties have until August 23, 2024 to certify to the Secretary of State’s office their Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates” under a provision of Alabama law Rawls identified. She added, “The Secretary of State’s office will certify lawfully submitted party certifications on August 28, 2024.” CNN’s Tierney Sneed reported Sunday that Trump allies have discussed whether or not they have grounds to mount a challenge on the replacement of Biden with Harris, according to a source familiar with the discussions. It’s impossible to say for certain whether a particular court in a particular state might rule that the state’s elections authority was wrong. But experts say that is unlikely. Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor who is an expert on election law, said in an email: “Democrats do not have a nominee yet. The nomination formally happens at the convention. Any litigation before the convention challenging the identity of the nominee is about something that hasn’t yet happened. Any challenges after the convention would be challenges to a nominee who received the support of the convention delegates under convention rules. It’s essentially impossible to argue that the nominee is not the true nominee of the party at that point.” CNN’s Marshall Cohen and Ethan Cohen contributed to this article."
Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris for president | CNN Politics,"Updated 5:28 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T09:01:56.835Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/barack-michelle-obama-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html,"Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid in a video released Friday. “Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” the former president told Harris on a phone call joined by his wife, according to the video. Harris thanked the Obamas for their support and expressed gratitude for their decadeslong friendship. “Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. I’m looking forward to doing this with the two of you, Doug and I both. And getting out there, being on the road,” the vice president said. “But most of all, I just want to tell you the words you have spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express, so thank you both. It means so much. And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” she added. The former first lady said she is proud of Harris and expects the upcoming election to be historic. “I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic,” she told Harris. In a joint statement announcing the endorsement, the Obamas praised Harris and listed her accomplishments. “But Kamala has more than a resume,” the statement said. “She has the vision, the character, and the strength that this critical moment demands. There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people.” The statement added, “At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.” Obama and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been in touch regularly, and he has been serving as a sounding board for her as he has over the 20 years they’ve known each other, a source told CNN earlier this week. Obama didn’t immediately endorse Harris following President Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was not seeking reelection. “I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” the former president said in a statement at the time. According to the source, Obama believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process by which delegates would select their new nominee. An Obama adviser told CNN that the former president was taking the same approach as he did during the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it was Harris or someone else. Obama’s statement was intended to keep the focus on Biden – his former vice president – on the day he announced he was no longer seeking a second term, the adviser said. Obama had previously been supportive of Biden’s reelection efforts, attending a handful of fundraisers that raised millions of dollars, along with participating in moderated conversations with Biden and sending messages encouraging supporters to chip in as part of fundraising efforts. Democrats have been moving quickly in their process to nominate Harris with the party adopting rules Wednesday to choose their presidential nominee. Voting to officially nominate Harris is likely to begin on August 1. The rules call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote. Harris has not yet selected a running mate. As CNN previously reported, a team of lawyers and advisers are conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, with a goal of announcing a nominee before August 7."
LinkedIn billionaire is going all-in on Kamala Harris. But he wants her to make a big change | CNN Business,"Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T09:00:02.601Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/business/reid-hoffman-kamala-harris-ftc-khan/index.html,"LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is throwing his financial firepower behind Vice President Kamala Harris. Hoffman, who has donated $7 million to the leading pro-Biden and Harris super PAC, told CNN he’s “redoubling” efforts to support the campaign and has “great hope” that Harris will become the United States’ first woman president. But the billionaire argued that if Harris wins in November, she should install a new antitrust cop in place of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. “Lina Khan is…a person who is not helping America,” Hoffman told CNN in his first on-camera interview since President Joe Biden stepped aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee. “I would hope that Vice President Harris would replace her.” Hoffman, who sits on the board of Microsoft, a company that has clashed with the FTC, said Khan is operating “outside the scope” of her job at the FTC. “Antitrust is fine…Waging war is not,” said Hoffman. Khan has won praise from many progressives by confronting dominant companies, from Big Oil to Big Tech. Noting the $7 million Hoffman has donated to Future Forward PAC, Sen. Bernie Sanders blasted “the arrogance of Mr. Hoffman” and praised Khan as both one of the best Biden appointees and best FTC chairs in a “very, very long time.” “Billionaires should not be telling candidates who to be keeping on or not,” the Vermont independent told CNN in a phone interview Thursday. “This concerns me because Lina Khan is doing a great job and I would hope and expect that the VP, if she wins, keeps her on.” Another progressive, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, told CNN in a statement that Khan has done an “excellent job” and “should of course continue her work lowering costs, protecting workers and supporting entrepreneurs.” Even some Republicans are on board with Khan. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the GOP nominee for vice president, is a fan. In February, Vance said Khan is “one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job.” Now, a Democratic megadonor is sharply criticizing a Biden-appointed regulator who has been praised by the Republican nominee for vice president. Hoffman told CNN he “certainly” hasn’t directly pushed Harris to replace Khan. “I do find it entertaining that she’s the precise person that JD Vance supports,” he said. A Harris campaign aide told CNN that there have been “no policy discussions” about replacing Khan at the current time. “She has been the presumptive nominee for three days,” the aide added. Hoffman sits on the board of directors at Microsoft, a company that has clashed with the Khan-led FTC. In June, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN’s Brian Fung that the FTC had launched an investigation into a recent Microsoft deal with AI startup Inflection. The FTC also tried, and failed, to block Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of “Call of Duty” video game maker Activision Blizzard. FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar told CNN in a statement Wednesday that Khan is “honored to serve in the Biden Harris administration, where she has protected consumers, workers and entrepreneurs from illegal conduct and corporate abuse.” “From banning junk fees and noncompete agreements to lowering prices for essentials like groceries, gas and health care, Chair Khan has been a leader on the Biden-Harris team’s fight to help working families across the country,” Farrar said. Asked if Khan would consider staying at the helm of a Harris administration, the FTC spokesperson Farrar said: “Yes.” Some of that work has won approval from Khan’s Republican colleagues at the agency. For instance, earlier this month the FTC voted unanimously to block Tempur Sealy’s $4 billion takeover of Mattress Firm on antitrust grounds. Beyond antitrust matters, Hoffman showered praise for Harris on economic matters. “Trump wants tariffs, which is anti-business. You know, it makes this a very strange election indeed, because I think actually Vice President Harris is much more of the pro-business candidate than Trump,” Hoffman told CNN. Of course, the Biden-Harris campaign has pushed to raise the corporate tax rate and increase taxes on billionaires. Such moves would face fierce opposition from major business groups, like the US Chamber of Commerce. “There are ways that I think they should navigate somewhat differently,” Hoffman said in response to a question about the Biden-Harris administration’s tax and tariff moves. “But what’s most important for business is stability of the country. Unity. Rule of law. A percent difference in corporate tax, or 2% or 3% difference in corporate taxes, is far, far less important.” Hoffman has argued that former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, does not respect the rule of law and would pose a threat to business. The Trump campaign did not directly respond to Hoffman’s recent comments. In a statement last month, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung slammed Hoffman in a statement to CNN as a “protégé of George Soros” and made other attacks on his character. The LinkedIn co-founder faced criticism earlier this month after the assassination attempt against Trump. Before the shooting, Hoffman reportedly had a public quarrel with fellow tech billionaire Peter Thiel. Thiel accused Hoffman of making a martyr of Trump by funding lawsuits against the former president. Hoffman told Thiel he wished he had made Trump an “actual martyr.” “I definitely regret having echoed the word martyr, which was pitched to me from the audience, and I echoed it. That was a mistake,” Hoffman told CNN. “It’s super important that we all as leaders strongly speak against physical violence in democracies and politics and everything else. I deeply regret having echoed that word.” Asked about his preference for a Harris VP pick, Hoffman argued that Democrats have an “amazing bench” to select from, specifically mentioning Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Hoffman said having two women on the ticket would be “awesome” and a way to show the party’s dedication to women’s rights. Asked about the prospect of Harris tapping a business leader like billionaire Mark Cuban, Hoffman said it would be “awesome and bold” to have a business leader on the ticket as a way for Harris to make her mark."
How Kamala Harris’ warp-speed campaign launch has changed the 2024 race | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 AM EDT, Fri July 26, 2024",2024-07-26T04:00:02.438Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/kamala-harris-election-campaign/index.html,"The five days since Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign launched at warp speed have remade the 2024 race – and given Democrats new hope of preventing a second Donald Trump presidency. Bright green, pro-Harris memes have erupted across social media. Fundraising exploded, with Harris’ campaign saying she raised $126 million between Sunday afternoon and Tuesday evening. And Democrats were more eager to devote their own time to working to elect Harris: More than 100,000 people signed up to volunteer for her bid, and more than 2,000 applied for campaign jobs, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a Wednesday memo. New polls show a race in which Trump had been ahead now having no clear leader. It’s all made clear how desperate much of the Democratic Party was for a change at the top of the ticket – and how eager its donors and loyalists are to back a candidate who can take on Trump in a more consistent and aggressive way. Michigan AFL-CIO President Ron Bieber described the energy in his state – one of November’s most important battlegrounds – as “electric.” “I’ve never seen energy like this, this time in an election cycle,” he said. The Democratic message is largely the same. Though Harris has put her own spin on it, much of what she’s focused on in recent days – defending women’s reproductive freedom; rejecting “trickle-down economic policies”; standing up for democratic norms and values – mirrors what President Joe Biden had campaigned on. But it’s coming through more clearly with a new messenger,  whose energetic performances on the campaign trail in recent days have laid bare the limitations of the 81-year-old Biden. The strength of Harris’ launch has at times surprised even the former Biden campaign staffers who on Sunday suddenly found themselves working for what was converted into the Harris campaign. It’s far too soon to draw many conclusions about how Harris’ ascension changes a race that had long looked to be a rematch between Biden and Trump. Harris hasn’t yet chosen a running mate or launched her campaign’s first television advertisement. The Democratic National Convention is just weeks away. And Harris and Trump could debate – the sort of showdown that would attract tens of millions of viewers and potentially change the trajectory of the race. Though Trump said earlier this week that he has not committed to debating Harris, the vice president said Thursday that she would participate in the September 10 debate that ABC had originally scheduled between Trump and Biden. “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so, I’m ready. Let’s go,” she told reporters after landing at Joint Base Andrews following a campaign trip to Houston. It adds up to an unsettled race – even though there are signs of Harris improving on key Biden weaknesses among younger, non-White and female voters. Trump, after surviving an assassination attempt and making his party’s case at the Republican National Convention last week, was in a margin-of-error race with Harris – 49% to her 46% – in a CNN/SSRS poll of registered nationwide voters released Wednesday. Half of those who backed Harris in the new poll (50%) said their vote was more in support of her than against Trump. That’s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden’s supporters in CNN’s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president. About three-quarters of Trump supporters (74%) said in the latest survey that their vote was to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris. The shift toward affirmative support for Harris was notably strong among young voters, voters of color and women – groups that typically back Democrats but had been seen as trouble spots for the Biden campaign. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Thursday offered similar findings, with Trump at 48% and Harris at 46% among registered voters nationwide – and Harris gaining strength compared with Biden among young and non-White voters. Harris is only beginning what will be the most grueling 102-day sprint of her political career. The mistakes of her 2020 Democratic primary bid and the verbal missteps and staff upheavals that marred the early period of her vice presidency could resurface as Harris tries to prove she has grown since those stumbles. And she will face the same challenges Biden did in uniting factions of the party who are split over the war in Gaza. Still, O’Malley Dillon argued in her memo that Harris’ presence at the top of the ticket would expand the map for Democrats. Biden’s campaign believed his path to 270 Electoral College votes ran through the “blue wall” states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But Harris, with potentially stronger appeal among young Black and Latino voters, could prove more competitive than Biden in Sun Belt battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. “We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,” O’Malley Dillon said in the memo. It began just after 1:46 p.m. Sunday in her official residence at the Naval Observatory, where Harris – wearing a Howard University hoodie and workout sweats and waiting for Biden’s social media post announcing his exit from the race – began a 10-hour marathon of phone calls. She called 100 Democrats, including former presidents, governors, congressional leaders and heads of key congressional caucuses. Harris had Biden’s endorsement but told those she called she intended to earn the nomination. By Sunday evening, many of those initially seen as potential rivals had backed her. Monday morning, many others followed suit. By the afternoon, she had former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s endorsement and had effectively ended the race to take over from Biden before it began. On Monday afternoon, Harris visited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, that had become a bunker of sorts, with staffers dispirited by the weeks of controversy over whether Biden could survive as the Democratic nominee in the wake of his disastrous debate performance weeks earlier. Biden signs were being swapped out for Harris signs. After all, only the Federal Election Commission paperwork had changed; Harris was taking over an infrastructure built for Biden, and at least initially, keeping the same leadership on board. As she spoke to campaign staff in a speech that was carried nationally on cable news networks, Harris left Democrats elated as she previewed the message she’d drive against Trump – invoking the former president’s scandals and legal troubles and contrasting those with her own history. She pointed to her time as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she “took on perpetrators of all kinds.” “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” Within about 36 hours, no serious challenger had emerged, and enough state delegations to the Democratic National Convention had announced their unanimous support for Harris for her to clinch the party’s nomination. Meanwhile, pro-Harris memes were exploding across social media. Charli XCX, the British pop singer, declared the vice president “brat,” which is both the title of her sixth studio album with its bright green-colored cover and now a Gen Z summer soundtrack. It set off a series of TikTok memes featuring the same shade of green and video of Harris. Then, there were the coconut memes, revisiting a May 2023 speech in which Harris spoke about “a difference between equality and equity.” “None of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,” she said in that speech. “My mother used to – she would give us a hard time sometimes – and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’” Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis posted an endorsement of Harris on social media that was communicated through three emojis: a coconut, a palm tree and an American flag. “What we’re seeing is a really classic example of when pop culture really gets intertwined with politics, and it takes a special kind of candidate and a special kind of leader to inspire that,” Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 27-year-old Democrat, said on CNN. “It has to be organic. You can’t make it happen.” On Tuesday, Harris traveled to Milwaukee, where she held her first rally as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The usually soft-spoken Wisconsin governor, Tony Evers, told thousands of people who had packed into the Milwaukee high school gymnasium that he was “jazzed as hell” to welcome Harris to town. “We have 105 days, and we do not have a minute to waste,” Evers said. Harris once again hammered Trump in her Tuesday speech. And she sought to drive an economic message that was much clearer and more forward-looking than Biden’s case for his own accomplishments. “Building up the middle class,” Harris told supporters, “will be a defining goal of my presidency.” Harris also pointed to what she called Trump’s “extreme Project 2025 agenda.” Trump has disavowed the Heritage Foundation-backed policy plan, which was created by many of his former staffers. However, many of its most conservative and controversial proposals have become central planks in Democratic attacks on Trump. “We are not going back,” she vowed, prompting the crowd to chant the words back at her. Many in the crowd, which the campaign said consisted of more than 3,500 attendees, said they were thrilled that Harris was replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Felita Daniels Ashley, a high school administrator in Milwaukee, said she was “so excited” to see Harris as the party’s nominee, after backing the California Democrat to be Biden’s running mate in 2020. “The future is banking on this,” she said. Seventeen-year-old Olivia Jessup-Anger and her friend Natalie Jauch, who turns 18 the day before Election Day, said they agree with Charli XCX that Harris is “brat,” a sentiment the pop artist shared on social media Sunday in a post that went viral. Jessup-Anger said she’s seen a lot of content over the past few days on TikTok featuring Harris paired with music by popular artists such as Taylor Swift and Kesha. “I think she’s iconic,” Jessup-Anger said of Harris, saying she also agrees with the vice president on policy issues such as abortion rights and education, and “overall seeing a strong independent woman on the ballot this November is really promising.” Harris has spent each day methodically targeting key parts of the Democratic base – including supporters in a crucial part of a swing state Tuesday, Black women on Wednesday and teachers on Thursday. She attempted to mobilize Black women – a key Democratic constituency that helped Biden secure the Democratic nomination in 2020 – in a speech to the Zeta Phi Beta sorority in Indianapolis. “There’s so much at stake at this moment. There’s so much at stake, and again in this moment, our nation – as it always has – is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize,” Harris said at the Black sorority’s Grand Boulé gathering. “To register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for our future.” She accused Trump of backing “a plan to return America to a dark past” and argued that some of Project 2025’s agenda, including cutting the Department of Education and Medicare, “represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future.” On Thursday, Harris traveled to Houston for the American Federation of Teachers’ convention, where she thanked the union for being the first to endorse her presidential campaign this week. Again, she pointed to Project 2025, saying that the agenda would stop student loan forgiveness for teachers and other public servants. “They even want to eliminate the Department of Education and Headstart, which, of course, would take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children,” she said. Harris’ campaign on Thursday also released the first video of her reelection campaign – a 75-second clip that features Beyoncé’s “Freedom.” The messengers are different, but the core theme bears similarities to what Biden said in his April 2023 reelection campaign launch video. In that three-minute video, Biden said: “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent. That’s why I’m running for reelection.” Harris, meanwhile, also emphasized an argument for “freedom” – though in a slight departure from Biden’s defense of democracy, she made the case more broadly, incorporating women’s reproductive rights and more. The video begins with Harris asking, “In this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in?” as scenes from her campaign rally in Milwaukee play. “We choose freedom. The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris said. “We choose a future where no child lives in poverty, where we can all afford health care. Where no one is above the law. We believe in the promise of America, and we’re ready to fight for it. Because when we fight, we win.”"

Follow the latest updates or scroll through the posts below. The Future Forward super PAC is launching a $50 million ad blitz to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris to voters in six key battleground states in the three weeks leading into the Democratic National Convention, a senior advisor to the group said. The advertising push is another example of how quickly the Democratic party has mobilized to boost Harris’ candidacy after President Joe Biden bowed out of the 2024 race. The ad campaign will begin on Saturday with a 30-second spot titled “Ready,” which features a narrator ticking through Harris’ accomplishments and declaring, “As America turns the page, Kamala is ready.” Watch the 30-second spot here. The effort will run on broadcast and cable television as well as digital streaming and YouTube platforms in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin through August 18, the senior adviser said. The group is gearing more than half of the ad buy over the next two weeks toward audiences watching the Olympics, including voters who might be less politically engaged. Future Forward moved quickly to begin making and testing new ads once the makeup of the 2024 race shifted this week. The group has produced more than 50 different spots about the expected contest between Harris and former President Donald Trump since Sunday. The super PAC had previously committed to spending $250 billion in advertising between the Democratic National Convention and Election Day. Future Forward has also seen an influx of cash in recent days, securing $150 million in new commitments in the 24 hours since Biden announced his decision to leave the race. Labor and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday in Arizona, giving Harris the boost of an influential Latino activist. Huerta endorsed Harris the morning of her visit to Arizona, which has a large Latino voting population that could help decide who wins the battleground state in November. Huerta endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. On Thursday, Huerta accused former President Donald Trump of having “attacked the Latino community on day one” with his speech launching his 2016 presidential campaign. “And he’s doing it again,” she argued.  Huerta applauded the Biden-Harris administration for allowing certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency and providing temporary status to migrants from South American countries. She was joined by Harris’ campaign manager Julia Chavez Rodriguez, who is the granddaughter of labor icon Cesar Chavez. Rodriguez called Harris the “perfect candidate to take on Donald Trump because she is Trump’s worst nightmare.” Thursday night’s campaign event was held in a hot warehouse belonging to a local carpenters’ union. The event featured a local Cumbia band and attendees could help themselves to free popsicles and tacos. Blaring over the speakers ahead of the event were Charli XCX songs off her “Brat” album. Earlier Thursday, Huerta and Rodriguez also visited a field office, the first to be opened in Arizona for the Biden-Harris campaign, and met with campaign volunteers. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu told CNN’s Pamela Brown that November’s race between Republican nominee Donald Trump and likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will be an “absolute coin toss.”  Sununu, who predicted on CNN last June that Biden would not end up being the party’s nominee, said he anticipates Harris will get a bump in the polls after the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.  Sununu, who was a vocal supporter of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley while she campaigned earlier this year to be atop the GOP ticket, said the way Republicans can defeat Harris through their messaging is by sticking to the issues and policy. Haley, who exited the race in March, said recent GOP attacks against Harris’ race and gender were “unhelpful” in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper earlier today. Sununu agreed with that position, saying Haley was “100% right” and that such personal attacks against Harris won’t move voters. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday met at the White House and discussed the ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations, with Biden stressing the need to finalize the deal as soon as possible, according to a readout from the White House.  Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of the Israeli-American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said he was able to ask “very difficult questions” to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting with hostage families in Washington on Thursday. Six of the seven families of US hostages, including Dekel-Chen, were represented in the room to discuss the current hostage situation in Gaza with US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu. Dekel-Chen, speaking to CNN’s Erin Burnett on Thursday after the meeting, could not provide many details about what Biden and Netanyahu spoke about with the families of hostages, but said that both leaders offered “a promise” that they “completely understand the urgency of this moment.” When asked if he thinks former US President Donald Trump had more “leverage” over Netanyahu to get a hostage deal, Dekel-Chen said it was an “illusion that a change in administration in the US is going to give more freedom of action to Israel to somehow negotiate some bigger, better deal.” Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is refusing to commit to any future debates until the Democratic nominee is officially chosen. Trump previously committed to a debate with President Biden on September 10 on ABC. Vice President Kamala Harris responded on social media to the Trump campaign’s statement. Earlier today, Harris said she was ready to debate the former president but added that Trump was “back pedaling” on debating her.  This post has been updated with additional comment from Vice President Kamala Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday gave the most forceful speech we’ve heard from the White House about the situation in Gaza since the war started almost 10 months ago. With Vice President Harris jumping into the presidential race the same week as Netanyahu’s unprecedented fourth address to Congress, questions immediately arose about how forceful she would be with Netanyahu and whether she would go farther than — or split from — President Joe Biden. Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel. The country has a right to defend itself, she said while noting, “how it does so matters.” But the empathy she used to describe the Palestinian plight and suffering is where you start to see the daylight between Biden and the president. As was how she described the ceasefire deal. She mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu. About the civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.” She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time.” Harris emphasized the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity, naming the eight Israeli-American hostages (three of whom have been killed). But when describing the ceasefire deal in the works, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange, or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.” That stands in stark contrast to Netanyahu’s speech to Congress. He didn’t mention the words “ceasefire” or “deal.” Instead there is a need for the “foreseeable future” he said, for “overriding security control” in Gaza. Whether the White House achieved their objective of getting Netanyahu to a place where he will agree to a ceasefire remains to be seen. Harris meanwhile left little doubt where she stands: “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.” Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance echoed former president Donald Trump’s criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she is a more liberal candidate than President Joe Biden. He argued that Biden stepping down and handing the reins to Harris is “fundamentally illegitimate” and that Republicans, by contrast,” respect the democratic process. “Kamala Harris has no democratic legitimacy,” Vance said. “Look at her record, Don. It is the worst record imaginable.” Claiming that the media is disinterested in focusing on Harris’ record, Vance said she will be rebranded as a moderate to win over voters in November. Vance criticized Harris for supporting an end to fracking and providing universal healthcare for undocumented immigrants as well as her policy on the US border.  Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to come out and deliver remarks after her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one more way in which she is quickly trying to prove herself in different ways following President Joe Biden leaving the 2024 race, a senior administration official tells CNN. Her remarks provided one of the clearest explanations yet of her views on the conflict as she warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government that how the war is prosecuted matters. Harris’ comments serve as one of the clearest distillations yet of her views as she works to thread the needle on the hot button issue that has not only divided the country but caused friction within the Democratic Party. And while the content of her remarks illustrate little daylight between her and President Joe Biden, they serve as an example of how her rhetoric has been far sharper than his on this issue.  Remember: The vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee expressed her “serious concern” about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, she named the American hostages held in the strip and in a notable moment, she illustrated her desire to acknowledge the “nuance” and “complexity” of the conflict.  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he’s “honored” to be a rumored contender for selection as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. While acknowledging the speculation, Beshear declined to reveal any details about the vice presidential vetting process during his weekly news conference in Frankfort, Kentucky. On offense against Vance: Beshear continued to attack the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who he has repeatedly criticized for claiming roots in Kentucky despite growing up in southern Ohio. Beshear said his attacks aren’t connected to his potential role on the Harris ticket or Vance’s place on the GOP ticket, but come from a desire to “stand up for our people.”  Vice President Kamala Harris has joined TikTok, posting her first video this afternoon. The campaign Tiktok, @kamalaHQ, has 1.6 million followers. People Magazine first reported Harris joining the social media app. After her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris made clear her “unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel, to its security and to the people of Israel.” While she supported Israel’s right to defend itself and also remembered the hostages still held in Gaza, she said she expressed to Netanyahu her “serious concern about the scale of human suffering” in the besieged enclave, including the civilian deaths and dire humanitarian situation that is unfolding there. Harris also urged Americans not to consider the war in Gaza a “binary issue.” She called on everyone to condemn terrorism, violence, antisemitism, Islamophobia and hate of any kind, and “do what we can” to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians.” “Let us work to unite our country,” the vice president concluded. Watch here: In remarks after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris said it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage release deal done. Recalling the details of the US-backed deal proposed, she said “it is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.” Harris also put her support behind the two-state solution as “the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure Jewish and democratic state, and one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security, and prosperity that they rightly deserve.” Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting now with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the vice president’s ceremonial office.  She did not take questions, and the press was escorted out quickly. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley offered no apologies Thursday for the “tough things” she said about former President Donald Trump during their bruising Republican primary fight, but she told CNN’s Jake Tapper she does not doubt her choice to support the former president over presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election. In her first interview since endorsing Trump and speaking at the Republican National Convention, Haley said President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race Sunday did not come as a surprise. Haley added: “I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and I think that’s what’s playing out.” Haley’s comments come in the wake of her decision to endorse Trump and speak at the GOP convention last week following a tumultuous primary, during which she repeatedly attacked the former president as “toxic,” “unhinged” and lacking “moral clarity.” In a wide-ranging interview, Haley brushed aside the rhetoric as just part of a campaign — which included Trump’s attacks on Haley and her husband while he was deployed overseas. Read more from the interview with Haley. House Speaker Mike Johnson is headed to Southern California on Thursday to visit the border, according to his office. He will be joined by Rep. Darrell Issa.  Johnson and Issa are expected to hold a news conference while in town and discuss the Biden/Harris administration’s border policies, as Republican attacks ramp up over the vice president’s record on the border. Johnson’s office confirmed that the news conference will happen along the “Whiskey 8” section of the border in San Ysidro, California, and visit the US Customs and Border Protection facilities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry and Imperial Beach locations. ABC News first reported the visit.  “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” ends its ninth season on Friday, but not without a PSA from a VIP: Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, stopped by the beloved reality show to remind viewers about the importance of voting. Her message will appear in Friday’s finale, which airs on Paramount+. Harris ended her message by encouraging viewers to register to vote and clapping along to RuPaul’s optimistic anthem “A Little Bit of Love.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, denied reports that he spoke with Harris campaign staff specifically yesterday about the role, but said he is in contact with the campaign about promoting their message to help Harris win in November.  Pritzker told reporters at a news conference in Chicago on Thursday he has had “a number of conversations” with people in the Harris campaign but denied a Chicago Sun-Times report that Pritzker spoke with Harris aides on Wednesday about the vice presidential role.  When pressed on whether he’s spoken to Harris aides, Pritzker suggested his conversations have focused on his role as a surrogate for the Harris campaign.  “Well, sure, I don’t know anybody who’s involved with Democratic politics that isn’t talking to their campaign,” Pritzker said. “I know people who work on the campaign, and I am involved in transmitting the message of the campaign and excited about the next days.” Vice President Kamala Harris is a “steadfast” friend of Israel, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday. “I can tell you for sure because I’ve been in the room with her, since my two and a half years of being here at the White House, that Vice President Harris shares President Biden’s steadfast commitment to the nation of Israel, to the security of the Israeli people, to making sure Israel can defend itself against attacks like they suffered on the seventh of October. She’s been a full partner,” Kirby said. However, he would not say whether she would consider herself a Zionist, similar to how President Joe Biden has described himself. “I won’t speak for the vice president in that level of detail, but I can tell you having seen her at work: She absolutely believes in all the facets of a free, secure, independent Israel, the nation of Israel, and the safety and security of the Israeli people. And she has been working harder than just about anybody to make sure that that as a team we are looking after our commitments to our neighbors, and our allies, our friends in Israel,” he told CNN. President Joe Biden’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today marked his first sit-down with a world leader since he exited the 2024 race on Sunday. The high-profile meeting — and Netanyahu’s visit to Washington this week in general — has put one of the country’s most politically fraught foreign policy issues front and center for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is also meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday. Here’s what we know about the prime minister’s White House visit so far today: Thanking Biden for his support: In remarks made in front of reporters, Netanyahu thanked Biden for “50 years of support” for Israel and said he looked forward to working with Biden for the rest of his term. A photo shared by the Israeli Government Press Office showed Netanyahu had signed the guestbook in the Roosevelt Room and thanked Biden for “decades of friendship and support” for Israel. Pressure campaign: Behind closed doors, Biden was expected to be as forceful as he has ever been in urging Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire agreement, sources tell CNN. A meeting with the families of Americans held hostage or killed by Hamas was viewed as an opportunity to hold Netanyahu accountable for his commitment to pursuing a peace deal, two US officials said. After the meeting, family members said the US government, Congress and Israeli leadership appeared to be on the same page. “While they could not share details, what they could share was this relationship. Maybe sometimes it’s rocky, but right now, you see it’s solid,” one family member, Liz Hirsh Naftali, said. The families said they received an “iron clad” commitment to a peace deal from Netanyahu and Biden. What the administration is saying: The differences remaining between ceasefire negotiators for Israel and Hamas “are narrow enough that, with some compromise and some leadership on both sides here, we believe that we can get this over the finish line,” White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Thursday. “We want to get this done,” he said on “CNN News Central,” adding that the Biden administration is pressuring leaders from both sides. A State Department spokesperson also pushed back Thursday on Netanyahu’s claim to Congress that there were “practically” no civilian casualties in Rafah outside of one incident, saying “of course” there were civilian casualties in the southern Gazan city due to Israel’s military campaign. CNN’s Michael Conte and Sam Fossum contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with comments from family members following a joint meeting with Biden and Netanyahu. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a possible contender for Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate pick, attacked Sen. JD Vance over his stance on abortion, Ukraine, and his comments about childless women. Kelly also said that Vance’s opposition to aid for Ukraine is deeply concerning. “If Donald Trump and JD Vance were back in the White House, it would be an utter disaster, and it would have a significant negative impact on our national security and the national security of our allies for decades,” he told reporters. Asked about Vance’s comments about childless women, Kelly replied, “You know, it’s a ridiculous thing to say about someone. You know, it’s obnoxious, it’s rude, it’s also not surprising.”  The Arizona Democrat refused to say what he spoke about with Harris, but indicated that he is ready to serve as her running mate if asked. “I’ve been a public servant since I was, even before I was in the Navy. I drove an ambulance when I was in high school. You know, I was a astronaut for 15 years. I flew with an aircraft carrier,” said Kelly. Sen. Tim Kaine, who ran on Hillary Clinton’s ticket in 2016, weighed in on Vice President Kamala Harris’ expedited search for her own running mate and shared that he has counseled many of those currently in consideration. He also said that he’s talked with several of the people who are currently being vetted and shared his experience with them directly: “It’s very intense, but it’s an honor to do it.” While he declined to weigh in on any specific candidates, Kaine said that “she’s got a lot of good options.” CNN previously reported that Harris will choose a running mate in less than two weeks with the top contenders currently being North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. “It’s normally a two-month process, and they go to do it in two weeks,” Kaine remarked, adding “I’m sure they’ll do a great job.” Vice President Kamala Harris said she is ready to debate former President Donald Trump. “And I’ll tell you I’m ready to debate Donald Trump. I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10 debate, he agreed to that previously. Now it appears he’s back pedaling. But I’m ready,” Harris told reporters after landing at Joint Base Andrews. About that date: Trump and President Joe Biden’s campaign had previously agreed to two debates this year, one hosted by CNN in June and another to be hosted by ABC on September 10. It’s not clear if that debate will still take place now that Biden has dropped out. Meanwhile, Fox News has proposed a presidential debate between Trump and Harris on September 17. Harris in her remarks today did not elaborate whether she would accept the debate proposed by Fox News. “I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage. And so I’m ready, let’s go,” Harris said Thursday. Earlier this week, Trump told reporters on a press call he wants to debate Harris but that he has not yet agreed to anything.  “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,” Trump said on the call. “But I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different, because they have the same policies. I think debating’s important for a presidential race, I really do, you sort of have an obligation to debate.” White House official John Kirby dismissed questions about whether President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race would impede his ability to either help secure a ceasefire and hostage deal for Israel and Gaza or secure the release of detained Americans abroad like Paul Whelan. Asked about wrongfully detained Americans abroad, like Evan Gershkovich and Whelan, Kirby said: “I can assure you that we continue to work extremely hard at getting all wrongfully detained Americans around the world, including those in Russia.”  Minutes into his first solo event as Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance had already divided his hometown audience here – over donuts. While reconnecting with the locals in the crowd over shared memories and favored haunts, Vance posited taking his security detail to nearby Central Pastry Shop after his event. Amid laughter, stans of a rival donut shop shouted at the stage: “Milton’s!” The Ohio Republican, in damage control mode, offered to the dissenters, “I love Milton’s, too.” Crisis averted. Vance has already faced far greater upheaval than pastry debates since joining the Republican ticket – more than perhaps any modern vice presidential nominee. The political landscape Vance stepped into 10 days ago is no longer recognizable after President Joe Biden abruptly ended his campaign. The fallout has left him without a Democratic counterpart after Vice President Kamala Harris quickly emerged as her party’s presumptive nominee. It could be more than a week before Harris selects her running mate. “I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump’s going to get to debate her?” Vance joked Monday in the Middletown High School auditorium, surrounded by his wife and friendly faces from his childhood. “I’m kind of pissed off about that if I’m being honest with you.” Read more about Vance’s first 10 days as Trump’s running mate here. Watch video analysis of Vance’s early poll numbers since Trump’s VP selection. Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she has to confront the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister. Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed. But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to nail down an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal, and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term. Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as protests erupted near the US Capitol. On Thursday, she’s set to welcome Netanyahu to her ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building. But articulating a clear position on Israel will take more than that, according to CNN’s conversations with two dozen former and current aides, members of Congress and other political players. Read the full story. America’s most powerful industry is set to have a presidential candidate on the ballot from its home turf — Vice President Kamala Harris. Top technology leaders are already showing their excitement for the Bay Area native, in the form of endorsements and donations for Harris, which have come from prominent names, such as longtime Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix Co-Founder Reed Hastings and philanthropist Melinda French Gates. The Harris supporters represent a foil to the loud and powerful — although not necessarily large — contingent of (mostly) men in tech who have endorsed Former President Donald Trump’s White House bid, including Elon Musk. The pro-Harris movement within tech suggests that the vice president’s policies, as well as her long and friendly relationship with many top executives in the tech world, may ultimately make her Silicon Valley’s top choice for the White House. Read more about those supporting Harris from Silicon Valley here. To understand the wave of coconut tree and K-Hive content that’s hitting your social media feeds and your group texts this week, you need some context.  Deja Foxx has it. She worked for the Kamala Harris campaign as a social media strategist during the then senator’s failed 2019 run. She was just 19 at the time. Now, at 24, she can say she’s worked in politics for nearly half her life. As she told Audie Cornish on The Assignment, the current internet obsession with remixing Harris’ 2023 White House speech invoking a coconut tree isn’t that surprising. The memes have power in part because they arose organically, created by Harris fans who were deliberately repurposing a moment that had originally been seen as a gaffe by detractors, who mocked the vice president’s delivery and laugh.  “Memes are meant to feel like insider language, right? That there is a certain group of people who understands them and can tap into them is what makes them potent,” Foxx said.   And the people wielding the memes — mostly Gen Z women who spend a lot of time on TikTok — have sharp insight into what it means to be very publicly online.  “Young women and girls are being forced to come of age, to go from girlhood to womanhood, in the public eye in a way that is just unprecedented,” Foxx said. “And I think that they have two kinds of people to look to. They look to their divas and their pop stars, and they look to politicians to see what it means to become a woman, in front of everyone.”  There’s a fine line between tapping into the zeitgeist and overdoing it with the coconuts, Foxx said. Political campaigns, Harris’ included, are smart to keep young people in the room and in positions of leadership in part because they’re the ones who will tell you when you’ve gone too far.   “They can create and uplift the messages that are arising organically without overdoing it or making it feel cringe,” she said. “This is where trusted messengers, I think, are really, really important.”  Listen to the full conversation on The Assignment here.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says it’s “humbling” to be considered among the shortlist of potential running mates for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. It’s “surreal” to be among the list of contenders, the former teacher-turned-politician said in a Wednesday night interview with MSNBC. “It is humbling, it’s a privilege, it’s surreal,” he said. Walz, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, called the fellow governors reported to be in contention to be Harris’ running mate “my friends,” and urged Harris to choose a governor. Jabs at Vance: Walz also used the interview to take veiled jabs at the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The governor referenced Vance’s previous remarks about Harris and other Democrats being “childless cat ladies.” “Oh my God, they went after cat people. Good luck with that. Turn on the internet and see what cat people do when you go after them,” Walz said. Key progressive’s backing: Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal told CNN’s Manu Raju on Thursday that she supports Walz as Harris’ pick. The Washington lawmaker said Walz has strong union ties, is committed to the Biden-Harris agenda and would bring deep support in purple states in the Midwest. CNN’s Morgan Rimmer contributed reporting to this post. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida attacked Vice President Kamala Harris as a “real liberal” who has led on policies that “have destroyed the country,” while Democrats pushed back on GOP criticisms of Harris on the border. Vulnerable Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin said that former President Donald Trump is to blame for the continued crisis at the border, not Harris, noting that in the Senate, “we had a border measure that was very strong, endorsed by the Border Patrol, and Trump, Donald Trump tanked it.” Democratic Campaign Committee Chair Suzan DelBene added that there has been a major uptick in enthusiasm — and donations — since Harris announced her candidacy. “We had our highest day of the cycle right after she announced she was running, and we’re continuing to see strong support in grassroots across the nation,” she said. Rubio dismissed concerns about this new jolt of energy in the race, saying that “both sides are going to have enthusiasm.” Vulnerable New York GOP Rep. Marc Molinaro compared the surge in enthusiasm Democrats are experiencing to what Republicans felt after the assassination attempt of Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly condemned pro-Hamas protesters who burned the American flag outside Union Station in Washington, DC, Wednesday. Harris also condemned the “burning of the American flag,” calling the flag a “symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America.” Conservative hardliners Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Anna Paulina Luna defended GOP Rep. Tim Burchett calling Vice President Kamala Harris a “DEI hire” earlier this week. “Tim Burchett was just echoing what Joe Biden said,” Greene told CNN, pointing to a video where Biden touts the diversity in his administration. In the video, Biden does not say that he chose Harris because of her race or her gender. “I think that that’s just saying what the Democrat Party and Joe Biden had said himself. I don’t see how it’s wrong to repeat Democrats, their own words,” she added.  Pressed on the fact that Biden never said he hired Harris because she was a black woman, Greene doubled down.  “He picked her, therefore he hired her. So those, that’s what the Democrats did, the Democrat Party. They’re the party of making identity and race qualifications for hiring someone,” continued Greene. “I think it should be their character, what they’re capable of, their background, you know, their resume. This is the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party, those are their words, and that’s what Joe Biden chose.” Luna argued that Burchett had not crossed a line. “I just, I think that there’s a double standard and I think that he uses words that the left likes to push. They want DEI, they want diversity, equity inclusion, and for argument’s sakes, Kamala Harris does fit the Diversity Equity and Inclusion term,” she said. “Yeah, it’s been taken out of context, I think because of who said it.” Read more about the ongoing controversy surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion here. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Vice President Kamala Harris is “a key player” in the Biden administration’s foreign policy decision-making processes.  Harris “has always been engaged and involved, is always prepared to for whatever discussion that we’re going to have,” said Austin at a news conference at the Pentagon. Austin ran through a laundry list of the foreign policy challenges the Biden administration had faced that Harris had been involved in, such as, “the strikes that we’ve had to take, the deployments that we’ve done, (and) the decision to support Ukraine.” He added that Harris “absolutely loves troops.” “She’s always been focused on the welfare of our troops and our families, and also veterans as well,” said Austin. Vice President Kamala Harris slammed GOP policies concerning gun violence while addressing the American Federation of Teachers union in Houston. “We want to ban assault weapons, and they want to ban books,” she said. She told the teachers union that “extremist” Republicans have failed to pass gun safety laws to protect both students and teachers. She continued addressing the teachers union: “While you teach students about our nation’s past, these extremists attack the freedom to learn and acknowledge our nation’s true and full history — including book bans,” she added. Addressing a teachers union in Houston on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris told crowd members that: “In this moment we are in a fight for our most fundamental freedoms. And to this room of leaders, I say: bring it on.” “Bring it on. Bring it on,” Harris continued. In response, the crowd started chanting: “Bring it on! Bring it on! Bring it on!” Once the chants stopped, Harris told the crowd: Vice President Kamala Harris said President Joe Biden showed “once again what true leadership looks like” when he addressed the nation Wednesday night. Harris made the comments speaking to a teachers union in Houston on Thursday, where she added that Biden’s policies focus on the future of the country. “He thinks and talks about his work and our country, understanding what it means in terms of what we do now and how that will impact the future. He thinks about our history and the context of the importance of the work we do now,” Harris said. Vice President Kamala Harris said that under her administration she will continue President Joe Biden’s legacy and not go back to failed economic policies of former President Donald Trump. The Democratic National Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission, claiming independent candidate Cornel West accepted illegal in-kind contributions from Republican-aligned firms to assist his ballot access efforts in Arizona and North Carolina. The DNC announced it filed the complaint last week against West’s campaign and three outside groups suggesting that Republicans are illegally backing West’s ballot access operation in two key battleground states. The complaint argues People Over Party and Blitz Canvassing, which have aided West’s campaign in North Carolina, and Wells Marketing, which has petitioned on behalf of West in Arizona, were not paid for their work in compliance with campaign finance laws. The efforts by People Over Party and Blitz Canvassing in North Carolina were the subject of the North Carolina State Board of Election’s investigation into West’s ballot access petition earlier this month. The board subsequently blocked West from appearing on the state’s ballot after the board chair stated he has “no confidence” signatures collected by the Republican-aligned groups were “done legitimately.” West’s campaign is appealing the board’s decision in federal court. CNN has reached out to West’s campaign for comment. House Republicans passed a symbolic resolution attacking Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, over immigration. The vote was 220 to 196. Six Democrats voted with Republicans in favor – Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Yadira Caraveo of Colorado, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Mary Peltola of Alaska.  The resolution “strongly condemns the Biden administration and its border czar, Kamala Harris’s, failure to secure the United States border,” according to the text. The resolution itself is a messaging exercise and has no real penalties for Harris. The White House has rejected GOP claims dubbing Harris “border czar,” arguing that her focus was on the region and not on border security.  This is the last vote in the House until September 9 as the chamber breaks for August recess. Former President Barack Obama is expected to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris soon and his team has been in touch with the campaign, a source told CNN. Obama and Harris have been in touch regularly, and he is serving as a sounding board for her, as he has been over the 20 years they’ve known each other, the source said.  Obama believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process where delegates select their new nominee, and he thinks Harris is off to an impressive start, this source said. Former President Donald Trump made at least 10 false claims about Vice President Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. We’re still looking into some of his claims, but at least 10 were wrong. Here’s just one of the false claims the former president made, for the full list read this story. Harris and the retirement age Discussing Social Security, Trump claimed of President Joe Biden and Harris: “They’re talking about, he was talking, she’s talking about – lifting the retirement age.” Facts First: This claim is false about Harris. She has not spoken in favor of raising the age for receiving Social Security retirement benefits. (Biden did, as a US senator in the 2000s and prior, express support for or openness to raising the retirement age, but he has been a vocal opponent of the idea as president.) Harris has supported increasing, not reducing, Social Security benefits. In 2019, about two years before she became vice president, she co-sponsored a bill from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called the Social Security Expansion Act, that would boost Social Security benefits by raising payroll taxes on high earners. President Joe Biden is expected to be as forceful as he has ever been in urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire agreement when the two leaders meet privately at the White House Thursday afternoon, sources tell CNN, as US officials believe that a deal may be on the cusp.  Biden’s in-person meeting with Netanyahu comes only days after the president’s stunning announcement dropping out of the 2024 race over the weekend, and a resolution to the Israel-Hamas war that began in October now looms large over Biden’s legacy as a one-term president. Progress in the negotiations for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war have come in fits and starts in recent months, and Biden and his senior national security officials have been closely involved in trying to land the deal.  Biden will also have a second separate setting Thursday afternoon where he could apply firm pressure on Netanyahu to finalize the ceasefire agreement – a joint meeting with the prime minister with the families of American hostages in Gaza.  Multiple sources stressed that no major announcement about an agreement is expected on Thursday – however, as CNN reported this week, US and Israeli officials have voiced increased optimism about the prospects of an agreement.  Speaking at her first public event since her husband dropped his bid for reelection, first lady Jill Biden told US Olympic athletes’ families in Paris, France, that President Joe Biden had led the country with “hope always in his heart.”  She paused as the crowd applauded. “Thank you,” she said, “I’ll take that home to him.” “As he says, there is nothing America can’t do when we do it together,” she continued, “and we see that, especially now at the Olympics, in this moment. We are more than our cities or states or backgrounds, we are more than our jobs or our political parties. We are all first and foremost Team USA.” President Joe Biden saved his most powerful argument against Donald Trump for the moment he explained to the nation why he was no longer the person to make it. In his primetime Oval Office address on Wednesday, Biden ceded the political stage to Kamala Harris, ushering in an unusual period heading into the election where the vice president, not the president, will lead their party. Apart from Biden’s announcement on Sunday not to seek reelection, after days of Democratic Party turmoil, the speech was the most critical moment in his attempt to pass power to Harris. The new presumptive Democratic nominee must now work quickly to carve her own political identity and to make a case for her own presidency — a task in which she must create a vision, program and aura that is distinct from Biden’s and his political liabilities. This reversal of power dynamics requires Biden to swallow his own aspirations, may at times compromise his dignity, and for Harris, at some point — perhaps as soon as this week over Gaza — to break from her boss for her own political good. Read more about what Biden tried to achieve in his address here. House Democrats Wednesday night praised President Joe Biden for his speech explaining his decision to step aside from the presidential race, putting an end to a bitter chapter of Democratic infighting over Biden’s future where many Democratic lawmakers publicly and privately pressured the president to not run for reelection. Biden’s disastrous debate performance on June 27 sent the Democratic Party into a tailspin, where concerns about the president’s mental acuity and the negative impact that could have on down ballot races culminated in 36 House and Senate Democrats publicly calling on Biden to end his presidential campaign. But in the wake of Biden’s heartfelt speech, the consensus among lawmakers was one of gratitude, ready to bury the hatchet. Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who had called for Biden to step aside, praised the speech, saying: “He did a great job of laying out why he did what he did.” Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who at one point told Biden that polling showed that the president cannot defeat Donald Trump and that Biden could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November if he continues seeking a second term, called Biden’s address “great.” “He made me cry,” Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a staunch Biden supporter amid concerns about his electability, said. Read the full story. Former First Lady Melania Trump will release a new memoir, titled “Melania,” this fall, her office announced on Thursday, describing the book as “a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has carved her own path, overcome adversity and defined personal excellence.” Her first memoir will offer a rare glimpse into the famously private former first lady, who has maintained a low profile throughout her husband’s campaign, having attended just three public appearances since he launched his third presidential bid. The book will include stories and family photos that have “never before shared with the public,” her office said. They did not include a release date, and it is unclear whether the book will be published before Election Day.  “Melania” will be released by Skyhorse Publishing, which has published a series of books by other supporters of former President Donald Trump, including former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Trump’s former attorney Alan Dershowitz. Last year, Skyhorse published “The Great Awakening” by conservative firebrand and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, which was written in part by Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon. Skyhorse has also published books by third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. The book will be released in two editions — a “Collector’s Edition,” featuring “256 pages in full color throughout, with each copy signed by the author,” which will be sold for $150, and a “Memoir Edition,” which is 304 pages and will be sold for $40. Signed copies of the “Memoir Edition” will go for $75. Both editions are available for pre-order through Melania Trump’s website.  The office of the former First Lady did not comment beyond the press release. President Joe Biden said Thursday’s GDP report makes it clear “we now have the strongest economy in the world” and specifically name-dropped Vice President Kamala Harris. “When I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression” Biden wrote in a statement released Thursday morning. He adds later in the statement: “The Vice President and I will keep fighting for America’s future—a future of promise and possibilities, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.” Biden typically touts economic numbers like the GDP, but his inclusion of Harris twice is notable. In his statement on the first-quarter GDP, he didn’t mention Harris once. State of the economy: As CNN previously reported, economic growth in the first half of the year was solid, with the economy expanding a robust 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter, according to fresh Commerce Department figures released Thursday, which are adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings. Businesses are continuing to invest, and a key gauge of consumer demand has been robust this year. As the economy continued to expand from April through June, inflation resumed a downward trend, the latest GDP report showed, and seems to be on track to slowing further toward the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Former President Donald Trump claimed Vice President Kamala Harris is “a much worse candidate” than President Joe Biden. “Should he stay? I guess that’s up to him, and it’s up to the people and I don’t think they should use the 25th Amendment,” Trump said on Fox & Friends. “You have not long to go, you know, we have four months now, and then he’s got another month and a half.”   “I think if he goes, she then takes over and she is worse than he is, I really believe. She is a San Francisco radical,” Trump said. “She is actually, I think a much worse, in a way, a much worse candidate.” Trump claimed that the way in which Biden ended his 2024 bid “was a coup.” “They didn’t want him running. He was way down in the polls, and they thought he was gonna lose. They went to him, and they said, ‘You can’t win the race,’ which I think is true. Unless I did something very foolish, which I wasn’t going to do,” Trump said.   Trump continued his barrage of attacks against his likely new opponent Harris, saying, “She’s bad news. She’s a radical left, not very smart person.”  Less than 24 hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, former President Donald Trump said Israel has a public relations problem and needs to end the war with Hamas quickly.  “I want him to finish up and get it done quickly. You gotta get it done quickly, because they are getting decimated with this publicity. And you know, Israel is not very good at public relations,” Trump said on Fox and Friends. Trump will meet with Netanyahu on Friday.   Trump reasserted his claim that the Hamas-led October 7 attacks wouldn’t have happened if he were president.  Asked if he would change US weapons policy to Israel, Trump said, “I would make sure that it gets over with fast. You have to end this fast. It can’t continue to go on like this. It’s too long. It’s too much.”  Trump said he suspected “bad news” with the hostages, many of whom he believes are dead. “I think you’re going to find that one of the reasons that Hamas is not really negotiating very nicely, I think they are saying wow, they the hostages back and we have killed the hostages. I think a lot of the hostages are dead” Trump said.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said while she thinks the country is ready for an all-female ticket, she intends to serve out the rest of her term as governor instead of potentially becoming Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Asked in an interview with theSkimm, taped on Wednesday, whether she thought the country was prepared to elect two women to serve in the White House, Whitmer answered, “I do, actually.” She went on to highlight the abundance of women in leadership in Michigan, which currently has a female governor, secretary of state and attorney general, along with several others. Asked what Harris should be looking for in a running mate, Whitmer made clear, “Kamala Harris in and of herself has more experience than the whole GOP ticket put together.” “(Donald Trump and JD Vance) only have six years of public service experience, and I often point out to people, you wouldn’t go into brain surgery and ask for the freshest neurosurgeon out of medical school. Experience is important,” she continued. Whitmer said she’s “confident” Harris will choose someone she “trusts, that shares her values, that can step into the breach in the very unlikely event that they would ever need to, that they would be ready.” Vice President Kamala Harris starts her day Thursday in Houston, where she will deliver the keynote speech at the American Federation of Teachers’ 88th national convention.  She will then head to Washington, DC, for a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at 4:30 p.m. ET. Ahead of her meeting with Netanyahu, Harris strongly condemned pro-Hamas protesters who burned the American flag outside Union Station in Washington, DC, Wednesday. “Yesterday, at Union Station in Washington, D.C. we saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric,” Harris wrote in a statement Thursday. Harris also condemned the “burning of the American flag,” calling the flag a “symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.”  “I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,” Harris wrote. Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that Secret Service shouldn’t have allowed him on stage at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally where he was shot in an assassination attempt.  “Now, they just weren’t communicating properly with the local police. Different groups of people knew there was some nut job on the roof and he was up there,” Trump continued, mentioning the woman in the crowd who warned about the shooter and the municipal officer who came face-to-face with him. Trump said that often the Secret Service has him wait 10 or 15 minutes before taking the stage at a rally due to lightning or thunder, and questioned why he was sent on stage this time.  While Trump praised the Secret Service agents who rushed on top of him after shots were fired, he said there was clearly a failure of communication between the Secret Service and the local police and that someone should have been on the roof where the shooter was.   “It’s just a terrible thing. It’s such a shame, and the Secret Service, they’re such great people,” Trump said. “It’s a blight on their reputation. There should have been somebody on the roof,” Trump said.  The likely 2024 presidential election campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump begins with no clear leader, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Trump holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. That’s a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found on the matchup between Biden and Trump. The survey finds voters widely supportive of both Biden’s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are broadly enthusiastic about Harris and willing to coalesce around her as the new presumptive nominee, even as they remain deeply divided on whether Biden’s Democratic successor should seek to continue his policies or chart a new course. The poll, conducted online July 22 and 23, surveyed registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June, both of which found Trump leading Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head matchup. Checking back in with the same people means that shifts in preferences are more likely to reflect real changes over time and not just statistical noise. And the new poll finds some critical movement in these early days of a Harris-Trump race. Harris hangs on to 95% of those who earlier said they supported Biden, while Trump retains the support of a slightly smaller 92% of his previous backers. Those who previously said they would support neither Biden nor Trump in a two-way matchup now split 30% for Harris and 27% for Trump, with the rest saying they’d vote for someone else or opt out of this year’s election. Half of those who back Harris in the new poll (50%) say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump. That’s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden’s supporters in CNN’s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president. About three-quarters of Trump’s supporters (74%) say their vote is to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris. That’s an increase in affirmative support for him compared with the June CNN poll (66%), which came before an assassination attempt on Trump’s life and the Republican National Convention at which the former president formally accepted his party’s nomination. The poll finds Trump’s favorability rating ticking up to 43%, higher than it’s been since 2020 in CNN polling. Read more about the new CNN poll. Fox News has proposed a debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on September 17.  The debate invitation from the right-wing cable network would take place in the swing state of Pennsylvania, with anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum serving as moderators, it said Wednesday. In letters to the Trump and Harris campaigns, Fox News President Jay Wallace and Vice President of Politics Jessica Loker said it is “open to discussion on the exact date, format and location – with or without an audience.” The network attached statistics and ratings which it said pointed to its “strength with key demographics such as independents in swing states.” Trump and President Joe Biden’s campaign had previously agreed to two debates this year, one hosted by CNN in June and another to be hosted by ABC on September 10. Trump has also expressed displeasure at ABC and has previously posted that he wants Fox News to host the debate instead of the Disney-owned network. In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he “absolutely” wants to debate Harris, and “would be willing to do more than one debate, actually.” Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday released her first video for her presidential campaign: “We choose freedom.” The 75-second video begins with Harris asking: “In this election, we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in?” as scenes from her first campaign rally in Milwaukee play. As the video transitions into clips of Donald Trump and JD Vance, she continues, “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate.” Harris makes clear the message of her campaign—choosing freedom—as she highlights many controversial issues including women’s reproductive rights and gun violence prevention, both of which she has led the charge for the White House. “We choose a future where no child lives in poverty, where we can all afford health care. Where no one is above the law. We believe in the promise of America and we’re ready to fight for it. Because when we fight, we win.” The video features Beyoncé’s song “Freedom.” A source close to Harris told CNN that her team got approval from Beyoncé’s representatives to use the song throughout her presidential campaign. Watch Kamala Harris’ first presidential campaign ad President Joe Biden has framed his decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race as a matter of saving democracy and passing “the torch to a new generation.” Last night, in a poignant address to the nation that marked the beginning of the closing chapter of his presidency and half-century in public service, Biden said uniting the party required sacrificing personal ambition for what he sees as a greater good. “I revere this office. But I love my country more,” he said. Biden is no longer a presumptive Democratic nominee trying to convince the nation that he has the stamina and faculties to take on Trump in an election in which he warned nothing less than democracy itself is in the balance. He’s now a lame duck, having thrown his political weight behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, after being convinced by fellow Democrats that he is politically incapable of seeking a second term. In his speech, Biden worked to shape the first draft of his own legacy, heralding his first-term accomplishments while looking ahead to goals for his remaining months in power, including Supreme Court reform, ending the war in Gaza, upholding American alliances and working toward his cancer-ending moonshot.

Kamala Harris wants to be America’s first Silicon Valley president. She has tech’s support | CNN Business,"Updated 9:35 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T09:30:02.454Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/tech/kamala-harris-tech-industry-support/index.html,"With Vice President Kamala Harris the front runner to receive the Democratic Party’s nomination for president, America’s most powerful industry is set to have a candidate on the ballot from its home turf. Top technology leaders are already showing their excitement for the Bay Area native, in the form of endorsements and donations for Harris, which have come from prominent names, such as longtime Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix Co-Founder Reed Hastings and philanthropist Melinda French Gates. The Harris supporters represent a foil to the loud and powerful — although not necessarily large — contingent of (mostly) men in tech who have endorsed Former President Donald Trump’s White House bid, including Elon Musk. The pro-Harris movement within tech suggests that the vice president’s policies, as well as her long and friendly relationship with many top executives in the tech world, may ultimately make her Silicon Valley’s top choice for the White House. “There’s been a real shift in the Valley toward supporting Harris in a way that was not happening with Biden,” Aaron Levie, CEO of the cloud computing firm Box, told CNN. “I am pretty optimistic. I believe she has some appreciation for the different dynamics that we deal with in the tech industry, and how important of a role tech is going to play in the in the future of the economy and the country.” Harris was born and began her political career in Oakland, California, a short ferry ride from the heart of the tech industry. She attended the wedding of early Facebook executive Sean Parker, and she’s appeared at events alongside Steve Jobs’ widow and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs. Harris’ failed 2020 presidential bid received support from various tech luminaries, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and legendary venture capitalist Ron Conway. Despite her friendly relationships with the industry’s leaders, Harris has also pushed for tech accountability in key areas. As California’s attorney general, she went after tech companies for their role in online sexual harassment and revenge porn. As a California senator in 2018, Harris grilled Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg over user privacy in a hearing following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. As vice president, Harris has taken a key role in the White House around establishing safety measures for artificial intelligence, which is widely viewed as the most consequential new technology in decades. Last year, Harris met with the chief executives of OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic on Capitol Hill to discuss AI safety measures and how to increase transparency among top tech firms and the government. “When she wanted to solve problems, she would bring social activists, public policy experts and business leaders together in common forums. …She just felt we should have all the players around the table and understand the issues and (tech leaders) love that that kind of a dialogue,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN. Harris can also stake a claim to some of the pro-tech actions taken by the Biden administration, including the Chips Act, which set aside funding to invest in US-production of critical computing components. Her record on tech stands in contrast to some of the policy positions that Trump has laid out for his possible second term, which tech leaders might find “toxic,” Sonnenfeld said. Trump’s anti-immigration stance and tariff plans, for example, could have serious ripple effects across Silicon Valley and send inflation higher again, numerous economists have warned. “Most folks that I’ve talked to didn’t really enjoy the chaos of the (prior) Trump administration,” Levie said. He added that the industry needs “level headed leadership that allows you to have a clear sense of trade policy and how you’re going to be interacting globally from a supply chain standpoint, versus on the Trump side, every day, you woke up to some new dynamic.” What’s more, many in tech likely appreciate Harris’ efforts to defend progressive causes, such as action on climate change and protecting reproductive rights, with which the industry has long been aligned. “Kamala Harris is the right person at the right time. …Harris’s background and leadership growing the economy, fighting for bodily autonomy, and protecting our democracy uniquely position her to push back against Trump’s extremism,” LinkedIn founder and tech investor Reid Hoffman said in a post on X. In an interview with CNN, Hoffman added: “In Silicon Valley, actually there’s many threads that are very excited about her. …She understands how technology can create a great difference for the American people.” –CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report."
Harris steps out on Israel as she navigates Biden and Netanyahu | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:17 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T05:00:02.392Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-israel-policy/index.html,"Four days into the most consequential week of Kamala Harris’ political life, she confronted the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country by looking directly into the eyes of an Israeli prime minister who decided not to even give her a passing name check in his address to Congress Wednesday afternoon. Up until now, Harris has been defined by working for President Joe Biden, arguably the most explicitly pro-Israel American president, even though his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has frayed. But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris has to define what kind of president she wants to be — on this and every other issue, while Biden remains at the White House trying to nail down a Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and with some around him thinking that restarting the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia could be a top legacy project for the remainder of his term. Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a pre-scheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana, as antisemitic protests erupted near the US Capitol where fences were put up like in the days following the January 6, 2021, riot. But after her meeting with the prime minister Thursday afternoon, she laid out what she wanted to be a very clear position, speaking to reporters in a way she has not done after previous meetings with foreign leaders. Harris started by recalling a history of connection to Israel that dates back to her childhood collecting money to plant trees there, and she ran through her work in the administration. She has, she said, “unwavering commitment” to Israel, its right to exist and its security. She called Hamas a “brutal terrorist organization.” She read the names of the American hostages still being held, and those who have died in captivity. “Israel has a right to defend itself,” she said, “and how it does so matters.” And the toll on the Palestinians matters, she said, as she called for everyone involved to push for a hostage release and ceasefire deal, and eventually, a two-state solution. “What has happened in Gaza over the last nine months is devastating,” she said. “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies, we cannot allow ourselves to be numb. And I will not be silent.” Harris is trying to clear up uncertainty about her position toward Israel, which has left even people who have talked in depth with her about it responding with pauses when CNN has asked whether, for example, she would have done the same as Biden in sending some, and halting other, weapons to Israel. And her remarks follow a statement on Thursday condemning the protests around Netanyahu’s speech in Washington as unequivocal: “I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.” Change is coming, predicted Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been critical of Israel in this period and observed Harris’ foreign policy thinking when they served on the Senate Intelligence Committee together. “President Biden brought to the White House a lifelong relationship with Bibi Netanyahu and a very mature history on the US-Israel relationship,” Murphy said. “This certainly seems to be a moment for a reconsideration of the relationship and for some fresh thinking on how to approach an Israeli political landscape that is lurching further to the right than we could have ever imagined.” Murphy added, “I think we would all benefit from getting a fresh set of eyes on this conflict and the way that the United States could try to create a viable Palestinian state.” But Harris has so many different pulls on her that an aide did not give a direct answer when asked if the vice president considers herself a Zionist — a term Biden again proudly embraced just weeks ago. That’s a reflection of how much Zionism, which for a century meant believing in the right of a Jewish homeland to exist, has been co-opted by anti-Israel forces, who argue it has come to symbolize colonialism and the killing of Palestinians. It’s also a reflection of the difference in thinking and rhetoric between the Democratic Party’s new standard bearer and a president who has made allegiance with Israel one of his defining positions for 50 years in national politics. “The vice president has been a strong and longstanding supporter of Israel as a secure, democratic homeland for the Jewish people. She will always ensure Israel can defend itself from threats, including from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah,” said Harris’ deputy national security adviser Dean Lieberman when asked if she considers herself a Zionist. “One can criticize specific policies of the government of Israel while still strongly supporting the state of Israel and the people of Israel. And that support for Israel in no way conflicts with the vice president’s strong view that the Palestinian people deserve freedom, dignity, and self-determination.” Many close observers see a sign of where Harris’ inclinations are in her choice of Phil Gordon to be her national security adviser. A former Obama administration official, Gordon in 2016 co-authored a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, which, seven years before the October 7 attacks, begins: “The U.S. relationship with Israel is in trouble.” The root of the problem, the authors wrote, is that while America and Israel used to agree on the threats to Israeli security and what to do about them, now those threats have become broader and more complicated, and the opinions about how to tackle them have too. Gordon has traveled to the region since October 7, holding meetings separate from the ones that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan and others have been having. One official who has been deeply involved with Biden administration policy on Israel said that Harris’ differences will actually be key to keeping the overall relationship from getting worse. “She’ll be able to communicate with another generation. She has the ability, because of who she is, to be enormously helpful to us who care deeply about Israel and how we’re going to get through this disaster,” said the official. “She is the future of the relationship between us and Israel.” Aides and allies who have talked with Harris – from her Senate days up through her being on the line for nearly every conversation Biden has had with Netanyahu – insist that substantively there is little daylight between her and the president. The difference is rhetorical, but that difference, they say, is very important. She has been concerned since right after October 7 both about expressing empathy for the Palestinians and about thinking of what the political reverberations could be back home from the way Biden hugged Netanyahu close, figuratively and then literally on his trip to Israel two weeks after the attacks. It’s the explanation, aides involved tell CNN, for the fury that erupted from the West Wing in March about the way Harris punctuated prepared text that both decried the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and thoroughly condemned Hamas. She built up to her reading of “there must be an immediate ceasefire,” taking a long pause, then adding the rest of the approved sentence: “for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.” Many Democrats outside the White House are making optimistic guesses that she aligns with them. “Like most Americans, the vice president falls within the pro-Israel mainstream—somewhere between the ‘Greater Israel’ far right and the ‘Free Palestine’ far left,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat who has positioned himself as one of the most stalwart defenders of Israel. He added that he expects that position to translate into being for a two-state solution, keeping up security aid and Iron Dome funding for Israel and supporting the Trump administration-negotiated Abraham Accords. For all the Biden speeches that had to be paused as protesters were removed from the rooms, Harris’ first week effectively on the top of the ticket hasn’t seen such an interruption so far. That doesn’t mean the politics of this are settled. Abbas Alawieh – a delegate who won a spot at the Democratic convention because he represents some of the 730,000 people who voted “uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary – told CNN on Wednesday that he remains “very curious how she will differentiate a Gaza policy.” Alawieh said he’s hopeful. At the very least, he thinks that the party under Harris’ leadership will no longer make him and others aligned with him feel “neglected, ignored—and in some cases maligned,” as happened on a Tuesday night call of state delegates when another person told him to shut up when he tried to speak. The Michigan Democratic Party chair condemned that behavior in an email to delegates. Meanwhile, the Republican Jewish Coalition released an online ad on Wednesday repeatedly referring to Harris by a mispronounced version of her first name and falsely claimed that she “sided with the pro-Hamas demonstrators” and snubbed Israel by not attending Netanyahu’s speech to Congress. Trump also accused her of this, saying at a rally in North Carolina that “she’s running away from Israel” and “totally against the Jewish people” for not going. Neither the ad nor the candidate mentioned that Ohio Sen. JD Vance also skipped the speech, though he had no other public schedule, with campaign spokesman Jason Miller telling CNN he “has duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for vice president.” Harris’ connection to these issues is more than policy. It touches second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s daughter, who has been noticeably active on pro-Palestinian causes since October 7. It has come up at Seder dinners at the Naval Observatory. And more than anything, it is rooted in the second gentleman. Emhoff has talked at length about feeling a sense of duty, not just when he became the first Jewish spouse of a vice president or president, and channeling that into helping develop the administration’s strategy to combat antisemitism. He’s also talked about how much pain he felt personally after October 7. Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, recalled a trip to Jerusalem she took with Harris and Emhoff in 2017, when she was working in the California Democrat’s new Senate office. She still has photos of Harris taking out a traditional kippah head covering for Emhoff when they visited the Western Wall. Soifer said she is satisfied that Harris remains committed to Israel — even after being read the indirect answer about whether the vice president considers herself a Zionist. And Emhoff has stressed that even as this campaign picks up, he is going to keep talking about Judaism and Israel, as he has throughout this administration with his wife’s encouragement. On a quickly organized Zoom call Wednesday afternoon hosted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala, where he made made a surprise appearance, Emhoff started by reiterating Harris’ unwavering support for Israel. But he also told the story of not being with his wife on Sunday when the news broke about Biden exiting the race, dropping a little Yiddish by blaming “this flight mishigas” that had him stuck in Los Angeles. Then he made a promise to the 1,700 people listening: “I’m going to keep living openly like a Jew and maybe there will be a mezuzah on the White House, like there is on the vice president’s residence.” This story has been updated with Harris’ remarks following her meeting with Netanyahu."
How older Democratic voters are responding to Harris replacing Biden | CNN Politics,"Published 5:30 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T21:30:58.232Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/older-democrats-biden-harris-pennsylvania/index.html,"Darrell Ann Murphy is relieved, grateful and newly hopeful Democrats can win Pennsylvania and the White House. But she is also still upset, a little mad even. “Wow, we’re losing Joe Biden,” said Murphy, 83, a retiree who keeps busy teaching the Chinese tile game Mahjong to fellow seniors. “Joe was us. He was every one of us. He cared so much about the middle class and everyone else of course.” We revisited Murphy this week at her Easton home, and she assembled the same group for a Mahjong game as she did when we first stopped by five months ago. Then, three of the four women at the table said they believed Biden was up to the job and that criticism of his age was unfair. This time, all four said the 81-year-old president was doing the right thing by stepping away from the campaign. “Surprise and relief” was how Catherine Long characterized her reaction. Long said she believes it was the president’s decision in the end, but added, “I didn’t like how people were telling him to get out of the game.” Mary Ann Horvath also used the term relief and “much less anxiety.” We included these voters in our All Over the Map battleground state project because they are all above the age of 70, members of the country’s most reliable voting demographic and residents of one of its bellwether presidential counties. The project’s goal is to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of key voters — and what we heard, then and now, about their takes on the Biden age issue was telling. The debate was the decisive moment. “It was sad,” Horvath said. But all of our Northampton County voters also told us they saw things in the weeks, even months, before the June debate that gave them pause: incomplete thoughts, mixing up names, slower and stiffer movements. “I know how things can change when you’re older,” Murphy said. “Past 80, things can change on a dime.” The mood among Democrats here is suddenly very different. Before Biden’s decision, morale was low and losing seemed inevitable. Now, the energy is palpable, even though Democrats here understand Kamala Harris faces a tough challenge in Pennsylvania. “I don’t think a lot of men will vote for Harris,” said Pamela Aita, the one conservative voter in the Mahjong group. “I just don’t. … I just don’t think a majority of men are ready for a female president.” Murphy, though, voiced confidence that Harris in 2024 will fare better than Hillary Clinton 2016. Times have changed, she believes. And so have the issues that are front and center. “Reproductive rights. Come on, women,” Murphy said. “Here we are after Roe v. Wade. Here we are. … I think her age is, is really so important. You know, she’s, she’s at the perfect age. She’s committed, she’s vigorous. And overwhelmingly the women I talked to are, ‘let’s go, let’s go.’’’ Murphy was not alone in our group to suggest Harris would improve her Pennsylvania odds by choosing Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. “I think he is incredibly smart,” Murphy said. “Very modest, understated guy. … He is focused like a beam when he wants to do something. I think he would be the perfect balance.” Local civil rights activist Marvin Boyer is a lifelong Easton resident who knows Northampton County well. The reaction to Harris, he said, convinced him she has a chance. “It also re-energizes this strong constituency of the Democratic Party – meaning Black females,” Boyer said in an interview at an Easton museum where he was instrumental in assembling the Black history exhibit. “There seems to be a great deal of support, a groundswell of support for her candidacy.” High Black turnout in Easton and Bethlehem is critical. Those two cities are the deep blue parts of this county. It takes just a short drive north or west to find Donald Trump flags dotting the lawns and homes. “Just the other day I was riding down one of the main streets and the guy drives by with a truck with an American flag and a F-Biden flag flying,” Boyer said. “The anger is something else that is very troubling, and the divisiveness is problematic.” Boyer is an independent but votes Democratic most of the time. He was loyal to Biden. He is excited about Harris. “One of the things I felt was lacking with the candidate, the Democratic candidate is being more assertive,” Boyer said. “When you are running against a candidate like Trump, you can’t be milquetoast, you can’t be middle of the road. You have to be aggressive. Because he’s coming after you. And I think she’s up to the challenge in that regard.” Boyer knows his innate optimism is about to be tested. “There’s still racism, misogyny in this country in 2024, no question,” he said. “Will we overcome it with this election enough that she can be elected? I hope so.” We put the same question to Larry Malinconico, a geology professor at Lafayette College: Is America ready to elect a woman of color as its president? “I hope so,” Malinconico said in an interview in the classroom where we first met him in February. “I’m a little nervous about that. … It’s an extremely big test. It will be incredibly exciting or incredibly disappointing come November.” The early buzz gives him optimism. Malinconico said his wife contributed to the Democrats as soon as news of Biden’s Harris endorsement broke. Students, too, he believes will rally around Harris. Younger voters were a giant crack in Biden’s coalition. “We don’t want Donald Trump as president,” Malinconico said. “And there’s an acceptable choice now. When before I think there was real skepticism about the viability of President Biden for another four years.” On our first visit, Malinconico said he had friends and colleagues who raised questions about Biden’s ability to do the job. Back then, he said he did not share those doubts, but that Biden needed to prove them wrong. But his opinion began to change over the spring, and the debate sealed it. “I initially thought, let’s be fair here,” Malinconico said. “Someone who is in their early 80s could be perfectly viable as a candidate as president of the United States. But as things were going on, you really have to start to question okay, what’s happening here. And as somebody who has seen, for example, my father go through an eventual decline to the point where I was asked to take over his affairs, I sort of recognize this. The time had come, and you don’t take over the affairs of the president, you have someone else do the job.” Still, he said he was confident Biden could finish his term now that he didn’t also need to deal with the rigors of a campaign. Malinconico very much hopes Harris and Trump reach agreement to debate. “I think that she should be able to push his buttons.” Pat Levin for months bristled at the Biden age conversation. She is a few weeks away from turning 95, is sharp as a tack, a vigorous and eager participant in pilates classes she jokes help keep her vertical. Performance, not age, is Levin’s test. And she sadly came to the conclusion that a president she admires can no longer pass it. “I love him. I think he has been just wonderful,” Levin said. “But he is definitely impaired in terms of his thinking, in terms of his presentation, in terms of his energy. He’s just not up to it.” Her advice to Harris is telling – so many voters who were loyal to Biden are now blunt about what was missing. “She needs to get out there,” Levin said. “Get into those into those swing states, show her enthusiasm and her stamina and her strength and be able to communicate strongly. She’s a very intelligent woman. She’s got a lot of confidence. She’s got a lot of stamina.” Biden was born in Pennsylvania. He won here in 2020 in part because he performed better than Hillary Clinton among white working-class voters. Democrats here understand Harris has work to do there, or in finding a different winning coalition. “It doesn’t look too good right now,” Levin said of the Pennsylvania odds. “But I think she can turn it around.” Levin tells anyone who seeks her advice that sure, inflation and immigration matter, but there is something more fundamental at stake. “It’s democracy,” she said. “This might be our last free and fair election. If we don’t win it. We cannot afford to lose this election for the American people.” Levin traces her political activism back to Franklin Roosevelt’s third term – the mid 1940s – as “just a kid, a really young kid.” Now, she is preparing to vote in her 19th presidential election, a record that traces back to just after World War II. She has seen a lot. But nothing like switching candidates with little more than 100 days left, in a contest where she sees the stakes as so consequential. “No, I’ve never experienced anything like this,” she said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”"
Kamala Harris stops by ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ with a message for viewers | CNN,"Published 5:02 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T21:02:37.728Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/entertainment/rupauls-drag-race-kamala-harris-cec/index.html,"“RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” ends its ninth season on Friday, but not without a PSA from a VIP: Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, stopped by the beloved reality show to remind viewers about the importance of voting. Her message will appear in Friday’s finale, which airs on Paramount+. “Each day we are seeing our rights and freedoms under attack, including the right of everyone to be who they are, love who they love, openly and with pride,” she said in the clip, flanked by a crew that included former *NSYNC member Lance Bass, “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Leslie Jones and “Drag Race” judge Michelle Visage. (RuPaul was absent from the clip.) “So as we fight back against these attacks, let’s all remember — no one is alone,” said Harris. “We are all in this together. And your vote is your power.” Harris ended her message by encouraging viewers to register to vote and clapping along to RuPaul’s optimistic anthem “A Little Bit of Love.” Harris is one of several prominent Democrats to stop by “Drag Race.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the judging panel for a pivotal episode of Season 12. In a tasteful sequin dress, Ocasio-Cortez visited the queens backstage and confessed that before she was a member of Congress, she was a regular “Drag Race” viewer. “People think Congress and government is all about leading people, but ultimately a lot of our politics is about following the public will,” she told the rapt group of queens. “And the people who change what people think are artists and drag queens.” Former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi has appeared on two separate seasons of “All Stars,” in 2018 and 2022. In both visits, she, too, impressed the power of voting. “Drag Race” has even seen multiple contestants impersonate former President Donald Trump. “Drag Race UK” winner The Vivienne ran away with the coveted Snatch Game challenge with her textured impersonation of Trump. And on Season 11, the queens performed “Trump: The Musical,” which skewered the former president’s family and political allies. Though the tone of the series leans toward silly and heartfelt, “Drag Race” does not shy away from politics. Most episodes of “Drag Race” end with the queens on the runway, hoisting signs with phrases like “You better vote!” with the vote.gov link, through which users can register to vote. Previous seasons have included faux political debates and nods to policies like “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”"
Exclusive: Haley offers no apologies for what she said about Trump during primary and defends choice to back him over Harris | CNN Politics,"Published 4:00 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T20:00:18.841Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/nikki-haley-trump-harris-interview/index.html,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley offered no apologies Thursday for the “tough things” she said about Donald Trump during their bruising Republican primary fight, but she told CNN’s Jake Tapper she does not doubt her choice to support the former president over presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election. In her first interview since endorsing Trump and speaking at the Republican National Convention, Haley said President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race Sunday did not come as a surprise. “I wasn’t surprised, and I didn’t take happiness in it,” Haley said of Biden’s announcement. “I think through the whole campaign, I fought for mental competency tests. I wasn’t doing it to be disrespectful. I wasn’t doing it to be mean. I was doing it because I think it’s not just Joe Biden. There is an issue we have in DC, where people will go into office and they won’t let go. And then their staffers and their family keep propping them up, and it’s a problem for the American people.” Haley added: “I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and I think that’s what’s playing out.” But Haley – who said during the campaign that the first party “to retire its 80-year-old candidate” would win the election – argued that Democrats’ decision to elevate Harris gave them “the weakest candidate they could put in.” “She is much more progressive than Joe Biden ever was,” Haley said. “So, the fact they put in Kamala Harris – kudos for putting in someone younger – the fact that you put in one of the most liberal politicians you probably could have put in, it’s going to be an issue.” Haley criticized those Republicans who have gone after Harris as a “DEI” candidate, arguing there are better ways to attack the vice president such as on immigration, fracking and foreign policy. “It’s not helpful,” Haley said. “There’s so many issues we can talk about when it comes to Kamala Harris that it doesn’t matter what she looks like. It matters what she’s said, what she’s fought for, and the lack of results that she’s had because of it.” Haley’s comments come in the wake of her decision to endorse Trump and speak at the GOP convention last week following a tumultuous primary, during which she repeatedly attacked the former president as “toxic,” “unhinged” and lacking “moral clarity.” In a wide-ranging interview, Haley brushed aside the rhetoric as just part of a campaign – which included Trump’s attacks on Haley and her husband while he was deployed overseas. “I said a lot of tough things about him in the campaign. He said a lot of tough things about me in the campaign. That’s what happens in campaigns. I don’t think we need to apologize or take anything back. I don’t plan on doing that,” Haley said. In May, Haley said she would vote for Trump, sparking backlash from some anti-Trump Republicans who had supported her campaign. Even after she suspended her campaign in March, Haley continued to get a significant share of the vote in subsequent primaries. Her supporters, Haley argued, “wanted Americans to have a choice for someone they could be proud of.” “That was what we fought for, that was what we did, and millions joined us,” Haley said. “I wanted what they wanted. We were in it together, and I loved the fight we had together. But we’ve been given a choice. It’s Trump, or it’s Harris. And so, what I did, was I said this is who I would be voting for. I also said I don’t agree with Trump 100% of time, and I don’t expect them to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him. But I wanted them to think about it through my eyes and how I thought about it.” Asked by Tapper about her previous comments that she didn’t know whether Trump would follow the Constitution if reelected, Haley said: “I hope he does. I hope that any president would follow the Constitution.” “So, yes, I hope that everything he does is in line with the Constitution, and I hope that Congress enforces that, and I hope that everybody he surrounds himself with enforces that. But I think the American people need to demand it,” she added. In her interview with Tapper, Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, continued to advocate a strong foreign policy, a stance that has put her at odds with the isolationist wing of her party, including Trump’s vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Haley urged both Trump and Vance to stand up to Russia on Ukraine. “I think there’s a division in the Republican Party on where we should be on foreign policy, especially, you know, we’ve seen that play out with Ukraine,” she said. “What I will tell you is when Russia gets a little bit, they want a little bit more and a little bit more. And so that should send a warning sign to Trump and to Vance to go and show, ‘No, we’re going to stand for America, we’re not going to stand for Russia, and we’re going to stand with Ukraine because that’s the right thing to do.’ I hope they do that.” But Haley also defended Trump’s record on Russia during his first term. “I know that Trump kept dictators at bay, and that’s what I hope he will continue to do,” she said. “This is about moral clarity. Standing with Ukraine, standing with Taiwan, standing with Israel, that’s moral clarity. That’s what I want President Trump to have. I will always be vocal about that.” Haley criticized both Harris and Vance for not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address before Congress on Wednesday. Both were away at other events – Harris is meeting with Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday while Trump is meeting the Israeli leader at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. “First of all, she was official, she should have been there,” Haley said of Harris, who serves as president of the Senate in her official capacity. “Israel is one of our strongest allies. What does that say to the people of Israel? More importantly, what did you just tell the Iranians? Because they love what they’re getting right now if she won’t even do her official job there.” “Should JD Vance have been there? Yes, of course,” she added. “We need to show a united front when it comes to Israel.” Haley brushed off criticism of her Republican convention speech from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump critic and onetime GOP presidential rival, who said she backed Trump only so she could run for president again and was “unified by her own tortured ambition” “I think it’s funny coming from a guy who didn’t even play in Iowa and couldn’t even get out of New Hampshire,” Haley said of Christie. “I think he’s bitter to anybody that he’s ever dealt with, and I think it’s comical that it’s coming from a person who, in 2016, literally did that one thing – fell all over himself for Trump – to get a position in an administration, and he still didn’t get it.” “So, look, I wish Chris well,” Haley said. “I think he’s got a lot of tortured demons inside of him. But I know what I’m doing and why I’m doing it. And everything he said could not be more wrong.”"
"A look at Alpha Kappa Alpha, the legendary sorority repped by Kamala Harris | CNN","Published 1:55 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T17:55:33.705Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/aka-alpha-kappa-alpha-kamala-harris-cec/index.html,"As long as she’s been on the political scene, Vice President and likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has proudly repped the salmon pink and apple green of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Sorority, Inc. Alpha Kappa Alpha is a historic African American sorority, founded on the campus of Howard University, Harris’ alma mater. It was the first Black sorority of its kind, and is a part of the “Divine Nine,” a group of Black Pan-Hellenic organizations. Members of Alpha Kappa Alpha and other groups in the Divine Nine have already rallied to support Harris’ bid for the presidency, networking and organizing to raise millions upon millions of dollars for her campaign. Harris is also a frequent presence at high-profile events, including Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.’s biennial convention earlier this month. The sorority has been a critical source of support and sisterhood not just for Harris, but for the 360,000 some women across the US and the world that make up its ranks. AKA members are political leaders, civil rights activists, literary icons and scientists, and the sorority’s cultural impact has deep, wide-reaching roots. “When you become a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, you become a member for life,” Danette Anthony Reed, international president and CEO of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. told CNN. Here’s a look at the history of Alpha Kappa Alpha and how it become a force in American society. Alpha Kappa Alpha, or AKA as it’s familiarly known, was founded more than a century ago with the aim of connecting and empowering Black college-educated women. In the years since, AKA has been a springboard for its members to achieve academic and professional success, as well as leadership development and personal growth. The organization has also facilitated numerous community service initiatives across the country. Groups like Alpha Kappa Alpha were a natural evolution of Greek life on college campuses. The first fraternities and sororities in the US formed in the late 1700s and 1800s as forums where college students could discuss current events and literature outside their strict curriculums, according to Lawrence Ross, author of “The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities.” Greek life at predominantly White institutions eventually expanded and evolved into social clubs, but it excluded students of color. In the early 1900s, at a time of intense racial segregation and disenfranchisement, African American students at White institutions and historically Black colleges and universities founded the Greek letter organizations that make up the Divine Nine with an additional mission: To uplift each other and all Black people. “It’s very much centered upon not just the college experience, but the notion that those of us who get college educations have a responsibility — not just to our own selves or our own transformation, but the transformation of our communities,” Ross, a member of the historically Black Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. said. On January 15, 1908, Ethel Hedgemon — along with Anna Easter Brown, Beulah Burke, Lillie Burke, Marjorie Hill, Margaret Flagg Holmes, Lavinia Norman, Lucy Diggs Slowe and Marie Woolfolk — founded Alpha Kappa Alpha at Howard University as a community of women with shared values and goals. They chose an ivy leaf as their symbol, drafted a constitution and extended invitations to a group of sophomores on campus. It was the first Black sorority in the country. “We weren’t allowed to vote. We weren’t allowed to hold certain positions,” Evelyn Sample-Oates, a former international regional director of Alpha Kappa Alpha and a longtime member, told CNN. “These are women that came together because they had the like-minded agenda to gather strong Black women so that we could make a difference.” To ensure the longevity of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Nellie Quander, along with Norma Boyd and Minnie Smith, led the effort to incorporate the organization in 1913. Over the next decade, AKA grew in strength and numbers — it established new chapters at campuses across the country, held its first Boule and began publishing an official journal called The Ivy Leaf. As Alpha Kappa Alpha transformed into a national organization over the first half of the 20th century, its members looked to more ambitious goals. In 1913, Quander wrote to women’s rights activist Alice Paul, imploring her to include Black students from Howard in a women’s suffrage march without discrimination. Then in 1921, Alpha Kappa Alpha sent a telegram to President Warren G. Harding, urging the administration to back a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime, according to AKA’s website. One of Alpha Kappa Alpha’s most significant and well-known initiatives was the Mississippi Health Project, which was launched during the Great Depression. From 1935 to 1942, AKA volunteers — led by President Ida Jackson and member Dr. Dorothy Ferebee — traveled to the Mississippi Delta and set up mobile health clinics for rural Black families who lacked access to health care. AKA compiled its observations into a report and elevated it to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who became a champion of many AKA initiatives and eventually an honorary member, according to the documentary “Twenty Pearls: The Story of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.” Over the years, Alpha Kappa Alpha and its members took on a more prominent role in the fight for social justice. In 1938, Boyd, an educator and one of AKA’s earliest members, founded a congressional lobbying group to push legislation on issues concerning Black Americans. And in 1939, Alpha Kappa Alpha joined the NAACP as a lifetime member, paving the way for other historically Black fraternities and sororities to formally join in the fight for civil rights. Another hallmark initiative came in 1965 with the Cleveland Job Corps. For 30 years, Alpha Kappa Alpha operated a federal job training center, equipping numerous Black women with the skills and education needed to place them in jobs. Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha carries on this legacy of service, awarding millions of dollars in scholarships and grants, fighting food insecurity and building up the next generation of Black leaders, Reed said. “Whether it’s social activism, advocacy for civil rights, building economic wealth, impacting our communities, we make a positive change,” she added. “And we empower individuals to strive for excellence.” For all of its accomplishments as an organization, perhaps the most enduring legacy of Alpha Kappa Alpha is the individual contributions and achievements of its members. Women of Alpha Kappa Alpha have populated the highest ranks of their fields, whether in politics, law, literature or science. Constance Baker Motley was the first female attorney for the Legal Defense Fund and wrote the original complaint in Brown v. Board of Education. The late Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a leading champion of Black American issues in Congress, was an AKA, as was Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson — three Black mathematicians who worked for NASA in the 1950s and were at the center of the film “Hidden Figures” — also were Alpha Kappa Alphas. NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, repped the pink and green, too. Many more women were initiated into Alpha Kappa Alpha as honorary members, including civil rights icon Rosa Parks, jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald and director Ava DuVernay. With the ascension of Vice President Harris, Alpha Kappa Alpha is once again in the spotlight, and its political and cultural power is on full display from flashes of pink and green among Harris supporters to endorsements from fellow AKAs in politics. “I am 1908% in with you Madam Soror Vice-President!!!!,” Florida Representative Ashley Gantt posted on X after President Joe Biden announced his endorsement of Harris. AKA is a nonpartisan organization, but like every Greek organization, its members are often politically active. CNN’s Fredreka Schouten reported that Harris’ campaign saw more than 1,500 contributions of exactly $19.08 between Sunday afternoon — when Biden exited the presidential race — and Monday evening, nodding to AKA’s founding in 1908. Sample-Oates said Harris’ campaign — and the support her sorors have shown her — are a testament to the sisterhood of AKA and what Black women can achieve when they link arms. It’s part of what inspired her to join the sorority about 40 years ago at American University. “We’ve got a tough role out here in society,” she said. “We’re often underestimated, undervalued, underpaid, and it’s important that we come together and bond on these issues so together we can rise up.”"
"Obama expected to endorse Harris soon, source says | CNN Politics","Updated 12:00 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T15:01:28.060Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/barack-obama-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html,"Former President Barack Obama is expected to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris soon and his team has been in touch with the campaign, a source told CNN. Obama and Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have been in touch regularly, and he is serving as a sounding board for her as he has over the 20 years they’ve known each other, the source said. Obama, who didn’t immediately endorse Harris following President Joe Biden’s announcement on Sunday that he was not seeking reelection, believed it was important for the Democratic Party to have a legitimate process through which delegates select their new nominee, and he thinks Harris is off to an impressive start, the source said. News of Obama’s expected endorsement was first reported by NBC News. Regarding Obama’s statement on Sunday, an adviser told CNN that the former president was taking the same approach as he did in the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to unify the party when a nominee is chosen – whether it was Harris or someone else. Obama’s statement was intended to keep the focus on Biden on the day he announced he was no longer seeking a second term, the adviser said. The former president was supportive of Biden’s reelection campaign as he attended multiple fundraisers that raised millions of dollars, along with participating in moderated conversations with Biden and sending messages encouraging supporters to chip in as part of fundraising efforts. Democrats have been moving quickly in the process to nominate Harris as the party adopted the rules on Wednesday that they will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1. The rules call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19-22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote. Harris has not yet selected a running mate. This story has been updated with additional details."

Spencer Gear was charged with multiple counts of transmitting a communication containing a threat to injure and threatening a federal official. He was arraigned earlier this week in Nevada federal court and pleaded not guilty. Gear remains in custody. Gear was charged with leaving threatening phone calls to federal and state officials in Washington, DC, and New York. The indictment identifies the targets of the threats by initials and a source confirmed that Bragg and New York Judge Juan Merchan were among them. Prosecutors allege Gear left a telephone message and “threatened to kill A.B. and J.M.,” according to the indictment. A person familiar with the investigation confirmed the initials refer to Bragg and Merchan. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has said threats to their office increased during Trump’s criminal trial earlier this year. Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records to coverup a payment made to silence a porn star before the 2016 election. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Trump has asked the judge to throw out the conviction based on the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity."
Fact check: Trump made at least 10 false claims about Kamala Harris in a single rally speech | CNN Politics,"Published 10:41 AM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-25T14:41:54.073Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-kamala-harris/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump made at least 10 false claims about Vice President Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Trump, speaking in North Carolina, attacked Harris at length with a flurry of assertions about her personal and political past, her record as vice president and her policy stances. We’re still looking into some of his claims, but at least 10 were wrong. Here is a fact check. Harris and the retirement age Discussing Social Security, Trump claimed of President Joe Biden and Harris: “They’re talking about, he was talking, she’s talking about – lifting the retirement age.” Facts First: This claim is false about Harris. She has not spoken in favor of raising the age for receiving Social Security retirement benefits. (Biden did, as a US senator in the 2000s and prior, express support for or openness to raising the retirement age, but he has been a vocal opponent of the idea as president.) Harris has supported increasing, not reducing, Social Security benefits. In 2019, about two years before she became vice president, she co-sponsored a bill from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called the Social Security Expansion Act, that would boost Social Security benefits by raising payroll taxes on high earners. Harris and abortion Trump said, “She wants abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy, that’s fine with her, right up until birth, and even after birth – the execution of a baby.”  Facts First: Trump’s claim that Harris supports the execution of babies after birth is false. She has never said anything to endorse post-birth murder, which is illegal everywhere in the country; Trump has frequently claimed that some Democratic states allow such post-birth executions, but that claim is false, too. Harris, a vocal supporter of abortion rights, has declined to endorse specific limits on how late in a pregnancy an abortion should be permitted to occur. According to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks gestation or later. Many of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies. Harris has called for legislation restoring the protections of the Roe v. Wade decision that was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022; Roe allowed states to restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, often considered to be around 23 to 24 weeks gestation, with exceptions for abortions necessary to protect the patient’s life or health. As a senator and vice president, Harris has supported a bill that would, like Roe, ensure abortion was available at least until fetal viability – and would also prohibit various state policies that make the process of providing or obtaining an abortion more onerous. Asked about Trump’s comments, the Trump campaign provided various examples of Harris taking liberal positions on abortion policy and declining to endorse specific limits - but nothing to substantiate the claim that she supports “the execution of a baby” after birth. Harris and red meat Trump claimed, “Kamala even wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop climate change.” Facts First: This is false. Harris has never expressed support for passing laws to outlaw red meat. At a CNN climate change town hall in 2019, when she was running in the Democratic presidential primary, she expressed support for changing dietary guidelines to try to encourage Americans to reduce their consumption of red meat, but she also said “I love cheeseburgers from time to time” and that she favored using “incentives” and education to encourage healthy eating.  After mentioning sodas and foods with copious sugar, Harris said in this same town hall answer that “the balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors.” The phrase “banning certain behaviors” opened the door to claims that she wants to ban red meat. But she immediately proceeded to her comments about how she enjoys cheeseburgers and favors incentives to prod changes in behavior – making clear in context that she was expressing support for incentives rather than bans. Asked about Trump’s claim about Harris wanting to outlaw red meat, the Trump campaign provided two citations that did not substantiate it: a YouTube video of Harris’ comments that was correctly titled “Kamala Harris Wants The Government To Create ‘Incentives’ For Americans to Eat Less Meat” and an article headlined, “Flashback: Kamala Harris said she would support eating less meat if elected president.” Harris and Trump’s legal cases Trump has claimed for months that Biden secretly orchestrated his criminal and civil legal cases. This time, he directed the claim at Harris. He said, “But it was all headed up by her. Because she’s a prosecutor.” Facts First: This is false. There is simply no basis for claiming that Harris “headed up” the legal cases against him. Trump has never presented any evidence for this claim that Biden was the hidden hand behind his cases, let alone for suddenly switching the claim to make it about the vice president after months of saying it about the president. There is no sign that Harris had any role in bringing charges against Trump in Manhattan, New York (where he was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records) or Fulton County, Georgia (where an election subversion case against Trump is on hold); those prosecutions have been led by elected local district attorneys. Trump’s two federal cases, one dismissed by a judge earlier this month, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden orchestrated the prosecutions – and certainly not proof that Harris did. Harris’ immigration role Trump claimed of Harris: “She was the border czar, but she never went to the border.” Facts First: Trump made two false claims here. First, Harris did go to the border as vice president, in Texas in mid-2021; many Republicans had criticized Harris prior to the visit for not having gone, and some later argued that she didn’t go frequently enough, but the claim that she “never” went has not been true for more than three years. Second, Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States. Some Republicans have scoffed this week at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries (he also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.” Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far. Harris and the number of migrants Trump claimed that Harris “allowed 20 million illegal aliens to stampede into our country from all over the world.” Facts First: Leaving aside Trump’s claim about Harris’ own responsibility for migration levels, the“20 million” figure is false, a major exaggeration. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern border from February 2021 through June 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was about 10 million – and an “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of Biden-era “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans said in May was nearly two million, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in late June after Trump used those figures. The “encounters” figures can’t be described as figures on people successfully entering the US. Some encounters involve people who are deemed inadmissible at legal ports and are refused permission to enter. Also, the same person can be “encountered” multiple times if they keep returning to the border to try again – which is what happened in many cases under Biden when the Title 42 rapid-expulsion authority invoked by Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic was in place into May 2023. Harris and fentanyl deaths Shortly after claiming there is a “Kamala Harris invasion” of the border, Trump said, “We’re losing 300,000 people a year through fentanyl that comes through our border.” Facts First: Trump’s “300,000” claim is false. The number of US overdose deaths in 2023 involving synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC said in May that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose involving any kind of drug in 2023; even that larger number is nowhere close to Trump’s “300,000.”   When Trump made similar “300,000” claims earlier this year, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, said “I have no idea where Trump is getting ‘300,000’ from and called it “a made-up number.” While Kolodny said it’s likely that the number of US overdose deaths is undercounted, there is no apparent basis for Trump’s insistence that the real number is nearly triple the reported number. And Kolodny said the undercount issue is centered not on overdoses from illicit fentanyl smuggled across the southern border but on seniors’ overdoses from accidentally taking too much of their legal prescription medications. It is also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking into the country. CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this item. Harris and the Jewish community Trump criticized Harris for not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Wednesday speech to Congress (though Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also did not attend); Harris, who is planning to hold a meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, traveled to Indianapolis on Wednesday to give a previously scheduled speech to a historically Black sorority. That’s fair game for criticism. But Trump said after criticizing Harris’ absence: “Even if you’re against Israel or you’re against the Jewish people, show up and listen to the concept. But she’s totally against the Jewish people.” Facts First: Trump’s claim that Harris is “totally against the Jewish people” is nonsense. Harris has been married to a Jewish man, Doug Emhoff, for nearly 10 years – and she has repeatedly denounced antisemitism, expressed fondness for the Jewish community and its traditions, complimented Israel at length, and endorsed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.” Though she has sometimes been pointedly critical of the actions of Israel’s government during the war in Gaza, drawing criticism from conservative Jews and others, there is no evidence she has a general antipathy toward “the Jewish people” as Trump claimed. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency news service reported this week: “Over the course of her life and career, she has been surrounded by Jews, from her schoolmates to her colleagues to her closest family members. That background has given Harris, 59, an easy familiarity with Jewish spaces, say those who have interacted with her. She has also encouraged Emhoff to embrace his Jewish identity as the second gentleman; for the first time, mezuzahs have been installed at the vice presidential residence, and Emhoff has taken a leading role in the administration’s efforts to fight antisemitism.” Harris and the bar exam Trump claimed that Harris, a lawyer who was elected as San Francisco’s district attorney and then as California’s attorney general, “failed her law exams.” Then he continued, “You know that? She couldn’t pass her bar. She couldn’t pass her bar exams…Does anyone know that? … But she’s gonna be a great president, right? No, she couldn’t pass her bar exams. She couldn’t pass anything. Couldn’t pass everything. She couldn’t pass anything.” Facts First: It’s not true that Harris “couldn’t pass anything.” She did fail on her first attempt to pass the bar exam, according to The New York Times, but then succeeded. She was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school.  Trump could fairly say that Harris couldn’t initially pass the bar exam, but his rally comments made it sound like she never passed at all."
Trump slams Harris as an ‘ultra-liberal’ as he returns to the campaign trail under a reshaped political landscape | CNN Politics,"Updated 9:11 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T08:00:02.378Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/donald-trump-rally-north-carolina/index.html,"Donald Trump stepped onto the campaign trail Wednesday to an entirely new race and a political landscape once again irrevocably altered by an unprecedented election year. The former president’s rally here was﻿ his first since President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid Sunday, setting off a chain of events that appears destined to end with Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Trump lost no time Wednesday turning his focus to his likely new opponent, dubbing her “Lyin’ Kamala Harris” and painting her as a “radical liberal” whom voters will reject in November. “Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,” the former president told his supporters. Biden’s decision to end his campaign and Harris’ subsequent elevation has sent a surge of adrenaline through the Democratic Party and unleashed a wave of new donations to compete with Trump’s own strengthened financial position. Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign are working to reimagine a playbook and operation launched to take on an unpopular 81-year-old incumbent. Trump told the audience in Charlotte that he “was supposed to be nice,” alluding to his message of unity after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania the weekend before the Republican National Convention. “They say something happened to me when I got shot: I became nice,” Trump said. “If you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice,” he added to roars from the crowd. “This November, the American people are going to tell her, ‘No thanks, Kamala. You’ve done a terrible job. You’ve been terrible at everything,’” said the former president, who slammed Harris over the border and inflation. Trump also mocked Harris’ attempts to portray the race against the former president as one between a former prosecutor – Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general – and a convicted felon. “Their campaign says, ‘I’m the prosecutor, and he is the convicted felon.’ That’s that campaign. I don’t think people are going to buy it. And we won our big case. You know, we won the case in Florida,” Trump said, referring to the recently dismissed classified documents case. “A vote for Kamala is a vote for four more years of dishonesty and incompetence, weakness and failure,” he added. In a campaign already marked by extraordinary events – a significant civil judgment against Trump, a felony conviction, an indictment dismissed and another delayed by a scandal in the Georgia prosecutor’s office, Biden’s confidence-shattering debate performance and the assassination attempt – the latest twist has plunged the presidential race deeper into uncharted territory. Trump spent Tuesday reacting to his changed political fortunes. In a barrage of social media posts, the former president ripped into his likely new opponent, lamented that Republicans were forced “to waste a great deal of time and money” prior to the Democratic shake-up, suggested that the “Biden/Harris administration” was to blame for the assassination attempt on his life, criticized Democratic tributes to Biden (“He was pushed out of power like a dog,” the former president wrote) and ripped Fox News for giving airtime to the Democratic governor of Minnesota, a state Trump is targeting. “They make me fight battles that I shouldn’t have to fight!” Trump said of the network. Later, Trump held a call with reporters – the first of its kind this cycle – during which he tested new attack lines against Harris. “As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it’s getting worse, not better,” said Trump, who has spent the past 19 months attacking Biden over the border while rarely mentioning Harris. The Democratic National Committee responded to the stepped-up attacks on Harris over immigration by highlighting Trump’s successful effort to kill a bipartisan immigration deal earlier this year. Trump’s team insists it was prepared for a change at the top of the Democratic ticket long before Biden officially dropped out, pointing to an internal memo from May laying out scenarios that would result in an open convention and another Democrat as the nominee. Senior Trump advisers continue to suggest that a campaign against Harris would largely center on the same issues once used to criticize Biden: crime, immigration and inflation. As Biden’s second in command, Harris played a key role in shaping the administration’s approaches to those topics, they will argue. However, some individuals close to Trump acknowledge the uncertainty brought on by Harris’ candidacy, specifically what new Democratic enthusiasm could mean for turnout in November. A new CNN/SSRS poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in a Trump-Harris matchup: The former president held 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling had found about a Biden-Trump matchup. Trump’s campaign had been bracing for the fresh excitement over Harris to generate a bump for her in the polls, as it laid out in an expectation-setting memo Tuesday from Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio. He predicted that Harris would start “gaining on or even leading President Trump” in the polls, though he also insisted that the “honeymoon” period would end. Trump’s team faces a race against the clock to define Harris before she can fully turn the Biden election machine into her own campaign. Though polls suggest Harris is a recognizable figure, the Trump campaign remains convinced that the public doesn’t know much about her – referring to the gap as “name education.” The campaign intends to spend the coming weeks trying to fill that knowledge void with as much negative information about Harris as it can. Fabrizio in his memo previewed what the Trump campaign is expected to attack: Harris’ record in California as a prosecutor and state attorney general; her tie-breaking vote as vice president on the Inflation Reduction Act, a law Biden championed to boost investments to reverse climate change; and her response to the rise in migrant border crossings. A source close to Trump also indicated that the campaign and its allies are planning to specifically highlight certain choices she made as San Francisco district attorney in an attempt to portray her as lenient on violent criminals. “So, while the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’ done,” Fabrizio wrote. The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, showcasing another plan of attack. The ad says Harris “covered up Joe Biden’s obvious mental decline” and features a clip of her praising Biden’s performance as president. “Our president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done,” Harris says in the clip. The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Trump’s appearance in Charlotte provided his first opportunity to contrast himself with Harris before voters in a battleground state. Four years ago, North Carolina produced Trump’s narrowest margin of statewide victory, and it is expected to be a top battleground again in 2024. In a memo released Wednesday, the Harris campaign outlined its view of the candidate’s electoral path to victory, painting a much more optimistic picture beyond the so-called Blue Wall states to include the battleground states of the Sun Belt such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. It’s a notable change from where things stood just weeks ago when a Biden campaign memo acknowledged that those Sun Belt states were no longer as competitive. This story and headline have been updated with additional details."
"What is DEI? Republicans are using the term to attack Kamala Harris, but experts say it’s widely misunderstood | CNN Politics","Updated 8:08 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T18:09:41.247Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/dei-kamala-harris/index.html,"The ongoing controversy surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion has spilled over into the 2024 presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris on the path to becoming the Democratic nominee. Earlier this week, Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett suggested in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that President Joe Biden chose Harris as a running mate because she was a Black woman. “100% she is a DEI hire,” Burchett said. Supporters have defended Harris, who, if elected, would become the nation’s first female president. In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, UN ambassador Susan Rice called the attacks from Republicans “extremely offensive and dehumanizing.” Rice said the attacks insinuate that people from marginalized groups who achieve success or rise to leadership roles didn’t earn it. “That is incredibly insulting,” Rice said. But Harris isn’t the first target in Republicans’ efforts to discredit people of color and the programs that help promote diversity. Since 2023, 85 anti-DEI bills that target programs at colleges have been introduced in 28 states and in Congress, according to a tally by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Fourteen have been signed into law, in states like Texas and Florida. A 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 52% of employed US adults said they have DEI trainings or meetings at work, and 33% said they have a designated staff member who promotes DEI. But recently, some companies have slashed teams dedicated to DEI. And wealthy corporate leaders such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk have made posts on social media that decried diversity programs. Critics say DEI programs are discriminatory and attempt to solve racial discrimination by disadvantaging other groups, particularly White Americans. But supporters and industry experts insist the decades-old practice has been politicized and is widely misunderstood. CNN interviewed seven DEI experts and industry leaders and asked each to define diversity, equity and inclusion. Although their responses varied slightly, most had a shared vision for what constitutes DEI: – Diversity is embracing the differences everyone brings to the table, whether it’s someone’s race, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability or other aspects of social identity. – Equity is treating everyone fairly and providing equal opportunities. – Inclusion is respecting everyone’s voice and creating a culture where people from all backgrounds feel encouraged to express their ideas and perspectives. Daniel Oppong, founder of The Courage Collective, a consultancy that advises companies on DEI, said DEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings. “That is the genesis of why some of these programs exist,” he said. “It was an attempt to try to create workplaces where more or all people can thrive.” President Lyndon Baines Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964. The law made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. It also banned segregation in public places, like public schools and libraries. The backlash against DEI may feel like a pendulum swing from 2020, when the nation faced a racial reckoning following George Floyd’s death. But the DEI practice has been around for decades. Dominique Hollins, founder of the DEI consulting firm WĒ360, said the origins of DEI programs date back to the civil rights movement, which played a pivotal role in accelerating efforts to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which works to eliminate employment discrimination. In the 1960s and ‘70s, employees began filing discrimination lawsuits with the EEOC, and many companies began incorporating diversity into their business strategies by providing diversity training, according to a 2008 report published in the Academy of Management Learning & Education. These diversity training efforts emerged around the time that affirmative action began by executive order from President John F. Kennedy. Although the two concepts may seem similar, affirmative action is different from DEI because it required federal contractors to treat all applicants and employees equally, regardless of race, color, religion and sex. Colleges and universities also used affirmative action to boost enrollment of students of color at majority-White schools. But last year, the Supreme Court gutted affirmative action, ruling that race-conscious college admissions were unconstitutional. After President Ronald Reagan backed corporate deregulation policies that said companies should be addressing discrimination internally in the 1980s, Hollins said some of the diversity efforts lost momentum. In the decades that followed, Hollins said, many companies kept pushing for DEI-focused jobs and training in a “piecemeal” fashion, instead of creating ongoing programs and dedicated teams. Hollins said many companies didn’t have the staffing or resources to sustain DEI efforts. But Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police in May 2020 sparked a racial reckoning and a renewed push for creating DEI leadership roles and initiatives at major corporations. Between 2019 and 2022, chief diversity and inclusion officer roles grew by 168.9%, according to a LinkedIn analysis. Today, some of those efforts have been rolled back, and people have left DEI roles because they didn’t feel fully supported, Hollins said. Companies “were giving the appearance of commitment without actually doing the right work for that commitment to be sustainable,” Hollins said. Despite the backlash against DEI programs and initiatives, many companies are standing firm in their support for DEI.  A survey published in January by the polling firm Ipsos found 67% of people surveyed said their employers require or offer trainings, lectures, webinars, or resources on DEI. And 71% of people surveyed said they think DEI training is important to “creating a positive workplace culture.” Today, studies show that many companies are prioritizing some form of DEI. According to a 2023 study by the Pew Research Center, 61% of U.S. adults say their workplace has policies that focus on fairness in hiring, promotions or pay. And 56% of U.S. adults say “focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion at work is mainly a good thing.” Kelly Baker, executive vice president and chief human resources officer at Thrivent, an organization that provides financial advice, said DEI in the workplace can be a mix of employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices. Her company, for example, has resource groups for women in leadership, young professionals, Black employees, Hispanic employees and military veterans, among others. Thrivent’s DEI training teaches employees how to understand and bridge cultural differences in the workplace, Baker said. Thrivent also seeks job candidates with diversity in their race, geography, gender and industry background, Baker said. Experts say many corporations tie DEI to their business strategies. Diversity “is related to our business growth strategy,” Baker said. “It’s pragmatic and essential and critical for us to ensure that our client base reflects the world that we are in and the world that we are going to be in.” College campuses have become ground zero for the DEI debate as state lawmakers across the country launch efforts to halt or limit DEI programs in public schools and universities. Earlier this year, the University of Florida eliminated the office of its chief diversity officer to comply with regulations from the Florida Board of Governors that prohibit spending state funds on DEI programs. Ella Washington, professor of practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, said she is concerned that efforts to ban DEI on college campuses will prevent students from being prepared for the real world. “I think a lot of it is short-sighted and politically motivated,” Washington said. “It’s hard for me to believe that all of these lawmakers want exclusion be taught and to erase all of history.” Washington said while DEI looks different on every college campus, many schools focus efforts on recruitment and admissions, curriculum and special programs for underrepresented students. Georgetown’s Office of Student Equity & Inclusion oversees several DEI-centered programs including the Disability Cultural Center, Women’s Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, according to its website. Washington said there is also a program for first-generation college students where they have a chance to build community. Prioritizing and embracing a diverse student body allows students to interact with peers from different walks of life and learn new perspectives even outside of the classroom, Washington said. “Colleges are certainly a microcosm of the world,” Washington said. “So, having an experience where equity is centered, equality is considered, inclusion is at the forefront of people’s minds, those are things we are teaching the next generation about how they should be running the world.” In recent years, DEI has become a social and political lightning rod for lawmakers, corporate leaders and conservative activists, who have sought to cast the initiatives as unfair and even racist. Some were emboldened by the Supreme Court’s decision to gut affirmative action last June. Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an outspoken critic of DEI, wrote in a New York Times op-ed last year that “these are not neutral programs to increase demographic diversity; they are political programs that use taxpayer resources to advance a specific partisan orthodoxy.” The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank, holds a similar position. Ryan P. Williams, president of the institute, previously told CNN he believes the ideology behind DEI is “fundamentally anti-American.” “The words that the acronym ‘DEI’ represent sound nice, but it is nothing more than affirmative action and racial preferences by a different name, a system that features racial headcounts and arbitrarily assigned roles of ‘oppressor’ and ‘oppressed’ groups in America,” Williams said in an emailed statement. “If we continue to do democracy this way, it will only end in acrimony, strife, resentment, and American collapse.” Earlier this year, billionaire investor Bill Ackman posted a 4,000-word opus on X that criticized DEI as “inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.” Ackman’s lengthy thesis was later reposted by billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who now owns the social media platform. “DEI is just another word for racism. Shame on anyone who uses it,” Musk wrote in his post. In a follow-up post, Musk doubled down, adding: “DEI, because it discriminates on the basis of race, gender and many other factors, is not merely immoral, it is also illegal.” Tesla, which is owned by Musk, has since omitted all language regarding minority workers and outreach to minority communities in its 10-K filing with the SEC made January 29, CNN previously reported. But not every business leader agrees. Mark Cuban, billionaire businessman and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, pushed back on Musk’s posts in a thread defending DEI as good for businesses and their workers. “The loss of DEI-Phobic companies is my gain,” Cuban wrote. “Having a workforce that is diverse and representative of your stakeholders is good for business.” In April 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 7, known as the “Stop WOKE” bill into law. Texas, North Dakota, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah also have at least one anti-DEI bill that has been signed into law, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. In Nebraska, Republican State Sen. Dave Murman proposed a bill in January that would prohibit state colleges and universities from dedicating public money and staff time to DEI efforts. The bill is currently with the Nebraska legislature’s education committee, which will decide whether to move it to the full legislature. Murman’s office did not respond to a request for an interview. Nebraska Democratic state Sen. Danielle Conrad told CNN she opposes the bill, in part because the broader effort to ban DEI has become “divisive.” She said it also “distracts from the real issues” colleges are facing, such as families who can’t afford tuition. DEI, she said, is valuable to colleges and universities. “We absolutely know from common sense and research that when we have more diverse perspectives in discussion or as part of our education, it helps us to have more thoughtful results,” Conrad said. “It helps us to be more well-rounded, active and engaged citizens.” CNN’s Athena Jones contributed to this report."
Right-wing media figures call Kamala Harris a ‘DEI’ candidate as race-based attacks ramp up | CNN Business,"Updated 7:40 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T12:45:04.978Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/media/right-wing-media-kamala-harris-dei-race-attacks/index.html,"The right-wing media machine is throwing everything but the kitchen sink at Kamala Harris.

As she held a rally Tuesday for the first time as the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Fox News, talk radio, and the constellation of digital news websites and online personalities were busy blitzing her with a wide array of attacks, aiming to quickly villainize her with only 100-some days to go before Election Day.

Over the last 48 hours, Harris has been derided as a radical California liberal; she has been smeared as a “DEI” candidate; she has been denigrated as a “mistress” for her previous relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, even though it occurred after Brown was separated from his wife and was not a secret; she has been ridiculed for her laugh and described as unlikeable; she has been characterized as having been too tough on crime as a prosecutor, but also pro-illegal immigration; she has had her candidacy labeled a “coup”; and she has been subjected to commentators mocking even the pronunciation of her name, among other things. Suffice to say, it has been a lot.

If elected, Harris would not only be the first woman president, but she is the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants. Her heritage and status as a powerful woman on the cusp of winning the Oval Office has, quite plainly, spurred the attacks drenched in racist and sexist vitriol. “Suddenly she’s the next messiah?” Fox News host Jesse Watters said Tuesday night as he railed against Harris. “The only reason she is in the White House is because of the DEI deal Biden cut with Bernie [Sanders] to seal the nomination.” The salvo is a page out of the right’s playbook targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, a bogeyman it has used to blame for everything from airline safety issues to the Baltimore bridge collapse.

In most of corporate America, even calling someone a “DEI” candidate would be grounds for stiff disciplinary action, if not outright dismissal. But attributing the success of Harris to her race and sex has become standard fare among Donald Trump’s media allies who conveniently ignore her wealth of experience in both law and government. (It is somewhat ironic, given that J.D. Vance, Trump’s running mate, actually has a rather thin resume.) To a degree, the onslaught of attacks Harris has been subjected to recalls the ugly treatment that Barack Obama received from right-wing media more than a decade ago as he campaigned for president and served in office. Most prominently, Obama was targeted with the false and reprehensible conspiracy theory suggesting he was an illegitimate president because he supposedly wasn’t born in America, a movement that Trump himself endlessly fanned the flames of. The attacks on Harris are, without question, in the same vein. While right-wing media figures have for years attacked and mocked Harris as the administration’s “border czar” and a “socialist,” the blitzkrieg of attacks now being directed toward the vice president signal how flummoxed MAGA Media is over how to tackle her candidacy. Until Sunday, the focus of right-wing media had been on Joe Biden, which waged an unrelenting campaign on the president, portraying him as a senile, mentally incapacitated man under the control of nefarious “globalist” forces. Now, with the sudden and last-minute switcheroo by the Democratic Party, Trump and his media allies are left searching for the most effective narrative to present to the public to damage Harris’ chances at denying them the White House. Those efforts will, surely, increase as new polling emerges showing Harris could seriously threaten Trump’s odds of winning in November. Which narrative Trump’s media allies settle on remains to be seen. It may ultimately prove too difficult to identify a singular line of attack on Harris, in which case several charges could be tossed into a stew that blends together. That’s how right-wing media confronted Obama in 2008. But, notably, it did not prove to be a successful strategy. And for some Republicans, the race-based attacks on Harris have already crossed the line. “Of course it’s not appropriate, for heaven’s sakes. What, are they just going to say if you’re not a white male, it’s a DEI candidate?” moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said. “I’m sorry. No.”"
Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife defends Harris against sexist criticisms of her as childless | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:31 AM EDT, Thu July 25, 2024",2024-07-24T23:31:57.190Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/kerstin-emhoff-defends-kamala-harris-sexism/index.html,"The ex-wife of second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Wednesday defended Vice President Kamala Harris against sexist criticisms about her lack of biological children, calling them “baseless” and expressing her gratitude for the presumptive Democratic nominee. “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Kerstin Emhoff said in a statement first provided to CNN. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.” Emhoff’s statement follows resurfaced video of Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance criticizing several public figures, including Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance told Tucker Carlson in a July 2021 interview. Kerstin Emhoff, a film producer, shares two children with Doug Emhoff. The vice president has said her stepchildren refer to her as “Momala.” Spokespeople for Vance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his 2021 statement. Vance is a father of three. Harris has already faced rounds of attacks on her race and gender. Right wing media have been maligning Harris at an increased clip since President Joe Biden announced he was dropping from the race Sunday and endorsed Harris, slamming the vice president as a “DEI” candidate while criticizing everything from her romantic history to the way she laughs. Buttigieg, who was criticized along with Harris in Vance’s 2021 interview, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that the remarks came at a time when he and his husband, Chasten, “had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.” “He couldn’t have known that,” Buttigieg said, “but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children.” (The Buttigiegs welcomed twins in late 2021.) Harris and Doug Emhoff married in 2014. “The thing about blended families,” Harris told CNN in 2020, “if everyone approaches it in the way that there’s plenty of love to share, then it works.” In a 2019 essay in Elle, Harris discussed becoming close friends with Kerstin Emhoff and sharing a blended family. “Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends,” Harris said. “… We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional.”"
Fox News proposes Trump-Harris debate on Sept. 17 after Biden pulls out of race | CNN Business,"Updated 7:29 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T18:12:40.887Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/media/fox-news-proposes-trump-harris-debate-sept-17/index.html,"Fox News has proposed a presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on September 17. The debate invitation from the right-wing cable network would take place in the swing state of Pennsylvania, with anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum serving as moderators, it said Wednesday. In letters to the Trump and Harris campaigns, Fox News President Jay Wallace and Vice President of Politics Jessica Loker said it is “open to discussion on the exact date, format and location – with or without an audience.” The letter also noted that “despite not having a Democratic debate” in 2016 or 2020, the network “was able to secure town halls with Democratic candidates” including with Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand. The network also attached statistics and ratings which it said pointed to its “strength with key demographics such as independents in swing states.” The Trump and Harris campaigns did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the proposal. Trump and President Joe Biden’s campaign had previously agreed to two debates this year, one hosted by CNN in June and another to be hosted by ABC on September 10. It’s not clear if that debate will still take place now that Biden has dropped out of the race. Trump has also expressed displeasure at ABC and has previously posted that he wants Fox News to host the debate instead of the Disney-owned network. An ABC News spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he “absolutely” wants to debate Harris, and “would be willing to do more than one debate, actually.” “I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden,” Trump said. “But I want to debate her, and she’ll be no different, because they have the same policies. I think debating’s important for a presidential race, I really do, you sort of have an obligation to debate.”"
Analysis: How Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump | CNN Politics,"Published 7:16 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T23:16:26.992Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/polling-harris-voters-color-women/index.html,"Kamala Harris seems to have more appeal among voters of color and younger voters than Joe Biden did before he got out of the presidential race. Still, the 2020 results show that Harris can make up even more ground with these groups in her expected matchup against Donald Trump. Take a look at our newly published CNN/SSRS poll. Harris leads Trump among Black voters 78% to 15%. Among these same voters (the poll recontacted the same respondents), Biden was ahead by a smaller 70% to 23% in CNN polling data from April and June. The same holds to a somewhat lesser degree among Hispanic voters. Harris comes in at 47% to Trump’s 45%, while it was 50% for Trump to 41% for Biden among these same respondents in the April and June data. Voters under the age of 35 demonstrate a similar shift. It’s Harris 47% to Trump’s 43% now. In April and June, these same voters put Trump up 49% to 42% over Biden. In some ways, none of these shifts are very surprising. Biden was doing the worst for a Democrat this century among all these traditionally Democratic-leaning groups. In fact, his performance among Hispanic and Black voters was the worst for a Democrat in over 50 years. Harris probably had nowhere to go but up with these segments of the electorate. Despite the improvement, the results should leave much to be desired for Harris. She is doing at least 5 points worse than Biden did among these same groups in the final 2020 polls. Among Black voters, Biden led Trump 84% to 9% at the end of the 2020 campaign. Even more notable is that Biden led among Hispanic voters by a 58% to 32% spread. Finally, even as Harris has become a meme favorite among young voters, Biden’s 60% to 31% advantage over Trump at the end of the 2020 campaign is massively larger than where Harris is right now. (I should note the polling at this point in the 2020 campaign was similar to what the polls at the end of the campaign showed.) This may seem like bad news for the Harris campaign, and, in one clear way, it is. Without improving among these groups, Harris likely cannot win against the former president. The good news for Harris, though, is that she’s showing that she can make up some ground with this group relative to how Biden was doing earlier this year. As Harris continues to define herself separately from being Biden’s vice president, there’s a real chance she could carve out her own political identity that may appeal more to voters of color and young voters. The fact that Harris overperforms Biden among voters of color also provides her an opportunity to open up more paths in the Electoral College. Biden’s pathway to 270 electoral votes seemed rather limited. He was likely going to need to run the table in the northern battleground states by carrying Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. His polling in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina had been poor. If he won the northern battleground states and the other Democratic-leaning states (minus those aforementioned Sun Belt states), Biden would have gotten exactly the 270 electoral votes he needed to win. A big reason Biden struggled in those Sun Belt states is that each has a significant share of either Black or Hispanic voters. By doing better with those groups, Harris may reopen the possibility of more electoral paths. If, for instance, Harris won all four Sun Belt battlegrounds mentioned above, she wouldn’t need to carry Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. Perhaps more likely, Harris could get to 270 electoral votes by winning some mixture of northern battlegrounds and Sun Belt swing states. The bottom line is that the latest CNN polling provides the Harris campaign with some hope. It’s not that Trump isn’t favored or that Harris doesn’t face an tough climb. Rather, Harris now has a bunch of paths toward victory, while Biden’s options seemed to be closing rather quickly."
Fact check: Harris falsely claims Project 2025 blueprint calls for cutting Social Security | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:00 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T19:47:58.045Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/fact-check-harris-project-2025-trump/index.html,"In the first rally of her presidential campaign on Tuesday, presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris wrongly described parts of the conservative Project 2025 blueprint for a potential second Donald Trump presidency. The 920-page Project 2025 blueprint was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration; Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.” Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. At Harris’ Tuesday rally in Wisconsin, she criticized Trump and “his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” then said: “Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It’s 900 pages. But here’s the thing. When you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. They intend to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back, then, to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions.” Facts First: One of Harris’ claims about Project 2025 is false, while another is at least misleading. The Project 2025 document does not show that Trump intends to cut Social Security; the document barely discusses Social Security at all and does not propose cuts to the program. In addition, contrary to Harris’ suggestion, Project 2025 does not call to “end” the Affordable Care Act or eliminate its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The document does criticize the Affordable Care Act, especially the law’s expansion of Medicaid, but makes clear it is advocating changes to the law rather than terminating the law entirely. A Harris campaign official said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.” ﻿After the initial publication of this article, a Harris campaign spokesperson, Joseph Costello, added, “Project 2025 is a blueprint for many of the dangerous policies we know that a second Trump term would include, and it is indisputable that in his first term, Donald Trump repeatedly tried to cut Social Security and end the Affordable Care Act.” Mary Vought, a spokesperson for Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation, said, “Harris should follow her own advice and read the book instead of promoting lies and misinformation.” No Project 2025 call to cut Social Security We won’t render a verdict on Harris’ claim about Project 2025 calling for cuts to Medicare, though Trump himself has vowed he will not cut even a cent from the health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities. The Project 2025 document proposes multiple significant changes to Medicare, and it’s not clear what their overall impact would be. And there is a reasonable basis for Harris’ claim about Project 2025 wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations. The project’s proposals to significantly restructure the tax code include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate and ideas that would disproportionately benefit high earners. Trump’s own proposal to extend the expiring provisions of his 2017 tax cut law also favors wealthy people. But contrary to Harris’ claim that “when you read” the Project 2025 document “you will see” that Trump intends to cut Social Security, the lengthy document includes no call to cut Social Security. In fact, the document uses the words “Social Security” just 10 times, mostly in passing. Vought said the document calls for “no changes to Social Security.” Harris could fairly have noted that Trump himself has expressed openness, both in decades past and earlier this year, to cutting Social Security. When he was asked in a March interview about how he would handle Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, he said, “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements.” (He has since vowed not to cut “one penny” from Social Security or Medicare.) But what Harris actually said is that the proof of a supposed Trump intention to cut Social Security in a second term is found in the Project 2025 document. It is not. No Project 2025 call to end the Affordable Care Act Harris at least suggested at the rally, though did not explicitly say, that the Project 2025 document includes a call to end the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But that’s not correct, either. The document criticizes the budget impact of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for lower-income people. It also explicitly calls for some changes to the Affordable Care Act – popularly known as Obamacare – or its implementation. Those suggested changes include removing restrictions on physician-owned and specialty hospitals, better enforcing a provision of the law related to how insurers must handle money related to abortion, and coming up with “a plan to separate the non-subsidized insurance market from the subsidized market.” But the document makes no mention of changes to Affordable Care Act protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And its suggestions for changes to the law are clearly not suggestions to get rid of the law entirely. “It does not end the Affordable Care Act,” Vought said. Trump himself repeatedly promised during his 2016 election campaign to “terminate” Obamacare and replace it with an unspecified superior plan, but failed to achieve his goal as president. In a social media post during this campaign, in November 2023, he said he was “seriously looking at alternatives” to Obamacare, criticized Republican senators who had voted “not to terminate” the law, and added that “we should never give up!” Then, four days later, he wrote, “I don’t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!” This story has been updated with a response from the Harris campaign."
Democrats approve rules for likely Harris nomination | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:41 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T19:52:24.786Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/democrats-rules-kamala-harris-nomination/index.html,"Democrats on Wednesday adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Kamala Harris likely to begin August 1. That would be less than two weeks after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection and endorsed his vice president, who quickly consolidated support within the party for her presidential bid. In just the first few days of her campaign, Harris earned the backing of hundreds of Democratic elected officials, including all her potential challengers, and it took her less than 36 hours to secure the support of enough delegates to win the nomination. “We are all working hard to execute this nomination with transparency, with fairness and efficiency,” Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said during Wednesday’s meeting. “Delegates are free to support who they choose, and we are glad that they are engaging in this important moment in history. As a party we have an obligation to design and implement a fair nomination process for delegates to officially express their preferences through a vote,” Harrison said. Under the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention’s rules panel, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidacies and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting toward the threshold. Voting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end. If more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates. Delegates will have 36 hours’ notice before voting begins. The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio. While the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new law won’t take effect until the end of August. While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates – senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their current or past positions – will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full Democratic convention. That could be determined by a candidate either winning enough votes during remote balloting or gathering a sufficient number of signatures. After a presidential candidate is nominated, the rules allow the nominee to name a running mate without the need for additional remote voting. The rules also call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19-22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote. This story has been updated with additional information."
"Harris is less than 2 weeks away from naming running mate, with vetting and polling underway | CNN Politics","Published 5:42 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T21:42:23.531Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/vice-president-pick-kamala-harris/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris is less than two weeks away from naming her own running mate. That’s the timeline the presumptive Democratic nominee has given to a team of lawyers and advisers who are conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, people familiar with the process tell CNN, with a goal of announcing a nominee before August 7. Democrats close to the process say the roster of leading contenders being vetted still includes North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sources say. “She will pick someone she’s comfortable with – someone who is ready to be president,” a Democrat close to the process tells CNN, adding that Harris is not tipping her hand to any early favorites among the contenders. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a team that is poring through financial documents, family histories, public statements, published documents, voting records, campaign experience and social media postings. Tony West, a former associate attorney general under Holder who is Harris’ brother-in-law, is also playing a central role in the search. CNN has also learned that Democratic pollsters have been asked to test how Harris and any of the prospective candidates would fare in their home states – and key battlegrounds – in hypothetical matchups against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman who often serves as a sounding board for Harris, is also playing an unofficial role in the search, people familiar with the process say, along with other top advisers to Harris. The truncated process means that nearly four years after Harris answered the call from Joe Biden to be his running mate – on August 11, 2020 – she intends to make a call of her own, asking one of the men on the list to join her Democratic ticket. A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed no clear leader in a matchup between Harris and Trump. The former president holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the survey’s margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found about a Biden-Trump matchup. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee’s rules panel on Wednesday adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin August 1. The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7."
The new wave of pop stars who are getting young voters tuned into the 2024 election | CNN,"Published 5:09 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T21:09:11.270Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/entertainment/pop-stars-tiktok-2024-election/index.html,"Hear that? That’s the sound of a wave of young pop artists powering Vice President Kamala Harris on TikTok. A video shared this week by the Harris campaign on the platform, set to pop star Chappell Roan’s song “Femininomenon” from her 2023 album “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” paints her in stark contrast to former President Donald Trump. It has already garnered more than 35 million views. “But what we really need is a femininomenon,” the chorus of Roan’s song plays over rotating photos of Harris and Trump. “A what?” her voice screams. “A femininomenon!” The song “Femininomenon” — a word made up by Roan that combines “feminine” and “phenomenon” — quickly secured the attention of the TikTok generation, many of whom are potential voters. While Roan has not yet endorsed a candidate in the race for the White House, galvanizing her fans through her music may pay off for the Harris campaign. (Roan’s representative did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment). The singer told a crowd of thousands last month at New York’s Governors Ball Music festival, where she performed while dressed as the Statue of Liberty, that she’d declined an invitation to perform at the White House’s LGBTQ+ Pride Celebration — but that was President Joe Biden’s White House. Now, with Harris as the presumptive Democratic nominee, celebrities who were reluctant to publicly endorse Biden have been coming out in full force to support Harris. And no class of celebrity will be more important to her campaign than the superstars who can rally young Americans to get out and vote. As the nature of celebrity influence changes in the world of social media, traditional A-listers no longer move the needle with a group of voters who matter great in this election: the first timers. In other words, Charli XCX could be more influential in the 2024 election than George Clooney or Barbra Streisand (both of whom have also endorsed Harris). “Both campaigns struggled to get to Gen Z because both of the candidates were older than their grandparents,” a Democratic strategist who is working with A-list celebrities this election cycle told CNN of the race that was between Biden and Trump. “Kamala has a really good chance to break through with Gen Z,” the Hollywood strategist added. “She’s closer to their parents’ age, which is more relatable.” Harris’ campaign has already gotten early support from young, hugely influential pop stars including Ariana Grande, who is one of the most followed people on the planet with 378 million Instagram followers; Demi Lovato, who has 155 million Instagram followers; Kesha and Charli XCX — who gave Harris more attention than any campaign could ever dream of with her now-infamous “Kamala IS brat” post, which was quickly embraced by the vice president’s team across their social media platforms. Harris isn’t the only presidential hopeful who is utilizing TikTok as a key campaigning strategy. While Harris’ TikTok page has 1.1 million followers, Trump, who joined TikTok in June, garnered 3 million followers in his first day on the social media platform. He now boasts 9.1 million followers. (However, with significantly less followers, Harris, who has 15.8 million likes on her HQ’s TikTok page, has higher engagement than Trump, who has 22.2 million likes with his much larger following.) Here’s a look at three pop stars who could galvanize Gen Z into action this election: Charli XCX Charli XCX was already being talked about as the “it girl” of the summer, thanks to her sixth studio album titled “brat,” which inspired a new color name and a fashion trend. The 31-year-old British singer has explained the aesthetic, in part, as visualizing a “pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.” “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes,” she explained in a video shared on TikTok. “Who feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat.” By declaring Harris “brat” she not only gave the campaign a highly visible boost among Gen Z, but also gave the campaign an opportunity to show they valued the distinction. Those visiting the official Kamala HQ account on X, which links to her official site, are met with a background photo in the “brat” green color and the vice president’s name in the same font as sported on Charli XCX’s album. And Charli XCX is not the only pop star to get in on the game. Olivia Rodrigo Singer and songwriter Olivia Rodrigo appeared to endorse Harris on social media on Wednesday. The 21-year-old Grammy-winning artist behind hits like “Drivers License” and “Deja Vu,” shared a video on Instagram of Harris giving her first rally speech as part of her presidential election campaign on Tuesday in West Allis, Wisconsin. Rodrigo placed emojis of praising hands on the video of Harris vowing to protect reproductive rights. “Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,” Harris says in the video. “And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as president of the United States, I will sign it into law.” Rodrigo made free emergency contraception available at some of her concerts during her “Guts” tour as part of her ongoing Fund 4 Good initiative, which is a “global initiative committed to building an equitable and just future for all women, girls and people seeking reproductive health freedom,” according to the foundation’s website. This is not the first time Rodrigo has spoken out about causes with poltical leaders. In July 2021, the singer visited the White House during the pandemic to meet with Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci to encourage young Americans to get vaccinated. At that visit, she posted for photos with Harris, and stated that she was proud to support the administration’s vaccination initiative by using her massive platform to reach her young fans. Turns out, Rodrigo’s influence on young voters may prove to be pivotal once again. Chappell Roan The Harris campaign’s video featuring Roan’s music might be the first some voters are hearing of the artist but not if they are Gen Z. The singer, 26, who signed her first record deal as a teen, has become a phenomenon this summer. Roan, whose music has an ‘80s synth-pop sound with smooth vocals, had seen her popularity rise so quickly that festivals have had to adjust for her growing concert crowds. Her 2023 debut studio album “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” which is a nod to her Willard, Missouri roots, currently sits in the No. 5 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart. She has also had three songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, according to the music charting site, including “Red Wine Supernova,” “Hot To Go!” and her latest single, “Good Luck Babe!” Roan, who identifies as queer and has said she draws inspiration from drag queens, has been compared to Madonna, in part, for her sex-positive lyrics. “My songs are so overtly sexual on purpose because it’s an expression of me that I wasn’t able to express growing up in a Christian household, in a Christian town that was very conservative,” Roan told Vulture.” When she performed at Governors Ball this past June and turned down the White House’s request to perform for Pride, she explained, “We want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.” Time will tell if Roan will come now for Harris. CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom and DJ Judd contributed to this story."
These three memes will help you understand the Kamala Harris online chatter | CNN,"Published 2:48 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T18:48:56.641Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/entertainment/memes-kamala-harris/index.html,"If memes are the language of the internet, this next election is absolutely being taken to the streets of social media. From coconut trees to “brat” summer laughs, many users have been having fun with Vice President Kamala Harris as she has become the presumptive Democratic nominee. “She’s gone from cringe to cool in 24 hours as a whole generation has taken all the content and remixed it in all these incredible TikTok videos,” CNN Senior Political Commentor Van Jones said earlier this week. “This is not a campaign, this a movement.” Here are three memes that will help you better understand how Harris has sparked so much conversation online. A 2019 video of Harris sharing her recipe for how to dry-brine a Thanksgiving turkey has brought new meaning to the popular phrase “let her cook,” which translates to let a person do the thing they are good at. Harris appears so focused on her cooking in the video, she can be heard telling someone off camera, “One minute” before she casually launches into her preparation of ”kosher salt, black pepper, maybe chop up a little thyme.” Her hand gestures as she describes how to “lather that baby up” made it all the more engaging for some viewers. Harris should probably send Charli XCX a muffin basket if she has not already. The very popular British pop singer signaled to social media that she was riding with Harris when she declared her “brat,” which is both the title of Charli XCX’s sixth studio album and now a Gen Z summer soundtrack. But even before the singer’s post, people were linking her to Harris. As receipts, please see this popular TikTok that mixed Charli’s single “360” with footage of Harris. Way to rizz up a presidential candidate! If you don’t understand what that means, a helpful translation is provided here for anyone in a household without a tween. If there is ever a greatest hits of Harris memes, this one will be listed as one of the most influential. In May 2023, during a swearing-in ceremony of commissioners at an initiative focused on expanding educational opportunities for the Hispanic community, Harris gave a speech that went a little nuts - coconuts that is. Harris spoke about “a difference between equality and equity” and personalized it with a family story. “None of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,” she said. “My mother used to – she would give us a hard time sometimes – and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’” Since then, coconuts and coconut tree imagery have been used online in support of Harris, but also used as a racial slur by some detractors to mean someone who is “brown” on the outside and “white” on the inside. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat representing California, appeared to be in the former camp as he recently spotted on the steps of the capitol in Washington, DC, holding a coconut with a straw in it. He reportedly told reporters he was “staying hydrated.”"
CNN Poll: Harris improves on Biden’s performance against Trump in early look at new matchup | CNN Politics,"Published 12:01 PM EDT, Wed July 24, 2024",2024-07-24T16:01:05.069Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/cnn-poll-kamala-harris-donald-trump/index.html,"The likely 2024 presidential election campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump begins with no clear leader, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection. Trump holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. That’s a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found on the matchup between Biden and Trump. The survey finds voters widely supportive of both Biden’s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are broadly enthusiastic about Harris and willing to coalesce around her as the new presumptive nominee, even as they remain deeply divided on whether Biden’s Democratic successor should seek to continue his policies or chart a new course. The poll, conducted online July 22 and 23, surveyed registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June, both of which found Trump leading Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head matchup. Checking back in with the same people means that shifts in preferences are more likely to reflect real changes over time and not just statistical noise. And the new poll finds some critical movement in these early days of a Harris-Trump race. Harris hangs on to 95% of those who earlier said they supported Biden, while Trump retains the support of a slightly smaller 92% of his previous backers. Those who previously said they would support neither Biden nor Trump in a two-way matchup now split 30% for Harris and 27% for Trump, with the rest saying they’d vote for someone else or opt out of this year’s election. Half of those who back Harris in the new poll (50%) say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump. That’s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden’s supporters in CNN’s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president. About three-quarters of Trump’s supporters (74%) say their vote is to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris. That’s an increase in affirmative support for him compared with the June CNN poll (66%), which came before an assassination attempt on Trump’s life and the Republican National Convention at which the former president formally accepted his party’s nomination. The poll finds Trump’s favorability rating ticking up to 43%, higher than it’s been since 2020 in CNN polling. The poll also suggests that Trump’s support among his strongest groups is holding steady even as his opponent changes: 67% of White voters without degrees support him over Harris, near-identical to his support against Biden (66%). He continues to hold the support of a majority of men (53% versus Harris, it was 54% against Biden). And he maintains the support of about 9 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (90% vs. Harris, 89% against Biden). The shift toward affirmative support for Harris among her backers comes from groups that typically break for Democrats but had been seen as trouble spots for the Biden campaign. Among Harris supporters younger than 45, 43% say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump, up from 28% of Biden voters in that age group who felt the same way about the president in June. Among voters of color who back Harris, 57% say their vote is for her more than against Trump, compared with 48% among Biden voters of color in June. And 54% of women backing Harris say their vote is to support her, compared with 43% of women backing Biden who said the same in June. Those same groups account at least in part for Harris’ polling gains over Biden among those who were recontacted for this survey. Among voters under 35, 49% said in April or June that they would support Trump and 42% Biden, but now, 47% support Harris to 43% for Trump. The same Black voters who split 70% for Biden to 23% for Trump in previous polling now break 78% for Harris to 15% for Trump. Among Hispanic voters, Biden trailed Trump in earlier polling 50% to 41%; those same voters now split about evenly, 47% Harris to 45% for Trump. Women split 46% Biden to 46% Trump in earlier polling, but now break 50% Harris to 45% Trump. Independent voters who broke 47% Trump to 37% Biden in prior polls now split 46% Trump to 43% Harris. That narrowed gap is driven at least partly by increased Harris support among independents who lean toward the Democratic Party. While 81% of voters in that group supported Biden in April or June, 90% of them now back Harris. The poll was conducted as Democratic politicians and delegates rapidly rallied around Harris as the party’s presumptive nominee in the days following Biden’s decision to exit the race. About three-quarters of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (76%) say the Democratic Party should nominate Harris as its candidate for president, with only about 6% expressing support for any other specific person as the nominee. Democratic-aligned voters express broadly positive views of Harris, with three-quarters or more saying that she is someone they’d be proud to have as president (86%), agrees with them on the issues that matter most (84%), represents the future of the Democratic Party (83%), will unite the country and not divide it (77%) and has a good chance of beating Trump (75%). In a sign of the current intraparty unity around Harris, there are relatively few sharp demographic divides in Democratic-aligned voters’ assessments. Ideological divisions within the Democratic Party are also relatively muted, with both 88% of self-described liberals and 81% of self-described moderates or conservatives saying that they think Harris agrees with them on the most important issues. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden’s policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, voters older than 65 (72%), White voters (62%) and those with college degrees (58%) largely want the party’s next nominee to follow in Biden’s footsteps. Six in 10 voters of color and voters younger than 45 say they’re looking for a new direction on policy. By contrast, there’s little ideological divide on this question, with similar shares of self-described liberals (55%) and moderates or conservatives (51%) hoping to see the next nominee continue with Biden’s policies. Democratic-aligned voters’ priorities for a potential Harris running mate suggest a focus on electability: Four in 10 say it’s extremely important that, if nominated, she choose someone with proven appeal to swing voters. That’s in contrast to under 3 in 10 who say it’s extremely important that her running mate bring ideological balance to the ticket (28%) or has experience as an executive in government (25%). Only 11% say it’s extremely important she pick a male running mate, with more than half saying that isn’t at all an important factor. The poll suggests Republican and Republican-leaning voters have also coalesced around Trump in the tumultuous weeks since the June 27 CNN presidential debate. Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) now say that the Republicans have a better chance to win with Trump at the top of the ticket than without him, the highest share to say so in any CNN poll on this question dating back to 2015. Nearly 9 in 10 registered voters overall (87%) say they approve of Biden’s decision to end his campaign for reelection, including more than 8 in 10 across parties (90% of Democrats, 88% of independents and 85% of Republicans approve). And 70% – including majorities across party lines – say that he should remain in office as president through the end of his term in January, while 29% say he ought to resign and let Harris take over. Asked how they feel about Biden stepping aside, 58% of voters nationwide say they feel relieved, 37% are hopeful, 28% say they were surprised and 20% are worried. Smaller shares say they felt disappointed (13%) or angry (4%). Black voters are somewhat less likely than voters overall to approve of Biden’s decision (78% approve) and more likely to say they were surprised (49%) or feel disappointed about his choice (27%). Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 54% say they feel hopeful, while 29% are worried. Just 2% of Democratic-aligned voters say they feel angry. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from July 22-23 among a random national sample of 1,631 registered voters who participated in CNN polls in April or June and were originally drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. More than 80% of registered voters across the two initial surveys participated in the recontact survey, and analysis showed no meaningful difference in demographic characteristics or political views between those who participated and those who did not. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points."
