LaMonica McIver wins special House election in New Jersey | CNN Politics,"Published 8:37 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-19T00:37:15.432Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/lamonica-mciver-new-jersey-special-election/index.html,"Democratic Newark City Council member LaMonica McIver has defeated Republican small businessman Carmen Bucco in a contest for New Jersey’s 10th Congressional District that opened up because of the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. in April. McIver will serve out the remainder of Payne’s term, which ends in January. She and Bucco will face a rematch on the November ballot for the full term. McIver emerged as the Democratic candidate in a crowded field in the July special primary election. A member of the city council of New Jersey’s biggest city since 2018, she also worked for Montclair Public Schools as a personnel director and plans to focus on affordability, infrastructure, abortion rights and “protecting our democracy,” she told The Associated Press earlier this summer. Bucco describes himself on his campaign website as a small-business owner influenced by his upbringing in the foster system. He lists support for law enforcement and ending corruption as top issues. The 10th District lies in a heavily Democratic and majority-Black region of northern New Jersey. Republicans are outnumbered by more than 6 to 1. It’s been a volatile year for Democrats in New Jersey, where the party dominates state government and the congressional delegation. Among the developments were the conviction on federal bribery charges of Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who has denied the charges, and the demise of the so-called county party line – a system in which local political leaders give their preferred candidates favorable position on the primary ballot. Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who’s running for Menendez’s seat, and other Democrats brought a federal lawsuit challenging the practice as part of his campaign to oust Menendez, who has resigned since his conviction."
"Harris expected to meet with Zelensky next week, sources say | CNN Politics","Published 6:57 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T22:57:10.125Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/harris-zelensky-meeting/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, DC, next week, according to three sources familiar with the planning. The meeting comes amid concerns over the impact the American election results will have on the Russia-Ukraine war and US policy toward Ukraine as it seeks additional resources. Asked Wednesday whether Harris will meet with Zelensky next week, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby suggested she might if the opportunity presented itself. “I know she has met with President Zelensky face-to-face on a couple of occasions, and I know she’s spoken to him on the phone. I have little doubt that if the opportunity presents itself, and both of them can have another conversation, they will, but you’ll have to talk to her staff,” Kirby told reporters. Harris, along with President Joe Biden, will also meet with the president of the United Arab Emirates at the White House on Monday to discuss ongoing tensions in the Middle East, the crisis in Sudan and a “number of bilateral and regional matters,” Kirby said. CNN reached out to the vice president’s office for comment. Earlier Wednesday, former President Donald Trump said he’ll “probably” meet with Zelensky when he travels to the US next week. Trump spoke on the phone with Zelensky in July, but a meeting between the two leaders would mark their first in-person interaction since Trump left the White House."
Harris wants to limit child care costs to 7% of family income | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:51 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T22:15:51.660Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/child-care-harris-7-percent-cap/index.html,"Two weeks after former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance raised eyebrows when answering how they’d make child care more affordable, Vice President Kamala Harris was asked how she’d address the problem vexing millions of American families. Harris responded that she’d cap child care costs at 7% of working families’ income, following the Biden administration playbook that she was heavily involved in writing. But she didn’t provide details on how she’d achieve that goal or how she’d pay for such a measure. “My plan is that no family, no working family, should pay more than 7% of their household income in child care,” Harris said Tuesday at a National Association of Black Journalists event, noting that steep child care expenses make it difficult for many parents to work. The 7% threshold was an early objective of the Biden administration. President Joe Biden’s ambitious – and ultimately unsuccessful – Build Back Better package in 2021 called for limiting child care costs for families with children younger than age 6 to no more than 7% of income for those earning up to 250% of state median income, expanding access to about 20 million children. Funding would have lasted six years. The provision, along with a universal pre-K measure, would have cost an estimated $382 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Stymied by Congress on a broader effort, the administration issued a rule earlier this year that instituted a 7% cap for low-income families receiving federal child care subsidies. It will reduce costs for about 100,000 children, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The rule, which Harris announced, also contained provisions to encourage more providers to participate in the federal grant program, and the vice president noted Tuesday that child care providers should “receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work.” Asked for more details about her current plan, a Harris campaign spokesperson pointed to the administration’s rule. Child care advocates were buoyed by Harris’ answer on Tuesday. It was the first time Melissa Boteach, vice president of child care and income security at the National Women’s Law Center Action Fund, heard Harris reference a specific figure as a candidate, though she long supported that threshold while in office. “It tracks with her history of being a strong champion on child care and early learning and her understanding the stress of parents trying to find and afford care and of providers trying to make a living wage,” Boteach said. Child care is a major financial burden for many families in the US. Parents with two kids in a child care center paid on average at least twice as much for that care as they did for the typical rent in 11 states and the District of Columbia in 2023, according to a Child Care Aware of America report released in May. Nationwide, the average annual cost of care rose to $11,582 per child last year. That equates to 10% of median household income for a married couple with children and 32% of median income for a single parent with children, Child Care Aware found. Child care has been in the political spotlight this month. Asked at an economic forum two weeks ago how he would make child care more affordable, Trump responded that his plan to hike tariffs would raise enough revenue, without explaining how that would help families. “We are going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it is relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in,” he said in remarks at the Economic Club of New York. Vance was also asked that week about lowering the cost of day care. “Maybe like grandma or grandpa wants to help out a little bit more. Or maybe there’s an aunt or uncle who wants to help out a little bit more,” he told Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at a campaign event in Arizona. Acknowledging that not everyone can turn to family, Vance said two problems with the current child care system is that a lot of people who want to work in the industry can’t “either because they don’t have access to the education that they need, or maybe more importantly, because the state government says you’re not allowed to take care of children unless you have some ridiculous certification that has nothing to do, nothing to do with taking care of kids.”"
Sarah Huckabee Sanders is latest Trump ally to make dig at Harris over biological kids | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:40 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T20:13:02.515Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/sarah-huckabee-sanders-harris-kids/index.html,"Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders reignited the controversy over how allies of Donald Trump talk about stepmothers and childless women when she told supporters of the former president Tuesday night that Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything to keep her humble. While introducing Trump at a Flint, Michigan, town hall, Sanders said her three children serve as a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country” ahead of the election. “My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble,” said Sanders, the first female governor of Arkansas and Trump’s former White House press secretary. “You would think after four years of straight failure, she would know a little humility. Unfortunately, she doesn’t.” The comments come as the Trump campaign attempts to narrow the gap with Harris among female voters. Sanders is one of several former Trump staffers who have attempted to vouch for the former president among women, despite his long history of sexual misconduct allegations and the fact that he was found liable of sexual abuse and defamation last year. During her time in the White House, Sanders, who at times faced sexist comments about her appearance, defended Trump after he was criticized for attacks on female politicians. Her remarks Tuesday, in which she argued that children serve as reminders of what matters in an election and alluded to the vice president’s lack of biological kids, are reminiscent of comments made by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, a longtime critic of those, particularly elected officials, without children. The Ohio senator has railed against a “childless elite” in Washington, who he has argued doesn’t have a “direct stake” in the future of the country, and has said that the US was being run by “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” Vance has also said the Democratic Party has become “anti-family and anti-child.” Those comments, made before he joined Trump on the Republican presidential ticket, have been widely criticized by members of both parties. Pop star Taylor Swift alluded to the Vance lines in her endorsement of Harris, signing off as a “Childless Cat Lady.” Trump has since said, “I hate Taylor Swift.” Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Sanders, said the governor was referring to the Biden-Harris administration’s economic and border security policies. “Vice President Harris, without winning any votes, and after driving up prices by 20% and allowing nearly ten million illegal border crossings, is claiming she alone can solve America’s problems,” Dubke said in a statement to CNN. “That’s the lack of humility Governor Sanders was referencing.” The Harris and Trump campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. But second gentleman Doug Emhoff, speaking at a campaign fundraiser in Brooklyn on Wednesday, defended “our big, beautiful, blended family” and tied Vance’s comments to what he said was Trump’s agenda. “We know what they’re really trying to do. It’s Dobbs, it’s Project 2025, it’s spreading hate and trying to pit women against each other, trying to pit us all against each other,” he said. “But I’ve got news for him. Women in this country are sick and tired of weak men trying to take away their fundamental rights and then gaslight you about it.” He continued: “The women in this country will never humble themselves before Donald Trump.” While Harris does not have biological children, she has two stepchildren – Cole and Ella Emhoff – through her 10-year marriage to second gentleman Doug Emhoff. “We might not look like other families in the White House, but we are ready to represent all families in America,” Cole Emhoff said in a video introducing his father at last month’s Democratic National Convention. The second gentleman’s former wife, Kerstin Emhoff, has continually defended Harris and her role in their blended family. “Cole and Ella keep us inspired to make the world a better place. I do it through storytelling. Kamala Harris has spent her entire career working for the people, ALL families,” she wrote on social media Tuesday in response to Sanders’ remarks. “That keeps you pretty humble.” At the core of the Democratic backlash to the remarks by Vance, and now Sanders, however, has been that women’s value and contributions to their communities shouldn’t be based on whether they have had children. And Democrats slam the related GOP rhetoric as a distraction. “When you have no substance, you have to resort to superficiality,” said Donna Brazile, a Harris ally and veteran Democratic political strategist. Brazile pointed to Vance missing recent Senate votes to temporarily expand the child tax credit and to protect and expand access to in vitro fertilization, which Senate Republicans blocked. Members of Sanders own party have also balked at her remarks at the Flint event. Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and CNN senior political commentator, said that he understood the value of stepparents, having been raised for several years by his stepmother. “My kind of Republican Party welcomes everyone,” Jennings said on CNN’s “NewsNight with Abby Phillip” on Tuesday. “We do encourage families, we encourage life, but we also encourage everybody to do what’s best for themselves in their own personal situation and respect other people’s choices.” Brian Lanza, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who was also raised by a stepmother, told Phillip he was “offended” by the comment and “disappointed” in Sanders for saying that. “I’m sure I’m going to get criticism from the campaign, but I have to defend somebody who’s a stepmom. It’s a tough job,” Lanza said. “We should reward that and speak of that in a high tone.” This story has been been updated with comments from second gentleman Doug Emhoff."
2024 campaign latest: Trump holds NY rally as Harris makes appeal to Latino voters | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-18T12:01:30.266Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-attempt-harris-election-09-18-24/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was going to visit Springfield, Ohio, “in the next two weeks” after repeatedly promoting an unfounded conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants in the city eating people’s pets. “I’m going to go there in the next two weeks, I’m going to Springfield and I’m going to Aurora. You may never see me again, but that’s OK. I gotta do what I gotta do,” Trump said at a rally in Uniondale, New York, also referring to Aurora, Colorado — another city he has used to promote false claims about immigration.  Trump on Wednesday said he thought the mayor of Springfield was “a very nice person” but slammed him for not expelling the migrants, who Trump falsely claimed are undocumented. The city of Springfield says on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County — which has a population of 136,000 — and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Former President Donald Trump said during a campaign rally in New York on Wednesday that if reelected he would make Ground Zero in Manhattan a national monument.   “I am announcing tonight that as president I will officially make the Ground Zero site at the World Trade Center a national monument protected and maintained by the United States government so that hallowed ground and the memory of those who perished there will be preserved for all time, preserved forever,” Trump said during the rally in Uniondale, New York.   Trump visited Ground Zero last week for a commemoration event to mark the 23rd anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris is the best choice for workers in this election, pointing to former President Donald Trump’s recent comments to cast him as anti-labor unions. “It’s a clear-cut choice, who stands with working class people and who doesn’t,” Fain told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” “You know, I mean Donald Trump wants to fire striking workers and Kamala Harris stands – stands out there with striking workers on the picket line.” Fain was referring to Trump remarks during an interview with Tesla CEO Elon Musk during which the former president seemingly agreed with the tactic of intimidating workers who go on strike. Following the interview, the UAW filed federal labor charges against Trump and Musk. Fain’s comments come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a union that represents truck drivers, freight workers and other workers, decided not to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in nearly 30 years. Asked by Collins whether the non-endorsement is a blow to Harris, Fain said, “Not really.” However, Trump has falsely claimed that he won the endorsement of the “rank-and-file” of Teamsters. Responding to Trump’s claim, Fain pointed to several local Teamsters chapters, including the key battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada, endorsing Harris. Emmy-award winner Liza Colón-Zayas and Grammy-award winner Anthony Ramos will appear alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, a campaign official told CNN. The appearance from the two actors marks the Harris campaign’s effort to ramp up engagement with Latino voters after the campaign announced a $3 million investment in Spanish-language radio advertising last week.  Colón-Zayas became the first Latina to win an Emmy for best supporting actress on Sunday for her role in “The Bear.” Ramos, who starred in “Hamilton” and “In the Heights,” campaigned along Vice President Kamala Harris at an event in Miami last year.  Variety first reported the two actors appearing alongside Walz. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff sharply rebuked recent comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris not having biological children robs her of something “keeping her humble.” “They said that somehow, because Cole and Ella aren’t Kamala’s quote, unquote biological children, that she doesn’t have anything in her life to keep her humble,” Emhoff told supporters at a campaign fundraiser in Brooklyn, New York. “As if keeping women humble, whether you have children or not, is something we should strive for.”  While introducing former President Trump at a town hall in Michigan, Sanders said her three children serve as a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country” that Harris “doesn’t have anything to keep her humble.” Emhoff said Wednesday that he and Harris experience the “same joys of raising children as any parent anywhere.” “There is nothing more important to me Kamala and Kerstin than our kids, our big, beautiful, blended family,” Emhoff continued, referring to his first wife Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of his children. The second gentleman also swiped at Trump while rallying women Harris supporters, who he said “will never humble themselves before Donald Trump.”  “We know what they’re really trying to do. It’s Dobbs. It’s Project 2025. It’s spreading hate and trying to pit women against each other, trying to pit us all against each other,” he said. “But I’ve got news for him. Women in this country are sick and tired of weak men trying to take away their fundamental rights and then and then gaslight you about it.”  “We’re sick and tired of it, and the women in this country will never humble themselves before Donald Trump,” he added. House Republicans sounded off after Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal to extend government funding failed and divided the GOP conference. Pressed on whether a shutdown before the election could hurt Republicans, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she thinks “this is a complete failure of the speaker’s strategy.” “Again, we weren’t here in the entire month of August and could have finished our 12 separate appropriations bills,” she said. The package tied a 6-month funding stopgap to a bill banning non-citizens from voting, known as the SAVE Act. The House voted 202 to 220, with 14 Republicans voting against it with two Republicans voting present. Three Democrats voted for the bill. Earlier Wednesday, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, encouraging lawmakers to allow the government to shut down rather than pass a funding extension without the SAVE Act included.  Asked about Trump’s post, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who voted present, said: “I think he needs to get to know Mike Johnson. There’s no way Mike Johnson’s doing that. If he think’s Mike Johnson’s doing that, Mike Johnson’s getting one over on Trump.” Rep. Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable Republican from New York who voted for the package, indicated that he would not support a shutdown. “We have to support the continuity of government,” he told reporters. New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who supported the legislation, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday evening that “the reality is we’re not shutting down the government with 48 days to go before an election.” The election is going to be decided by voters based on the issues that are impacting them, Lawler said, and a shutdown “will only distract from that and certainly won’t serve any real purpose.” This post has been updated with comments from Rep. Mike Lawler. Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed he received the endorsement of the “rank-and-file” of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters despite the union declining to endorse a presidential candidate. The union announced on Wednesday that for the first time in nearly three decades it would not endorse a presidential candidate. Internal polling released by the Teamsters showed about 60% of its members believed the union should endorse Trump, while 34% supported Vice President Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign on Wednesday touted the endorsement of local Teamsters union chapters in some key battleground states. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is touting the endorsement of local Teamsters union chapters in some key battleground states after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to make an official endorsement in the presidential election on Wednesday. The campaign boasted new endorsements from local Teamsters union chapters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. Some context: The campaign is seeking to reaffirm its union support following the non-endorsement from the union’s leadership. The Teamsters union choosing to not endorse Harris marks the first time since 1996 the union has not endorsed the Democratic nominee for president. Survey data released by the union on Wednesday showed a majority of its members support former President Donald Trump. The House failed on Wednesday to pass a six-month GOP government funding plan that included a controversial measure targeting noncitizen voting, an effort pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The defeat of the bill puts Republican divisions on full display, but creates an opportunity for Speaker Mike Johnson to pivot to a Plan B as a shutdown looms. The House vote was 202 to 220, with 14 Republicans voting against it, two Republicans voting present and three Democrats voting for it. While Johnson has not yet said what his next steps will be, government funding runs out at the end of the month. A “clean” funding extension without the voting provisions attached is widely viewed on Capitol Hill as the only viable option to prevent a shutdown. Meanwhile, Trump is ramping up the pressure for a shutdown if Republicans are unable to pass the voting measure, which is considered a non-starter in the Democrat-led Senate. Johnson, fresh off the defeat on the House floor, told reporters he will “draw up another play” but did not specify what he will do next. Read more on the funding legislation here Vice President Kamala Harris has 50% support among likely voters to 48% for former President Donald Trump in the latest national poll from Fox News, suggesting no clear leader in the race.  Among registered voters, the survey finds Harris and Trump closely matched on who would do a better job bringing needed change (50% Harris to 47% Trump) and making the country safe (50% Trump to 47% Harris). Harris is more often seen as better able to help the middle class (53% Harris to 44% Trump), unite the country (50% Harris to 45% Trump), and fight for people like you (51% Harris to 46% Trump). Trump holds a 5-point advantage as more trusted to handle the economy (51% to 46%) and a 10-point lead on handling immigration (54% to 44%). Harris has the advantage on election integrity (52% to 45%), abortion (56% to 40%) and health care (54% to 43%). The two are even on trust to handle taxes (49% each) and guns (49% Trump to 48% Harris). And Harris is viewed slightly more favorably than Trump, with 49% holding a favorable view of the Vice President and 46% saying the same about the former president. About a third of Harris’ supporters say they back her because they dislike Trump (33%), with 42% saying they support her because they like her record and policies and 24% because they like her character. Among Trump’s supporters, the vast majority, 72%, point to his record and policies, with 19% saying they support him because they dislike Harris and just 8% that they back him because they like his character. This is the first poll from Fox to report a result among likely voters this cycle. The results among registered voters in the current survey are the same (50% Harris to 48% Trump) and are little changed from the near-even 49% Harris to 50% Trump result in the August poll from Fox. The poll was conducted September 13-16 among a random national sample of 1,102 registered voters, including 876 who are likely voters. Results for both the sample of registered voters and likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Iranian hackers sent unsolicited information they stole from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to people who were affiliated with Joe Biden’s campaign over the summer, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. There is no indication that Biden’s staff ever replied, the statement says. A spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said “a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails” and that the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement. The Trump campaign said in a statement that Harris and Biden “must come clean on whether they used the hacked material,” claiming it’s “further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election” to help the Democratic ticket. CNN previously reported that Iranian government-backed hackers stole internal Trump campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The law enforcement statement Wednesday said that the hackers’ efforts to send information to US media outlets have continued. The hack is one of several efforts by the Iranian government attempting to “stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,” the statement said. Law enforcement officials have previously said that those efforts also included an unsuccessful attempt to hack the Biden-Harris campaign.   The Iranian hackers did breach the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff in June, CNN has reported. US officials believe the hackers work for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Investigators believe the suspected Iranian hackers breached Stone’s account and then used that email account to try to break into the account of a senior Trump campaign official as part of a persistent effort to access campaign networks. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Kristen Holmes contributed reporting. This post has been updated with additional details. House lawmakers leading a bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempts into former President Donald Trump said Secret Service officials told them in their closed-door briefing that there did not appear to be “any obvious failures of security and protocols” at Trump’s West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where a second apparent assassination attempt occurred Sunday. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, the top Democrat on the panel, said that assessment is different than the apparent security failures that led to the first assassination attempt of Trump in July at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crow added that Secret Service officials told lawmakers that Trump had the “same security package” from the Secret Service while golfing on Sunday that he did when he was president. Following the Butler assassination attempt, President Joe Biden ordered the Secret Service to provide Trump and Harris with “a presidential level of security,” Crow said. A source familiar with Wednesday’s briefing confirmed that Secret Service officials detailed how Trump and Biden currently receive the same security package, with the exception of specialized assets from other agencies that are reserved only for the commander-in-chief.  Secret Service officials told lawmakers that the security model used to protect Trump on Sunday enabled agents to identify the potential shooter before he gained a clear line of sight at the former president or was able to fire any shots. That security model — which is the same provided by the Secret Service to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — included a protective bubble that moved ahead of Trump on the golf course, sweeping the area and a “shift” that followed behind with the former President, the source said. GOP Rep. Mike Kelly, who chairs the task force, said the panel cannot go to Trump’s International Golf Club for a site visit or take any other official steps on this investigation until the House votes to formally expand the jurisdiction of his panel, which was created to focus specifically on the Butler assassination attempt. Kelly and Crow expect this formality to be handled quickly. CNN has reported that the effort to broaden its jurisdiction is in the works. The panel has already requested a full briefing with the Department of Justice and FBI by the end of this week. This post has been updated with additional reporting. Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday he doesn’t “want to ever be curtailed” by the Secret Service’s security measures following an apparent assassination attempt Sunday. While Trump added that he will “do what the Secret Service wants,” he told reporters at a campaign stop in New York City that he hopes to continue to “lead my life,” including playing golf. The apparent assassination attempt happened as Trump played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Asked by reporters if he feels “hemmed in” by the security protocols, Trump said he does not but insisted, “I just have to lead my life, and I have to make American great again.” Former President Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance on Wednesday amped up his criticism of an immigration parole program that allows Haitian immigrants to legally live and work in Springfield, Ohio, insisting that he will still call them “illegal aliens.” CNN has previously reported, the city of Springfield notes on its website that approximately 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants live in Clark County and that Haitian immigrants are there legally as part of a parole program that allows citizens and lawful residents to apply to have their family members from Haiti come to the United States. Former President Donald Trump did not directly respond when asked Wednesday about Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ swipe at Vice President Kamala Harris for not having biological children. Asked if Harris not having biological children is something for which she should be attacked, Trump said during a campaign stop in New York City: “Well I just don’t know anything about it, really.” Sanders made the comment during a town hall she moderated with Trump in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday. The governor said in introductory remarks that her children offer a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country” and said Harris not having children robs her of “humility.” “My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble,” Sanders said. “You would think after four years of straight failure, she would know a little humility. Unfortunately, she doesn’t.” Former President Donald Trump said he is “probably” going to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he travels to the US next week. Asked by reporters during a campaign stop in New York City on Wednesday if he is going to meet with Zelensky, Trump replied, “Probably, yes.” While Trump and Zelensky spoke on the phone in July, a meeting between the two leaders would mark their first in-person interaction since Trump left the White House. The potential meeting comes amid concerns in Europe about what the Republican presidential nominee’s policy toward the Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win in November. Trump has repeatedly pledged to end the war though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. Zelensky is expected to attend the UN General Assembly in New York next week. Former President Donald Trump said the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ decision to withhold an endorsement in the presidential race was “a great honor,” citing the union’s history of endorsing Democratic presidential candidates in previous elections. During a campaign stop in New York City on Wednesday, Trump celebrated survey data released by Teamsters leadership indicating about 60% of the union’s members supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. “It’s a great honor. They’re not going to endorse the Democrats. That’s a big thing,” he said. “Democrats automatically have the Teamsters. They took a vote, and I guess I was at 60% or more, and that’s a great honor.” “But the vote of the Teamsters themselves was very high for me and the leadership,” he continued. “Sean O’Brien and the group, who are great people, they said, ‘We can’t endorse the Democrats.’ So, I think this is the first time in many decades that they haven’t endorsed Democrats.” The Teamsters last backed a Republican presidential candidate in 1988, with an endorsement of George H.W. Bush.  Trump’s comments come months after Teamsters’ union president Sean O’Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in July. Since then, O’Brien has criticized Trump for comments he made in a virtual event with Elon Musk that O’Brien indicated were hostile to striking workers.   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will stay on the Michigan ballot, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, rejecting his last-ditch attempt to remove his name. The ruling comes about one week after the Michigan Supreme Court similarly decided to keep Kennedy’s name on the state ballot. He filed the federal lawsuit after losing the state case. District Judge Denise Hood argued, in part, that removing Kennedy from the ballot would harm the minor party that nominated him in Michigan, which gave him a spot on the ballot in the first place. Kennedy, who ran as an independent candidate, withdrew from the race last month and threw his support behind former President Donald Trump. Mail-in voting in Michigan is scheduled to start September 26, although ballots for overseas and military voters are required to go out by Saturday. Former President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point could be a politically motivated move. Asked at a campaign stop in New York City for his reaction to the interest rate cut, Trump said it reflects either “the economy is very bad” or the Federal Reserve is “playing politics” with how it sets interest rates.  The Chairman of the National Black Caucus of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is questioning the decision of his union’s senior leadership to withhold an endorsement of a presidential candidate this year. James Curbeam told CNN that he was disappointed Teamsters President Sean O’Brien did not stand up to former President Donald Trump, whom he described as a “bully,” and questioned the polling the union cited to defend it’s decision to not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in nearly three decades. Teamsters said internal polling showed that a majority of its members supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. Curbeam asked, “What is the actual number of people that took part in the polls?” and claimed that “the poll numbers are skewed.” Curbeam said the union’s Black Caucus is doing its own organizing in support of Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris said the rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is “welcome news,” adding her focus is on keeping prices down. In the first rate cut since March 2020, the half-point move paves the way for lower borrowing costs and marks a crucial milestone for the central bank’s historic inflation fight. Harris touted her economic proposal, which includes plans to cut taxes for more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans, affordable housing and the first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.  Harris described her agenda as “the opposite of what Donald Trump would do as President,” before blasting him over his economic plans.  Trump camp responds: Trump’s team is slamming the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates with an election around the corner, suggesting with no evidence the central bank lowered borrowing costs by half a percentage point for political reasons. Asked about the decision’s timing relative to the election, Powell said the Fed applies no political filter to its decisions.   Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Wednesday dismissed the rate cut and blamed Harris’ policies for contributing to inflation and high housing costs. “A half a point is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years,” Vance said in Raleigh, later conceding, “It’s better than nothing.” This post has been updated with additional reporting. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump ramped up pressure on Republicans on Wednesday to shut down the government unless lawmakers can pass a controversial bill targeting non-citizen voting, a move that comes just hours before the House is expected to try, and fail, to pass a six-month funding plan that includes the voting legislation.  Johnson announced earlier in the week that the House will vote Wednesday on the six-month funding extension, which includes the voting measure, known as the SAVE Act. The vote is expected to begin around 7 p.m. ET. Due to Republican opposition, this legislation is expected to fail, leaving Congress in limbo as they scramble to meet the September 30 funding deadline. Some GOP hardliners attacked Johnson’s proposed extension, despite it being tied to the voting bill. Republican Rep. Cory Mills, who also plans to vote against the extension, said he has been “disappointed with the way the 118th Congress has handled this entire session.” “I think that we should have had more policy wins,” he said. “I think the American people would rather see us fight and lose than not fight at all,” Mills added. While Republican Rep. Chip Roy is backing the speaker’s proposal, and criticized his GOP colleagues who are opposing it, he warned that he will not accept Johnson stripping the ban on non-citizens voting from the package.  However, Rep. Steve Womack, a senior Republican appropriator, said he is “not a fan” of allowing a shutdown, despite Trump calling for one. Womack added he is “frustrated,” that they are in this position in the first place. “I think our job is to find a way to make government work for people, and that doesn’t include shuttering its operations,” Womack said. This post has been updated with remarks from lawmakers. The vice presidential candidates – Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz – are attending a Business Roundtable gathering in Washington, DC, on Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the plans.  The appearances will take place at the BRT’s quarterly gathering of its executive members, which has become a common forum for sitting presidents and political candidates to discuss policies like regulation, immigration, and taxes.  Instead of delivering traditional stump speeches, Vance and Walz will each be interviewed separately by one of the Business Roundtable’s member CEOs. The off the record event is meant to serve as a dialogue between the nation’s titans of business and those seeking the highest offices in government. Former President Trump appeared at the organization’s second-quarter meeting in June. A standing invitation to President Biden was transferred to Vice President Harris when she ascended to the top of the ticket, but schedules did not align for her to appear given the intensity of campaign travel. Politico first reported that Vance and Walz are addressing the Business Roundtable. The influential Teamsters union, representing 1.6 million workers and retirees, will not endorse a candidate for president in 2024, the first time the union is remaining neutral in a race in nearly three decades. Harris met with Teamsters leaders on Monday. O’Brien had a primetime speaking slot at this summer’s Republican National Convention but did not appear at the Democratic National Convention the following month.  The Teamsters, which represents truck drivers, freight workers and other workers, is the last major labor union to announce a presidential endorsement. The nation’s other major labor organizations have backed Harris. The Teamsters last backed a Republican presidential candidate in 1988, with an endorsement of George H.W. Bush. The Teamsters did not endorse a candidate in 1996, the last time they sat out a presidential election. Trump’s campaign reacts: After the announcement from the union, the Trump campaign argued the “rank-and-file” members support the former president and cited polling figures released earlier by the Teamsters showing Trump with a wide margin of support. “While the Executive Board of the Teamsters is making no formal endorsement, the vast majority of rank-and-file working men and women in this important organization want President Donald Trump back in the White House,” the Trump campaign said. This post has been updated with comments from the Trump campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Georgia on Friday to deliver remarks on women’s reproductive rights, days after a recent ProPublica report revealed at least two women in the state died after they couldn’t access legal abortions and timely medical care, the campaign confirmed to CNN. A Georgia mother died in 2022 from a treatable infection due to delays to her medical care stemming from the state’s restrictive abortion law, nonprofit news outlet ProPublica reported. Amber Nicole Thurman, 28, discovered she was pregnant with twins shortly after Georgia banned abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy. She tried to schedule a surgical abortion four hours away in North Carolina, but due to traffic, she was late to the appointment and instead had a medication abortion: two pills approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation. ProPublica reported that Thurman experienced a rare complication from the medication. She retained some fetal tissue in her body and needed a dilation and curettage, known as a D&C, to remove it. At a hospital outside Atlanta where Thurman was transported after experiencing heavy bleeding and signs of infection, doctors waited to perform the procedure. Thurman died during surgery.  A maternal mortality review committee said there was “a good chance” that Thurman’s death was preventable if she’d had a D&C sooner, ProPublica reported.  ProPublica’s report also detailed another death that Georgia’s review committee called “preventable.” Candi Miller, a 41-year-old mother with several chronic conditions, died in 2022 after she experienced rare, treatable complications from a medication abortion. According to ProPublica, Miller’s family told a coroner she did not seek care because of laws around pregnancy and abortion. CNN has sought comment from Miller’s family. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday slammed Donald Trump over immigration proposals in an appeal to Latino voters, warning of “mass deportations” and “massive detention camps” if the former president returns to office. A key demographic: Harris’ remarks come as she seeks to court the key demographic by drawing contrasts on the most controversial issues among voters. She outlined the “two very different visions” of the campaigns as she highlighted her policies including her “opportunity economy” agenda and health care. She railed against Trump’s stance on women’s reproductive rights, emphasizing nearly two dozen states now have restrictive abortion bans and pointed to the impact it has had on the Latino community.  “In more than 20 states, we have a Trump abortion ban, which criminalized health care providers in one state, providing prison for life…Many of these Trump abortion bans today, 40% of Latinas in America live in the state where the Trump abortion ban is,” Harris said. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in the Biden era after the White House spent the last three years grappling with Americans’ dissatisfaction with the cost of living, raising new questions about the health of the economy and the impact on voters at the ballot box. The move is fresh vindication for President Joe Biden, whose pandemic-era agenda ushered in trillions of dollars in government spending — which, when coupled with strong demand for goods, supply chain snarls and Russia’s war with Ukraine — drove inflation to a four-decade high. The half-percentage-point cut could indicate the elusive “soft landing” — experts’ favored term for raising borrowing costs to slow economic activity while avoiding severe joblessness — has been reached. Biden, who has publicly touted the Fed’s policy independence, will speak at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, on Thursday and likely tout an economy that’s come full circle in four years. But it could also suggest the economy, which is showing signs of stress, is in need of a jolt. Although most mainstream economists agree a recession is not around the corner, they also suggest the economy is not out of the woods yet. Read more about what voters are saying. This post has been updated with news of the rate cut. A set of new post-debate surveys from Quinnipiac University show Kamala Harris with a modest advantage over Donald Trump among likely voters in battleground Michigan and Pennsylvania, with no clear leader in the race in Wisconsin. With third party candidates included, Harris takes 51% to Trump’s 45% in Pennsylvania. In Michigan, she takes 50% to Trump’s 45%. In Wisconsin, Harris takes 48% to Trump’s 47%, with no clear leader between the two. The results are similar when looking at head-to-head matchups between just Harris and Trump in each state. Surveys from other outlets released in September have found either no clear leader or an edge for Harris in all three states. The Quinnipiac polls find Michigan and Pennsylvania likely voters closely divided over which candidate would do a better job handling the economy. In both states, 50% say Trump and 48% Harris. In Wisconsin, Trump has a slight edge on the issue, 51% to 47%. Likely voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin also give Trump an advantage over Harris on immigration: 50% to 46% in Pennsylvania, and 52% to 45% in Wisconsin. Michigan voters, however, are closely split with 49% saying Trump and 48% Harris. Majorities in all three states – 57% in Pennsylvania, 53% in Michigan and 53% in Wisconsin – trust Harris over Trump on abortion. About the polling: The Quinnipiac University polls were conducted September 12 through 16 and surveyed: Senate races in Montana and Ohio stand out as especially challenging contests this year for Democrats, defending a pair of veteran incumbents who are seeking reelection in states that former President Donald Trump won twice. Both contests rank in the top three among all Senate races in ad spending to date, and in future ad reservations. And dozens of new ads have hit the airwaves in these contests over the last week, reflecting key messaging strategies seen in top races across the country. Here’s a rundown of some of the recent activity in both races: Montana: Montana looms as one of the most challenging Senate races for Democrats, defending incumbent Sen. Jon Tester in the reliably red state with a thin Senate majority on the line, and advertising money from both parties is flooding the state. All advertisers have combined to spend more than $111 million since the primary on June 4, and Democrats have outspent Republicans by about $60.3 million to $50.7 million. Tester’s campaign leads in ad spending, having spent more than $24 million during that stretch, while a top GOP outside group, One Nation, ranks second at $14.2 million, and a pro-Tester super PAC, Last Best Place PAC, ranks third at $13.3 million. GOP nominee Tim Sheehy’s campaign has spent about $4.5 million on ad so far. Five new ads went up this week, including two today, and twelve new ads have hit Montana airwaves just since last Friday, a pace matched by few other 2024 contests. Ohio: Besides Tester, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is the only other Democratic incumbent seeking reelection in a state that Trump won twice, and his reelection contest is drawing more ad dollars than any other 2024 Senate race. Since the primary on March 19 and today, Ohio voters have seen more than $200 million worth of Senate advertising, and the parties are running about even – including campaigns and outside groups, Republicans have spent about $105.7 million, and Democrats have spent about $101.2 million. Six new ads from the Senate race have hit Ohio airwaves this week, and four more began airing over the weekend. The voting process in the November election is already starting. Mail ballots will be sent out to voters who request them in Wisconsin beginning on Thursday. Both presidential candidates have been dedicating a lot of time on the campaign trail in the battleground state — and it will likely be a “photo finish,” the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party said. Wisconsin was decided by about 20,000 votes in 2020. “I’m confident that everyone who casts a ballot will know that their ballot will be counted. The question is how many folks can we make sure cast ballots for (Kamala) Harris because Wisconsin is the land of the nail-biter,” Ben Wikler said. He said with just 48 days until Election Day, Democrats in the state are ramping up efforts to get their message out by organizing volunteer shifts, pushing for donations and calling voters on the phone. A hollowed-out state party apparatus. An off-kilter campaign by the governor. A botched redistricting plan that squeezed out incumbent House members. New York Democrats offered a wide array of excuses for their disastrous 2022 midterms, when Republicans flipped four seats outside New York City on their way to winning a narrow US House majority. Less than two months out from the 2024 general election, the state party, its campaign season allies, chastened candidates and Gov. Kathy Hochul are betting on what most describe as a revitalized political project – a series of them, in fact – to help the state deliver Democratic majority-makers, particularly from suburban districts, to the House next year. Former President Donald Trump’s Wednesday rally on Long Island, in Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito’s district, underscores the high stakes of the New York contests. D’Esposito is one of five New York GOP freshmen facing an onslaught from Democrats determined to claw back suburban voters. In 2022, he defeated Democrat Laura Gillen, flipping a district where Joe Biden would have routed Trump in 2020 under the current lines. Gillen is back for a rematch this year. Reps. Marc Molinaro and Mike Lawler in the Hudson Valley, Nick LaLota on Long Island and Brandon Williams in Central New York are the other Republicans facing tough reelection fights in what is still largely blue state that Kamala Harris is expected to win comfortably. Read the full story. With just 48 days until Election Day, former President Donald Trump is traveling to deeply blue Uniondale, New York, for his first large-scale rally since the second apparent assassination attempt on his life this weekend.   While Trump lost the Empire State by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020, he insists he has a “real chance of winning” New York in November.  Trump advisers described the visit as being somewhat steeped in nostalgia. The former president has long wanted to hold another large-scale rally in New York, his initial hometown, even more so after his event in the Bronx this May drew thousands of supporters.  “He’s always wanted to do a New York rally, in an arena,” one senior Trump adviser told CNN. Months ago, discussions over whether Trump would potentially host a political event at Madison Square Garden percolated within Trump’s campaign — initiated by the former president — though there were logistical problems that made doing so unfeasible. Despite the state not being a battleground, Trump’s advisers argue there’s merit to visiting Long Island, noting its large immigrant population as well as it being home to many blue-collar, working class voters and small business owners that the campaign is eager to court in the weeks leading up to November 5. New York is also home to several key US House races that could determine control of the chamber in the next Congress. Senate Minority Whip John Thune said he disagrees with former President Donald Trump’s call to reverse a cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), something that hit blue states hard and was part of a 2017 tax bill up for renewal next year. Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, said the changes to SALT were used to offset the price tag of the 2017 tax bill and will be needed for the same reason in 2025. Trump and congressional Republicans included the so-called SALT cap, which limits Americans’ ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal returns to $10,000, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to pay for other tax cuts in the law. It largely affects higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions, but its unpopularity has led some GOP representatives in those states to call for its elimination as the party seeks to hold onto the House in this year’s election. “I’m a supporter of what we did in ’17 and would like to see it extended,” Thune said when asked about his personal position on the issue. CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed reporting to this post. Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance is attending a fundraiser in Washington, DC, on Wednesday evening with several fellow senators and lawmakers, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.  House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, along with Sens. Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, Rick Scott, John Barrasso, Tom Cotton, Marsha Blackburn, Chuck Grassley, Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lee and Bill Hagerty are listed as special guests, as well as several other senators. Other attendees: Several Republican Senate candidates are also attending including Kari Lake, Dave McCormick, Sam Brown, Rep. Jim Banks, Hung Cao and Bernie Moreno.  The Trump 47 event is hosted by the Associated Builders and Contractors, Deecy Gray, Jeff Miller and Marty Obst. House Speaker Mike Johnson would not reveal what he will do if his government funding plan fails Wednesday night and said he has spoken Donald Trump “a lot” about government funding after the former president floated a government shutdown.  Trump has said that if Republicans don’t receive “absolute assurances” on election security, they should not pass a funding extension. Asked by CNN if he would listen to Trump, Johnson said, “President Trump and I have talked a lot about this. We talked a lot about it with our colleagues who are building consensus on the plan.” “We all believe that election security is of preeminent importance right now,” Johnson said.  Johnson vowed to bring his spending bill to the floor regardless of its doomed fate as more than ten GOP members have already indicated they will not support it. “We’ll see what happens with the bill. All right, we’re on the field in the middle of the game. The quarterback’s calling the play. We’re going to run the play. I’m very confident,” the speaker said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed former President Donald Trump Wednesday for announcing he would support reversing a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, ahead of Trump’s Wednesday rally on Long Island, an area that was hit hard by the cap that the former president signed into law as part of a major tax bill in 2017. The New York Democrat warned Trump won’t go through with his pledge if he wins back the White House: “It’s comical, unserious and shows the lack of integrity that this man has. His promises carry as much weight as Monopoly money.”  “I’ve been a loud proponent of eliminating the SALT cap from the start. As long as I’m leader, I’ll do everything I can to make sure these caps expire at the end of next year,” Schumer said. Trump and congressional Republicans included the so-called SALT cap, which limits a taxpayer’s state and local tax deduction to $10,000, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to pay for other tax cuts in the law. It largely affects higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions, but its unpopularity has led some GOP representatives in those states to call for its elimination as the party seeks to hold onto the House in this year’s election. Republican Rep. Mike Waltz, a member of the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump, told CNN’s Manu Raju that he wants to hear how the Secret Service will adjust to prioritize Trump’s protection during today’s briefing. He added that they are “open” to the idea of sending additional funding to the Secret Service, but said the agency needs to make more changes to their operating procedures.  Pressed on whether future funding could be folded into this round of government funding, Waltz said that the Secret Service should focus on making internal changes, with or without new resources. “I think the changes Secret Service need to happen clearly yesterday, and so that’s what we’ll be, that’s what we’ll be looking for,” he said. “And those can shift internally. Mayorkas can shift agents; he can shift from HSI, he can shift from TSA, if he even had to. But if you’ve got lower threat protectees, then pull the agents onto your highest threat protectee, which is clearly Donald Trump.” Representatives from both Vice President Kamala Harris’ and former President Trump’s transition teams met with the White House Transition Coordinating Committee this week for the first time. The meeting was led by White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. It was not immediately clear which aides from the transition teams were present. Who is on the committee: The White House’s transition coordinating committee is comprised of several top administration officials, including the White House chief of staff, General Services Administration administrator, director of National Intelligence, director of the Office of Management and Budget and National Security adviser, among others. House Speaker Mike Johnson is keeping his members in the dark about a Plan B, as his first proposal to extend government funding is expected to fail on the House floor this evening. However, Republicans are warning that Congress must avoid a shutdown ahead of the election.  “We’re going to have a vote, see what happens, and then ultimately, obviously, if it fails, then obviously the speaker is going to have to, have to recalibrate. But bottom line is, there’s not going to be a shutdown,” GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told CNN’s Manu Raju. “We are 47 days away from an election. There’s not going to be a shutdown.”  Pressed on former President Donald Trump’s argument that they should shut down the government if they cannot tie the funding extension to a bill banning non-citizens from voting, Lawler maintained that they would avoid a shutdown.  Rep. Mark Alford of Missouri, another freshman Republican, pushed back on his colleagues that have agreed with Trump about allowing a possible shutdown, warning that a shutdown is “not a winner for the Republicans.” Haiti clearly holds a place in the heart of Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. He’s been to the country at least 25 times with his wife, he said at a news conference Monday in Springfield. He respects the Haitians who have come to the US legally and found work in Springfield. Further, DeWine said the Haitians found Springfield because business owners there were having trouble finding workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. But while he is defending the Haitians legally working in Springfield with Temporary Protected Status due to violence and a humanitarian crisis after storms and an earthquake there, DeWine wants to separate them from the larger immigration and border debate fueling the Republican political argument in 2024. “The immigration issue, and the border issue, obviously, is fair game,” DeWine said in the PBS interview, and it’s a refrain he has repeated in press conferences and interviews in recent days. And on this point, there seems to be an ocean of disconnect between Republican leaders in Ohio, who argue that Haitians filled a desperate need in Springfield, and Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who argue, as Vance did, that “thousands of residents have had their lives destroyed” by the arrival of the Haitians. Like DeWine, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue has also tried very hard to correct the record on the role Haitians are playing in Springfield. Read the full analysis piece here. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday defended his inclusion of the SAVE Act, a controversial measure that targets non-citizen voting, as part of a government funding plan and did not say what a plan B might look like to avert a shutdown. When asked about whether his Plan B would be to push a clean funding extension and work with Democrats, Johnson responded, “I don’t talk about Plan B. … I’m the quarterback on the field running the play, OK? I gotta focus on that down the field.” Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is running digital ads in Michigan touting the vice president’s concern for Palestinian civilians, part of an intense fight to sway a key demographic in the critical battleground state. Atop the video reads, in all caps text, “VP HARRIS WILL NOT BE SILENT ABOUT HUMAN SUFFERING IN GAZA.”  Another one of the ads features more clips of Harris criticizing the deaths of Palestinian civilians. “What happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.” They’re the first ads from the Harris campaign that have mentioned the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The ads began running this week, and disclosure data from Google shows the campaign has spent only a few hundred dollars running each spot – small numbers in a presidential campaign seeing hundreds of millions in ad spending, but still enough to precisely target key voters, and with extremely low production costs. That fight escalated last week, when a GOP-linked super PAC launched its own highly targeted digital advertising campaign also aimed at Michigan, featuring anti-semitic advertisements highlighting the Jewish faith of Harris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, and touting Harris’ support for Israel. FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday that the FBI is working “around the clock” to investigate the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump on Sunday.  Where things stand in the probe: The FBI is leading the investigation into the 58-year-old man who authorities believe planning to attack the former president while he played golf at his West Palm Beach course over the weekend. The man, Ryan Wesley Routh, is facing two federal gun charges.   Wray said that the bureau’s investigation is “very much ongoing,” and stressed “we have dedicated the full force of the FBI to this investigation.” Those investigative efforts include resources like tactical support, evidence response teams and forensic scientists, he said.  The Harris campaign on Wednesday launched a new ad focused on Asian American voters in swing states as it seeks to court the key voting bloc. The ad, titled “My Mother,” features Vice President Kamala Harris’ remarks at the Democratic National Convention paying tribute to her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and immigrated to the US in 1958. “So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. Because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice,” the ad continued. The campaign believes the demographic is a key part of their winning coalition in November and plans an aggressive outreach in coming weeks, including Asian American voter engagement staff in every swing state and paid media. The campaign also unveiled a fact sheet outlining Harris’ and Gov. Tim Walz’s plans for AANPHI communities. The 60-second slot will air across an assortment of digital channels and nearly 70 different broadcast outlets. This marks the campaign’s third ad targeting Asian American communities in the last month and is part of the Harris campaign’s $370 million investment in digital and television reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. Members of the task force investigating the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump will be briefed by the US Secret Service Wednesday afternoon, according to an aide.  On Tuesday, the FBI searched the home of Ryan Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt, in Hawaii. The Harris campaign launched a new ad highlighting women’s reproductive freedoms featuring Hadley Duvall, a reproductive rights advocate and rape survivor. The ad, titled “Monster,” is narrated in first-person by Duvall, who describes becoming pregnant after her stepfather raped her at age 12 after years of sexual abuse.  “I just remember thinking I have to get out of my skin. I can’t be me right now. Like, this can’t be it. I didn’t know what to do. I was a child. I didn’t know what it meant to be pregnant, at all. But I had options,” Duvall said in the ad. On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris posted about Duvall while also blasting Trump over abortion policies.  “After a violation of their bodies, survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens to them next—all because of Trump Abortion Bans. This is immoral. Women and girls like Hadley deserve better,” Harris posted on X. The ad’s soundtrack notably includes Billie Eilish’s song, “When the Party’s Over” — a day after the pop megastar said she will be “voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy.”  Acting United States Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has made a concerted effort to put himself front and center after Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt at former President Donald Trump’s Florida golf course, as he makes his pitch — both publicly and privately — for Congress to provide his agency with more resources. But lawmakers are still contending with whether the Secret Service is underfunded or simply mismanaged, and many have questions about what meaningful security improvements can be made 48 days before the presidential election to an organization under whose watch two apparent assassination attempts have occurred against a former president roughly 60 days apart. Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said his panel has asked the Secret Service to “get creative” in its requests for additional resources, adding that “they can’t hire new Secret Service agents to make a difference between now and the inauguration.” Murphy said that Senate appropriators have asked the agency to look at additional overtime costs as one option, and that the Secret Service has “come to us with some good ideas,” citing technology like drones. One possibility being discussed, according to sources, is to include additional funding to the government funding extension, which needs to pass by September 30. Senate appropriators and the Biden administration are in talks about how much money to add to the upcoming stopgap bill for USSS, telling CNN it could be “hundreds of millions of dollars” to plus-up their budget, or it could be language allowing the agency to spend its existing money faster. There is an uneasiness, however, about providing more money to an agency — whose budget has increased in the past decade — that has not been fully held accountable or shown that the issues that led to both apparent assassination attempts have been fixed. Read the full story. One of the best pollsters in America recently came out with its latest survey, and it’s good news for Kamala Harris. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., found Donald Trump at 47% to the vice president’s 43% — within the margin of error — in a state the former president has twice won comfortably. (The poll was conducted last week, before Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump.) While the Hawkeye State is unlikely to be pivotal in November, the fact that Selzer found a close race in a state Trump has dominated could signal good things for Harris, both in terms of the accuracy of polling and for her chances in next-door Wisconsin. What makes the Selzer survey so important is that it’s been accurate in an era when other pollsters have struggled. Four years ago, it had Trump up in Iowa by 7 points days before the election, when other polls had Democrat Joe Biden in a much better position. I noted at the time that “this one poll is giving Trump backers hope and Democrats anxiety.” Democrats had good reason to worry. Not only did Trump end up winning Iowa by 8 points, he also vastly outperformed his polling in Wisconsin — nearly winning a state where he had trailed by high single-digits in pre-election polling. Trump would do significantly better in many other battleground states as well. Read the full analysis here. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week and labeled India a “very big abuser” when it comes to trade with the United States as he spoke about his vision for a reciprocal trade policy. Trump added that countries like India, Brazil and China are “at the top of their game and they use it against us.” Michigan voters were able to ask questions at the town hall, all of which teed up Trump to talk about his policy promises. When a retired nurse asked how he would bring down the price of food and groceries, Trump said, “We have to start always with energy,” pledging to bring down Americans’ energy bills by 50% within his first year if elected. “Interest rates are going to follow,” he said, adding, “actually they’re going to follow for another reason.” Trump also referenced an expected interest rate cut announcement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. “The economy is now not good, and interest rates, you’ll see they’ll do the rate cut and all the political stuff tomorrow, I think. And you know, will he do a half a point? Will he do a quarter of a point? But the reason is because the economy is not good. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to do it,” Trump said. Trump also acknowledged his rambling speaking style and pushed back on Vice President Kamala Harris’ jab during last week’s debate that people leave during his rallies. “You know, when she said that, well, your rallies, people leave. Honestly, nobody does. And if I saw them leaving, I’d say, and ladies and gentlemen, make America great again, now get the hell out. OK, because I don’t want people leaving,” Trump told a hockey arena full of supporters in Flint, Michigan. Last week in Philadelphia, Harris said people leave Trump’s rallies early “out of exhaustion and boredom,” which prompted Trump to defend his campaign events and then pivot to making false claims about immigrants eating pets in Ohio. Trump acknowledged to the Michigan crowd that he uses “long, sometimes very complex sentences and paragraphs,” but he said “they come all together.” Real estate investor Steve Witkoff, who was golfing with Trump, further detailed to CNN’s Kaitlin Collins a dramatic moment-by-moment recounting of seeing various teams of Secret Service agents spring into action simultaneously after shots were heard near the golf course.  One group of agents rushed to secure Trump, Witkoff said.  Witkoff said another group of agents worked to secure the perimeter around Trump to ensure there were no additional threats around the former president.  “There were two snipers who were next to me — they were probably three yards away from me, with their tripods on the ground,” Witkoff said. At times agents were laying on the ground to stabilize their weapons for a better aim at the possible shooter, he said, and also repositioned themselves inside a golf cart to try to get “a better shot” at the apparent assassin.  A final group of agents moved forward to where the suspected gunman was located “to engage with him,” Witkoff told Collins. Voters want more from Kamala Harris. But while the Democratic nominee has been clear about what she is not — Donald Trump — she is unwilling or unable to spell out a comprehensive blueprint for exactly what she would do as the 47th president. In an interview on Tuesday, the vice president mostly stuck to broad themes about her economic plan that were largely familiar from a previous big-picture policy speech and her convention address. But a candidate criticized by opponents for running on “vibes” and surfing a wave of joy refused to be pinned down on specifics and details, instead citing her values and background to attest to her sincerity. When asked how she’d alleviate the “squeeze” many Americans feel over child and elder care, she said her plan was for no family to pay more than 7% of their income on such costs. But she offered no roadmap for how she’d drive major social policy reform through what is likely to be a polarized Congress next year and didn’t say how she’d pay for it. On the Israel-Hamas war, Harris was strong on aspiration, vague on specifics and seemed to fall on both sides of the issue. It may be unrealistic to expect Harris, a member of an incumbent administration, to break with Biden over the war. And she’s got no power to stop it herself. But her hedging and repetitive soundbites in recent weeks show little evidence of new ideas. Read the full analysis. A week after President Barack Obama won reelection in November 2012, JD Vance, then a law student at Yale, wrote a scathing rebuke of the Republican Party’s stance on migrants and minorities. He criticized the Party’s stance for being “openly hostile to non-whites” and for alienating “Blacks, Latinos, (and) the youth.” Four years later, as Vance considered a career in Republican politics, he asked a former college professor to delete the article. That professor, Brad Nelson, taught Vance at Ohio State University while Vance was an undergraduate student. After Vance graduated, Nelson asked him to contribute to a blog he ran for the nonpartisan Center for World Conflict and Peace. Nelson told CNN that during the 2016 Republican primary he agreed to delete the article at Vance’s request, so that he might have an easier time getting a job in Republican politics. However, the article, titled “A Blueprint for the GOP,” remains viewable on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. More background: Vance has spread and defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio. Asked to support his claims in an interview with CNN, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening — though he didn’t provide the evidence.

Here’s where the presidential contenders and their running mates will be this week: Trump: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, today. GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump will hold another rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Saturday, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. Harris: Harris will deliver remarks Wednesday at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s (CHCI) 47th Annual Leadership Conference. Later today, “Young Voters for Harris-Walz” will hold a “national youth organizing call” with the vice president. Tomorrow, Harris will participate in a “Unite for America” livestream with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. Harris’ running mate Tim Walz was in Georgia and North Carolina earlier this week. This post has been updated with new details on Harris’ schedule."
Analysis: Harris isn’t giving the specifics some undecided voters say they want | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 AM EDT, Wed September 18, 2024",2024-09-18T04:00:19.566Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/politics/harris-policy-specifics-analysis/index.html,"Voters want more from Kamala Harris. But while the Democratic nominee has been clear about what she is not — Donald Trump — she is either unwilling or unable to spell out a comprehensive blueprint for exactly what she would do as the 47th president. In an interview on Tuesday, the vice president mostly stuck to broad themes and headlines about her economic plan that were largely familiar from a previous big-picture policy speech and her convention address. But a candidate who has been criticized by opponents for running on “vibes” and surfing a wave of joy refused to be pinned down on specifics and details, instead citing her values and background to attest to her sincerity. For instance, when asked at Tuesday’s National Association of Black Journalists event how she’d alleviate the “squeeze” many Americans feel over child and elder care, she said her plan was for no family to pay more than 7% of their income on such costs. But she offered no roadmap for how she’d drive major social policy reform through what is likely to be a polarized Congress next year and didn’t say how she’d pay for it. On another intractable issue, the Israel-Hamas war, Harris was strong on aspiration, vague on specifics and seemed to fall on both sides of the issue. “I absolutely believe that this war has to end. And it has to end as soon as possible,” she said. “And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And we are working around the clock to achieve that end.” She added: “Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” Few would quarrel with her diagnosis of the situation, but the US has been pursuing the mirage of a deal for months. There’s no sign Israel and Hamas want an agreement. And after months of failed diplomacy, the White House seems to be taking a breather. It may be unrealistic to expect Harris, a member of an incumbent administration, to break with Biden over the war. And she’s got no power to stop it herself. But her hedging and repetitive soundbites in recent weeks show little evidence of new ideas. While her debate performance last week projected strength, Harris is not usually a gifted political athlete in spontaneous, high-pressure media sitdowns like ex-President Bill Clinton, for instance. And it doesn’t come naturally to her to drill down deep into policy questions like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. This makes her vulnerable to attacks by the Trump campaign and conservative media that her “word salads” mean she’s not up to being president – even if Trump often communicates in a scattershot stream of consciousness and is spreading dangerous falsehoods. This all raises two key questions. Does it matter that Harris is hardly a policy wonk? And is it really likely that this most unusual of elections will turn on something as conventional as a policy platform? Harris is, after all, offering herself as a fleeting chance for Americans to escape the bitterness and division of the Trump years. Her success in triggering the former president in their debate was in service of her primary goal – exposing his wild behavior and showing that he’s unfit for the Oval Office. The days when presidential elections were decided by chunky policy speeches – if they ever existed – have been swept away in the social media era and by the sound and fury epitomized by the Republican nominee. And since Harris is a last-minute replacement for President Joe Biden, it’s not surprising she lacks a long-established policy shop pumping out programs. Issues matter, but elections also involve less defined, more emotive choices. While Trump’s voters might buy into his hardline rhetoric on immigration, their bond with their candidate is often anchored in an instinctive sense that he understands them and will protect them. The vice president’s success may not be confined to her policy stances on issues like abortion – though these are critical – but a sense that a different, more optimistic future is within reach with her at the top of the Democratic ticket. And the presidency, more than any other high office, tests temperament as much as policy gravitas. Even so, voters looking for a more granular approach may be disappointed with the Democratic nominee. The list of policies recently added to the Harris campaign website is rudimentary. And good luck working out whether she’d break with Biden in handling the world’s most pressing crises — from the war in Ukraine, to China’s superpower challenge and Iran’s nuclear program. The vice president is yet to give a major foreign policy address since becoming the Democratic nominee — a concern for voters who wonder how she’d lead the free world. Harris’ reluctance to plunge into a round of major media interviews or town hall events – and her preference for friendly social media influencers and local media – is only adding to the opacity about her views. But she’s not running in a vacuum – her undisciplined opponent is hardly a policy wonk. Trump would often switch his administration’s priorities on the fly and often seems to care more about himself than ideology. And Harris might be smart to avoid taking positions that could scare off disaffected Republicans and moderate suburban voters she’s seeking to win over. Already, arch conservatives like former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who see Trump as an existential threat to the republic, have found a way to endorse the Democratic nominee. Still, recent polls show that the vice president has a window of opportunity to court voters who want to learn more about her. And many want details about how she’d ease their economic worries, including from high prices. A New York Times/Siena College poll before last week’s presidential debate showed that 28% of likely voters wanted to know more about Harris and just 9% said the same about the ex-president. And voters in the handful of swing states that will decide the election are also telling CNN that while they were impressed with her debate performance, they still need more specifics. “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” Linda Rooney, who voted for ex-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary, told CNN’s John King last week. Rooney, from the Philadelphia suburbs, doesn’t want to vote for Trump but voiced concern over the Democratic nominee’s positions on fracking and other issues. Antonio Munoz, a veteran and retired police officer who owns a taco bar in Nevada, is leaning toward Harris but is frustrated that she’s not done more to detail her vows to help small businesses. “I’ve been checking her website and you read it, but it’s not specific,” Munoz told King. “We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses. … She needs to be more direct.” A lack of specifics may give Trump less to attack. But the risk is that leaves Harris without a strong defense. She’s getting criticized every day by negative ads in battleground states mocking her as an architect of unpopular “Bidenomics.” She might be promising to crack down on supposed price gouging by supermarkets, but she skipped over the issue preoccupying millions of Americans in her Tuesday interview in Philadelphia and pivoted to another message. “Is the price of groceries still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular, turning the page on an era that, sadly, has shown us attempts by some to incite fear, to create division in our country,” Harris said. The vice president did tout her plan to offer a $50,000 tax deduction to spur small business start-ups, her proposal to increase the child tax credit to $6,000 and a push to increasing housing stock and provide assistance to first-time homebuyers. Yet as she often does, she spoke in generalities rather than offering step-by-step plans. And that’s exactly how it should be, according to the only other female presidential nominee of a major party. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton scoffed at demands for endless policy plans from Harris. “She does not have to do it. I am going to just cut to the chase,” Clinton told the “On with Kara Swisher” podcast, released on Monday. “Policy details are not going to do it,” Clinton said. “I put out more policies than I think anybody ever has … and I talked about the economy every day, but literally after the election, I was told that I never talked about the economy. Campaign policy is really about showing you can govern with your values in a way that can improve people’s lives.” Clinton said Harris’ principal message was the right one, namely that “I am going to help you, I am going to protect you, I am going to try to provide opportunities for you.”"
Microsoft says Russian operatives are ramping up attacks on Harris campaign with fake videos | CNN Politics,"Published 3:00 PM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T19:00:34.917Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/microsoft-russian-operatives-harris/index.html,"Microsoft said Tuesday that Russian operatives have in recent weeks intensified their online attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign by producing and disseminating videos promoting “outlandish conspiracy theories” aimed at stoking US racial and political divisions. One of the inauthentic videos, which Microsoft said had been viewed millions of times, claimed to show Harris supporters attacking an attendee of a Donald Trump rally. Another video falsely claimed that Harris paralyzed a young girl in a 2011 hit-and-run accident. Russian operatives promoted the latter story through a website pretending to be a local San Francisco media outlet, Microsoft researchers said. Both videos were still accessible on X as of Tuesday afternoon, with one post of the video garnering 1.5 million views on its own. CNN has requested comment from the social media platform. The report is the latest evidence that Kremlin-linked trolls and digital operatives are ramping up their efforts to denigrate Harris’s campaign just weeks before the presidential election. US intelligence agencies warned in July that Russia planned to “covertly use social media” to try to sway public opinion and undermine support for Ukraine in swing states. Russia’s preferences for the presidential race haven’t shifted since 2020 or 2016, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations aimed at denigrating Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, respectively, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. CNN has requested comment on the Microsoft report from the Harris-Walz campaign and from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. There was an initial period after Biden withdrew from the presidential race in July when Russian influence operations“struggled to pivot” to find new ways to target the Democratic ticket, according to Microsoft. But then, in late August and early September, the videos attacking Harris and her supporters emerged. “The shift to focusing on the Harris-Walz campaign reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived vulnerabilities in the new candidates,” Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said in a blog post. The research comes amid a flurry of US government action aimed at blunting Russian disinformation efforts targeting American voters in the final stretches of the presidential campaign. The State Department last week declassified intelligence alleging that Russian state-run media outlet RT has become fully integrated into Russia’s intelligence operations around the world, including those targeting elections. That followed an indictment unsealed by the Justice Department that accused two RT employees of funneling nearly $10 million into a US company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media, to create and amplify content that aligned with Russian interests. US social media giant Meta on Monday announced a ban on RT over the Russian network’s “foreign interference activity.” Iran has been the other foreign power that has actively tried to shape the US presidential campaign, according to US intelligence officials. Tehran has conducted a covert social media activity in an effort to undercut Trump’s candidacy, US officials have said. Iranian government-backed hackers have also targeted the Trump campaign with a hack-and-leak of internal campaign documents to US media outlets, according to a statement from the FBI and other agencies."
Analysis: Vance warns calling a candidate a ‘fascist’ can lead to violence but doesn’t mention that’s what Trump calls Harris | CNN Politics,"Updated 6:10 PM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T17:26:37.733Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/jd-vance-kamala-harris-fascist/index.html,"In the wake of the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on Sunday, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, argued in a speech in Georgia on Monday that the two recent attempts to kill Trump are evidence that “the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out; somebody’s going to get hurt by it.” Moments prior, Vance had criticized a Democratic congressman for saying last year that Trump must be “eliminated.” (The congressman apologized for a “poor choice of words,” saying he had been trying to talk about how Trump must be defeated in the election.) And Vance said: “Look, we can disagree with one another, we can debate one another, but we cannot tell the American people that one candidate is a fascist and if he’s elected it is going to be the end of American democracy.” What Vance didn’t mention was that Trump has repeatedly told the American people that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is a fascist whose election would mean the end of the country itself. In fact, Trump called Harris a fascist at least twice last week alone. “She’s a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist,” Trump said at an Arizona rally on Thursday. “This is a radical-left, Marxist, communist, fascist,” Trump said while attacking Harris at a news conference on Friday. This wasn’t new rhetoric. “We have a fascist person running who’s incompetent,” Trump told Virginia residents during a campaign stop in August; at an Arizona rally in August, Trump said the true divide in American politics is between patriots with traditional values and “these far-left fascists led by Harris and her group.” And Trump has gone beyond saying that electing Harris would mean an end to American democracy. He has said this summer that electing Harris would mean “you’re not going to have a country anymore” and that “we’re not going to have a country left.” A Vance spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNN’s request on Tuesday to explain whether Vance is calling on Trump to tone down his language, and, if not, what Vance sees as the difference between Trump’s words and the words from “the left” he was denouncing. Vance argued in his Monday speech that there is not a “both-sides problem.” He said that while he acknowledges conservatives do not “always get things exactly right,” he said that the fact that “no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months” demonstrates that the issue of incendiary rhetoric about presidential candidates is a one-side-only concern. But Harris has faced violent threats for years, including in recent months. In August alone, a Virginia man and a Tennessee man were separately charged with making death threats against her."
Economic worries boost Trump’s Hispanic support in battleground Nevada | CNN Politics,"Updated 12:20 PM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T16:04:11.321Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/nevada-hispanic-voters-trump-harris/index.html,"The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand. It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson. But it is also a reminder of a major economic and political issue here. Rents are on the rise, and starter homes are scarce. The wealthy can find what they want – or build it – but working-class families face a housing crunch. “Prices are extremely high – the highest they’ve ever been,” Sanchez said in an interview. “And with interest rates being really high, the affordability is not there for a lot of people.” Sanchez says a Federal Reserve interest rate cut would help, and she is counting on one soon not only to help her business and local families but also her candidate for president: Kamala Harris. “She’s a very smart lady,” Sanchez said of the vice president. “She talks to me. She just says everything that I need to hear.” That’s coming from a self-described Reagan Republican who hopes to one day soon vote GOP for president again. But not with Donald Trump atop the ticket. “I’ve never liked anything about him,” Sanchez said of the former president. “Nothing. The way he speaks. What he represents.  … You know, that we immigrants are the worst. That we are coming from mental institutions and jails and everything else. Which is not true.” Trump narrowly lost Nevada in both 2016 and 2020. Sanchez concedes she hears more support for him this time among Latino voters, especially men. “I want to understand it,” she said. “And I can’t. I realty can’t. … I think it is kind of a macho thing.” When we first met last December, Sanchez was ready to vote a second time for Joe Biden, mostly because of her animus toward Trump. Now, she says she is excited to vote for Harris. “If we get to elect the first women president, I mean, I just get chills to witness history,” she said. Sanchez is confident, insisting the energy she sees for Harris outweighs the increased Trump talk among fellow Hispanics. “I know that Hispanics have made a difference in a lot of elections, and I can see it right now,” Sanchez said. Rogelio Regalado and Rafael Cerros Jr. are not so sure. Close friends, Regalado and Cerros took a risk in 2020 – in the middle of the pandemic – and launched a local radio station, Fiesta 98.1. Their little startup is now No. 2 in a competitive Vegas Spanish language market. Cerros works the business side and says he is undecided in the presidential race at the moment. Regalado is the afternoon drive-time host, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, and describes himself as leaning Harris but eager to see her work harder for the Hispanic vote. “I feel the Democrats take the Hispanic vote for granted here in Vegas or in Nevada,” Cerros said. “We are one-third of the population. Last time I checked, it’s like 23% of voter registration.” The station has a weekend political show, and the campaign sometimes also comes up during the week when listeners call in to discuss music or compete for prizes. Plus the station is often represented at local events. “I see people on social media, Hispanics, sharing that post ‘I’m not with Her.’ I’m, like, wow,” Regalado said. Cerros added: “A lot of people are calling me, or calling us – Latinos, you know, talking about voting for Trump.” Both said the economy is by far the biggest reason people they know who were solid Democrats are at least open to supporting Trump. “It is 100% that,” Cerros said. Nevada was crushed during the Covid pandemic because it is so reliant on tourism. The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% – more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: the jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures. “We have seen the record numbers at the casinos,” Regalado said. “But some businesses are struggling still.” Cerros said Fiesta 98.1’s advertisers are mostly small, Latino-owned businesses. “A lot of small businesses are struggling,” he said. “It’s not 100% yet, to where it was. Especially with inflation.” Zena Hajji presents a different problem for Harris. Muslims are just a tiny slice of Nevada’s population, but every vote and constituency matter in a battleground settled by 33,596 votes four years ago. “A lot of Muslims are angry they are being somehow — and I would say, unfortunately — partner to the issues that are happening abroad,” Hajji said in an interview at her Henderson home. “I don’t want my tax dollars to be able to hurt people, especially when I work so hard to focus on helping people here,” Hajji said. The 21-year-old Democrat, who’s a proud daughter of Moroccan immigrants, stands with Harris on just about every issue. But the Biden administration’s support of Israel as the conflict with Hamas drags on leaves Hajji pondering a third-party vote or just skipping the presidential line on the ballot. “Why would you keep voting for a group of people that promises no more bombs, no more pain, peace in the Middle East,” Hajji said, noting that those vows haven’t held up. She said Harris is more explicit than Biden in calling for an end to the killing of Palestinian civilians, but that words are not enough. “We just need a ceasefire,” she said. “That’s it. We just need it to stop. … We are tired. We are very, very tired. And we don’t know what to do with our votes right now.” Antonio Munoz is a man of contagious optimism. A veteran, retired police officer and now the owner of the 911 Taco Bar in El Mercado, a former JC Penny department store that now houses dozens of Hispanic small businesses. When we first met last December, he was undecided in the presidential race and unhappy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch. In that meeting, he bet neither Trump nor Biden would be on the ballot in the end. He was half right. Leaning Harris is where Munoz is now – intrigued and excited but also still frustrated he cannot find more specifics about her promise to help small businesses like his. “I’ve been checking her website and you read it, but it’s not specific,” Munoz said. “We do need to move forward. We need a different plan to get over the hump with this inflation that has caused severe damage to a lot of businesses. … She needs to be more direct.” A scorching summer was the latest challenge, stifling the catering business critical to Munoz’s bottom line. “We had over 30 days of 110 degrees,” Munoz said. “So we had a lot of cancellations because people didn’t want to be outside.” Now he sees a competitive election as a pause button. “Because people are afraid to go out and spend,” he said. “They don’t know what to expect when it comes around to a new administration.” Evidence of new energy for Harris begins at home for Munoz. He says his wife is excited, and that he shares her view that there is inspiration in the vice president’s story. “She came up with immigrant parents, which to me, it’s amazing for someone like that to come up and be able to be president,” Munoz said. “It’s a hit for people.” He also has no patience when Trump slams immigrants or berates the country he wants to lead. “One of the things that hurts me the most is for him to talk down America,” Munoz said. “America is a world leader. We have always been. … We’re the best. No matter who is there. The people make it the best.” But Munoz said many friends and others he encounters at community events are nostalgic for the pre-Covid economy and think that Trump is a better choice for their bottom line. Nevada also elected a Republican governor in 2022, and Munoz believes that makes it more hospitable climate for Trump this year. “He has grown,” Munoz said of the former president’s support among Hispanics. “I have friends that were Democrats who have turned the page. They feel that the country is not going in the right direction.” Harris, though, is more competitive than Biden would have been and Munoz predicts a Nevada nailbiter. “It’s a 50-50 tossup,” he said. “They need to be out here with a direct message and talking to the voters out here. I really think it is 50-50 right now. It is tight.”"

Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week and labeled India a “very big abuser” when it comes to trade with the United States as he spoke about his vision for a reciprocal trade policy. Trump added that countries like India, Brazil and China are “at the top of their game and they use it against us.” Michigan voters were able to ask questions at the town hall, all of which teed up Trump to talk about his policy promises. When a retired nurse asked how he would bring down the price of food and groceries, Trump said, “We have to start always with energy,” pledging to bring down Americans’ energy bills by 50% within his first year if elected. “Interest rates are going to follow,” he said, adding, “actually they’re going to follow for another reason.” Trump also referenced an expected interest rate cut announcement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. Trump also acknowledged his rambling speaking style and pushed back on Vice President Kamala Harris’ jab during last week’s debate that people leave during his rallies. “You know, when she said that, well, your rallies, people leave. Honestly, nobody does. And if I saw them leaving, I’d say, and ladies and gentlemen, make America great again, now get the hell out. OK, because I don’t want people leaving,” Trump told a hockey arena full of supporters in Flint, Michigan. Last week in Philadelphia, Harris said people leave Trump’s rallies early “out of exhaustion and boredom,” which prompted Trump to defend his campaign events and then pivot to making false claims about immigrants eating pets in Ohio. Trump acknowledged to the Michigan crowd that he uses “long, sometimes very complex sentences and paragraphs,” but he said “they come all together.” Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, slammed JD Vance’s defense of unsubstantiated claims that Haitian immigrants are eating pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio, suggesting the Ohio senator may be “making up stories” about other topics. On Sunday, Vance fiercely defended to CNN’s Dana Bash the unfounded rumor about Haitian immigrants in the small Ohio town without providing evidence to support his claim, which has also been promoted by former President Donald Trump.   “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” the GOP vice presidential nominee said on “State of the Union,” later adding that by “create,” he meant getting the media to focus on stories coming from constituent complaints. During a campaign rally in Asheville, North Carolina, on Tuesday, Walz jumped on Vance’s comment, claiming he “admitted” to knowingly spreading “vicious, hurtful lies about immigrants” with the intent to “spread fear” and “drum up support” for the GOP ticket.  Walz suggested Republicans are attempting to “blame the brown man” to harness fear as a “short-term motivator,” while drawing a contrast to Vice President Kamala Harris’ vision for the country.  “These guys focus on fear, fear of the unknown. Blame the brown man. Blame somebody else. That’s what they do,” Walz said. “It’s important to know who they are, but what really inspires people is policies and a vision like Kamala Harris is bringing that’s about the future.” Real estate investor Steve Witkoff on Tuesday detailed Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that they had arrived at the fifth hole on the golf course when a US Secret Service agent fired at a man who had a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. The Secret Service later said the gunman had no line of sight on the former president. Witkoff described Tuesday seeing Secret Service agents advance towards the source of the gunshots while others secured the perimeter. A group of snipers, he added, was “probably three yards away from me with their tripods on the ground.” “Everybody doing his job, and I was mesmerized by the whole thing, Kaitlan, I really was,” he said. Asked if he’d heard from Trump about whether he wants to be able to keep playing golf, Witkoff said, “I think what I would tell him is that he should do what makes him happy.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued Tuesday that the most violent rhetoric this election cycle has come from former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, as the two seek to blame liberals’ rhetoric for Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said Trump “absolutely” is a threat to democracy, citing his actions on January 6, 2021, and unwillingness to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election. The former president has argued Democrats’ insistence that he is a threat to democracy led to the two attempts on his life. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a crowd of Michigan voters Tuesday that her children keep her down to Earth, while remarking that Vice President Kamala Harris “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.” Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Donald Trump’s administration, said at a town hall with the former president that the “greatest title” she has is being a mom and that her three children serve as a “permanent reminder of everything that is at stake in this country.” She told a story of how she was getting her daughter ready for a father-daughter dance and she got emotional. “My sweet daughter reaches up, pats my shoulder and says, ‘It’s OK, Mommy, one day you can be pretty too,’” she said. “So my kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble,” she continued. Some context: Harris does not have biological children, but she is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s children from a previous marriage. The family has spoken extensively about their close relationship and how Harris has played an important role in her stepchildren’s lives. Just after being selected as Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance faced public scrutiny for previous comments he made criticizing childless adults. Democrats have continued to link the Republican ticket to the rhetoric, including Taylor Swift, who signed off on her endorsement of Harris as “childless cat lady.” Hillary Clinton slammed Elon Musk for “rotten” and “creepy” comments about Taylor Swift, saying that his reaction to the pop megastar’s endorsement of Kamala Harris was “kind of another way of saying rape, I think.”  Appearing on tech journalist Kara Swisher’s podcast, Clinton was initially asked about the potential impact of Swift’s endorsement, and the former Democratic presidential nominee was enthusiastic. “I think Taylor Swift brings an unusual impact to an endorsement. I think her fan base is so intense and incredibly influenced by her,” Clinton said. The conversation turned to Donald Trump’s critical reaction to Swift’s endorsement, and a social media post from Musk responding to the news, in which the tech billionaire wrote, “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.” Clinton said that Trump “had his alter ego, Elon Musk, say something really rotten and creepy about her.” Swisher jumped in, asking the former secretary of state to “please comment on that … what Elon said was he essentially would have a baby with her, or forcibly have a baby with her.” Clinton replied, “Yeah impregnate her, which you know, is kind of another way of saying rape, I think.” She added, “I can’t understand why he says what he says.” During the interview, released Monday, Clinton also accused critics demanding more policy details from Harris of holding her to a “double standard.” She went on to argue that Democrats needed to press a large gender gap to win in 2024, and ultimately made the case that “policy is not going to do it,” referencing her own struggles to break through to voters in 2016. Days following an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, both presidential candidates pressed on with campaign efforts in must-win states.  Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a panel in Philadelphia, while Trump hosted a town hall in Flint, Michigan, this evening.  Here are the latest developments:  Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, slammed Senate legislation that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide as a “ridiculous show vote bill” and accused Democrats of using the issue as a political weapon. Senate Republicans voted to block the measure earlier Tuesday. The bill sought to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. Vance argued the legislation “highlights one of the problems” he has with Vice President Kamala Harris’ “entire approach to government,” and criticized her and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for “ridiculous show votes so that they can win elections.” Vance reiterated his argument that the issue Republicans have with the Democrats’ bill is that it would “a huge infringement on religious liberty.”  Asked to clarify his stance on same-sex marriage, Vance said that “the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and nobody is trying to change that.” “Whether you’re gay or straight, you are welcome in Donald Trump’s Republican Party so long as you believe in commonsense,” he added. Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Secret Service “did a hell of a job” in stopping Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination in Florida. He praised the agents who identified and stopped the would-be assassin. “Now, they do need more people, and they’ve been complaining about that for a long time. But he did a great job,” he said at a town hall in Flint, Michigan.  His comments came amid scrutiny of the Secret Service in recent weeks — particularly over its failure to stop a shooter from firing at the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.  Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into that shooting, said Tuesday he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said that “the problem right now” is that the DHS and Secret Service “are refusing to give us almost any documentation.” “Why not? I mean, what do they — why don’t they want the accountability?” Hawley said.  Trump also praised a witness who took pictures of the Florida suspect’s license plate and sent them to the sheriff’s office.  “She saw something and decided it was bad,” he said of the witness. “Think of it — who would do this? If you took 1,000 of these incidents, would even one person have done it?”  Former President Donald Trump recounted his calls with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on him, repeatedly saying both Democrats were “nice” to him. “I have to say that President Biden called me yesterday,” he said at a town hall in Michigan on Tuesday, calling it a “very nice conversation.” Trump said he “appreciated” that Biden called about “what happened the other day.” Trump also brought up his call earlier on Tuesday with Harris, saying that he “got a very nice call from Kamala. It was very nice.” Still, while repeating that he appreciated the calls, he told the crowd that “we have to take back our country. We have to win. We’re going to win, and we’re going to make America great again.” As Trump said his call with Harris was nice, the crowd in Flint booed, and a few people shouted “liar.”  Later, while answering a question about the auto industry and railing against the Biden administration, Trump said he wanted to “be nice” because Biden “was so nice to me yesterday,” but he mused that he wished the call hadn’t happened so he didn’t have to praise his political rivals. Donald Trump told a Michigan crowd Tuesday night that steep tariffs he would impose on products imported from China, Mexico and other countries would rejuvenate the state’s automotive industry and drive an economic boom.  The former president, in his first campaign event since Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, said in Flint he would slap a 200% tariff on cars imported from Mexico. He said doing so would make those cars “unsellable in the United States.”  He also criticized the United Auto Workers’ president, Shawn Fain, who he said is too supportive of President Joe Biden’s efforts to transition to electric vehicles. Trump claimed those vehicles are “all going to be made in China and Mexico,” despite union contracts negotiated late last year intended to guarantee those vehicles are built in the United States.  Trump claimed he would impose “reciprocal” tariffs matching those that other countries slap on US imports — and said tariffs are a “beautiful word.”  Harris’ campaign has said Trump’s proposed tariffs would effectively amount to an inflation-driving national sales tax. Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign goods — and Harris’ campaign has noted that companies are all but certain to pass those additional costs on to consumers.  Trump linked his economic proposals to the apparent assassination attempt Sunday and one at a July rally in Pennsylvania.  Former President Donald Trump walked out through the crowd and shook hands with supporters at his first campaign event since Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against him.  Trump emerged from a curtain in a hockey arena in Flint, Michigan, and walked down a long pathway lined with metal barricades and flanked by security agents. People leaned out to greet him and shake his hands.  Oftentimes at rallies, Trump walks onto the stage from an elevated platform and waves at supporters in the crowd without getting close. “They think race-car driving is dangerous. No, they think bull-riding — that’s pretty scary, right? No, this is a dangerous business, so we have to keep it safe,” Trump remarked to Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former White House press secretary who is hosting a town hall with Michigan voters.  As she introduced Trump, Sanders said, “The left has tried everything they can think of. They’ve tried to impeach this president. They’ve tried to throw him in jail, and not once, but twice, two would-be assassins have tried to take this president down.” The crowd chanted “fight, fight, fight,” a rallying cry popularized in the wake of the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. The Biden administration submitted a special request to congressional committees in August asking for a boost to funding for the US Secret Service in the weeks leading up to and after the 2024 election, according to sources familiar with the matter, warning of “insufficient resources” for the agency if the request isn’t granted.  The Office of Management and Budget submitted the so-called anomaly request, which includes the White House’s proposed additions to the standard contents of a short-term government funding bill, after the July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the sources told CNN.  Congress and the White House are largely expected to negotiate a deal in the coming weeks to fund the government for a period of several months, lasting at least through the election, through a package known as a continuing resolution, or “CR.”  The White House’s funding request, sources said, notes that if the change is not granted, the Secret Service would have “insufficient resources to sustain and enhance protective operations” during that period.   A detailed amount of ramped-up spending was not specified in the request, which called instead for more flexible language that allows the Department of Homeland Security to provide funding “at a rate of operations necessary to continue protective and presidential campaign operations during the CR period.”  Federal agencies customarily submit such requests to the Office of Management and Budget ahead of negotiations over short-term government funding. The language proposed by the Biden administration for enhanced Secret Service funding through the 2024 election has appeared in at least one Republican-sponsored funding bill, lending credence to the belief that such an effort would see bipartisan support on the Hill. Read more on the White House’s request here Hunter Biden asked a judge Tuesday to delay his gun sentencing from November 13 to late November or early December, in part because his family members are preoccupied with the presidential campaign and election, according to court filings. President Joe Biden’s son is set to be sentenced for three gun felonies after he was convicted on all charges at a June trial in Delaware. Separately, he pleaded guilty to nine federal tax offenses and is scheduled to be sentenced for those crimes in December in California. In all, he could face a maximum of 25 years in prison for the gun case and 17 years for the tax case, though it’s rare for people to get the most severe punishment available. Hunter Biden’s lawyers said “it will be very difficult for Mr. Biden’s counsel to be ready for sentencing on November 13,” even though his legal team has been “diligently preparing for sentencing, including working with Delaware’s Chief Probation Officer to assemble the necessary financial paperwork, arrange pre-sentencing interviews, and prepare appropriate pre-sentencing submissions.” Special counsel David Weiss opposes any delays, according to emails made public as part of Hunter Biden’s request to postpone the sentencing. Biden’s lawyers also told the judge that they want more time because some members of the Biden family, who want to write and submit supportive letters for sentencing, are busy on the campaign trial. They also raised the possibility that they might want to bring in witnesses to testify on Hunter Biden’s behalf at his gun sentencing. But they said these people “may not be available until after November 5 and the events that could occur right after that date,” referring to the presidential election. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz swiped at Georgia’s state government during a meeting with young voters in Atlanta over voting laws that he says “make it harder to vote.”  Walz met with students from four historically Black colleges and universities at a coffee shop in Atlanta on Tuesday as part of a two-state swing through Georgia and North Carolina. He said he believes Georgia should have same-day voter registration, as he has approved in Minnesota.  “We’ll compete on the field of ideas and policies, but all of these policies that make it more difficult is because they fear the voter. And they should this time, because we’re coming to vote,” he continued. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters Tuesday that lawmakers are making a few “minor” changes to a bill that would mandate that two candidates for president — Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris — receive the same level of Secret Service protection that President Joe Biden receives, and are aiming to put it on the floor this week.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the safety of candidates is a bipartisan issue and that “we’re going to do everything we can.” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday welcomed presidential candidates to visit Springfield as “they have the right to be here,” but he emphasized “resources are really stretched” in the city right now. Springfield, a town of nearly 60,000 in southwestern Ohio, has been thrown into chaos since Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, began to spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets. DeWine has deployed state troopers to monitor schools in the city after they received 33 bomb threats since late last week. Local colleges have moved to remote classes due to threats. When asked whether Trump’s campaign has reached out to express support for Springfield, DeWine told reporters he hasn’t spoken with either Trump or Vance recently. Vance said Tuesday there aren’t any explicit plans for Trump or himself to visit Springfield. Vance said later Tuesday that he would like to visit the city and “talk with folks on the ground,” but said he wants to avoid overwhelming local law enforcement. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue stressed that it would be very difficult on city resources if a candidate were to visit. “It would be fine with me if they decided not to make that stop right now,” he said at the news conference with the governor. Rue also thanked DeWine for believing local leadership, adding that national leaders should “temper their words and speak truth.” This post has been updated with remarks from JD Vance. Microsoft said Tuesday that Russian operatives have in recent weeks intensified their online attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign by producing and disseminating videos promoting “outlandish conspiracy theories” aimed at stoking US racial and political divisions. One of the inauthentic videos, which Microsoft said had been viewed millions of times, claimed to show Harris supporters attacking an attendee of a Donald Trump rally. Another video falsely claimed that Harris paralyzed a young girl in a 2011 hit-and-run accident. Russian operatives promoted the latter story through a website pretending to be a San Francisco media outlet, Microsoft researchers said. Both videos were still accessible on X as of Tuesday afternoon, with one post of the video garnering 1.5 million views on its own. CNN has requested comment from the social media platform. The report is the latest evidence that Kremlin-linked trolls and digital operatives are ramping up their efforts to denigrate Harris’ campaign just weeks before the presidential election. US intelligence agencies warned in July that Russia planned to “covertly use social media” to try to sway public opinion and undermine support for Ukraine in swing states. CNN has requested comment on the Microsoft report from the Harris-Walz campaign and from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. Read more here A week after President Barack Obama won reelection in November 2012, JD Vance, then a law student at Yale, wrote a scathing rebuke of the Republican Party’s stance on migrants and minorities. He criticized the Party’s stance for being “openly hostile to non-whites” and for alienating “Blacks, Latinos, (and) the youth.” Four years later, as Vance considered a career in Republican politics, he asked a former college professor to delete the article. That professor, Brad Nelson, taught Vance at Ohio State University while Vance was an undergraduate student. After Vance graduated, Nelson asked him to contribute to a blog he ran for the nonpartisan Center for World Conflict and Peace. Nelson told CNN that during the 2016 Republican primary he agreed to delete the article at Vance’s request, so that he might have an easier time getting a job in Republican politics. However, the article, titled “A Blueprint for the GOP,” remains viewable on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. More background: Vance has spread and defended false claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio. Asked to support his claims in an interview with CNN, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening — though he didn’t provide the evidence. Read more here  A group of GOP senators sent a letter to acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe demanding former President Donald Trump receive the same level of protection as a sitting president, after the apparent assassination attempt against him over the weekend. Sens. Tommy Tuberville, Roger Marshall, Bill Cassidy, Bill Hagerty, Mike Lee, Jim Risch, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott signed the letter, which stated: In a news conference Tuesday, several of these senators reiterated their call for greater protection for Trump. However, Marshall said the Secret Service does not need more funding. “They’ve got plenty of personnel, they’ve got plenty of money, they need to prioritize where to be placing these Secret Service agents. They’ve got the people to do it,” he said. Some background: The letter comes amid renewed scrutiny of the Secret Service and its ability to protect Trump. As CNN reported, Trump on Monday said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told Joe Biden that when the president called him earlier in the day.  Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, said Tuesday that the former president “ought to have the same” level of Secret Service protection as Biden. Donald Trump met with the Florida sheriff’s deputies who took the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against him into custody, according to the Trump campaign.   Trump campaign spokeswoman Margo Martin posted a video to X on Tuesday and said, “President @realDonaldTrump meets with the Martin County Sheriff’s Office Deputies who activated the traffic stop on I-95 and took Ryan Routh into custody.” In the video, Trump is seen greeting the deputies at his Mar-a-Lago residence and says, “That’s good-looking human beings.” “Great job. Thank you very much,” Trump says as he shook the hand of every officer.  The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, was taken into custody by deputies from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office after fleeing Trump’s golf course and being detained on a nearby highway. He faces two gun-related charges. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Donald Trump “ought to have the same” level of Secret Service protection as President Joe Biden after a second apparent assassination attempt against the former president.  Vance said he did not know whether Trump has specifically requested additional protection. However, he said he has spoken to allies on Capitol Hill who are working on appropriating funds “so that he has the security detail that maps up with President Biden’s.” As CNN reported, Trump on Monday said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told Joe Biden that when the president called him earlier in the day.  Vance said he has not personally requested additional Secret Service protection, saying that “I think we have what we need” and that “these guys are doing a great job.” Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told former President Donald Trump on Monday that substantial security enhancements are needed for him to continue golfing safely at his private clubs, three people familiar with the meeting told CNN.  Trump asked Rowe during the meeting at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida whether the Secret Service believed it was safe for him to continue golfing — a favorite pastime of the former president’s. Rowe said the private courses raised concerns, given the large amount of space that need to be secured and their proximity to public roads and spaces, the sources said.  A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The New York Times first reported on the exchange between Rowe and Trump.  Rowe also acknowledged that it was easier to secure the golf course at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where past presidents such as Barack Obama played while in office, given it is a military course. He also acknowledged Trump’s security detail, as a former president, is not as comprehensive as when he was in office. Some of Trump’s advisers have argued the former president should be able to continue golfing, noting it’s one of the few activities he uses to blow off steam and socialize with allies. During the meeting, Rowe also walked Trump through current security protocols as well as security enhancements that are available to his campaign, CNN previously reported. One source familiar with the meeting described it as “very direct, very matter of fact, and it was very cordial.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, pleaded guilty to possessing an explosive device stemming from an arrest in April 2002 in North Carolina.   According to Guilford County records, Routh was in possession of an explosive device with a 10-inch detonation cord and a blasting cap. It’s unclear what lead to Routh’s arrest. This incident is separate from another arrest in December of 2002, when Routh drove off during a traffic stop and barricaded himself inside his office. Routh has a lengthy criminal record with charges including burglary, larceny, arson and multiple charges of driving without a license.  Vice President Kamala Harris said she has full confidence in the Secret Service following Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. “I do,” Harris responded when asked whether she feels safe with her Secret Service protection. Speaking to a panel held by the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday, she then shifted her answer to address Springfield, Ohio, which has received threats after Republicans promoted false rumors about immigrants there. “But I mean, you can go back to Ohio,” Harris said. “Not everybody has Secret Service, and there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe.” “I feel safe,” Harris added. “I have Secret Service protection. But that doesn’t change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country and doing everything we can to again lift people up and not beat people down.” She said she spoke with Trump earlier today and told him there is no place for political violence in the United States The 2024 election is now less than 50 days away, and clear messaging trends are emerging in the hundreds of millions worth of campaign advertising airing across the country. Democrats are leaning into messaging focused on abortion, taxes, and health care, while Republicans are emphasizing immigration, crime, and inflation. Democrats are pouring money into campaign ads about abortion. Out of a total of $279 million spent on broadcast TV by all Democratic advertisers between August 15 and September 15, $83.8 million went to ads that referenced or discussed abortion. Democrats also spent more than $70.1 million on ads about taxes, part of a concerted effort in the presidential race to pitch middle-class tax cuts and blunt the persistent edge that voters give Trump on the economy. In addition, Democrats spent more than $52 million on ads about health care, many focused on Medicare, while ads about character, many featuring sharp personal attacks, accounted for about $36.5 million. Some Democratic advertisers have placed a greater emphasis on abortion than others. In the presidential race, the Harris campaign and its allies have focused more on economic issues, such as taxes and housing; in congressional races, meanwhile, abortion rights have been a dominant issue. Out of a total of $69.3 million spent on broadcast TV between August 15 and September 15, the Harris campaign spent $19.9 million on ads about abortion, while at the same time spending $33.9 million on ads about taxes, and $18.6 million on ads about housing. Republicans, by contrast, have almost totally avoided abortion — the main focus of Democratic attacks — in their campaign advertising, spending $0 on ads about abortion in the presidential race between August 15 and September 15, and just $6.4 million across all other races. Instead, Republicans have emphasized competing issues: immigration and crime, which are often linked in their ads, and the economy, frequently criticizing the rising cost of living and progressive tax policy. Reflecting those messaging priorities, out of a total of $275.4 million spent on broadcast TV over the last month, Republicans have spent $114 million on ads about immigration; $95.2 million on ads about crime; and $87.6 million on ads about inflation Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while speaking to Georgia Tech students in Atlanta at an event celebrating National Voter Registration Day, urged young voters there to avoid becoming cynical as they engage in politics ahead of November’s election and beyond. “It’s nothing secret to you, and you haven’t seen it — for many of us, this pessimism in our electoral system, this has not always been there. There had been joy in this, and we had a bunch of people shake hands and then they work together for a common good. This is something somewhat new, and it’s really, really scary,” he said. “My fear is that you become cynical and check out. Maybe this is where we need you to work with your friends, where they say, ‘Oh, it’s not worth it. Not worth it. Both sides are the same. I’m really not into politics,’” Walz continued. “My response to that is, too damn bad. Politics is into you.” Walz also made another reference to the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on Sunday, again condemning the attack and calling for the end of gun violence broadly, linking the attempt on Trump’s life to the shooting at a Georgia high school earlier this month.  Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the false rumors about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, being promoted by former President Donald Trump and vice presidential nominee JD Vance, calling the rumors “a crying shame.” She added that “most people in this country, regardless of their race, are beginning to see through this nonsense,” which she said “we should not have the tolerance for.” Some background: Republicans including Vance fueled a firestorm of misinformation this month when they spread false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, injecting the town with chaos. The claims, which have been widely discredited, have made their way onto the national stage. Trump further pushed the false narrative during his first debate against Harris, when he falsely claimed, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday against comments from former President Donald Trump blaming their rhetoric for a second apparent assassination attempt against him over the weekend.  In a Monday interview with Fox News, Trump blamed Biden and Harris for Sunday’s failed assassination attempt, saying, “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at.” “He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,” Trump claimed in an interview with Fox News of the suspect who came to his property in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday.  In a follow-up exchange, Jean-Pierre criticized comments from GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance, who said Monday that the “big difference” between conservatives and liberals is that “no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris.”  “It’s dangerous to have that type of rhetoric out there,” Jean-Pierre said. The White House press secretary also emphasized the need to “bring that temperature down of that political violent rhetoric.” A Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday finds “practically no change” in voters’ support for either of the leading presidential candidates following their debate last week. In the survey, 49% of registered voters say they will “definitely” or “probably” support Harris, while in a separate question, 44% say they will “definitely” or “probably” support Trump. In August, those numbers were 48% for Harris and 43% for Trump. These questions were not asked in the format of a horserace poll – voters could say they were likely to support both or neither — and should not be reported on as such. On the issues: Majorities of registered voters say they feel they have a good idea about the specific policies that Trump (59%) and Harris (54%) respectively would pursue to help American families if they were elected president, the poll finds. About half (52%) say they’re at least somewhat confident that the federal government would be in safe hands if Harris were president, with 48% saying the same of Trump. More about the poll: Monmouth University surveyed 803 registered voters by telephone and online on Sept. 11-15. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/- 3.9 percentage points. Pressed on whether her policy on the Israel-Hamas war differs from President Joe Biden’s, Vice President Kamala Harris offered no specific divergence — but said she believed it is time for a lasting ceasefire and hostage deal. Asked about a specific policy that would end the war, Harris responded, “We need to get this deal done, and we need to get it done immediately, and that is my position, and that is my policy.” More background: Harris’ answer reflected a position entirely in line with Biden’s approach to the conflict. She allowed no daylight between herself and her boss, who has unsuccessfully worked to secure an agreement that would pair a release of hostages held by Hamas with an end to the fighting in Gaza. After months of painstaking negotiations, American officials have been unable to bring the talks over the finish line. CNN reported Tuesday that Biden’s national security advisers have no imminent plans to present him with an updated proposal in the negotiations, the latest indication that talks to end the conflict have seriously stalled. Yet Harris, in her comments Tuesday, did not offer a new approach. This post has been updated with more on Harris’ comments on her Israel policy. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged she has to work to earn the vote of Black people — especially Black men. She continued: “So I’m working to earn the vote, not assuming I’m going to have it because I am Black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have.” She added she intends to be president for all Americans. Vice President Kamala Harris offered few specific plans when pressed on her plan to lower child care costs for American families. Speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday, the first question the vice president fielded was about the economy. Harris acknowledged the American dream feels “unattainable” for many young people and touted her vision for an “opportunity economy” that benefits all. One of the panelists, “Fresh Air” co-host Tonya Mosley, pressed Harris for specifics on lowering child care costs, aside from the child tax credit she has already pitched. Harris responded: “It is, sadly, the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work or be able to afford child care.” She said no family should be paying more than 7% of their income on child care, but did not say what policies she would implement to achieve that goal. Vice President Kamala Harris called former President Donald Trump this afternoon to speak with him directly to express that she is grateful that he is safe following the apparent assassination attempt against him, a White House official said.  The conversation was cordial and brief, the official said. Biden and Trump spoke yesterday: President Joe Biden and Trump had a “cordial conversation” on Monday, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X.  Biden also conveyed his relief that Trump was safe and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, Simons said. CNN’s Sam Fossum contributed reporting to this post. Vice President Kamala Harris is participating in a panel discussion with members of the National Association of Black Journalists. The panel is taking place at the WHYY studios in Philadelphia. This comes several weeks after former President Donald Trump also participated in an interview with NABJ at their conference in Chicago. During that contentious interview, Trump questioned Harris’ racial identity and falsely claimed she only recently began presenting herself as Black. The FBI is currently searching the home of Ryan Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, in Hawaii. CNN can see multiple federal vehicles outside the home on the beachfront community of Kaawa on the east side of the island of Oahu. Agents are going in and out and a public information officer on site said they are executing a court-authorized search warrant. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday praised the Secret Service’s response to the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump over the weekend. The agency “did its job” and “eliminated a threat,” Mayorkas said at Politico’s AI & Tech Summit in Washington, DC. The Secret Service, which is part of DHS, has been under intense scrutiny after the second apparent assassination attempt aimed at Trump in three months, amid questions about whether the agency has the resources it needs in an elevated threat environment.  The Secret Service has “enhanced” the security posture around Trump, Mayorkas said, “so that he is receiving a level of security commensurate with the fact that he is a former president and on the campaign trail.” Mayorkas reiterated DHS’s assessment that the US is in a “heightened” threat environment that includes potential threats from foreign terrorists and domestic violent extremists.   “It is a threat environment that is of deep concern, and it requires vigilance at every level of government, and frankly on every block of each community across this country,” Mayorkas said. US officials, Mayorkas said, are also “concerned about the situation” in Springfield, Ohio, where schools were evacuated Monday after bomb threats that came in the wake of a viral and false claims about Haitian immigrants that Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, helped propagate. “The community is feeling extraordinary threatened,” Mayorkas said. “They’ve received bomb threats and other threats of violence based on false statements.” In the wake of the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump on Sunday, the former president’s running mate, JD Vance, argued in a speech in Georgia on Monday that the two recent attempts to kill Trump are evidence that “the left needs to tone down the rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out; somebody’s going to get hurt by it.” What Vance didn’t mention was that Trump has repeatedly told the American people that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is a fascist whose election would mean the end of the country itself. In fact, Trump called Harris a fascist at least twice last week alone. “She’s a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist,” Trump said at an Arizona rally on Thursday. “This is a radical-left, Marxist, communist, fascist,” Trump said while attacking Harris at a news conference on Friday. This wasn’t new rhetoric. “We have a fascist person running who’s incompetent,” Trump told Virginia residents during a campaign stop in August; at an Arizona rally that month, Trump said the true divide in American politics is between patriots with traditional values and “these far-left fascists led by Harris and her group.” A Vance spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNN’s request Tuesday to explain whether the Ohio senator is calling on Trump to tone down his language, and, if not, what Vance sees as the difference between Trump’s words and the words from “the left” he was denouncing. Read more of the analysis here. The Michigan Republican Party is running a radio ad supporting former President Donald Trump in Detroit featuring the city’s former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick was sent to a federal detention facility in 2013 after he was convicted on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, extortion and filing false tax returns. Trump commuted Kilpatrick’s sentence as one of his last acts in office. The former Democratic mayor endorsed Trump earlier this summer. In the one-minute radio ad, Kilpatrick talks about how he’s had to challenge his previous beliefs, including on “identity politics.” Sen. Chris Murphy, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said his panel has asked the US Secret Service to “get creative” in its requests for additional resources, saying “they can’t hire new Secret Service agents to make a difference between now and the inauguration” in January. The Connecticut Democrat told CNN’s Manu Raju that Senate appropriators and the Biden administration are in talks about how much money to add for the Secret Service in the upcoming stop-gap government funding bill. He said it could be “hundreds of millions of dollars” to beef up the agency’s budget, or it could be language allowing the Secret Service to spend its existing money faster. Murphy said Congress doesn’t “necessarily need” to include additional Secret Service funding in the impending bill, but “we could for now give them the ability to spend at an accelerated rate between now and the inauguration.” Some background: Murphy’s comments come as the second apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump in as many months is raising new questions about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect the former president. After a second close call, President Joe Biden recognized a problem still persists. “The Secret Service needs more help,” he told reporters Monday. The sounds of blasting and bulldozing in the hills overlooking Las Vegas are proof change is a constant here, with the new $5 million homes evidence of the vibrant, upscale demand. It is progress, longtime Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez says, as she points out new construction from the patio of her own home in suburban Henderson. But it is also a reminder of a major economic and political issue here. Rents are on the rise, and starter homes are scarce. The wealthy can find what they want — or build it — but working-class families face a housing crunch. Sanchez says a Federal Reserve interest rate cut would help, and she is counting on one soon not only to help her business and local families but also her candidate for president: Kamala Harris. Donald Trump narrowly lost Nevada in both 2016 and 2020. Sanchez concedes she hears more support for him this time among Latino voters, especially men. Rogelio Regalado and Rafael Cerros Jr. both said the economy is by far the biggest reason people they know who were solid Democrats are at least open to supporting Trump. “It is 100% that,” Cerros said. Nevada was crushed during the Covid-19 pandemic because of its heavy reliance on tourism. The state had the highest pandemic unemployment rate, at one point just shy of 31% — more than twice the national average. The statistics now are clear: The jobs are back, and then some. But the bruises linger, and working families trying to put the pandemic stress behind them have faced housing and inflation pressures.

The only way to stop them and the dangerous Project 2025 agenda is to vote and elect Kamala Harris,” O’Connell said.  “Vote like your life depends on it, because it does,” Eilish said.  The pair urged supporters to cast their ballots early. “Today is National Voter Registration Day, and we are asking you to please join us in going to iwillvote.com to check your status and vote early like we do,” O’Connell said. Eilish is the latest pop artist to endorse Harris, after Taylor Swift announced last week she is supporting the vice president, ending months of speculation over whether the superstar would share her views ahead of the election. Vice President Kamala Harris again condemned political violence during her first radio interview following former President Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt.  Harris made the remarks during an interview taped on Monday with Nueva Network’s radio host Stephanie Himonidis, also known as “Chiquibaby.” Harris previously said she was “deeply disturbed” and condemned violence on Sunday following the security incident that occurred while Trump was golfing in Florida. What Trump has said: The former president on Monday unleashed a series of attacks, blaming Harris and Biden for this latest apparent attempt on his life. He told Fox News Digital on Monday, that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.” He similarly lambasted the Democratic president and vice president on his Truth Social website. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and Senate allies used the chamber’s expected vote on a bill to guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide to draw contrasts between their Republican rivals, former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Vance will spend Tuesday campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin as the Senate is expected to vote on the bill. Senate Democrats are bringing the bill back to the floor after Republicans blocked the measure from advancing in June. The legislation is likely to again be blocked by GOP senators. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, one of the legislation’s sponsors, said “we know exactly how (Vance) would vote, because he voted against this bill just a couple of months ago.” Duckworth, who had her own children using IVF, said Trump and Vance “spent weeks lying about their records on IVF, and pretending to champion this cause, but we know time and again, when given the chance, they’ll never actually do anything to support IVF.” Trump’s stance: The former president is due to campaign in Michigan on Tuesday evening. The last time he was in the battleground state, he pledged to implement a policy as president that would pay for IVF, without specifying how the treatments would be paid for. He has said multiple times that his administration would be “great” for women’s reproductive rights, despite regularly touting his role in eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion that had been upheld for nearly half a century.  During the second presidential debate, Trump would not directly say whether he would veto a national abortion ban, though he has said his position is that the issue should be decided by states. Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday again threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, whom he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election, if he wins the presidency. Trump posted the same message, word for word, on September 7 on Truth Social. It falsely claims Democrats engaged in fraudulent behavior in 2020 and says that Trump, attorneys and legal scholars are “watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely.” Some background: Trump has been ramping up efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election and has routinely suggested he would weaponize the justice system to go after his political opponents if voters return him to the White House — threats that began after he was first indicted in his Manhattan hush money case more than a year ago. Despite Trump’s repeated claims, the 2020 election was highly secure, and he lost to Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes. There is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome of the election in any state. Trump still faces his own charges over election interference stemming from efforts to subvert the 2020 election, including a four-count indictment in his federal case. A separate election interference case against him in Fulton County, Georgia, has been indefinitely paused. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana argued that former President Donald Trump should steer clear of debunked rumors of migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, as threats against local officials and others in the city continue.  “I think the better attack on the broken immigration system is the women who’ve been raped and murdered. We know that’s true,” said Graham. “We know that the leading cause of death for young people is fentanyl poisoning coming through a broken border coming through Mexico. I’d rather talk about that.”  He added, “I don’t know about dogs and cats, but I know about raped women. I know about people who are dying from fentanyl poisoning directly related to Mexican drug cartels who are running amok to the southern border.” Cassidy said of the rumor: “it turns out it’s not true,” and when pressed on whether Trump should continue to repeat it, he replied, “I prefer not to say things which are not true.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz visited a soul food restaurant in Macon, Georgia, where he met with voters and made brief remarks amid his two-state swing through Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday. Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, walked into the restaurant by joking about “the perks of being on this ticket,” referring to making stops at local restaurants like H&H restaurant, a historic comfort food diner in Macon. At one instance, he spoke about the aftermath of his son Gus’ emotional reaction to seeing him speak at the Democratic National Convention last month. He told one voter, “It’s like the whole country kind of wrapped their arms around him.” “It’s scary, and it was scary. We’ve been really protective over the years,” he said. “There’s a few people that nothing is off limits, but the majority … my faith in humanity, was so restored, they wrapped their arms around that kid.” At the end of the event, Walz was introduced for brief formal remarks by Stanley Stewart, a Macon city commissioner, who spoke about Walz’s place in the legacy of Democratic politicians and mentioned meeting Vice President Kamala Harris in Selma, Alabama earlier this year.  Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged Tuesday that the law enforcement community will “work together to tirelessly determine accountability” in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump last weekend.   He continued: “The entire Justice Department — including in particular, the FBI, the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, the National Security Division — are all coordinating closely with our local state law enforcement partners on the ground. We will all work together to tirelessly determine accountability in this matter. We will spare no resource in this investigation.”   Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s incident, was charged on Monday with two gun-related crimes. Additional charges could be brought as the investigation continues, law enforcement officials have told CNN. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into the first assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, said he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation.  Blumenthal added that they have refused to provide “documents, witnesses, other evidence that is important,” and said he is open to issuing subpoenas if this continues.  “I know how to do subpoenas. I’m very willing and able to use the subpoena process, if necessary, to get information from the Department of Homeland Security, and we have told them repeatedly about our frustration,” he said. “I’m deeply dissatisfied and disappointed.”   GOP Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana declared that the Secret Service should not receive more funding until they answer Congress’ questions. “We need answers more than the Secret Service needs money,” he insisted. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, acknowledged that the Secret Service might need more resources, but he noted that they haven’t asked for any extra funding. “I’m wide open, as I think everyone is, to the notion that the Secret Service will need more resources,” he said. “I don’t see that case being presented, but of course, if there’s more resources needed, Congress needs to act.”  Republican Sen. Josh Hawley voiced frustrations with the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service, saying the agencies are again “stonewall(ing)” the committee investigating the first assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.  The Missouri senator pointed to the lack of cooperation when asked if the committee would also be investigating Sunday’s assassination attempt, saying “the problem right now” is that the DHS and Secret Service “are refusing to give us almost any documentation.” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee leading the investigation into the first assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, also said he is “on the verge of outrage” with the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of cooperation.  Former President Donald Trump’s meeting with acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe on Monday was brief and matter of fact, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. Rowe walked the former president through their current security protocols as well as security enhancements that are available to his campaign.  CNN previously reported that Trump is expected to maintain his campaign schedule in the aftermath of the apparent second assassination attempt, on Sunday. The advisers told CNN security enhancements are being made in response to the incident, and such measures will likely be noticeable on the ground during his political events this week. The advisers would not go into detail over what exactly those enhancements will look like, citing the heightened concerns over the former president’s security. Trump and his advisers continue to praise the former president’s Secret Service personnel on the ground, with the former president having privately remarked that his day-to-day secret service detail, which he has worked with for years and knows personally, as “heroes.” “On a systematic level, there’s obviously some things that need to be changed and adjusted. That’s what we’ve always said. It’s not the people on the ground, it’s the system in place” that might not be well-equipped to handle the current environment, one of the advisers said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called for the end of gun violence in the wake of a shooting at a Georgia high school earlier this month while speaking to volunteers at a Georgia field office on Tuesday. Walz told supporters in Macon, Georgia that Vice President Kamala Harris would work to reduce mass shooting incidents in his first trip to the state since the Apalachee High School shooting in Winder, Georgia, that left four people dead and nine others injured.  Walz also made a reference to a comment Ohio Sen. JD Vance made in the aftermath of the shooting lamenting that school shootings are “a fact of life.” He also made reference to the two apparent assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump in calling for the end of gun violence. “That is not just a fact of life people, that is not just a fact of life,” he said. “And as Donald Trump would know, this violence across the country has got to end. Gun violence has got to end.” President Joe Biden said “everything is frightening” in the wake of the second apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, telling a radio show that more resources should be provided to the US Secret Service. Biden described the climate as “up across the board” in an interview airing Tuesday with the Dallas-based radio show DeDe in the Morning. Biden, who called into the show Monday night, said “just got off the phone” with Trump. “We had about a five-minute call and I told him what we’re doing,” Biden said. “He thanked me very much for the call, told me he really appreciates what I was doing, etcetera.” Biden also extolled his “smart as hell” Vice President Kamala Harris, describing their “close” work together in the interview. “We work really closely together,” Biden told the outlet. “Every major initiative that we’ve been credited for from cyber security, stuff we’ve done.” Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced an executive order to launch a state investigation into the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday at his West Palm Beach golf course. DeSantis said the Office of Statewide Prosecution would lead the investigation since there appear to be potential law violations in multiple counties. The state may be able to file stronger charges against suspect Ryan Wesley Routh than federal prosecutors, he said. “The state of Florida has jurisdiction over the most serious, straightforward offense, which is attempted murder,” DeSantis said. DeSantis waded into political territory during the news conference, saying he has doubts about the ability of federal law enforcement to be fair while investigating the threat to Trump. “In my judgment, it’s not in the best interest of our state or our nation to have the same federal agencies that are seeking to prosecute Donald Trump leading this investigation,” the governor said. The state investigation will be supervised by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, who also suggested that criticism of Trump is contributing to the threats against him. DeSantis said the investigation will not only be focused on pursuing charges against Routh, but also answering more questions about the case. “This guy had red flags. I know he’s been looked at by federal law enforcement,” DeSantis. said. “How the heck did it end up where he’s in West Palm Beach in those bushes?” More context: DeSantis, who has wielded executive power unlike any of his predecessors, has repeatedly leveraged state resources to thrust Florida into the national conversation, often by challenging the federal government or other conservative targets. It’s a playbook DeSantis has tapped into repeatedly in ways that have maximized his exposure, often in furtherance of his political ambitions. In 2022, as Congress and the federal government wrestled with a surge of border crossings, his administration lured migrants in Texas onto planes with promises of jobs and then dropped them off in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, without telling locals, setting off a national firestorm and a wave of glowing coverage from conservative media. Later, as he weighed whether to challenge to Trump for the Republican nomination for president, he pushed the Florida Supreme Court to empanel a statewide grand jury to investigate the Covid-19 vaccine developed under the former president’s Operation Warp Speed. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed reporting to this post. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz condemned the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday and said he’s “grateful” Trump is safe in his first on-camera reaction to what he called a “horrific situation.”  The Democratic vice presidential nominee addressed the incident at the beginning of his remarks to volunteers at a campaign field office in Macon, Georgia, on Tuesday, telling supporters “We don’t solve our difference in this country with violence.” Walz said that he was “thankful to Secret Service, the folks you see, law enforcement and grateful that the (former) president is safe,” Walz said. “I think all of us know, we don’t solve our differences in this country with violence. We condemn it in all its forms. We solve our differences at the ballot box. That’s how we get this done.” Walz is also set to campaign in North Carolina later today. Real estate investor Steve Witkoff, who was playing golf with former President Donald Trump during his second apparent assassination attempt, on Tuesday described his experience and shared his gratitude toward the Secret Service. He continued, “I was almost mesmerized by everything that was happening.” Trump’s round of golf with Witkoff on Sunday was ahead of the presidential candidate’s livestreamed announcement on Monday that he would be launching a new cryptocurrency venture, which Witkoff helped spearhead. “Our whole system, our whole country, runs on the availability of credit. And there are many who have been locked out of the marketplace, as I was when I first had a dream and wanted to be in the real estate business, and so that’s the reason we went into this business,” Witkoff explained. The man suspected of trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Sunday depicted himself on social media as a globe-trotting freedom fighter: tweeting at world leaders, traveling to Ukraine to support its war effort, and professing his willingness to die for the causes he believed in. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old living in Hawaii, told news outlets that he had spent months in Ukraine working to bring foreign fighters to the country from Afghanistan. But the grandiose image that Routh painted online didn’t seem to match up with his reality. In one interview last year, he acknowledged that he hadn’t secured a single visa for the Afghan fighters he claimed he was ready to send to the country, and a Ukrainian military official told CNN that Routh’s ideas seemed “delusional.” In the years before Routh’s alleged assassination attempt, he posted messages online criticizing Trump. Routh claimed in a 2020 post that he supported Trump in 2016 but had changed his tune on the former president. Away from his keyboard, Routh ran a small company that built tiny homes in a Honolulu suburb, and he spent his time writing letters to his local newspaper about homeless encampments, graffiti on an Oahu highway tunnel, and a dispute about a hiking trail. Read the full story. As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, will deliver remarks at a political event in Macon, Georgia, and then travel to Atlanta. Walz will then travel to North Carolina and deliver remarks at a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Asheville. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, and his running mate JD Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. Donald Trump and his children unveiled a new cryptocurrency business Monday night in a virtual address from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the latest venture that stands to benefit the former president as he seeks another four years in the Oval Office. Details on the new business, which will be called World Liberty Financial, remain limited, but his son Donald Trump Jr. suggested the new company will provide opportunities for people who cannot get financing from traditional banks. The GOP nominee has teased the latest expansion of his family’s business empire from the same social media account that carries his political messaging and shared vague thoughts Monday about the perceived upside. No major party nominee has ever leveraged their candidacy for personal profit quite like Trump has during his third White House bid. Since entering the race nearly two years ago, Trump has netted millions of dollars selling new items featuring moments from his political life while also generating billions of dollars in wealth through a social media site where he speaks directly to supporters. Read the full story. Donald Trump was walking down the fifth hole of the championship course at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, preparing for his birdie putt, when the all-too-familiar sound of gunfire prompted his Secret Service detail to pounce on the former president. Here’s a timeline of how the attempted shooting played out on Sunday: Read more about how the attempted shooting played out here. The Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee have launched a new initiative to mobilize young voters across key battleground states. To mark National Voter Registration Day, the campaign and DNC announced a “Youth Week of Action” to encourage young voters to register to vote ahead of November’s election. The initiative consists of organizing on college campuses, paid maid media and an “aggressive campaign blitz across battleground states anchored by events with Gov. Tim Walz to ensure every eligible voter has a chance to make their voice heard by November 5.” Top surrogates will be deployed this week including Gov. Josh Shapiro hosting an event at Penn State University and Bill Nye speaking at a Climate Voters for Harris-Walz event in Durham, North Carolina. The campaign will support over 130 youth voter registration events this week alone. The week of action will also dedicate resources to target Black and Latino students in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions where they will highlight “Trump’s Project 2025 would roll back student debt relief, monitor pregnancies and ban abortion and slash funding for these critical institutions.” The DNC has also unveiled the National Voter Assistance Text Line, which aims to provide information in English and Spanish so that voters can access information needed to register to vote. One of the best pollsters in America recently came out with its latest survey, and it’s good news for Kamala Harris. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., found Donald Trump at 47% to the vice president’s 43% – within the margin of error – in a state the former president has twice won comfortably. (The poll was conducted last week, before Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump.) While the Hawkeye State is unlikely to be pivotal in November, the fact that Selzer found a close race in a state Trump has dominated could signal good things for Harris, both in terms of the accuracy of polling and for her chances in next-door Wisconsin. What makes the Selzer survey so important is that it’s been accurate in an era when other pollsters have struggled. This Selzer poll could also be an outlier, and much could change between now and Election Day. Selzer’s September 2020 poll was a lot more favorable to Biden (showing a tie) than its final survey that year. But the current poll is a far better result than the previous Selzer survey from June – when Biden was still in the race. It had Trump up by 18 points. The bottom line: You’d much rather have the Selzer poll in your corner than not. And right now, the survey shows a better result for Harris than it did in the end for either Clinton or Biden. Read the full analysis here Former President Donald Trump is set to hold his first rally Tuesday night since the second apparent assassination attempt of the former president, traveling to Flint, Michigan, for what’s being billed as a town hall hosted by his former White House press secretary, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, will sit for an interview in Philadelphia with the members of the National Association of Black Journalists – a major unscripted moment for a candidate who has largely stuck tightly to her message. It’s the same group to whom Trump falsely said weeks ago that Harris only “happened to turn Black” in recent years. The events come in the wake of the Secret Service on Sunday preventing a potential shooter from firing at Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course — stopping what could have been the second attempt on the former president’s life. They’ll offer a window into how the next phase of the campaign could play out — particularly for Trump, who is traveling to Michigan for an event that had been aimed at criticizing President Joe Biden and Harris’ record in one of the nation’s most important swing states. Read more about the state of the 2024 race here. Ex-President Donald Trump responded to a second apparent assassination attempt that he blames on incendiary political rhetoric by inflaming the situation even more. When a bullet grazed his ear in a horrific shooting that killed a rally goer in July, Trump initially acted like a changed man, telling The Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito he had a chance to bring the country and the world together — although that aspiration did not last any longer than the opening paragraphs of his convention speech. After the Secret Service thwarted a gunman who had apparently lain in wait for the ex-president at one of his Florida golf courses Sunday, Trump’s reaction was different. He accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of inviting assassins to target him when they warn that he is a threat to democracy. Trump’s claim that their warnings about his supposed threat to democracy risk getting him killed is particularly stark. By implication, he’s saying that it is illegitimate for his opponents to point out the truth: that his past behavior — in seeking to steal the 2020 election and spreading false claims that this year’s voting will be corrupt — suggests that he poses a danger to America’s democratic system. His position, which looks like an attempt to stifle free speech, may also be a dark harbinger of how he would behave if he won a second term. Read the full analysis here. Rob Rue, the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, said he didn’t think it was a good idea for former President Donald Trump to hold a campaign event in the city as Trump had suggested during a news conference Friday.  “It would be extremely difficult if either one of the candidates came to our community right now, and I would discourage it if I had the opportunity, just because this is not a time to campaign in our community at the national level,” Rue told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday.  Springfield has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in the town. Former President Donald Trump is still planning to attend scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump is expected to be in Flint, Michigan, today, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday, and Washington, DC, this week."
Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs denied bail and will remain in federal detention | CNN,No Results Found,2024-09-17T12:17:38.112Z,https://www.cnn.com/entertainment/live-news/sean-diddy-combs-arrested-nyc-09-17-2024/index.html,"Read the latest on our coverage of Sean Combs’ arrest here Sean “Diddy” Combs will be held by himself at the Special Housing Unit in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until his next court appearance Wednesday afternoon, according to a law enforcement official. The special housing unit is separate from the general prison population and is used to house inmates who require additional protection, among other reasons.  Many high-profile individuals have been temporarily held in MDC — including R. Kelly, Sam Bankman-Fried and Ghislaine Maxwell. Combs will appeal the decision to hold him without bail in front of US District Court Judge Andrew Carter on Wednesday. If the appeal is denied, Combs will be remanded back to the detention center. What happened in court today: Combs was denied bail and will remain in custody as he faces charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, a federal judge ruled. His lawyer said after the hearing they would appeal the decision. Combs also pled not guilty to the charges against him. A federal judge ruled Tuesday Sean “Diddy” Combs will remain in custody while the case against him plays out – a decision his lawyer said would be appealed Wednesday. Here’s what prosecutors and the defense argued during Combs’ detention hearing: Federal prosecutors said at least a dozen witnesses personally observed the music mogul’s violence against women or the injuries they sustained at his hands. Prosecutors also noted Combs had reached out to victims and witnesses, some of whom are scared of him. Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson said Combs’ alleged efforts to cover up and obstruct investigations were additional reasons for detainment, citing a March 2016 incident captured on hotel surveillance that shows him beating his then-girlfriend at a Los Angeles hotel as “critical” evidence of his physical danger. Johnson said Combs should be detained because he is a “serial abuser and a serial obstructor,” adding pretrial services also recommended detention. Combs’ defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked the court to allow his client to remain out on bond prior to trial, saying he had no plans to flee and had “earned” the court’s trust. Combs came to New York less than two weeks ago believing that an indictment was imminent, Agnifilo said. The rapper came to surrender because he didn’t want anybody to be hurt if he was arrested at home. He also said the indictment was “arguably better than we imagined” given the flurry of lawsuits from multiple accusers over the past year.” The attorney argued the 2016 assault video is not evidence of sex trafficking, as prosecutors suggested, but evidence of Combs “having more than one girlfriend and getting caught.” You can read more takeaways from the indictment here. Speaking to reporters after Tuesday’s bail hearing, Sean “Diddy” Combs’ lawyer Marc Agnifilo sounded frustrated with the federal prosecutors after Combs was arrested the previous night. “He came here to turn himself in. Why doesn’t the government want him to turn himself in? Because then they can’t ask for detention,” Agnifilo said.  “All we can do is show good faith. He got on a plane and he came here,” he added. “They arrested a guy who came here to turn himself in.” Agnifilo said he will argue the same points again Wednesday, when a different judge will hear their appeal at 3:30 p.m. ET at the same New York courthouse. “We’ll make it as much as we can until we get him out.” Sean “Diddy” Combs’ lawyer said his team is going to appeal the decision to hold the hip-hop artist and music mogul without bail. Judge Robyn Tarnofsky ruled on Tuesday that Combs will stay in custody while the case plays out. Combs was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The lawyer reiterated that he believes Combs “didn’t do these things.” Combs pleaded not guilty to all of the charges earlier today. Agnifilo said the bail appeal will take place in the same courtroom on Wednesday, in front of a different judge. Sean “Diddy” Combs has been denied bail and will remain in custody as he faces charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. Judge Robyn Tarnofsky told him her concern is “this is a crime that happens behind closed doors, even when pretrial services is monitoring.” Combs was charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The judge told Combs there were no conditions she could find to assure her that he would appear in court if released. Combs’ defense attorneys proposed to put him on home detention with a $50 million bond secured by his Miami residence, according to a bail motion earlier today. Combs did not react when the judge made her ruling. He took a sip of water from a bottle at the table before he was led out of the courtroom. This post has been updated. Judge Robyn Tarnofsky has returned to the courtroom after taking a brief recess, with pretrial services joining her in the robing room. This headline and post have been updated The hotel surveillance video that shows Sean “Diddy” Combs beating his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura in 2016 is not evidence of sex trafficking, as prosecutors suggested, according to Combs’ attorney. Leading up the the actions on the video, Combs’ attorney said Ventura discovered Combs had more than one girlfriend. “She hit him in the head with her cellphone” while he was sleeping and left him in the hotel room with no clothes, Agnifilo said. More context: In the video, Ventura exits a hotel room and walks to a bank of elevators. Combs, holding a towel around his waist, runs down a hall after Ventura. He grabs her by the back of the neck and throws her to the floor. Still holding his towel closed with one hand, he then turns to kick her, the video shows. As Ventura is on the ground, Combs retrieves a purse and suitcase from the floor near the elevators. He turns around and kicks Ventura again as she lies motionless on the floor. About 4 seconds transpire between the two kicks, according to the video. He then briefly drags Ventura by her sweatshirt toward a room before walking away. After the video came out, Combs apologized for assaulting Ventura, saying in a video statement posted on Instagram, “My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.” CNN’s Sandra Gonzalez and Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed reporting to this post. An attorney for Sean “Diddy” Combs said in court Tuesday that the federal indictment against him was “arguably better than we imagined” given the flurry of lawsuits from multiple accusers over the past year. Attorney Marc Agnifilo made the argument as he asked the court to allow Combs to remain out of jail ahead of his trial on charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. The case, he argued, is about one victim and a 10-year relationship that involved occasional sex with a third party. “The government never says anybody didn’t consent” in the indictment, he said. In a rebuttal, Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson rejected those points. “I want to clarify the record — we are most certainly proceeding on a theory of lack of consent,” she said. “This is not a case about one victim. There are multiple victims,” she added. Since last November, Combs has been hit with 10 lawsuits – nine directly accusing him of sexual assault. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked the court to allow Sean “Diddy” Combs to remain out on bond prior to trial, saying he had no plans to flee and noting Combs had “earned” the court’s trust. “Trust is earned and we have earned it,” Agnifilo said. Combs came to New York less than two weeks ago believing that an indictment was imminent, Agnifilo said. The rapper came to surrender because he didn’t want anybody to be hurt if he was arrested at home. “We took this investigation absolutely seriously,” Agnifilo said. Agnifilo said he took Combs’ and his family members’ passports and reported all of his domestic travel since he became involved in the investigation as a show to prosecutors they were taking this seriously. In addition, Combs is in treatment and therapy, which Agnifilo says is a reason for his release. The attorneys wrote in a letter to the court that he should be placed on home detention with a $50 million bond secured by his Miami resident. Federal prosecutors are arguing that Sean “Diddy” Combs should not be released on bail because he has reached out to witnesses and victims — and some witnesses say they are scared of him. Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson told the judge Tuesday that the investigation uncovered evidence of Combs allegedly assaulting victims by choking, hitting, kicking and dragging victims, often by their hair. Combs has reached out to some victims, according to Johnson. After Dawn Richard, a former member of a music group Combs started, filed her lawsuit on September 10, Combs reached out to another member of the band who publicly denied the allegations three days later. Johnson said Combs called and texted that other woman 58 times in four days. Richard has accused Combs of sexual battery, sexual harassment and false imprisonment, among other allegations, in a civil lawsuit filed in New York federal court. According to Johnson, Combs also reached out to a different victim after she filed a lawsuit in November. Combs tried to contact that person twice over three days. In a recorded call, Combs urged the victim — who was financially dependent on him — to say she willingly engaged in sex acts, Johnson said. The prosecutor said “the risk of danger is acute” if Combs were to be released on bail. Johnson cited other high-profile cases where the defendants were detained, including cases against R. Kelly, Jeffrey Epstein and Keith Raniere. Federal prosecutors argued Sean “Diddy” Combs should be detained ahead of trial in part because he has previously tried to cover up and obstruct investigations, including in a March 2016 incident captured on hotel surveillance. The surveillance video exclusively obtained by CNN showing Combs beating his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, the artist known as “Cassie,” at a Los Angeles hotel is “critical” evidence of his physical danger and his effort to obstruct, Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson said. Combs attempted to bribe a hotel security officer with a handful of cash, which the officer refused, she said. Days later, the surveillance video disappeared from the hotel servers, she said. “That is not a coincidence,” Johnson said. In November 2023, Ventura sued Combs and accused him of rape and years of abuse, and an attorney for Combs said he “vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations.” They settled the lawsuit a day after it was filed. But when CNN published the explosive surveillance video in May, Diddy posted an Instagram video apologizing. “My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,” he said. Johnson argued that his denials prior to the video’s publication makes “crystal clear you cannot take defendant at his word. He lies to cover things up.” “The risk of danger is acute,” Johnson said. “Witnesses have universally expressed fear of the defendant.” Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson is arguing that Sean “Diddy” Combs should remain in custody while the case against him plays out. It is part of the detention hearing happening in federal court right now in front of Judge Robyn Tarnofsky. Combs pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges minutes ago. Johnson said Combs should stay in detention because he is a “serial abuser and a serial obstructor.” Johnson said pretrial services also recommended detention. The attorney said at least a dozen witnesses personally observed Combs’ violence toward women or the injuries they sustained at the hands of Combs. Johnson also cited Combs’ access to weapons. “What sets this case apart from others,” Johnson said, is Combs acts to obstruct the investigation. Sean “Diddy” Combs pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges in court Tuesday afternoon. He stood briefly and said “not guilty,” in a clear voice, according to the CNN correspondent in the courtroom. There are no cameras allowed inside. The indictment from the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York charges Combs with three counts: racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Sean “Diddy” Combs has entered the New York courtroom. He walked into the courtroom wearing a black T-shirt and gray workout pants with a black stripe down the side, looking stunned. His hands were clasped behind his back and not cuffed. He walked into the room from a side door and sat between his attorneys. Two US marshals are standing behind him and the courtroom is silent, awaiting the judge. Sean “Diddy” Combs’ attorneys are arguing that the media mogul should be released on bail ahead of a trial, according to a letter to the judge on Tuesday. It comes after federal prosecutors previously said he should be kept in custody while the racketeering and sex trafficking case against him proceeds. In the letter, Combs’ attorneys told the court that their client “is not a risk of flight or a danger to anyone in the community.” That is in direct contrast to prosecutors saying Combs was a flight risk “even without a passport, private plane, or multiple residences,” according to the detention letter in which they laid out the Combs’ resources. The defense attorneys argued that Combs “travelled to New York to self-surrender” when it was apparent that he would be formally charged. This, among other examples included in the letter of how Combs has been cooperative throughout the investigation, is a display of Combs’ “trustworthiness and lack of flight risk,” his lawyers said. Combs’ defense attorneys proposed to put him on home detention with a $50 million bond secured by his Miami residence, according to the motion. Prosecutors previously argued that that was “plainly insufficient.” A three-count federal indictment from the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York against the hip hop artist Sean “Diddy” Combs lays out in an overarching summary the serious and sprawling allegations against him. Combs was charged with three counts: racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Here are some of the key takeaways from the indictment. Combs accused of leading criminal enterprise: The first charge in the indictment is racketeering conspiracy, a federal crime used to target organized criminal syndicates, known as an “enterprise,” such as the Mafia. In Combs’ case, according to the indictment, the “Combs Enterprise” consisted of: Indictment notes 2016 video of Combs beating woman: The indictment accuses Combs of years of abuse and specifically notes the surveillance video exclusively obtained by CNN showing him beating his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, the artist known as Cassie, at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. Combs “engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,” the indictment states. “This abuse was, at times, verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.” Law enforcement seized guns and “Freak Off” supplies in raids of Combs’ homes: Law enforcement seized guns, ammo, drugs and a huge collection of baby oil and lubricant during searches of Combs’ homes in Miami and Los Angeles in March, according to the indictment. The indictment alleges Combs held what he called “Freak Offs,” or elaborate sex performances in which he drugged and coerced victims into extended sex acts with male sex workers. In addition, the indictment alleges Combs’ associates at times carried firearms and accuses Combs of brandishing firearms “to intimidate and threaten others.” An attorney for a former member of Danity Kane, a musical group formed by Sean “Diddy” Combs, told CNN that his client “is grateful the DOJ has decided to pursue” charges against the media mogul and that she’s looking forward to a fair trial. Dawn Richard has accused Combs of sexual battery, sexual harassment and false imprisonment, among other allegations, in a civil lawsuit filed in New York federal court last week. Her attorney Arick Fudali said that more than anything his client wants the truth to come out.   The lawyer would not comment on whether his client would testify in the federal case against Combs, but did say that given the allegations of witness intimidation in the case, “we’re not going to be intimidated, certainly Ms. Richard is not going to be intimidated.” Sean “Diddy” Combs is trying to sell his house in Los Angeles and his plane — but federal prosecutors argue he should still be kept in custody while the racketeering and sex trafficking case against him proceeds. The prosecutors filed a letter outlining that Combs has “access to dozens of bank accounts — some personal and many under corporate entities — which contain millions of dollars.” The letter also said Combs has owned a personal plane since about 2019, as well as multiple vehicles in various locations. Combs’ defense lawyers have his passport and the passports of several of his family members, the letter said. “As explained above, however, the defendant’s vast resources make him a flight risk even without a passport, private plane, or multiple residences,” prosecutors argue. Combs’ defense attorneys proposed to put him on home detention with a $50 million bond secured by his Miami residence. Prosecutors argued in the detention letter that that was “plainly insufficient.” CNN’s Eric Levenson and Nicki Brown contributed reporting to this post. US District Attorney for New York’s Southern District Damian Williams alleged that Sean “Diddy” Combs could become “violent” when he “didn’t get his way.” “When Combs didn’t get his way, he was violent and he subjected victims of physical, emotional, and verbal abuse so that they would participate in the Freak Offs,” he said in a Tuesday news conference. He also outlined that “Combs hit, kicked, threw objects at and dragged victims — at times by their hair,” Williams said. As a reminder: A “Freak Off” was a sex performance that was allegedly planned and controlled by Combs, in which he electronically recorded victims and supplied them with narcotics. Sean “Diddy” Combs was arrested Monday night at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan and taken into custody by Homeland Security Investigations after months of controversy, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. A federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday revealed that Combs faces a number of charges. During a news conference, US attorney for Southern District of New York Damian Williams said that the investigation is ongoing and that he’s not taking “anything off the table” regarding the possibility of additional charges in the future. Here’s what we know so far about the case: After Diddy’s arrest on Monday night, his attorney said the hip-hop star had been “cooperative” with investigators. “To his credit, Mr. Combs has been nothing but cooperative with this investigation and he voluntarily relocated to New York last week in anticipation of these charges,” attorney Marc Agnifilo told CNN. However, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York pushed back on that characterization in a news conference Tuesday. “Generally, and with increasing frequency, the word cooperative or cooperating has taken on tremendous elasticity, and it no longer really bears any relation to what the word means when we use it in a very specific context,” US Attorney Damian Williams said. United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams has outlined some of the items seized from raids on Sean “Diddy” Combs’ properties in Miami and Los Angeles in March this year. Among the items seized by law enforcement were AR-15 rifles, ammunition and a large capacity drum magazine. They also seized electronic evidence of the “freak offs” held by Combs. The indictment released Tuesday described a “freak off” as a sex performance in which Combs allegedly organized the transportation of commercial sex workers across state lines and internationally. These events “occurred regularly, sometimes lasted multiple days, and often involved multiple commercial sex workers,” it said. The attorney pointed to the drum magazine on a poster board at a news conference as he outlined what had been seized. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams alleged that Sean “Diddy” Combs used his business associates, staff and others “to help conceal his abuse.” These individuals allegedly included high ranking supervisors, personal assistants, security and household staff, who “facilitated the ‘freak offs.’ They booked the hotel rooms and stocked them with the supplies, including drugs, baby oil, personal lubricant, extra linens and lighting. When the hotel rooms got damaged, they cleaned it up.”  Williams also alleged that these associates “arranged for victims and commercial sex workers to travel for the ‘freak offs,’” and delivered large quantities of cash to Combs “to pay for the commercial sex workers.” US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams expressed his confidence in prosecuting Sean “Diddy” Combs’ case in New York.  “We have an outstanding track record of bringing some of the most impactful sprawling complex (and) difficult, sex trafficking, human trafficking, labor trafficking (cases). You name it, the Southern District of New York can do it,” he said, responding to a question about why Combs was being prosecuted in the state when search warrants were previously executed at Combs’ homes in Miami and Los Angeles. Williams added that “the scope and complexity of this investigation isn’t something that we ran from.” “It’s something that we embrace and we will continue to do that,” he said. Prosecutors are seeking to detain Sean “Diddy” Combs ahead of trial, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said Tuesday. The federal prosecutors filed a letter with the court explaining their reasoning, but Williams did not elaborate on the details it contained. “There is a presumption of detention in a case like this, and we think that’s warranted,” he said. The investigation into Sean “Diddy” Combs is still ongoing, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said on Tuesday. Williams noted that Combs was given a key to New York City just last year, and has now been arrested and charged. Williams said that anyone with information can call 1-877-4-HSI-TIP. His office also shared an email in its news release:Sextrafficking_outreach@hsi.dhs.gov The official thanked the witnesses and victims who have “used their voices and helped bring this criminal conduct to light. We would not be here without them.” He also thanked the agents who have helped on the case. Asked by a reporter if there could be other charges brought related to this, Williams said, “I’m not taking anything off the table.” This post has been updated with more details from Williams on next steps in the case. Sean “Diddy” Combs allegedly gave victims a series of party drugs during extended sex performances he called “Freak Offs,” US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said Tuesday. “As alleged, Combs used force, threats of force and coercion to cause victims to engage in extended sexual performances with male commercial sex workers, some of whom he transported or caused to be transported over state lines,” he said. Combs allegedly planned and controlled the sex performances, which he called “Freak Offs,” and he often electronically recorded them. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said that Sean “Diddy” Combs’ physical abuse to victims resulted in injuries that took “days or weeks to heal.” Williams cited an incident that took place at a Los Angeles hotel that was reported on. US attorney for Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, outlined the charges against Sean “Diddy” Combs for racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and interstate transportation for prostitution at a news conference Tuesday. Williams said that “between at least 2008 and the present, Combs abused, threatened and coerced victims to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation and conceal his conduct.” “Sean Combs led and participated in a racketeering conspiracy that used the business empire he controlled to carry out criminal activity, including sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and the obstruction of justice,” he added. This post has been updated with more on the charges against Combs. The indictment against music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs alleges he used his vast resources and business associates to “lure female victims” into his orbit “often under the pretense of a romantic relationship.”  It describes sex performances known as “Freak Offs” in which Combs allegedly organized the transportation of commercial sex workers across state lines and internationally. These events “occurred regularly, sometimes lasted multiple days, and often involved multiple commercial sex workers.”  Controlled substances were a regular part of the performances, according to the indictment, in part “to keep victims obedient and compliant.” The complaint says Combs kept videos of people having sex at the gatherings.   Prosecutors offer details on the sorts of supplies they say Combs required for these performances, which among other items included IV fluids, lubricants and lighting.  During these parties Combs is alleged to have “subjected victims to physical, emotional and verbal abuse.” Victims of his abuse, the complaint claims, were threatened with a loss of income or livelihood if they resisted participating in the parties.  The three-count indictment alleges  Sean “Diddy” Combs “engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern” of physical, verbal, emotional and sexual abuse “toward women and other individuals.” The indictment also alleges that on numerous occasions from 2009 and on, he “assaulted women by, among other things, striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them.” The complaint alleges further that Combs used his various businesses and employees “to carry out, facilitate, and cover up his abuse and commercial sex.” According to the complaint, his businesses includeBad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises, and Combs Global — which comprise an apparel line, alcohol spirits business, marketing agency, recording labels and a recording studio as well as a media company and television network. The Combs businesses, the complaint argues, attempted to engage in “sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.”  Prosecutors wrote that Combs was able to secure “absolute loyalty” from members of his businesses through “acts of violence and threats” and that the Combs Enterprises avoided detection for illegal activities through “acts of intimidation, manipulation, bribery, and threats of retaliation against individuals who witnessed the crimes committed by members and associates of the enterprise.”  Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs is accused of creating and running a “criminal enterprise” through his business empire that for decades engaged and attempted to engage in crimes including sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice, according to a wide-ranging federal indictment released on Tuesday. A news conference will be held at 11:30 a.m. ET at the US attorney’s office detailing the indictment against Sean “Diddy” Combs. Combs was charged Tuesday with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking in a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday in New York.  The allegations are part of sweeping 14-page complaint.  We will bring you the latest updates from the news conference as we get them. Sean “Diddy” Combs is in pretrial services right now being processed, according to a law enforcement offical. The timing of his initial court appearance is still unclear.  Sean “Diddy” Combs has been charged with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking in a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday in New York.  Read the full indictment here: With the unsealed federal indictment against Sean “Diddy” Combs on Tuesday involving charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, attention is once again being turned to the women in his life. It was his former girlfriend singer Cassie Ventura’s lawsuit last year which stirred interest in the personal life of the rapper and mogul. In the suit, she documented their relationship and alleged Combs raped her and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their more than a decade together. That has raised speculation about who Combs was and is behind closed doors in his relationships with various women from his mother, Janice Combs, to the late Kim Porter, who was the mother of three of his biological children and a son Combs raised. Read more about the women in his life here. Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs was charged Tuesday with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking in a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday in New York.  The allegations are part of sweeping 14-page complaint.  Combs is going to plead not guilty, his attorney Marc Agnifilo said Tuesday.  “He’s not guilty. He’s innocent of these charges,” Agnifilo told reporters as he entered the courthouse in lower Manhattan.  Combs was arrested Monday night.  Agnifilo said Combs relocated to New York City two weeks ago in anticipation of the charges. He said he anticipated a “long battle with a good result for Mr. Combs.”  A law enforcement official has told CNN that Sean “Diddy” Combs is present in court today. The federal indictment that details the charges against him was unsealed Tuesday in New York. CNN is reading through the indictment now and will bring you the details as soon as we have them. A federal indictment against music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, which details the charges against him, was unsealed Tuesday in New York.  Combs has been the subject of an ongoing federal probe stemming from sexual assault allegations made in several lawsuits against him. On Tuesday, Combs’ attorney Marc Agnifilo said he expected the charges to relate to racketeering and sex trafficking, but he had not yet seen the indictment.  Combs is going to plead not guilty, Agnifilo said. “He’s not guilty. He’s innocent of these charges.”  CNN is reading through the indictment and will update with detailed information on the charges.  One of the key events leading to Sean “Diddy” Comb’s downfall was surveillance video – exclusively published by CNN in May – showing him physically assaulting and kicking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. In the video, Ventura exits a hotel room and walks to a bank of elevators. Combs, holding a towel around his waist, runs down a hall after her. He grabs her by the back of the neck and throws her to the floor. Still holding his towel closed with one hand, he then turns to kick her, the video shows. As Ventura is on the ground, Combs retrieves a purse and suitcase from the floor near the elevators. He turns around and kicks Ventura again as she lies motionless on the floor. About four seconds transpire between the two kicks, according to the video. He then briefly drags Ventura by her sweatshirt toward a room before walking away. Ventura is then seen slowly standing up. She gathers items from the floor and moves to pick up a phone on the hallway wall near the elevators. Combs, still in the towel and socks, returns. A mirror directly across from the security camera shows Combs appearing to shove Ventura. Seconds later, he sits down on a chair, grabs an object off a table and forcefully throws it toward Ventura. The explosive video contradicted Combs’ earlier comments denying any wrongdoing. In November 2023, Ventura sued Diddy and accused him of rape and years of abuse, and an attorney for Combs said he “vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations.” They settled the lawsuit a day after it was filed. In response to CNN’s surveillance video, Combs posted an Instagram video apologizing and acknowledging wrongdoing. “I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now,” he added. “I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I’m so sorry. But I’m committed to be a better man each and every day. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry.” An attorney for Sean “Diddy” Combs, Marc Agnifilo, said he has not seen the indictment yet but expects Combs to be charged with racketeering and sex trafficking charges today. “We knew this was coming,” he said Tuesday as he entered court. Agnifilo said Combs moved to New York two weeks ago in anticipation of being charged. He said his client would plead not guilty. Agnifilo said Combs is in good spirits and is confident. “He is dealing with this head-on the way he’s dealt with every challenge in his life, and he’s not guilty. He’s innocent of these charges,” he said. The attorney also said he would “fight like hell to get him released,” adding that he believed Combs should be released because of “all that he’s done and coming here voluntarily.” Sean “Diddy” Combs appeared to not have a care in the world moments before his arrest Monday night. In video obtained by TMZ, the mogul is seen looking jovial as he greets a group of men on the street in New York City. According to the site, the video was taken in Midtown Manhattan approximately 30 minutes before Combs was taken into custody by federal authorities at the nearby Park Hyatt Hotel. His attorney has said Combs relocated to his hometown of New York City in light of a federal investigation centered around him. Sean “Diddy” Combs has faced months of controversy. Here’s what to know: March raids: Authorities searched Combs’ homes in Miami and Los Angeles because he is a target of a federal probe carried out by HSI, the lead investigative arm of the US Department of Homeland Security, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the case. The investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches. HSI is responsible for investigating transnational crime and threats, including human trafficking, terrorism, narcotics smuggling and other organized criminal activity. The raids came weeks after a lawsuit was filed against Combs by Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones. November lawsuit: Combs settled a suit brought by his former girlfriend, singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, who alleged she was raped and subjected to years of repeated physical and other abuses by Combs. Civil lawsuits: Since November, Combs has been hit with 10 lawsuits, nine directly accusing him of sexual assault. As previously reported by CNN, several of those accusers have met with federal investigators for questioning as part of the wide-ranging probe. Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs’ 10 bedroom, 13 bathroom Los Angeles home has just been listed for sale for $61.5 million. Combs bought the house in 2014 for just over $39 million, according to Zillow. The ad describes the house as “one of the most spectacular and beautiful estates in Holmby Hills” spanning over 1.3 acres. The house has a large living room, formal dining, wine cellar, office, gourmet kitchen with a family room and a catering kitchen, according to the ad. One thing prospective buyers should know is that this same house was raided in March as a part of a federal sex trafficking investigation. Marc Agnifilo, an attorney for Sean “Diddy” Combs, told CNN on Monday night that the musician had been cooperating with the investigation that led to the indictment and “voluntarily relocated to New York last week in anticipation of these charges.” Agnifilo said they were disappointed that the US Attorney’s Office decided to prosecute his client. His team maintains his innocence and says he has “nothing to hide.” Tyrone Blackburn, an attorney who represents three people who filed civil lawsuits against Sean “Diddy” Combs relating to allegations of sexual assault, said Monday night that the arrest was “the first step for our clients receiving justice.” Details about the charges against Combs were not immediately released. The office of the US attorney for the Southern District of New York expects to move to unseal the indictment this morning, that office has said. Blackburn represents Lil Rod, April Lampros and Grace O’Marcaigh, each of whom filed separate civil lawsuits against Combs this year. Lil Rod and Lampros’ lawsuits accused Combs of sexual assault, while O’Marcaigh’s lawsuit accused Combs of aiding and abetting someone accused of sexual assault. Those three suits were among the 10 filed against Combs since November, nine of which accused Combs of sexual assault. Damian Williams, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on social media that the indictment in the case against Sean “Diddy” Combs would be unsealed this morning. “Earlier this evening, federal agents arrested Sean Combs, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time,” he posted on X on Monday.  A grand jury voted to indict Thursday, September 12, according to the source. Correction: A previous version of this report gave the incorrect day the grand jury voted to indict. It was Thursday, September 12. CNN exclusively reported in May that federal investigators were preparing to bring accusers of Sean “Diddy” Combs before a federal grand jury for testimony. The significant escalation in the government’s investigation signaled the Justice Department was moving toward potentially seeking an indictment of the rapper and businessman."
Kamala Harris just got one of her best polls of the year | CNN Politics,"Updated 10:56 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T12:00:19.808Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/harris-trump-iowa-poll-wisconsin/index.html,"One of the best pollsters in America recently came out with its latest survey, and it’s good news for Kamala Harris. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., found Donald Trump at 47% to the vice president’s 43% – within the margin of error – in a state the former president has twice won comfortably. (The poll was conducted last week, before Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Trump.) While the Hawkeye State is unlikely to be pivotal in November, the fact that Selzer found a close race in a state Trump has dominated could signal good things for Harris, both in terms of the accuracy of polling and for her chances in next-door Wisconsin. What makes the Selzer survey so important is that it’s been accurate in an era when other pollsters have struggled. Four years ago, it had Trump up in Iowa by 7 points days before the election, when other polls had Democrat Joe Biden in a much better position. I noted at the time that “this one poll is giving Trump backers hope and Democrats anxiety.” Democrats had good reason to worry. Not only did Trump end up winning Iowa by 8 points, he also vastly outperformed his polling in Wisconsin – nearly winning a state where he had trailed by high single-digits in preelection polling. Trump would do significantly better in many other battleground states as well. A similar scenario played out in 2016. Selzer’s final poll had Trump ahead by 7 points in Iowa. He went on to win the state (by 9 points) and the election over Hillary Clinton, doing better than most swing-state surveys said he would. This year, a lot of people, myself included, have wondered whether there could be another polling misfire. Even as many pollsters have tried to change how they conduct and/or weight their polls to prevent what happened in 2016 and 2020, they could still get it wrong. Selzer’s latest Iowa poll, however, suggests that other pollsters who show a race that is way too close to call are not underestimating Trump at this point. The result also makes sense when you look at the numbers coming out of neighboring Wisconsin, which has comparable demographics. Wisconsin is one of the seven battleground states where the polling remains tight. Harris, though, has received some of her best polling from the Badger State. The most recent poll from the reputed Marquette University Law School put Harris at 52% to Trump’s 48% among likely voters. An average of recent polls from Marquette, CBS News/YouGov and CNN/SSRS has Harris up by 4 points. A 4-point advantage is not wide and can easily be overcome by Trump, but it stands out among the other key swing states. Harris and Trump tend to be closer in the other six battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania). Moreover, the 4-point Harris edge is better than Biden’s winning margin in Wisconsin in 2020 – 0.6 points. That result fell well short of the lead he had in preelection state polling. The Badger State polls also overestimated Clinton four years earlier to such an extent that she became the first Democrat to lose Wisconsin since 1984. The fact that the Selzer poll is indicating a similar shift in Harris’ favor in Iowa makes me think the Wisconsin polls may be on to something. Now, a win by Harris in Wisconsin would not guarantee her victory by any stretch. Even if you give her the state’s 10 electoral votes (along with the states already leaning her way), she’d need to carry at least two of the other six battleground states. Carrying Wisconsin, however, would improve Harris’ chances of winning. Instead of the race being roughly 50/50, most modelers would give her closer to a 75% chance of winning if she won Wisconsin. That’s a big shift in Harris’ direction. Still, a 75% chance of victory is not a guarantee of anything. Trump’s chance of winning would basically be the equivalent chance of a coin landing on heads in two consecutive tosses. This Selzer poll could also be an outlier, and much could change between now and Election Day. Selzer’s September 2020 poll was a lot more favorable to Biden (showing a tie) than its final survey that year. But the current poll is a far better result than the previous Selzer survey from June – when Biden was still in the race. It had Trump up by 18 points. The bottom line: You’d much rather have the Selzer poll in your corner than not. And right now, the survey shows a better result for Harris than it did in the end for either Clinton or Biden. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that polling overestimated Hillary Clinton’s margin in Wisconsin during the 2016 election."
Trump and Harris get back on the trail after another campaign-shaking moment | CNN Politics,"Published 6:00 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T10:00:19.807Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-campaign-tuesday/index.html,"Former President Donald Trump is set to hold his first rally Tuesday night since the second apparent assassination attempt of the former president, traveling to Flint, Michigan, for what’s being billed as a town hall hosted by his former White House press secretary, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, will sit for an interview in Philadelphia with the members of the National Association of Black Journalists – a major unscripted moment for a candidate who has largely stuck tightly to her message. It’s the same group to whom Trump falsely said weeks ago that Harris only “happened to turn Black” in recent years. The events come in the wake of the Secret Service on Sunday preventing a potential shooter from firing at Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course — stopping what could have been the second attempt on the former president’s life. They’ll offer a window into how the next phase of the campaign could play out — particularly for Trump, who is traveling to Michigan for an event that had been aimed at criticizing President Joe Biden and Harris’ record in one of the nation’s most important swing states. Trump on Monday unleashed a series of attacks, blaming Harris and Biden for this latest apparent attempt on his life. He argued Monday to Fox News Digital, in his first interview since the incident, that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.” He similarly lambasted the Democratic president and vice president on his Truth Social website. Biden conceded after the first assassination attempt it was a “mistake” to tell supporters he wanted to “put Trump in a bull’s-eye,” but neither he nor Harris showed any signs they would ease off their warnings about the danger Trump posed to democracy. At last week’s debate, Harris cited the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, the riots in Charlottesville and Trump’s prediction of a “bloodbath” should he lose as examples of his dangerous rhetoric. “Let’s turn the page on this,” she urged. Trump also has a long history of incendiary rhetoric and violent imagery – a point some Democrats made Monday. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said at a canvassing event for Harris’ campaign that Trump “plays to people’s fear, he plays to people’s anxiety. He defines us with hate and fear.” “This violence has to stop, but we also need to understand who and what he is and how much he is contributing to it,” Dingell said. Harris’ campaign on Monday sought to avoid discussing the apparent assassination attempt in a political manner. While the White House did not respond directly to Trump’s accusation that Sunday’s would-be shooter was acting upon his belief in “the rhetoric of Biden and Harris,” few aides believed the former president was speaking in good faith. Both Biden and Harris maintained their plans Monday following Sunday’s incident in Florida, a stark change from when Biden’s campaign pulled down its political advertising and canceled planned campaign travel by the president and vice president following the first attempt on Trump’s life over the summer. It’s a precarious moment for Trump’s campaign, with the first ballots going out at a time when the polling lead he held for the first half of the year has evaporated and his fundraising advantage is gone. Harris exited last week’s ABC debate with momentum, with 63% of debate-watchers saying the vice president turned in a better performance on stage in Philadelphia to Trump’s 37%, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. A glaring warning sign for Trump came Sunday when a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll conducted by Ann Selzer – one of the nation’s most respected pollsters, and an expert in the Hawkeye State – found that Trump’s lead in Iowa was just 47% to Harris’ 43% among likely voters. The former president was up 50% to 32% against Biden in June, the same poll found. Iowa has not been expected to be a competitive state – Trump won there by 8 percentage points in 2020. But the poll found an uptick in the likelihood of voting among a number of Democratic-leaning groups, including women, college-educated Iowans, city-dwellers and those under age 45. An ABC News and Ipsos poll released Sunday found Harris with a lead over Trump nationally, with 52% support among likely voters to Trump’s 46%. It also found a clear gender gap: Women who are likely to vote break for Harris 55% to 44%, while male likely voters split evenly, 49% for each. Trump spent the hours after the apparent assassination attempt in Florida talking to allies and advisers on the phone, including while he was in lockdown at Trump International Golf Course. Multiple sources that spoke to him said that Trump seemed to be in good spirits. One source said Trump joked at that he was two under par at the time of the shooting and said he was in the middle of a “wonderful game of golf.” Another source said Trump asked what was being said in the media about the apparent second assassination attempt. A third source, who was briefed on a conversation with the former president, said he was adamant that he was going to win in November. Because of the circumstances around Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, including Trump being quickly rushed to safety and placed under lockdown, Trump’s team was briefed far faster than they were after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, when some staff was left in limbo about Trump’s overall state for hours. While some close to Trump said that they were initially startled by the news there had been shots fired near the former president, they were also told immediately that Trump was safe and in a secure location. Trump’s Secret Service team quickly briefed members of the campaign on what had transpired while Trump was still in lockdown, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. What was starkly different about the Butler shooting and the Florida attempt, though, was how quickly Trump pivoted to political attacks. Following the shooting in Pennsylvania, the former president issued calls for unity – avoiding the immediate leap to political attacks that he made on Monday. That July shooting occurred when Biden was still in the race and struggling to overcome his poor June debate performance. Days later, Biden would exit, Harris would clinch the Democratic nod to replace him and Trump’s lead would vanish. The apparent assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend, which has once again prompted bipartisan condemnation of political violence, is also likely to fuel concerns about Harris’ safety when she is out on the campaign trail. The campaign has heard from numerous allies and supporters in recent weeks urging the team to avoid outdoor rallies altogether, believing that indoor events are much easier to secure, according to a source. Harris’ rallies have largely been indoors, except for two occasions – at a venue in Wisconsin and at a brewery in New Hampshire. The latter event was especially exposed, resulting in a large, protective glass box around the podium. While outdoor rallies aren’t completely off the table, the campaign is expected to continue to host most of its rallies indoors, according to a source familiar. The campaign, which for its part has been careful about trying to avoid any perception of politicizing Sunday’s incident in any way, is keenly sensitive to rhetoric that appears aimed at trying to incite violence against the former president. At a campaign event in Michigan over the summer, following the first attempted assassination of Trump, Harris acknowledged the delicate balance campaigns are forced to strike amid heightened political rhetoric. “On Sunday evening, our President Joe Biden issued a call for unity and there must be unity around the idea that while our nation’s history has been scarred by political violence, violence is never acceptable. There can be no equivocation about that,” she said at the July event. “At the same time, the hallmark of American democracy – the hallmark of any democracy – is a strong competition of ideas, policies and a vision for the future. And just as we must reject political violence, we must also embrace a robust discussion about what is at stake in this election,” she added."
Harris campaign sees opportunity to reach some male voters on reproductive rights | CNN Politics,"Published 4:00 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T08:00:19.685Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/harris-reproductive-rights-male-voters/index.html,"Marcia Ruberg is old enough to remember what the country was like for women before the Supreme Court established a federal right to abortion in 1973, and the nearly 50 years that followed. On Sunday, the 69-year-old retired psychologist, whose shirt read “Vote Like it’s 1973,” joined about 100 voters at a stop on the Kamala Harris campaign’s bus tour supporting reproductive rights. Her husband, Gary Goldberg, was by her side. “I’m here to support my wife and everybody else that deserves the right to have freedom of their reproductive rights,” said Goldberg, a 70-year-old retired computer software developer. Abortion access has long been viewed as an electoral issue that primarily motivates, and affects, women. But Democrats hope that the impact of the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision — which was made possible by Trump-appointed conservative justices — and the wave of state abortion restrictions that followed, has created an opportunity to rally more men behind the cause. The goal is not to persuade large swaths of men, but to broaden the range of people who see reproductive rights as an issue that touches their own lives. Even small gains — through a combination of driving up turnout among Democratic men and persuading some moderates and independents — could make a difference in states like Pennsylvania, where the presidential race will likely be decided by a razor thin margin. The Harris campaign has tied the issue to a larger fight over freedom and utilized surrogates to share their personal stories of how abortion bans threatened the lives of pregnant women and their ability to conceive in the future. Many of those speakers have been men, from vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff to the spouses of women who have shared their experiences. Women clearly feel the impact of abortion restrictions, said Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. “But we know that it impacts families as well,” she said. “It impacts fathers, husbands, spouses.” And that message has resonated with some men whom CNN spoke to at the Philadelphia bus tour stop. “I want all my nieces and all the women I love to have the ability to take care of their own bodies, make decisions about their own bodies, period,” said Michael Cook, 62, from Yardley, Pennsylvania, who attended the event with his spouse. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that the election will come down to whether voters are more motivated by the issues that favor Republicans – the economy, inflation and immigration – or abortion, which is Democrats’ best issue. But the intensity of a voter’s views on certain issues matters as well. “Everything we know now is that there are far more people motivated by the economy and inflation than there are motivated by abortion,” Ayres said. “But the people who are motivated by abortion are very intense and very motivated.” Recent polls show that voters trust Harris more on abortion policy than Trump. But voters – especially men – are more likely to rank the economy as their top issue and say they have more faith in the former president to handle it. A CNN poll released earlier this month found that 40% of likely voters in Pennsylvania – including 46% of men and 34% of women – rated the economy as their top issue, while 12% of likely voters – including just 4% of men and 18% of women – said abortion was their top issue. Women trusted Harris to handle abortion rights by a 56% to 31% margin, while men preferred her by 45% to 40%. Samuel Chen, a Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist, said whenever campaigns can take an issue that affects a portion of the electorate and broaden it – in this case, by expanding discussions on abortion to include health care — they have an effective tool. At the same time, he argued, there’s no precedent for reproductive rights being a driving issue for men.  “You hear a lot of men talk about supporting women’s issues, women’s rights and reproductive rights issues like this, in support of their female counterparts, but those men were likely Democratic voters to begin with,” said Chen, a past staffer for former Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. “You don’t usually see this as a turning point issue for men that are independent, that are on the fence, that are ticket splitters.” But Mike Mikus, a Democratic strategist based in Pittsburgh, said even small gains with men could help the Harris campaign in the state. “You don’t need a big shift in the electorate,” he said. “Small shifts can have very big impacts.” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro pointed to recent election cycles – in which he and other Democrats beat anti-abortion Republicans – as evidence that men are also motivated by reproductive rights. He also argued Harris has been able to speak to voters on both reproductive freedom and the economic anxiety some feel. “I think Kamala Harris understands how to walk and chew gum at the same time,” Shapiro told CNN. “I think she’s put forth plans to address both economic worries as well as our fundamental freedoms.” According to AdImpact data, more than $21 million of the $87 million that Harris’ campaign has spent on broadcast TV ads has gone to spots that reference or discuss abortion. More than $4 million of that total has aired in Pennsylvania. Pro-Harris outside groups have made abortion an even more significant share of their messaging — of the almost $90 million that Democratic outside groups have spent on broadcast TV since President Joe Biden dropped out, nearly $40 million has gone to ads referencing abortion. Republicans, by contrast, have totally avoided abortion in presidential advertising. Out of $175 million spent on broadcast TV by GOP advertisers, including the Trump campaign and its allies, since Biden dropped out, none of the ads have mentioned abortion. The Harris campaign’s Reproductive Freedom bus tour, which launched in Florida earlier this month, has featured some of what advocates call abortion storytellers, including Hadley Duvall, a reproductive rights advocate and rape survivor. In addition to the Philadelphia stop, Duvall is scheduled to appear at tour events in Scranton and Allentown. The bus tour is also making Pennsylvania stops in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Humanizing the real-life impact of abortion bans that went into place after Roe was overturned with surrogates has been a cornerstone of the campaign’s strategy, said Morgan Mohr, Harris’ senior adviser for reproductive rights. “The advantage of this tour is that it’s its own vehicle, no pun intended, through which we can engage surrogates and celebrities like you’re seeing here today, and leaders like Governor Shapiro,” Mohr said. Several of the campaign’s male reproductive rights surrogates, including TV actors Tony Goldwyn and Zachary Quinto, will appear at a Men for Reproductive Freedom coalition event at the Friday Pittsburgh stop of their bus tour, a campaign spokesperson told CNN. The event will be led by Josh Zurawski, the husband of Amanda Zurawski, who was the lead plaintiff in a case challenging Texas’s total abortion ban. Amanda Zurawski went into sepsis and developed scar tissue that permanently closed one her of fallopian tubes after her water broke early and she was denied miscarriage care, according to court filings. The couple has become surrogates for the Harris campaign on reproductive rights, including at last month’s Democratic National Convention. “I’m here because the fight for reproductive rights isn’t just a women’s fight,” Josh Zurawski said at the Chicago convention. “This is about fighting for our families, and, as Kamala Harris says, our future.” Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, pointed to his DNC speech as an example of how the Harris campaign can effectively message to men on the issue. “I think it’s about drawing them into a bigger picture of the fact that they are likewise impacted when abortion bans have made pregnancy more dangerous,” Johnson said. Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women’s Law Center Action Fund, argued the vice president’s efforts to tie reproductive rights to her broader pitch on freedom is also drawing men in. “It helps people understand that the issue of abortion access, and reproductive freedom generally, is connected to all of our freedoms,” Graves said. At the recent bus tour stop in Philadelphia, Shapiro was the headliner, but Duvall’s remarks elicited the most emotion. The room was silent as she told the audience that she became pregnant at age 12 after being raped by her stepfather, who had sexually abused her since she was five. She described feeling hope knowing she had the option to terminate the pregnancy, which ultimately ended in a miscarriage, and said she wouldn’t have that option today. Kentucky, her home state, bans abortion at all stages except to save a pregnant patient’s life or physical health, with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. “I will vote for the younger me who deserved so much better and who deserved the options that she had,” Duvall said. Duvall appeared in an ad during last year’s Kentucky governor’s race – hitting the GOP candidate for not supporting rape and incest exemptions – that Democrats credit with helping Gov. Andy Beshear win reelection. Sitting aboard the Harris campaign’s tour bus, Duvall said she’s seen her story resonate with people because she could be anyone’s daughter, niece, sister, wife or neighbor. “That’s what’s so scary, is that you hear that there are women going through these traumatic incidents and not able to get abortion care, and then men have the audacity to say it’s not their issue,” she said. “There is not a single man who doesn’t have a woman who is significant in their life, and that makes it everybody’s problem.” Several of the male Harris supporters in the crowd pointed to those women as they discussed their support for reproductive rights. Chris Scholding, a 50-year-old union electrician, said he was there because he has two daughters – a 20-year-old college student and a four-year-old toddler – and he felt a second Trump term would pose a broad threat to people’s rights. Larry Padersky, a 60-year-old registered Republican from New Jersey who attended the Harris event with his 28-year-old daughter, said he doesn’t want the government infringing on anyone’s pursuit of happiness and said he was moved by Duvall’s story. “It really rips your heart out to hear a true individual’s testament of what happened to her,” he said. “And I know that she’s not alone. If you hear stories like that, it just strengthens my opinion on reproductive freedoms.”"
Analysis: Why these three states are the most consistent tipping point in American politics | CNN Politics,"Updated 8:59 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T04:00:21.516Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/17/politics/blue-wall-states-harris-trump-analysis/index.html,"Whether measured by campaign advertising, candidate visits, organizational effort or nervous obsessing over poll results, Michigan, Wisconsin and above all Pennsylvania have moved to the top of the priority list for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump – just as they have in seemingly every recent presidential election. Trump won the presidency in 2016 by stunning Democrat Hillary Clinton to win all three states by a combined margin of about 80,000 votes. President Joe Biden won back the White House in 2020 by recapturing all three states by a combined margin of around 260,000 votes. Since Harris took over at the top of Democratic candidate in July, the candidates have spent more money in advertising in Pennsylvania than anywhere else, with Michigan ranking second and Wisconsin fourth, according to data provided to CNN by AdImpact, an advertising tracking service. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin rank first, second and fourth as well in the amount of advertising the campaigns have reserved through November (with only Georgia intruding as number three on both lists.) Bob Shrum, the long-time Democratic strategist who now serves as the director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California, said the three Rust Belt battlegrounds have remained pivotal in presidential elections for so long because they encapsulate so many of the entrenched divisions that now define American politics – between, for instance, urban and rural areas and white-collar and blue-collar voters. “They reflect the polarization,” Shrum said. In a clear statement of their priorities, the campaigns have spent nearly $120 million more on ads in the three big Rust Belt battlegrounds than they have in the four Sunbelt states they are contesting (Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada). After camping out in Pennsylvania for her debate preparation, Harris is appearing in all three of the big Rust Belt battlegrounds again this week. Trump is holding a town hall in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday. Other political operatives point out that the historic tendency of these three states to vote the same way in presidential elections functionally makes them the nation’s largest swing state at a time when the other biggest states lean reliably toward one party or the other (California, New York and Illinois toward Democrats; Texas, Florida and Ohio toward Republicans). Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are not carbon copies. But they do share enough common characteristics that the long-time Democratic strategist Tad Devine argues they should be thought of effectively a single state – what he calls “Mi-Pa-Wi.” Each of them is less racially diverse than the nation overall, according to data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Whites account for about three-fourths of the population in Michigan and Pennsylvania and roughly four-fifths in Wisconsin. Although their Latino communities are growing, Blacks remain the largest minority group in each of them. The three states are also slightly older than the nation overall, with seniors accounting for about one-fifth of the population in each. None have many immigrants, with residents born abroad accounting for only about 7% of the population in Michigan and Pennsylvania and just 5% in Wisconsin. All three have seen minimal population growth in recent years. At a time when education has become an increasingly powerful predictor of political allegiance, the three converge, with about one-third of their adults holding at least a four-year college degree – just slightly below the share in the nation overall, the Census found. The median income just slightly lags the national average in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and trails by a larger margin (about 10%) in Michigan. All three are big manufacturing states that have seen substantial job loss in that sector since 2000, but have also seen employment in it increase by about 20,000-30,000 jobs since Biden took office, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In their religious orientation, they are very similar too: White Christians, who generally lean Republican, comprise about 55% of adults in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and just over half in Michigan, according to newly released findings from the Public Religion Research Institute. Meanwhile, voters with no religious affiliation, who have become a staunchly Democratic group, represent about one-fourth of the population in all three, PRRI found. While the big three Rust Belt states look similar on all these measures, in some other respects Wisconsin, on paper, should be the most difficult state of the three for Harris this year. Not only is the minority share of the population smaller in Wisconsin than the other two, but Whites without a college degree (the core of the modern GOP coalition, especially in the Trump era) cast about three-fifths of the votes there compared to about half in Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at the non-partisan Brookings Metro think tank. Heavily White and blue-collar small town and rural areas, which have moved toward the GOP almost everywhere, also constitute a much bigger share of the vote in Wisconsin than in the other two. In a six-category geographic measuring system, devised by the non-partisan Center for Rural Strategies, small metros and non-metros cast nearly 50% of Wisconsin’s votes in both 2016 and 2020, compared to about 30% in Michigan and 20% in Pennsylvania each time, according to results provided to CNN by Tim Marema, the center’s vice president and editor of its Daily Yonder website. Conversely, Democrats don’t have as strong an asset in Wisconsin’s largest metro area as in the other two states. The county centered on Milwaukee is only about half as big as the counties that encompass Philadelphia and Detroit, and doesn’t provide Democrats nearly as large a vote advantage, particularly with turnout there lagging in recent years; simultaneously, while Democrats have steadily gained ground in the suburban so-called WOW counties outside Milwaukee, Republicans still win those three big counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington), by bigger margins than almost any other major suburbs north of the Mason-Dixon line. One last factor makes Wisconsin on paper less attractive to Democrats: unions only represent about half as much of the private sector workforce in Wisconsin as they do in the other two states, according to federal figures. Election results over the past few decades have frequently reflected the tougher demographic and geographic challenge that Wisconsin presents for Democrats. While Wisconsin provided bigger margins for Barack Obama than Pennsylvania in his two races, Democrats won by more in the Keystone State in 2000, 2004 and 2020. In 2022, Wisconsin was a much tighter squeeze for Democrats than the other two: Democrat Tony Evers won the governor’s race there by a significantly smaller margin than fellow Democrats Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson narrowly held his seat (while the GOP was simultaneously surrendering an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania). Yet this year, strategists in both parties consider Wisconsin the best bet for Harris, and the toughest challenge for Trump, among the big three Rust Belt battlegrounds. One reason is the enormous growth in Wisconsin’s second largest city, Madison, which is at once the state capital, the home of its flagship public university, and a burgeoning biotech and finance center. Even as Dane County, which encompasses the city and its suburbs, has added population faster than any other Wisconsin county, it is also becoming more blue: The Democratic share of the vote in Dane County has increased from 70% in the 2016 presidential election to 75% in the 2018 gubernatorial and 2020 presidential elections, to 79% in the 2022 governor’s race, to 82% in the hard-fought 2023 state Supreme Court election that revolved around the issue of abortion rights. The other key to Democrats’ success in Wisconsin is that the party has remained competitive in smaller places, a key priority for party chair Ben Wikler. According to the Center for Rural Strategies, a larger share of residents in Wisconsin than in Michigan and Pennsylvania live in mid-sized cities and Democrats run better in such communities than in the other two states. These include places like Eau Claire, Appleton, La Crosse and the “BOW” counties (Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago) centered on Green Bay. Pete Giangreco, a Democratic consultant who has worked in Wisconsin, said the party’s continuing competitiveness in the Green Bay area is symbolic of its broader reach in the state – and key to its ability to win it. “The Green Bay market is kind of the bellwether of every [Wisconsin] election, [and] it’s been trending more our way,” he said. “It’s because there has been a lot more college-educated people and people of color moving there. You’ve had a lot of people leave Milwaukee and leave Chicago and go up there. That’s not like Scranton or Wilkes-Barre in Pennsylvania, which used to be Democratic, [but] are really going the other way.” Michigan recently has been the strongest of these three states for Democrats. Not only have Democrats run better there than in the other two in every presidential election since 2000, but the party now controls all four of the elected statewide constitutional offices (three of which are held by women), both US Senate seats and both chambers of the state legislature. (Democrats are defending an open US Senate seat this year.) But this year, operatives in both parties consider Michigan a closer call for Harris than Wisconsin. “Michigan has some weird things going on,” said GOP pollster Gene Ulm, who is working in the state. “There are some x factors there.” Michigan’s principal “x factor” is anger in its large and previously Democratic-leaning Arab American population over the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza. That unhappiness has spilled over more broadly among young people on college campuses. Michigan Democrats must also contend with a concerted push by Trump to convince auto workers that the Biden administration’s efforts to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (which Harris supports) will destroy domestic jobs. And while Biden was the candidate, Democrats faced the risk of depressed turnout among Black voters, especially younger men. But Democrats have significant offsetting assets in the state. The focus on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade has turbocharged the party’s advance in white-collar suburbs around the state, particularly among women: exit polls in 2022 found that Whitmer won nearly 70% of college-educated White women. As in Wisconsin, Democrats have also retained their competitiveness in Michigan’s many mid-sized cities better than they have in most states; also as in Wisconsin, Michigan Democrats traditionally have run slightly better with working-class Whites than they do in most places. With Harris replacing Biden, organizers are cautiously optimistic as well about reinvigorating turnout among Black voters. “There was such a lack of enthusiasm over these last few months, a shot in the arm that maybe we have a chance is palpable for folks,” said Branden Snyder, a senior adviser to Detroit Action, a grassroots group that mobilizes working-class and younger voters of color in Michigan. “And there are people who are apolitical who are excited about the prospect of a Black woman being the president of the United States.” That leaves Pennsylvania as the consensus toughest of the three states for Harris. It’s also the state analysts generally consider the most likely to provide the 270th Electoral College vote for the winner in November. (Wisconsin played that role in both 2016 and 2020.) “To me, the tipping point is Pennsylvania,” said Giangreco. “If we win Pennsylvania, [Harris] is going to be president. It’s really, really hard to see where you win Pennsylvania and you lose Michigan or Wisconsin. It’s not going to happen.” The same broad trends reshaping the political landscapes in Wisconsin and Michigan are evident in Pennsylvania. As in the other states, Democrats are gaining in white-collar suburbs, especially in the Trump era: Biden in 2020 won the four big suburban counties outside Philadelphia by nearly 300,000 votes – over 100,000 more than even Clinton did four years earlier. But, as in other states, Democrats have been concerned about the risk of depressed turnout and some gains for Trump among Black voters in Philadelphia. And Republicans have built an imposing and enduring advantage among the state’s large population of non-college educated White voters. Exit polls in 2020 showed that Trump won working-class White voters in Pennsylvania by a larger margin than he did in the other two states. The Center for Rural Studies’ typology likewise shows that Trump ran much more strongly in mid-sized and smaller communities in Pennsylvania than he did in the other two states. That may be at least partly because the loss of manufacturing jobs over the past generation has been even more severe in Pennsylvania than in the other two battlegrounds. “Pennsylvania has just become a much better state” for Republicans, said Ulm, noting how the Democrats’ lead in Pennsylvania voter registration has shrunk since 2020. “Places that used to be Democratic bastions aren’t anymore.” Dante Chinni is founder and director of the American Communities Project, which has developed another well-respected classification system to sort the nation’s political geography. Chinni says that in Pennsylvania (as well as the other two states) many of the places where Trump runs best are what the project calls “Middle Suburbs” – middle-income places outside urban centers predominantly filled with White working-class voters, like the blue-collar counties around Pittsburgh. “These were union strongholds…and in the past that’s meant they were Democratic,” Chinni said. “But they’ve shifted. They’ve become Trump-y. Usually he runs up vote in tiny places. But these are Trump’s most reliable concentration of dense votes.” Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini said he’s dubious that Harris is as strong in Wisconsin as most public polling now shows. And he believes all of this year’s unusual factors keep Michigan in play for Republicans despite the Democrats’ inherent demographic strengths there. But he agrees Pennsylvania is Trump’s best chance to peel off one of the big three Rust Belt states. As an older White Catholic with roots in the state, Ruffini said, Biden benefited in Pennsylvania’s eastern areas from a “regional strength” he displayed throughout the Northeast. “I’m skeptical Harris can recreate this,” Ruffini said. “Moreover, the issue environment might be worse for Harris in Pennsylvania than elsewhere due to the fracking issue and lingering sympathy [for Trump] from the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting.” Democrats, however, see the possibility of Harris amassing huge margins in the Philadelphia suburbs with voters who support abortion rights and reversing some of the turnout decline that Biden suffered among Black voters in the city itself. “Nirvana is getting 2016 numbers in the city of Philadelphia and 2020 numbers in the Philadelphia suburbs,” said Geoff Garin, a long-time Democratic pollster. “If you do that…your arithmetic in the state starts to be pretty good.” For any of these three states to vote differently than the other would depart from recent political history. For Michigan and Pennsylvania to diverge would depart from a much deeper trend. All three states were cornerstones of what I labeled in 2009 “the blue wall”: the 18 states that ultimately voted Democratic in all six presidential elections from 1992 to 2012. The three states moved out of the blue wall together in 2016 when they each went narrowly for Trump and then together moved back into the wall in 2020 when they each broke narrowly for Biden. In all, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have now voted the same way in every presidential election since 1980 except in 1988, when Wisconsin backed Democrat Michael Dukakis and the other two went with Republican George H.W. Bush. The three states have even elected the same party to control their governorships in every election since 1994 – except in 2014, when a Democrat ousted a Republican in Pennsylvania while GOP incumbents won reelection in the other two. The convergence between Michigan and Pennsylvania stretches back much further. It probably didn’t seem particularly noteworthy in 1856 when Pennsylvania backed Democrat James Buchanan for the presidency and Michigan supported John C. Fremont, the first nominee of the newly formed Republican Party. But Michigan and Pennsylvania would not vote for different presidential candidates again for the next 76 years, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won Michigan and Pennsylvania stuck with incumbent Herbert Hoover in 1932. Eight years later, the two states split again, when Roosevelt comfortably won Pennsylvania and Michigan narrowly went to Republican Wendell Willkie. But once again, those New Deal-era splits proved the exception to a remarkable run of convergence. Michigan and Pennsylvania have again voted for the same candidate in every presidential election since 1940 except one: in 1976, Michigan supported its native son, Republican President Gerald Ford, while Democrat Jimmy Carter won Pennsylvania. Add it up and Michigan and Pennsylvania have diverged in their preference just four times in the 42 presidential elections since Republicans and Democrats became the principal alternatives in the American political system. The two states even moved together to reject the two parties in 1912 when they were among the mere six states that backed former President Theodore Roosevelt’s third-party bid. This trio of states has arguably become the most consistent tipping point in American politics. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have voted for the same presidential candidate in 17 of the 26 elections since 1920; the candidate who swept these states won 15 of those 17 campaigns. In the nine elections since 1920 when they split their vote, the candidate who carried two of these three states won seven times. Over the past century, the only presidential candidates who swept these states and lost were Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004; the only candidates who won two of them and lost were Republican Thomas Dewey in 1948 and Democrat Hubert Humphrey in 1968. The history of convergence between these three states – and especially between Michigan and Pennsylvania – is no guarantee they won’t tilt in different directions in November. As Garin pointed out, “Given how close the results have been in these states in the last couple of elections … they could be pretty darn close to one another and still have different outcomes.” Nor is there any guarantee that the candidate who wins more of them will win the White House: Harris faces a real risk she could win both Michigan and Wisconsin and still fall short if Trump wins Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina. The one thing that is certain: whatever the outcome in November, the burly battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – the political state of “Mi-Pa-Wi”– will be pivotal in it."
Vance blames liberal rhetoric for apparent assassination attempt against Trump | CNN Politics,"Updated 7:01 AM EDT, Tue September 17, 2024",2024-09-17T00:37:43.900Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/vance-rhetoric-trump-harris/index.html,"JD Vance on Monday blamed liberal rhetoric for the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump over the weekend. “I know it’s popular on a lot of corners of the left to say that we have a both sides problem. And I’m not going to say we’re always perfect. I’m not going to say that conservatives always get things exactly right. But you know, the big difference between conservatives and liberals is that we have — no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months,” the Republican vice presidential candidate said at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition dinner in Atlanta. “I’d say that’s pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric, and needs to cut this crap out,” he continued. Vance vowed to “do my part” to tone down the rhetoric and said he was speaking particularly to those who say that Trump needs to be “eliminated.” “Somebody’s gonna get hurt by it, and it’s gonna destroy this country. Somebody is gonna get hurt. And you think about what an incredible wound it would open up in the United States of America, all of us, and I promise I will do my part to tone down the rhetoric,” Vance said. “But in particular, the people telling you that Donald Trump needs to be eliminated. You guys need to cut it out, or you’re gonna get somebody hurt.” Trump earlier Monday confirmed he had spoken with President Joe Biden over the phone, saying in a statement that the pair “had a very nice call” and that it was about US Secret Service protection. Biden – who told reporters Monday that he wants Congress to give the Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the incident – conveyed his relief that Trump was safe during the call, which a White House spokesperson described a “cordial conversation.” Vice President Kamala Harris similarly said Sunday that she was thankful that Trump is safe. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” she said. Monday morning, Elon Musk deleted a post on X that questioned why Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while Biden and Harris have not encountered any. Musk removed the post after initially resisting numerous calls Sunday night to do so. The X owner later claimed it was a joke. The White House called the comment “irresponsible” and said violence should be “never encouraged or joked about.” The Secret Service said it has seen Musk’s deleted post, with a spokesman for the agency declining to comment directly on it but saying the agency investigates all threats to the president and vice president. “The U.S. Secret Service is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence,” a Secret Service spokesman told CNN. “We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.” On Sunday, a Secret Service agent fired at a suspect, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the person, who later fled in a car. The Secret Service later said the suspect had no line of sight on the former president. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, has been charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number in connection with the incident. He appeared in federal court Monday morning. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors seek to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate the incident."
Biden becomes a top Harris surrogate as they split up on the campaign trail | CNN Politics,"Published 6:40 PM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T22:40:15.880Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/politics/biden-harris-campaign-trail/index.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden worked to shore up support among key constituencies during separate events Monday, an example of their strategic attempt to divide and conquer the campaign trail with the race to November heating up. In battleground Pennsylvania, a must-win state for Harris, Biden spoke to a Philadelphia conference attended by leaders of historically Black colleges and universities. For the fourth time in a week, Biden’s official remarks began with a nod to his onetime running mate, who’s now at the top of the ticket. “I want to get to something straight at the outset,” Biden told the audience, to cheers. “I love Kamala!” Harris, meanwhile, met with a key Democratic constituency behind closed doors: Union members. The vice president held a roundtable discussion with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, whose leadership has been withholding an endorsement before learning more specifics on each candidates’ platform for organized labor. The divided ground game by the vice president and her boss-turned-top surrogate, aides say, is all part of a plan. “We’ve got to be everywhere, blocking and tackling,” one Harris aide told CNN. Harris is working to strike a delicate balance between embracing the Biden-era policies that voters like while ensuring the electorate she’d represent generational change from her predecessor, whose approval rating has been underwater through much of his presidency. And on the campaign trail – and the debate stage – she’s now pointing to her own policy platform and messaging, establishing some distance from the current administration. Biden and Harris have appeared in an official capacity together at least four times since she’s ascended to the top of the ticket – welcoming Americans released by Russia at Joint Base Andrews, touting lower drug prices through Medicare negotiations, participating in September 11 commemorative events and speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus’ annual Phoenix awards dinner. But only once have they been side by side in a campaign capacity, which advisers say is likely to be an increasingly rare occurrence going forward. On Labor Day, Harris and Biden appeared with a half-dozen labor leaders at a Pittsburgh union hall for a raucous rally focused on working-class issues. But the optics appeared to favor the principal rather than the No. 2. Cheers of “Thank you, Joe” erupted at various times throughout the delivery of his remarks. Even though they were allotted the same amount of time, Biden spoke for 10 minutes longer. And when the event ended, Biden’s motorcade and plane departed before Harris’, as is custom for the president. In addition to avoiding those awkward moments, dividing and conquering carries its own benefits.  They can cover far more ground. And they can fill more seats. Harris packs ten thousand-seat arenas, whereas Biden events skew far smaller. In Pittsburgh – the union hall where the two spoke together – reached the fire marshal’s capacity, which was 600. Still there are unusual moments where the distance between Biden and Harris is on display. One of those came in last week’s debate when former President Donald Trump – Harris’ Republican opponent – attacked the vice president by saying, “She’s trying to get away from Biden. ‘I don’t know the gentleman,’ she says. She is Biden.” Harris delivered a punch that, while intended for her Republican opponent, also landed hard at the White House. “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,” she replied. Still, if the moment wounded Biden, he hasn’t let on. Even watching Harris do what he failed disastrously to do during his own debate with Trump, Biden has evinced only pride in his vice president, not bitterness. Harris’ commanding debate performance was “another validating moment” for the president, according to a senior adviser. In some ways, Biden’s decision to cede the Democratic ticket to Harris has allowed him room for other parts of his life. He watched the debate from his room at the JW Marriott Essex House in New York, where he’d traveled to attend a birthday party for one of his granddaughters at an Upper East Side Italian restaurant — the type of trip that would have been impossible if he was still the nominee. A day later, as he was visiting a firehouse in Pennsylvania on the anniversary of 9/11, he jokingly put on a Trump 2024 hat offered by a support of the former president – a moment that landed much differently than it would have if Trump was still his rival for the presidency. And when, during that interaction, the Trump supporter called the president an “old fart,” the moment felt somehow more jovial now that Biden’s advanced age is no longer a central issue in the campaign. There’s precedent for splitting up on the trail. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore sought distance from scandal-marred President Bill Clinton as he campaigned against George W. Bush. And in 2020, Biden and former President Barack Obama – as private citizens, four years after leaving office – did not appear together until the final weeks of the race. Aides believe Biden can still help in areas of Pennsylvania, for example, and the president has discussed a tour of the Keystone State with its governor, Josh Shapiro. Biden is now one of several high profile surrogates the Harris campaign will seek to deploy. Obama and his wife, Michelle, along with Bill and Hillary Clinton, are also expected to stump for Harris in the leadup to November. Positioning Biden among the roster of other high-wattage Democratic talent will be a sensitive operation, one person familiar with the matter acknowledged, but one the campaign remains eager for. And Biden remains eager to promote her. Speaking at the Black Excellence Brunch the White House co-hosted on Friday, Biden made his enthusiasm abundantly clear as he nodded to the possibility she could make history as the first female Black president. “Kamala wanted to be here today, but she’s traveling,” Biden told the crowd on the White House South Lawn. “She’s always there with us. We’ll always be there for her.”"
She left behind her life in the US to race camels in the UAE. Now she’s hoping to inspire other women to follow in her tracks | CNN,"Published 8:09 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2024",2024-09-16T12:09:35.485Z,https://www.cnn.com/sport/camel-racing-uae-taylor-dees-spc/index.html,"Straining every fiber to stay atop the 1,000 pound camel churning up sand two meters beneath her as it gallops at over 40 kilometers (24 miles) an hour, Taylor Dees is a long way from Texas. It’s around 12,700 kilometers (7,890 miles) from her hometown of Moulton to the Saudi Arabian city of Taif, and it takes just two more for her to clinch victory at the Crown Prince Camel Festival’s first ever all-women race. That was back in August 2023, just one year on from her mounting a camel for the first time. It turns out that Dees — who rode horses frequently as a child — is as fast a learner as she is a rider. “It really starts with an awareness of animals and awareness of your own body,” she told CNN. “Once you get into the rhythm and you understand how the animal is moving and how you can move with the animal, it’s quite easy.” Dees moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2017, after falling in love with the country on vacation. Now living in the capital of Abu Dhabi, the dietician balances her roles as a business owner and mother with that of being a trailblazing figure in her sport. The racing of dromedaries, a single-humped species also known as the Arabian camel, is a centuries-old passion in the region and endures in both popularity and lucrativeness, with prize money reaching multi-million-dollar figures. However, it’s a storied history that has been predominantly written by men — until recently. Dees is one of the many success stories to emerge from the UAE’s Arabian Desert Camel Riding Center (ADCRC), co-founded by German expat Linda Krockenberger. Krockenberger, who moved to the UAE in 2015, tried for years to find a place to ride, but was frequently turned down on account of her gender. In a 2022 interview she told CNN she recalled once being told “It will be good if you can dress like a boy.” Krockenberger opened the school in 2021, and she says it received the first ever license for a camel riding center in the country. The ADCRC launched the UAE’s maiden all-women camel racing team — a development that immediately piqued Dees’ interest. “I think so many times, particularly around animals, women are seen as too fragile or too feminine to be able to be in that environment,” said Dees. “Yes, we can be more fragile and feminine, but we can also be very strong and very brave and be very physically fit in order to ride camels.” Dees, has raced in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia — including in the ancient city of AlUla — but will be taking a season off from competing with the ADCRC. Though there are typically one to two months between events, Dees has a rigorous weekly training regime that focuses heavily on endurance. Trots gradually progress to short and then long runs as a way of building stamina and ensuring both camel and rider arrive on race day at peak fitness. “The outcome of the race is so reliant on the fitness and quality of the camel,” Dees explained. “Yes, your riding style, form, and ability plays a part but even the best rider will not win on a camel that is less fit than the camel next to it.” Upon her return next season, Dees will saddle up against other talents that have emerged from the ADCRC, including Krockenberger, Jordan’s Rawan Salah, and French-native Coralie Viroulaud, victor of last season’s all-women C1 Championship. Yet Dees does not see the trio as rivals. She welcomes the competition, paradoxically because competition is not her primary motivation. “I don’t race to win,” Dees explained. “I do it because, first and foremost, it’s fun. Second, I want people to see that as women, we are strong, we are confident, and we can do things that maybe men perceive we cannot. “Each international race is a bit bigger, which I love because it means that there are more women who are willing to step out of their comfort zone and who are willing to step out of this very male-dominated sport and prove that yes — women can not only do it, but we can do it very well, we can do it very safely and we can be successful in it as well.”"
Live updates: Trump apparent assassination attempt on Florida golf course | CNN Politics,No Results Found,2024-09-16T10:54:15.892Z,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-assassination-attempt-election-news-09-16-24/index.html,"Our live coverage has ended. Read the latest on the apparent Trump assassination attempt here The suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump has been hit with two gun-related charges.   As the Secret Service, FBI and local authorities investigate further, the Republican presidential nominee and his running mate, JD Vance, are blaming the rhetoric of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, with Trump saying the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.”  Here are the latest developments:  Hillary Clinton said she was “surprised, shocked even” by Joe Biden’s performance during his debate with Donald Trump, saying “it just couldn’t be recovered” and that the president “made the right decision” to endorse Kamala Harris. Clinton said she was “thrilled” that Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. She also complimented Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, calling the Minnesota governor “such a breath of fresh air.” Clinton was asked if she could envision herself serving in a potential Harris administration, and she quickly dismissed the possibility. The Harris-Walz campaign is leveraging the deep legal network of Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff for a series of fundraisers this week, according to people familiar with the matter. Emhoff is headlining a virtual event Tuesday, featuring former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former White House counsel Dana Remus, and former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, with hundreds of practicing lawyers from white-shoe firms and blue-chip companies expected to attend. Organizers say they expect the event to raise millions of dollars. The program for the event is expected to touch on the importance of the rule of law, election integrity and voter protection. According to one source, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had been expected to participate. Having served as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general, Harris has crossed paths with multiple attorneys. Emhoff has served as a law partner at firms DLA Piper and Venable — lucrative roles where he developed his own Rolodex and cultivated clients in entertainment law. The industry has come out in full force for Harris. Former acting Solicitor General and Trump critic Neal Katyal, now a partner at Hogan Lovells, is hosting another fundraising event for Harris on Wednesday. Former Democratic acting Attorney General Sally Yates hosted an August reception for attorneys in Los Angeles shortly after Harris ascended to the top of the ticket. And several other lunches and receptions have popped up as other law firm partners have tapped their networks for Harris. Rob Rue, the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, said he didn’t think it was a good idea for former President Donald Trump to hold a campaign event in the city as Trump had suggested during a news conference Friday.  “It would be extremely difficult if either one of the candidates came to our community right now, and I would discourage it if I had the opportunity, just because this is not a time to campaign in our community at the national level,” Rue told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday.  Springfield has become a political flashpoint as Republicans, including Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have spread false claims that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in the town. A sheriff in Ohio is appearing to encourage people to write down the addresses of supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.  Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski made the comments on his Facebook account.  “When people ask me…What’s gonna happen if the Flip - Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins??,” Bruce Zuchowski wrote Friday about Harris. “I say…write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards! Sooo…when the Illegal human ‘Locus’ (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” Zuchowski’s post included screen grabs from recent Fox News stories that read: “Kamala’s open borders are destroying small towns,” and “Biden-Harris’ open border fuels migrant crime wave.”  CNN has reached out to Zuchowski’s office and the Harris campaign for comment.   Portage County is approximately 30 miles southeast of Cleveland. Zuchowski is also the president and chairman of the Ohio State Troopers Association and has served in public office for almost 30 years, according to his biography on the Portage County Sheriff’s Office website.   The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Ohio appeared to respond to Zuchowski’s post on Monday.  “Sheriffs are elected officials who have a duty to serve ALL members of their community. They are sworn to protect the public from intimidation and oppression,” the ACLU of Ohio said on X. “For the sitting sheriff of Portage County to be engaging in the very type of behavior he’s meant to combat is despicable.”   Former President Donald Trump on Monday said he needed more people on his security detail and suggested he told that to President Joe Biden when the president called him after the apparent assassination attempt Sunday. The White House said the two men had a “cordial conversation.” Biden conveyed his relief that Trump was safe, and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X. Earlier, Trump sought to blame Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life, saying that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that “they are the real threat.”  Former President Donald Trump explained his embrace of cryptocurrency on Monday, insisting that growing the industry in the United States would help the country compete with China. The comments are similar to some he made in July, when he promised to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the US at a bitcoin conference. Since Trump announced his support for cryptocurrency earlier this year, industry leaders and investors have donated millions of dollars to his campaign and aligned political committees. While cryptocurrency “suffers from some credibility lapses,” Trump said the industry “has a chance to really be something special.” Pointing at the Biden administration’s efforts to regulate cryptocurrency, he suggested that some figures in the industry supposedly being investigated now would face consequences if he lost the election in November. Former President Donald Trump on Monday raised questions about the first assassination attempt against him in July and claimed there were “a couple of pretty strange things going on there.” His comments followed the apparent assassination attempt against Trump as he was golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Last week, former first lady Melania Trump also raised questions about the assassination attempt in Butler, claiming there was “more to the story.” Donald Trump praised the civilian who spotted and reported the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt against as the man was trying to flee the scene near the former president’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday. The civilian’s flag ultimately helped law enforcement officials locate the suspect’s vehicle driving north on I-95 in Martin County, one county to the north of Palm Beach. He also commended local law enforcement and the Secret Service. “They got him with a high-speed chase. … It was amazing. So Secret Service did a great job. And I think I can say honestly, the sheriff’s office, law enforcement, everybody really did a great job. Quite happy about that,” Trump added. More context on the civilian’s report: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said during a Sunday news conference that they were able to catch the suspect because a witness “came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great.” Former President Donald Trump on Monday publicly recounted the apparent assassination attempt in detail for the first time, recalling in a livestreamed discussion on X that he was playing with some of his friends when he heard gunshots. “It was quite something, but it worked out well, and Secret Service did an excellent job, and they have the man behind bars, and hopefully there for a long time,” Trump told cryptocurrency personality Farokh Sarmad. Trump recounted how a Secret Service agent saw the barrel of the suspect’s gun through the bushes. “He started shooting at the barrel, started shooting in the bushes. Could only see the barrel. … Based on that, he started shooting and ran toward the target and was shooting a lot, I mean, those were the shots we heard. The other one never got a shot off,” Trump said. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. ET Sunday after a Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence between the fifth and sixth hole of Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, Florida, in a tree line near a heavily traveled road. This post has been updated with additional remarks from Donald Trump. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said the “big difference” between conservatives and liberals is that “no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris” in the past couple of months and now two people have tried to kill Donald Trump — which he sees as “strong evidence” that Democrats need to “tone down the rhetoric.” At the same time, Vance promised to do his part to tone down the rhetoric. He was speaking particularly to those who say Trump needs to be “eliminated,” referring to New York Rep. Dan Goldman, who said in an interview last year that Trump “has to be eliminated.” Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she reacted with “horror” to the news of a second apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Vice presidential nominee JD Vance said he was with his 7-year-old son when he got a phone call from former President Donald Trump about 10 minutes after the apparent assassination attempt on Sunday. Vance said Trump told him he was “doing fine,” but said the former president was “a little mad” because he “was about to make a birdie.”  The weapon, according to authorities, was a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope. This post was updated with the description of the weapon provided by authorities. The Secret Service said it has seen Elon Musk’s deleted post about the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The post raised the question of why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had not been targeted. Musk later posted several times that it had been a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. A spokesperson for the Secret Service declined to comment directly on the post but said the agency investigates all threats to the president and vice president. Some background: Musk initially resisted calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But the X owner was ultimately persuaded by a post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. However, Musk subsequently responded to a similar post, replying with a thinking face emoji to a photo that noted the four presidents who preceded Trump faced no assassination attempts when Trump has apparently encountered two. X did not respond to a request for comment. The White House called Musk’s comments “irresponsible.” The suspect in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was “nonplussed” when he was taken into custody, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect, seemed alert but “never asked, ‘Well, what is this about?’” said Snyder, who was there when Routh was detained. His relaxed demeanor contrasted with the chaos of the moment, according to the sheriff. Routh remained calm even as he was surrounded by armed deputies with K-9 units and a helicopter overhead. A witness who happened to take a picture of Routh’s car and license plate as he allegedly fled the golf course after being shot at by the Secret Service was “crucial” to apprehending the suspect, Snyder said. Within 15 minutes, a road deputy had spotted the car based on the witness’ photo. Authorities flew the witness in a helicopter to the site to help identify Routh, according to Snyder. The post was updated with more details from the sheriff’s interview. Sen. Lindsey Graham was incredulous Monday that a man with a gun was able to get close to Donald Trump at his golf course Sunday during an apparent assassination attempt. Graham, a Trump ally and top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was asked if the Secret Service did its job in protecting Trump.   “I would say the guy did. But how can you say the system worked when a guy was able to get an AK-47 by the fence in a bunch of bushes and it’s just fortuitous the guy stuck the barrel out so the guy could see it,” he told reporters adding that Trump should continue playing golf despite what happened. The weapon, according to authorities, was a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell opened his remarks on the Senate floor Monday by expressing gratitude that Trump is safe and demanded assurances the former president is receiving the appropriate level of security. This post was updated with the description of the weapon provided by authorities. Law enforcement officials are working to learn more about the suspect in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump over the weekend. Meanwhile, the acting Director of the Secret Service Ronald Rowe Jr. on Monday defended the level of security provided for the former president, as the second apparent assassination attempt raised new questions about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect Trump. What we know about what happened: Where the investigation stands: Charges announced today:  Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden worked to shore up support among key constituencies during separate events Monday, an example of their strategic attempt to divide and conquer the campaign trail with the race to November heating up. In battleground Pennsylvania, a must-win state for Harris, Biden spoke to a Philadelphia conference attended by leaders of historically Black colleges and universities. For the fourth time in a week, his official remarks began with a nod to his onetime running mate. “I want to get to something straight at the outset,” Biden told the audience. “I love Kamala!” Harris, meanwhile, met with a key Democratic constituency behind closed doors: union members. The vice president held a roundtable discussion with rank-and-file members of the influential Teamsters union, whose leadership has been withholding an endorsement before learning more specifics on each candidates’ platform for organized labor.

Biden and Harris have appeared in an official capacity together at least four times since she’s ascended to the top of the ticket, but only once have they been side by side in a campaign capacity. Advisers say this is likely to be an increasingly rare occurrence going forward.  Read more here After holding roundtables with all three presidential candidates this cycle, the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters could reach an endorsement decision as soon as Wednesday, a spokesperson told CNN. Most major unions have already endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, including the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. The Teamsters, with 1.3 million members across a variety of industries, is the largest union whose decision is still outstanding. Sean O’Brien, the union’s president, raised eyebrows after speaking at the Republican National Convention. O’Brien, the union said, requested speaking slots at both parties’ nominating conventions, and only the Republicans agreed. Instead, Harris met with Teamsters members during the Democratic convention. Later in the summer, O’Brien panned former President Donald Trump’s comments suggesting striking workers could be fired. O’Brien will now discuss the candidates with the group’s executive board, which will also consider the results of internal polling data. When Biden was still the Democratic nominee, sources had suggested the union could remain neutral in the election for the first time in three decades. Trump participated in a Teamsters roundtable in late January. Harris attended a rank-and-file roundtable with the Teamsters Monday in Washington, DC. Her campaign voiced fresh commitment to a slate of pro-union issues following the meeting.  A former police sergeant in Greensboro, North Carolina, said Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, had been well known to her department.  In an interview with CNN, Tracy Fulk, who said she retired in 2017, recalled receiving “several alerts” years earlier in the form of internal law enforcement reports related to Routh. “They would send out alerts saying, ‘Hey this person might be dangerous,’ and we had gotten several reports on Ryan Routh so I knew who he was,” Fulk said.   Fulk recalled a 2002 incident in which she stopped Routh because she saw him driving but knew his license had been revoked. Fulk said that as she approached his vehicle, Routh opened a duffle bag containing a firearm, prompting her to draw her weapon.   He then fled the scene and barricaded himself in his nearby business, which led to a stand-off with a police special-response team, Fulk said. He was later arrested.  Court records show that in 2002 Routh was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon, and ID card fraud. Fulk is listed on a court record as a charging officer. The barricade incident was previously described in a 2002 article in the Greensboro News & Record. President Joe Biden spoke with former President Donald Trump on Monday afternoon, and the two men had a “cordial conversation,” White House spokesperson Emilie Simons wrote on X. Biden conveyed his relief that Trump was safe, and the former president expressed his thanks for the call, Simons said. “We had a very nice call. It was about Secret Service protection,” Trump said in a statement provided to CNN. The conversation marked the pair’s second call in two months, after they spoke following the July assassination attempt on Trump. The man suspected of trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Sunday depicted himself on social media as a globe-trotting freedom fighter – tweeting at world leaders, traveling to Ukraine to support its war effort, and professing his willingness to die for the causes he believed in. In the years before Routh’s alleged assassination attempt, he posted messages online criticizing Trump and showed a deep interest in supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Routh joined X, then known as Twitter, in January 2020, and immediately began posting about politics, according to tweets saved by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Routh claimed in a 2020 post that he supported Trump in 2016, but had changed his tune on the former president – writing that “I and the world hoped that president Trump would be different and better than the candidate, but we all were greatly disappointment (sic) and it seems you are getting worse and devolving.” More recently, he suggested that Trump’s campaign slogan should be “make Americans slaves again.” Routh also displayed a sense of self-importance in messages to world leaders as early as 2020, when he tweeted repeatedly at North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Read more about Routh’s history and behavior here. Federal Election Commission records show that Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, made a series of small-dollar contributions to several Democratic presidential candidates during the 2020 election cycle. The records show that Routh made 19 contributions between September 2019 and March 2020, ranging from between $1 and $25. Candidates who Routh gave to include Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke and Tom Steyer. Routh’s largest contribution was his first, on September 15, 2019, when he gave $25 to O’Rourke’s presidential campaign. Gabbard was the last candidate to receive a contribution from Routh, when he gave $3 on March 16, 2020. There are no contributions since the 2020 cycle, according to the records. President Joe Biden called Donald Trump in the last hour following Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on the former president, but the two did not connect, a senior White House official confirmed. Biden appeared to tell reporters when he arrived at the White House late Monday afternoon that he called Trump but the former president was unavailable. The official confirmed that’s what Biden was saying to reporters. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe commended agents for their actions Sunday but said that more support and resources are needed for the agency to be at its best. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw also voiced his support for the Secret Service, noting that Trump had told him that he feels safe. Hear from the Acting Secret Service Director here: The suspect in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump “didn’t even get close to getting a round off,” the sheriff said. A Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of the fence while Trump was playing golf at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday and “immediately engaged” with the person, Bradshaw had said previously. The person fled the scene in a car and was spotted by a witness. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office later pulled over the vehicle and detained the person. The witness was able to then identify the man. The FBI is “still exploring” whether Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected of staging an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, acted alone. “Our investigation will determine that,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office at a Monday news conference. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said former President Donald Trump called him Sunday night and “thanked me for everything that we did along with the Secret Service.” The acting director of the Secret Service argued that “there’s not much difference” in security at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate between now and 2017, when the former president was in office. Ronald Rowe Jr. said Monday there is a “heavy uniformed presence” and “additional assets of the Secret Service” around the Florida property. “When you look at that footprint” when Trump was in office “and you look at it today, there’s not much difference there. There is heavy uniformed presence out there,” Rowe said. He emphasized that Trump’s round of golf on Sunday was not on his official schedule, referring to it as an “off-the-record movement.” “We put together a security plan, and that security plan worked,” Rowe said. Following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump on July 13, “the Secret Service moved to increase assets to an already enhanced security posture for the former president,” Ronald Rowe Jr., acting director of the US Secret Service, said Monday at a news briefing. Suspect Ryan Wesley Routh did not have a line of sight of former President Donald Trump when he was caught by agents Sunday, Secret Service acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. said. Routh was on the public side of the golf course fence, Rowe said at a Monday news conference. Rowe continued, “The subject who did not have line of sight to the former president fled the scene. He did not fire or get off any shots at our agents.” Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office said the agency is viewing the apparent attempted assassination of Donald Trump as “extremely serious.” The agency is “determined to provide answers as to what led up to the events which took place,” said Veltri. The FBI is working with its partners to pursue search warrants for Ryan Wesley Routh’s vehicle, cell phone and other devices, Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office said. The FBI’s investigative team, along with the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, “are actively working hand-in-hand to pursue and subsequently execute search warrants. Thus far, the warrants include a video recording device, subject’s cellular devices, a vehicle and other electronic devices located at previously known addresses,” Veltri said at a news conference Monday. The man suspected in an apparent assassination of Donald Trump had an “active online presence,” Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri said Monday. Veltri, who is from the FBI Miami Field Office, said the agency is going through all of the suspect’s posts and online search history. Some background: The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, had criticized Trump on social media and is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours near the area where he was spotted in the bushes, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. Markenzy Lapointe, US attorney, for the Southern District of Florida detailed allegations in the criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump. The US attorney also shared the contents found in the area after Routh fled, according to the complaint: The FBI has already conducted interviews with witnesses at the scene of the apparent attempted assassination Sunday of former President Donald Trump, an official said Monday. Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office said it interviewed “seven civilian witnesses at the scene.” “And that is just the beginning,” Veltri said at a news conference. He said the FBI’s Honolulu, Hawaii, and Charlotte, North Carolina, field offices are also working to interview “several family members, frields and former colleagues of the subject.” Security at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida is the “highest it can possibly be” after the apparent attempted assassination of the former president over the weekend, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Monday. Bradshaw and other officials are giving an update on the investigation into the incident. The sheriff also said he will give “every possible resource” to the Secret Service as the investigation continues. The second apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump in as many months is raising new alarms about whether the Secret Service can adequately protect the former president or whether more needs to be done to bolster the security of the Republican presidential candidate even though he’s not in office. While Secret Service agents on Sunday prevented the potential shooter from firing at Trump while golfing at his West Palm Beach course – unlike the would-be assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania – questions are again swirling about how another gunman was able to get within several hundred yards of the former president. “He’s a former president running for reelection again. We have to be able to keep him safe,” Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat and member of the congressional task force now investigating both assassination attempts, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday. While a sitting president is always afforded a different level of protection than candidates seeking the same office, a variety of credible threats against Trump and the first unsuccessful assassination attempt prompted the Secret Service to provide him with additional resources not usually offered to someone in his position. But after a second close call, even President Joe Biden recognized a problem still persists. “The Secret Service needs more help,” Biden told reporters while leaving the White House on Monday. Success in preventing the would-be gunman from firing any shots is being overshadowed by renewed questions about whether the Secret Service lacks the manpower, funding or operational flexibility to consistently protect the former president, particularly in similar outdoor settings, even as the agency’s budget has increased in the past decade. Read more here Donald Trump on Monday will unveil a new cryptocurrency business during an evening address from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the latest venture that stands to benefit the former president as he seeks another four years in the Oval Office. Details on the new business, which will be called World Liberty Financial, are limited, but Trump’s sons have spent weeks promoting it. The GOP nominee himself has teased the latest expansion of his family’s business empire from the same social media account that carries his political messaging. No major party nominee has ever leveraged their candidacy for personal profit quite like Trump has during his third White House bid. Since entering the race nearly two years ago, Trump has netted millions of dollars selling new items featuring moments from his political life while also generating billions of dollars in wealth through a social media site where he speaks directly to supporters. His fans can buy coffee table books featuring pictures and letters from his presidency or, if they prefer, a Trump-themed Bible. He has sold $399 golden sneakers and recently advertised to supporters “fifty all new stunning digital trading cards” for purchase at a cost of $99 each. Buy 75 and get access to a dinner gala with Trump, plus pieces of a suit he wore in his debate against President Joe Biden. But this latest enterprise, taking off just 50 days before the election, comes with a hornets nest of ethical conflicts should Trump win in November. On the campaign trail, the former president has promised to usher in a wave of policies favorable to digital currencies as he courted the votes and financial support of the bitcoin community. Now, a company he is helping to get off the ground could stand to benefit from the actions he takes in the Oval Office. Read more details about the potential conflicts here Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz on Monday said “violence has no place” in the United States and that she’s grateful Donald Trump is safe following yesterday’s second apparent assassination attempt against the former president.  Some background: Vice President Kamala Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and President Joe Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Former President Donald Trump spent the hours after the apparent assassination attempt in Florida talking to allies and advisers on the phone, including while he was in lockdown at Trump International Golf Course. Multiple sources that spoke to the former president said that Trump seemed to be in good spirits.  The circumstances around Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt, including Trump being quickly rushed to safety and place under lockdown, enabled the former president’s team to be briefed far faster than they were after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, where some staff was left in limbo about Trump’s overall state for hours. While some close to Trump said that they were initially startled by the news that there had been shots fired near the former president, they were also told immediately that Trump was safe and in a secure location. The Secret Service quickly briefed members of the campaign on what had transpired while Trump was still in lockdown, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened his remarks on the Senate floor today by praising the Secret Service’s quick action yesterday during the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, and indicated that the Secret Service could receive more resources as government funding negotiations continue. “I will say what I have said many times before: there is no place in America for political violence of any kind. I’m glad the former president is safe, and I applaud the Secret Service and all first responders for acting quickly before anyone got hurt. As for the perpetrator, he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” said Schumer. Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell condemned violence against Donald Trump after a second apparent assassination attempt against the former president, while also saying the GOP presidential nominee is “contributing” to the charged environment with his rhetoric and that she fears a “civil war” would break out if something happened to Trump. Referencing the second assassination attempt, Dingell said that “this violence has to stop, but we also need to understand who and what he is and how much he is contributing to it,” adding, “he has not said he’ll accept the election results.” Dingell said Trump “will not condemn some of the violence we’ve been seeing,” and pointed to Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance “defending his lying” by continuing to promote false stories about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.  Asked to support his claims about immigrants eating pets by CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, Vance pointed to what he said are firsthand accounts from constituents who have told him this is happening, though he still didn’t provide the evidence. He also denied that his rhetoric was contributing to danger in the communtity, as city hall and schools in Springfield have experienced threats. Dingell said what Vance has done is “not OK,” and “that’s what we have to remind people of. That’s who these people are. I don’t want to go back to that.” As the Secret Service grapples with another apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, the former president’s schedule could present another challenge for them — a highly anticipated college football game. According to four sources familiar with the matter, Trump is scheduled to travel to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on September 28, for the Alabama-Georgia game. Trump previously attended a game in the state when he was in office, but this would be his first time with a robust, but smaller, security presence than he had when he was the sitting president.   The stadium seats more than 100,000 people, and officials at the university were already planning about how to accommodate Trump, his staff and his detail. Trump sat in a box the last time he was in Tuscaloosa and is expected to do so again, a source told CNN.  The trip is still moving forward, but it remains to be seen whether the second shooting alters his plans. There has already been a noticeable change around Trump since the first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. He now has a ramped-up security presence and at times speaks behind ballistic glass when out in public. Former President Donald Trump on Monday told followers on X to “join me live from Mar-a-Lago” on X Spaces at 8 p.m. ET.  Trump had been scheduled to launch a new cryptocurrency business called World Liberty Financial at 8 p.m. on X Spaces. Trump’s post suggests the launch is moving forward as planned despite the assassination attempt that took place at Trump International Golf Club the day prior. One of the two federal gun laws Ryan Wesley Routh has been charged with has come under judicial scrutiny in recent years as courts have reexamined the nation’s gun laws in light of a 2022 landmark Supreme Court decision expanding Second Amendment rights. Routh, the suspect of an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Sunday, was charged Monday with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and possession of a firearm while a convicted felon.   The constitutionality of the federal law underpinning the second charge has been examined by federal courts around the country in recent years after some people convicted under it or subject to its prohibition have tried to take it off the books.   Courts have been divided on whether it is constitutionally sound. In one case, a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court that had initially said the law was constitutional as applied to a man convicted of welfare fraud said that the federal law violates the Second Amendment. It cited the 2022 Supreme Court decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, that said firearm laws must be rooted in historical tradition. But other federal courts have upheld the prohibition, including in cases concerning people convicted of violent and non-violent felonies.   The Supreme Court was asked this year to settle the question for good, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying in court papers that disagreement among lower courts about the law’s constitutionality “is undermining public safety.”  This June, the Supreme Court said that some types of regulations can withstand the strict test it created two years ago. The Supreme Court has now asked lower courts to look at cases involving the felon disarmament law with that revised structure in mind. When there were rumors of a plot against the life of Abraham Lincoln before his 1861 inauguration, there was no official protection for the president-elect. Southern states were seceding from the Union in protest of Lincoln’s election, and the rumored plot out of Baltimore led Lincoln, at the urging of the private detective Allan Pinkerton, to sneak into Washington, DC, disguised on a late-night train. During his presidency, Lincoln eschewed bodyguards despite threats. The night Lincoln was shot at Ford’s Theatre the following year, his lone guard was at a saloon next door. But incredibly, it was on the day Lincoln was shot that the president had signed legislation creating what is today the US Secret Service. However, the agency was commissioned within the Treasury Department, and the Secret Service was entirely focused on counterfeit money. The Secret Service didn’t start protecting presidents until 1894, and only part time, after agents probing a group of gamblers discovered an assassination plot aimed at then-President Grover Cleveland. Two more presidents — James Garfield in 1881 and William McKinley in 1901 — would be killed before Congress officially tasked the Secret Service with protecting US presidents full time. McKinley’s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was the first president to get round-the-clock protection, but only two agents were assigned full time to the detail. What was once just two full-time agents assigned to protect Roosevelt in 1902 has now grown to a force of thousands under the Department of Homeland Security. The entire Secret Service employs nearly 8,000 people, and it secures thousands of events each year. In fiscal year 2023, it guarded 33 “protectees.” Read more here President Joe Biden decried Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and condemned political violence in remarks from Philadelphia on Monday. Biden, speaking at the National HBCU Week Conference, commended the Secret Service for its “expert handling” of the situation and said the acting head of the agency, Ronald Rowe, is in Florida “determining whether any further adjustments need to be made to ensure the safety of our former president.” The president added that assassination “solves nothing. It just tears the country apart. We must do everything we can to prevent it and never give it any oxygen.” Attorney General Merrick Garland promised in a Monday statement to use “every available resource” in the investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump. Garland said that “the FBI is continuing to investigate what appears to be an assassination attempt of former President Trump” and that “we are grateful that the former President is safe.” Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, has an extensive criminal history in North Carolina, records show.  In 2002, he was charged with and later pleaded guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges, including resisting an officer, carrying a concealed weapon and ID card fraud.  Those are the most serious charges he faced, but the records also show a litany of less serious accusations as well — some of which were dismissed. He has faced multiple charges related to worthless checks in separate cases. While some cases were dismissed, he pleaded guilty to one such charge in 2003.  In 2009, he was charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. The case was dismissed.  In 2010, he was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods and received three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, though a court docket states the case was dismissed.  He has faced various other charges related to traffic issues. For example, in 1996, he pleaded guilty to driving with no registration. Separately, state and federal authorities have repeatedly accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time. He faced a federal tax lien in 2008 of about $32,000, according to court records. The Pennsylvania State Police provided the bipartisan congressional task force investigating the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump with the documents it requested due Monday, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  “They were responsive to our request,” the source added.  The request included a slew of documents and information from the Pennsylvania State Police, including transcripts of interviews, body-camera footage and radio communications.   The task force also requested internal communications and other information related to the July 13 event in Butler, Pennsylvania. Some background: The task force, made up of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was approved by the House in July in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, but the appointment came at a fraught political time as members work to prove to both parties that they’re thoroughly investigating the attempted assassination. The 13 lawmakers have until mid-December to issue a final report and recommendations in the investigation. Members of the task force promised last month to get to the bottom of the security failures even if it may be a “slow process,” after the group toured the Pennsylvania rally site where the shooting took place. The FBI is investigating what it said is an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Florida golf club Sunday, the second time in two months there has been an apparent attempt on the former president’s life. Trump is safe and was not harmed in the incident, his campaign said. Federal and local law enforcement are expected to provide updates on the investigation at a news briefing later today. Here’s where things stand now: Former President Donald Trump on Monday continued to try to blame Vice President Kamala Harris’ rhetoric for the apparent assassination attempt at his golf club on Sunday. In a new post on social media, the former president pointed to Harris’ statements during the ABC presidential debate, without specifying which ones.  “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe’s, then Kamala’s, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!” Trump posted on Truth Social.  Trump has repeatedly claimed the debate last week was “rigged” against him and has bashed the debate moderators and said he will not participate in another debate before the election. He also continues to baselessly claim that the criminal charges he faces and his felony conviction were masterminded by President Joe Biden and Harris because Trump is running for president.  In his first interview after the apparent assassination attempt in West Palm Beach posted earlier on Monday, Trump also sought to blame Biden and Harris for the apparent attempt on his life and argued in his first interview since the incident that “their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at” and that they are “the real threat.”   Authorities recovered an SKS-style rifle with a scope from the area Ryan Wesley Routh fled Sunday after he was spotted by a Secret Service agent, according to newly unsealed court documents.  An affidavit from Mark A. Thomas, an FBI special agent, said Secret Service agents recovered a “loaded SKS-style 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope,” as well as a digital camera and two bags, including a backpack. The affidavit included a black-and-white photo of the items law enforcement found. Routh was charged with possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.  He could face years in prison if convicted of the two charges, according to court documents. The felon in possession of a firearm charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, while the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum of five years in prison and three years of supervised release. Officials from the Secret Service, the FBI and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office will hold a public briefing at 4 p.m. ET to provide updates on the investigation into Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The briefing will take place near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump tried to bring people over to fight in Ukraine via non-official means, against the advice of the International Legion in the country, and had “delusions of grandeur,” according to a former recruiter for the military unit. Evelyn Aschenbrenner, an American citizen who served for two years in the International Legion in Ukraine, a military unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces that is composed of foreign volunteers, told CNN they warned Ryan Wesley Routh several times to use official routes to recruit people to fight in Ukraine and bring them across the border — but he just wouldn’t listen. Aschenbrenner, who identifies as gender fluid and uses “they/them” pronouns, worked as an administrator and then in an official recruiting role within the International Legion. “In August 2022, Routh put my phone number and another recruiter’s phone number on a website that he had designed. I got angry. I told him, ‘Take this down. You didn’t get our permission. The legion already has a recruiting website, there’s no need for you to be doing this. There’s already enough disinformation about Ukraine. Don’t start adding to it,’” Aschenbrenner said. Instead, Routh kept trying to bring people over the border into Ukraine, Aschenbrenner said. “In August 2022, for Ukraine’s Independence Day, there was a high security risk, with curfews in place in Kharkiv and other cities. And Routh messaged me asking to get some random person over the border and he sent me this poor woman’s passport,” they said. Aschenbrenner replied to Routh, saying they had no authority to bring people over, and highlighted the strike alert all over the country. “It’s a military. There’s a chain of command,” Aschenbrenner said they told Routh. “You need to be okay with possible delays. It’s an active war zone.” But Aschenbrenner said Routh got mad about that and replied to them in a message, which was seen by CNN: “I’ll tell the world Ukraine does not want help…it is obvious.” Aschenbrenner said they never saw Routh in Ukraine, neither in a combat zone nor in a military base.  “He seemed to have this delusion of grandeur thing, where he was the … I’ve seen this with some other volunteers on smaller scales … they’re the only one really helping Ukraine,” Aschenbrenner said. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office released bodycam video of the apprehension of Ryan Wesley Routh on Sunday on an interstate in Florida. Routh, who is suspected of planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf on Sunday, was stopped on the highway after authorities say a Secret Service agent engaged a suspect near Trump’s golf club after noticing the barrel of a rifle poking from the fence. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the agent fired at the gunman, who officials said was within 500 yards of Trump. Bradshaw said no shots were fired by the gunman, who later fled in a car. Bradshaw said a witness saw a man run from the bushes. Routh was later detained in Martin County, about an hour drive from Trump’s golf club. See video of the moment: CNN’s Evan Perez, Holmes Lybrand, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed reporting to this post. In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number on the rifle recovered from the area where Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted at Trump’s golf club was “unreadable to the naked eye.”   One of the charges Routh is facing has to do with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number — meaning that when law enforcement recovered the weapon Sunday, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump, made his initial court appearance Monday morning at a federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court sketches show Routh standing before the judge. Ryan Wesley Routh’s cell phone data indicates he may have spent nearly 12 hours on Sunday near the area where he was spotted in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club, according to charging documents unsealed on Monday. An FBI agent said in affidavit filed in court that during their initial investigation, law enforcement got phone records from T-Mobile that indicated Routh’s phone was “in the vicinity of the area” where he was first spotted by US Secret Service from around 1:59 am local time Sunday until 1:31 pm local time, when a USSS agent saw his rifle poking out from a tree line. The court document also details Routh’s past run-ins with the law, including felony convictions in North Carolina. He was convicted in 2002 for “possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction,” and he was convicted in 2010 for “multiple counts of possession of stolen goods.” Federal law prohibits individuals convicted of a felony from possessing firearms. The arrest of the Trump attempted assassination suspect Sunday was a “textbook case of a traffic stop of a known felon,” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said Monday at a news conference. At about 1:55 p.m. Sunday, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office got a BOLO – or “be on the lookout” alert – about a suspect in the case heading north on I-95, with a vehicle description and a tag number. Every available unit – about 30 in all, he estimated – went out to search. One patrol deputy saw the suspect vehicle at about Mile Marker 110 and alerted others but did not immediately try to stop the vehicle, Snyder said. Instead, the deputy waited for two large F-250 pickup trucks to get in place on the highway. Those trucks surrounded the vehicle, he continued, and forced it to a stop at about Mile Marker 112. Officers then did a “felony stop,” calling the suspect out of the vehicle. He came back and was handcuffed, the sheriff said. They turned the suspect and his vehicle over to the FBI. Snyder praised his team for following procedures designed to avoid a high-speed chase or a shootout. The sheriff also praised the witness who told authorities he had seen a suspect flee the golf course and get into a Nissan. “That witness deserves a lot of credit,” Snyder said. A criminal complaint against Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, was unsealed shortly before noon ET Monday after he made his initial court appearance where federal prosecutors charged him with gun-related charges.  An affidavit in the court file details what unfolded Sunday at Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida where a US Secret Service agent thwarted an apparent assassination attempt. Read the full criminal complaint below: Former President Donald Trump is still planning on attending his previously scheduled campaign events this week following the apparent assassination attempt, two sources familiar with the schedule tell CNN. The schedule: Trump’s virtual address on cryptocurrency on Monday evening will continue as planned. Trump is expected be in Flint, Michigan, tomorrow, Uniondale, New York, on Wednesday and Washington, DC, this week. One of the charges Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, is facing involves possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. That means when law enforcement recovered Routh’s weapon, they had trouble reading its serial number.  Law enforcement uses the serial number to trace a firearm and learn who owns it or when it was purchased. Federal agents had trouble running that search on Routh’s weapon Sunday evening because the serial number was damaged, law enforcement sources told CNN. It’s a common charge you see with drug and gang suspects. Most times people don’t manage to obliterate the serial numbers in every place it is imprinted on the gun. They can do the ones readily visible but not others in harder-to-reach places.  In court documents unsealed Monday, prosecutors said the serial number was “unreadable to the naked eye.”  So far, Routh has been charged with two firearm counts. Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach, Florida, said Ryan Routh, the suspect who was taken into custody on Sunday for the potential assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, will face federal, not state charges.  Aronberg told MSNBC that Florida initially considered pursuing state charges, but stood down when federal agents took over the case. It may be difficult to charge Routh with a crime against Trump specifically. Aronberg said the distance between Routh and Trump, between 300 to 500 yards, might be too far for the court to be certain Routh was aiming his rifle at Trump. Instead, Aronberg said it will be much easier to charge Routh with aiming at the Secret Service agent who saw the rifle barrel pointed at him. When asked about the possibility of an insanity argument, Aronberg said it would be very difficult to argue insanity in this case because Routh fled the scene, showing he was aware his actions were wrong. Aronberg told MSNBC the evidence left behind including the two bags, ceramic tiles, GoPro, AK-14 rifle and scope will be key in making the case against Routh for attempted murder. The 2024 presidential election is less than 50 days away and the campaigns and their allies are continuing to blitz battleground states with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of advertising, Pennsylvania looming largest. Since July 22, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out to September 16, the top seven battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada — have seen $688.7 million in combined presidential advertising. During that stretch, Democrats lead Republicans — including campaigns and outside groups — by about $369.3 million to $315.3 million. Here are the latest numbers by broken down by state:  Pennsylvania Michigan Georgia Wisconsin Arizona North Carolina Nevada Pennsylvania remains the premier battleground, accounting for about $185.3 million in total ad spending since Biden dropped out, and Democrats are beginning to open a meaningful edge there after weeks in which the parties have been running close. As of today, Democrats have spent about $100 million on presidential ads in Pennsylvania, compared to about $84.3 million for Republicans. Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to blame President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the apparent attempt on his life at his Florida golf club. During an interview with Fox News Digital the former president said that the suspect “believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.” Trump added, “Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out.”   The former president pointed to comments made by Biden and Harris that Trump is a threat to democracy, according to Fox News Digital, and said, “These are people that want to destroy our country.”   He said that Biden and Harris, “They are the real threat.” “They use highly inflammatory language,” Trump said. “I can use it too — far better than they can — but I don’t,” Trump said. Harris, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Biden all quickly expressed relief that a person suspected of planning to target Trump at one of his Florida golf courses was spotted before he could get off a shot and that the former president was safe. Harris said she was briefed on the incident and wrote on social media: “I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” Biden and Harris have both argued Trump presents a clear threat to US democracy. When Biden kicked off his 2024 campaign which he has since suspended, he pointed to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited and argued Trump was “willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power.” Harris has argued Trump is a “threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.” Trump frequently uses inflammatory rhetoric when attacking his political rivals, judges overseeing his criminal cases, prosecutors who have brought charges against him, undocumented immigrants, people who don’t support his campaign and others. Trump has vowed retribution if he is reelected and has repeatedly suggested he would weaponize the justice system to prosecute his political opponents. Trump also recently threatened prosecution and “long term prison sentences” for election officials and political operatives, who he suggested could cheat in the 2024 election. The investigation into Sunday’s apparent attempt on Donald Trump’s life is continuing, and additional charges could be brought against Ryan Wesley Routh, law enforcement officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. The initial gun-related charges were filed as prosecutors are seeking to keep Routh detained while authorities continue to investigate what the FBI has said appears to be an attempted assassination. Kristy Militello, the federal public defender assigned to Routh’s case, declined to comment after the hearing. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he has not yet spoken with former President Donald Trump after what appeared to be an attempted assassination on him as he played golf on Sunday, but reiterated that his state was doing its own investigation as “there is a need to make sure that the truth about all of this comes out in a way that is credible.” While taking questions, DeSantis explained his reasoning for why Florida was doing its own, separate investigation to the federal one. DeSantis said more details about the investigation would be announced in the coming days. He first announced the investigation on Sunday on X. DeSantis made the comments at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, where he appeared alongside education leaders in the state. During Monday’s hearing in federal court in Florida, Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect behind the apparent assassination attempt, answered the judge’s questions with nods and “yes judge” responses. The judge found Routh couldn’t afford his own attorney after he said he had “zero funds” in savings. He was making $3,000 a month before his arrest, Routh told the judge, but had no assets beyond two trucks in Hawaii. Prosecutor Adam McMichael said they would be asking for pre-trial detention, citing a risk of flight and danger to the community. Authorities suspect Routh, who owns a small construction company in Hawaii, was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf on Sunday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man suspected in the apparent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, has been charged with two firearm counts. The counts include possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.   A detention hearing has been set for September 23 and the arraignment is set for September 30. The White House weighed in on the now-deleted post from Elon Musk, calling the comment “irresponsible” and saying violence should be “never encouraged or joked about.” Musk deleted a post Monday morning questioning why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. Musk later claimed the post was a joke. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is holding a news conference in Orlando, Florida, a day after an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is speaking at an elementary school, addressed tertiary education across Florida and did not mention the incident involving Trump. Yesterday, the Florida governor announced on X that his state will conduct its own investigation of the incident. The apparent assassination attempt took place at Trump International Golf Club, which is located in West Palm Beach. CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed to this report. Kamala Harris’ campaign does not plan to address the weekend’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in a political manner, sources said, and any forthcoming remarks from the vice president on the developments are expected to closely mirror her statement released by the White House Sunday night. Both President Joe Biden and Harris were briefed on the incident in West Palm Beach, and both were quick to condemn all kinds of political violence and express relief that the former president was not harmed. Harris said in a statement — released in her official capacity as vice president via the White House — that she was “deeply disturbed” by the apparent assassination attempt. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said. “I am thankful that former President Trump is safe.” Harris is participating in a meeting with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, this afternoon. She is also spending part of the day preparing for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday. Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump,  is in federal court for an initial appearance Monday morning. Routh is wearing dark prison scrubs, and his feet and hands are shackled. He has been escorted to a holding area to await his appearance. Federal prosecutors have not yet announced what charges Routh will face. He was taken into custody Sunday after being stopped on the highway following the shooting incident. Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe is on the bench. Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe plans to remain in Florida “indefinitely” as the investigation into an apparent second assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump plays out, according to USSS spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.  Rowe will also meet with local law enforcement today and then do a walk through of the golf course this afternoon, Guglielmi told CNN on Monday.  He was appointed to the position on July 23, after Kimberly Cheatle resigned after Trump was shot in the ear in an attempted assassination. Trump and Rowe will meet today in Florida this afternoon, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this post. The man detained in Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was so calm when he was stopped it was “perplexing,” the sheriff of Martin County, Florida, recalled.  “His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Sheriff William Snyder told CNN on Monday morning. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.” Despite the commotion surrounding his apprehension – the area “crawling with law enforcement … SWAT team (that) had gotten out their rifles, helicopter, I-95 shut down, a bomb dog” – the man never even asked why he got pulled over, Snyder said. The traffic stop unfolded after the sheriff’s office got a BOLO – a “be on the lookout” alert – with a vehicle and tag description, Snyder said. A road patrol deputy spotted the vehicle, followed it for a couple miles and waited for big trucks with heavy bumpers to get there and force the vehicle to a stop, he said. Deputies then conducted a felony stop and safely brought the man out of the vehicle into custody, Snyder said. Ryan Wesley Routh is appearing in federal court Monday morning. Now, Snyder’s main concern is to investigate whether anyone else was involved, he said. “Are we tracking with a conspiracy?” he asked. “That’s the question that I think has to be answered.” As the investigation over the apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump continues, the 2024 presidential candidates are hitting the campaign trail this week to make their pitch to voters in the final sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting key swing states this week, while Trump is holding events in the Midwest. Here’s what the campaigns are up to: Monday: Trump will introduce a new cryptocurrency business at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will deliver remarks at the Georgia Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual dinner. Harris, meanwhile, will attend a roundtable with the Teamsters at the union’s headquarters in Washington, DC, as she seeks to win over support from organized labor. Tuesday: Harris will participate in a “fireside chat” hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. Trump will host a town hall in Flint, Michigan, while Vance will deliver remarks at events in Michigan and Wisconsin. Wednesday: Trump will host a rally in Uniondale, New York, while Vance will speak at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thursday: Trump will address the Israeli American Council’s summit in Washington, DC, as a featured speaker. Harris, meanwhile, will be in Michigan, where she will join Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed event with grassroots groups. Friday: Harris will campaign in Wisconsin. Saturday: Trump will hold a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, while Vance will join Tucker Carlson in Hershey, Pennsylvania, as part of the former Fox News host’s tour across the country. President Joe Biden wants Congress to give the US Secret Service “more help” in the wake of the second apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, he told reporters Monday.  “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said. Asked by CNN’s Kevin Liptak what kind of help they needed, Biden responded, “I think we need some more personnel.” Staffing issues have plagued the Secret Service for years. Agents and officers have described feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments, leading to high turnover. Then-director Kim Cheatle told Congress over the summer that the agency currently has 8,000 employees but that its goal was to reach 9,500. The Secret Service faced significant scrutiny following the first assassination attempt against Trump when he was struck in the ear during a rally in July. Elon Musk deleted a post Monday morning that questioned why former President Donald Trump has faced two apparent assassination attempts in recent months while President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have not encountered any. He later claimed the post was a joke. “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala 🤔,” Musk wrote in the now-deleted X post. Musk initially resisted numerous calls throughout Sunday night to delete the post. In one post responding to a demand to take down his remarks, Musk doubled down: “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” But Musk was ultimately persuaded by an X post that said Musk’s “obvious intent” may be misinterpreted. “Fair enough. I don’t want to do what they have done, even in jest,” Musk responded. He later posted several times that the deleted post had been a joke. There’s no political playbook for how to deal with another apparent assassination attempt against a major-party presidential candidate within weeks of an election. Yet that’s where the rival campaigns now find themselves after what looks like a second attempt to kill Republican nominee Donald Trump in the latest twist to a political season defying precedent and highlighting the nation’s deep polarization. Twice within two months, America has narrowly avoided the tragedy of seeing a major political figure assassinated during an election season — and the toxic forces that such an outrage could unleash in a country wracked by visceral partisan divides. That such incidents happen at all speak to the undercurrent of violence that is a constant shadow over American politics, one that is exacerbated by the easy availability of firearms. Both nominees now address outdoor crowds from behind bulletproof screens. There will now be fresh fears that a tempestuous period running up to Election Day could take the country further down a dark road. After decades without an assassination attempt against a high-level executive branch official, a haunting reality has been revived this year: that those who offer themselves for the highest office are potentially putting their lives on the line. Read more about the impact the assassination could have here. Ryan Wesley Routh, the detained man behind Donald Trump’s second apparent assassination attempt, was a small business owner in Hawaii and avid supporter of the Ukrainian war effort. CNN spoke to another Hawaiian business owner and a journalist in Ukraine, both of whom had interacted with Routh in the past. Newsweek Romania journalist Remus Cernea first met Routh in Kyiv’s Independence Square in June 2022, where the American was rallying people to join the foreign legion or to help Ukraine through various humanitarian aid organizations. According to Cernea, Routh described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as a “black and white… good versus evil” conflict. In an interview with the AFP news agency from Kyiv in April 2022, Routh said: “Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended, so we need everybody from around the globe to stop what they’re doing and come here now and support the Ukrainians to end this war.” In another instance, Hawaiian business owner Saili Levi told CNN he had paid Routh $3,800 upfront to build a trailer for his business. But when Levi came to Routh’s shop to review his work, it was shoddy, he said. Levi said when he asked Routh to improve the work via email, Routh ranted at him. “He just kind of started ranting about, you know, ‘You think because you have money, you’re better than me?’” Levi said, adding that Routh also mentioned having gone to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained Sunday in the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, was driving his daughter’s car when he was apprehended, according to a law enforcement source. Routh was detained after the Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence and agents fired at a man who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. He then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The person detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt Sunday on former President Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course did not fire any shots, the Palm Beach County sheriff said Monday morning. The man is detained at a “federal holding facility,” Bradshaw added. Asked whether he is talking, Bradshaw responded: “No.” Bradshaw also praised the quick action of the Secret Service for keeping the former president safe. “This is not like what happened in Butler,” he said, referring to the assassination attempt against Trump two months ago in Pennsylvania that sparked scrutiny of the Secret Service. A photo of the moment 58-year-old Ryan Routh was detained by police in Florida, after allegedly being caught with a rifle on a golf course where former President Donald Trump was playing has been released. The Secret Service spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence on Sunday and agents fired at Routh, who was in the bushes along the perimeter, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. It is believed he then fled in a car and was detained after being stopped on the highway. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office shared the image with CNN on Monday. Golf courses, and in particular former President Donald Trump’s own properties, have long been a source of concern among Secret Service officials tasked with securing the grounds, according to people familiar with the matter. While security around Trump was bolstered in the aftermath of the first attempt on his life over the summer, the new beefed-up protective detail wasn’t able to prevent another would-be assassin from coming within 500 yards of the former president, armed with an AK-47 with a telescopic sight on Sunday. In some ways, a similar issue led to both situations: difficulty securing a perimeter around the former president. A golf course presents a particular challenge. The fairways and greens of a golf course are often the largest outdoor area a president can visit, and their design — often abutting public roads and containing elements such as trees and hills that can conceal would-be assassins — make them particularly difficult for the agency to secure. Like other presidents before him, Trump’s presence at a golf course does not prompt the club to shut down to the general public, nor for the roads to be closed nearby. Instead, groups of agents in golf clothes typically ride in golf carts ahead and behind the former president as he plays and secures the areas before he arrives. Read the full story. Ryan Routh attended a demonstration in support of a Ukrainian National Guard brigade in Kyiv in 2022, according to images verified by CNN. But in an official statement, the 12th National Guard Azov Brigade told CNN: “He has nothing to do with our brigade.” Other Ukrainian military groupings have issued similar statements saying Routh was not involved with them despite him expressing interest in aiding Ukraine.  A representative from Ukraine’s Land Forces Command foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted it several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. The Ukrainian military’s International Legion of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, another foreign legion organization, also said Routh had “never served” and “has no relation to the unit.” Ryan Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack former President Donald Trump as he played a round of golf, was a staunch supporter of Ukraine and had visited the country. Routh’s time in Ukraine: In an April 2022 video by AFP in Kyiv, Routh called Putin a “terrorist” and said “he needs to be ended.” A representative from Ukraine’s foreign legion told CNN that Routh had contacted them several times but that he was never part of the military unit in which overseas volunteers fight. Routh also expressed support for Ukraine on social media. In dozens of posts on X in 2022, he said he was willing to die in the fight and that “we need to burn the Kremlin to the ground.”  He used Facebook to encourage foreigners to fight in the war, trying to enlist Afghan conscripts in a flurry of posts beginning in October 2023, presenting himself as an off-the-books liaison for the Ukrainian government.   The FBI said it “is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination” of Donald Trump at his Florida golf club, just two months after an attempt to kill the Republican presidential nominee at a Pennsylvania rally. The former president was not harmed. Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company in Hawaii, has been detained in connection with Sunday’s incident, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what happened: Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old owner of a small construction company, has been detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, according to three law enforcement sources. Here’s what we know about him: Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday that a Secret Service agent was able to spot a rifle barrel with a scope sticking out of a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and that the agent “engaged” with the suspect. The gunman was 300 to 500 yards away from former President Donald Trump, a Secret Service official said. The former president was one or two holes behind because the security detail moves ahead to make sure the area is cleared. The agent noticed the rifle barrel sticking out during the advance check, the official said. “The US Secret Service personnel opened fire on a gunman located near the property line and this matter is under investigation,” the Secret Service representative said. A witness saw the suspect later detained in the security incident near former President Donald Trump run from the bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s apprehension, according to the Palm Beach County sheriff. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Sunday that his office was alerted at 1:30 p.m. ET of shots fired by the US Secret Service. “We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Bradshaw said. Authorities were able to get a hit on the vehicle and alerted the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which detained the suspect. The witness was able to then identify the man Law enforcement officials found a weapon and other items left behind by the suspect where he was positioned in the bushes near the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida on Sunday. “In the bushes, where this guy was, is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope; two backpacks, which were hung on the fence and had ceramic tile in them; and a GoPro. … So, those are being processed right now,” Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said."
The one Harris comment Trump and his allies have spent $38 million for voters to see | CNN Politics,"Published 12:00 PM EDT, Sun September 15, 2024",2024-09-15T16:00:19.735Z,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/15/politics/kamala-harris-bidenomics-trump-advertisements/index.html,"On an August afternoon last year in Washington, Kamala Harris appeared at a retail village to promote the Biden administration’s economic record. “Bidenomics is working,” the vice president announced, touting the latest round of job numbers. “That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.” It was a fateful declaration, one that has dogged Harris since she took over as the Democratic standard-bearer and has attempted to seize the mantle of change candidate in the 2024 presidential race. The Trump campaign and its allies have spent more than $38 million replaying that soundbite almost 70,000 times in campaign advertisements since Harris became the Democratic nominee, looking to capitalize on persistent voter concerns about the economy and blunt Harris’ turn-the-page messaging by yoking her to President Joe Biden’s record. One of the ads, backed by more than $13 million, simply juxtaposes Harris on the campaign trail in 2024, speaking to voter concerns about rising prices, with the clip from 2023, and includes no other narration. “Everyday prices are too high – food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes,” Harris says in the clip featured in the ad. What Immediately follows is the 2023 clip of her saying, “That is called Bidenomics.” Another one of the ads, also backed by more than $13 million, contrasts news coverage of inflation with the same 2023 clip, taking the same spare approach, also with no other narration. A third ad from the Trump campaign, launched last week and already backed by more than $3 million, opens with the clip of Harris saying that “Bidenomics is working,” before a narrator cuts in with “It’s not” and references more critical news coverage of inflation. “Yet Harris still says, ‘Bidenomics working.’ No, it isn’t,” the ad ends. A fourth ad featuring the soundbite went up Friday. Throughout the campaign, Trump and his allies have taken a two-track approach to their attacks against Harris – on the one hand linking immigration and crime, and amplifying public safety concerns; while on the other, slamming the Biden-Harris economic record, with a particular focus on inflation. The spree of ads replaying Harris’ endorsement of “Bidenomics” reflects the latter approach, and that share of the pro-Trump messaging has been increasing in recent weeks as the campaign fine-tunes its advertising strategy for the final weeks of the race. The ads are aimed at leveraging the advantage that polls show voters give Trump on economic issues and magnifying persistent concerns about inflation and a potential recession – even as inflation in the actual economy has slowed and job growth has continued. Harris and her allies, meanwhile, have made a concerted effort to blunt those criticisms, also leaning into economic messaging in their campaign advertising. Last week, Harris’ campaign launched a series of ads on her economic pitch, specifically tailored to key swing states. “Lowering the cost of living will be a defining goal of my presidency. I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone. And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gouging on food. More than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut. We will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,” Harris says in the ads. In addition, her campaign has spent more than $10 million airing an ad in which Harris says, “You want lower prices and lower taxes. I believe you want to just not get by, but you want to get ahead,” before delivering her pitch for an “opportunity economy.” And another top Harris ad contrasts her approach with Trump’s. “It’s a very different vision than Donald Trump’s. His plans will raise costs and taxes on the vast majority of Americans. We need to be thinking about the future and how we make it better for families like yours,” Harris says in the ad. Democrats – including Biden and Harris – ditched the “Bidenomics” branding long ago as part of their messaging on the economy. For the vice president, her approach to the issue since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket speaks to the balancing act she has faced when it comes to embracing the administration’s record, including during her first sit-down interview as the nominee last month with CNN. “So you maintain Bidenomics is a success?” CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris during an exchange about her economic plans. “I maintain that when we do the work,” Harris responded before launching into a litany of the administration’s achievements. “I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work.” The backdrop to the back-and-forth over who is best for voters’ pocketbooks is a US economy that has continued to post solid data, even as prices are higher than four years ago and interest rates are elevated. Inflation has slowed significantly from its peak in 2022, and the US economy added 142,000 jobs in August, marking stronger growth than a worrisome lower number in July. Still, the ads from the Trump campaign also reflect the basic conundrum facing all politicians – they spend hours before the public, staking out positions and making statements, all while political operatives and ad-makers watch for a moment to capitalize. Harris, standing in southeast DC in August 2023, could not have known that exactly one year later, she would face the challenge of pitching an entirely different vision to voters."
